<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghao Huang, Zhaoxia Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced sentiment analysis capabilities. However, the trade-offs between model performance, efficiency, and explainability of some latest models remain underexplored. This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of the DeepSeek-R1 series of models, reasoning open-source LLMs, for sentiment analysis, comparing them against OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-4-mini. We systematically analyze their performance under few-shot prompting conditions, scaling up to 50-shot configurations to assess in-context learning effectiveness. Our experiments reveal that DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates competitive accuracy, particularly in multi-class sentiment tasks, while offering enhanced interpretability through its detailed reasoning process. Additionally, we highlight the impact of increasing few-shot examples on model performance and discuss key trade-offs between explainability and computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Liu, Aarav Jain, Soham Takuri, Srihan Vege, Aslihan Akalin, Kevin Zhu, Sean O'Brien, Vasu Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid improvements in large language models have unveiled a critical challenge in human-AI interaction: sycophancy. In this context, sycophancy refers to the tendency of models to excessively agree with or flatter users, often at the expense of factual accuracy. While previous studies have primarily analyzed this behavior in single-turn interactions, its persistence and evolution in multi-step conversations remain largely unexplored. We introduce TRUTH DECAY, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate sycophancy in extended dialogues, where language models must navigate iterative user feedback, challenges, and persuasion. We prompt models to elicit four types of sycophantic biases. We then propose and test sycophancy reduction strategies, evaluating their effectiveness beyond single-step interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Li, Yule Fu, Tim Knappe, Kevin Han, Kevin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks, including mathematical problem-solving that requires multi-step logical reasoning. However, challenges persist in automating the identification of key mathematical concepts, understanding their interrelations, and formalizing proofs within a rigorous framework. We present a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment LLMs to construct and formalize mathematical proofs. Our results demonstrate significant performance improvements across multiple datasets, with using knowledge graphs, achieving up to a 34% success rate on the MUSTARDSAUCE dataset on o1-mini and consistently outperforming baseline approaches by 2-11% across different models. We show how this approach bridges the gap between natural language understanding and formal logic proof systems and achieve elevated results for foundation models over baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces LogitLens4LLMs, a toolkit that extends the Logit Lens technique to modern large language models. While Logit Lens has been a crucial method for understanding internal representations of language models, it was previously limited to earlier model architectures. Our work overcomes the limitations of existing implementations, enabling the technique to be applied to state-of-the-art architectures (such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3.1) while automating key analytical workflows. By developing component-specific hooks to capture both attention mechanisms and MLP outputs, our implementation achieves full compatibility with the HuggingFace transformer library while maintaining low inference overhead. The toolkit provides both interactive exploration and batch processing capabilities, supporting large-scale layer-wise analyses. Through open-sourcing our implementation, we aim to facilitate deeper investigations into the internal mechanisms of large-scale language models. The toolkit is openly available at https://github.com/zhenyu-02/LogitLens4LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaofeng Wu, Michihiro Yasunaga, Andrew Cohen, Yoon Kim, Asli Celikyilmaz, Marjan Ghazvininejad</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward models have become a staple in modern NLP, serving as not only a scalable text evaluator, but also an indispensable component in many alignment recipes and inference-time algorithms. However, while recent reward models increase performance on standard benchmarks, this may partly be due to overfitting effects, which would confound an understanding of their true capability. In this work, we scrutinize the robustness of reward models and the extent of such overfitting. We build **reWordBench**, which systematically transforms reward model inputs in meaning- or ranking-preserving ways. We show that state-of-the-art reward models suffer from substantial performance degradation even with minor input transformations, sometimes dropping to significantly below-random accuracy, suggesting brittleness. To improve reward model robustness, we propose to explicitly train them to assign similar scores to paraphrases, and find that this approach also improves robustness to other distinct kinds of transformations. For example, our robust reward model reduces such degradation by roughly half for the Chat Hard subset in RewardBench. Furthermore, when used in alignment, our robust reward models demonstrate better utility and lead to higher-quality outputs, winning in up to 59% of instances against a standardly trained RM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating text, images, and video content. However, as context length grows, the computational cost of attention increases quadratically with the number of tokens, presenting significant efficiency challenges. This paper presents an analysis of various Key-Value (KV) cache compression strategies, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes these methods by their underlying principles and implementation techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate their impact on performance and inference latency, providing critical insights into their effectiveness. Our findings highlight the trade-offs involved in KV cache compression and its influence on handling long-context scenarios, paving the way for more efficient LLM implementations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kezia Oketch, John P. Lalor, Yi Yang, Ahmed Abbasi</p>
<p>Abstract: Closed large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have set state-of-the-art results across a number of NLP tasks and have become central to NLP and machine learning (ML)-driven solutions. Closed LLMs' performance and wide adoption has sparked considerable debate about their accessibility in terms of availability, cost, and transparency. In this study, we perform a rigorous comparative analysis of nine leading LLMs, spanning closed, open, and open-source LLM ecosystems, across text assessment and generation tasks related to automated essay scoring. Our findings reveal that for few-shot learning-based assessment of human generated essays, open LLMs such as Llama 3 and Qwen2.5 perform comparably to GPT-4 in terms of predictive performance, with no significant differences in disparate impact scores when considering age- or race-related fairness. Moreover, Llama 3 offers a substantial cost advantage, being up to 37 times more cost-efficient than GPT-4. For generative tasks, we find that essays generated by top open LLMs are comparable to closed LLMs in terms of their semantic composition/embeddings and ML assessed scores. Our findings challenge the dominance of closed LLMs and highlight the democratizing potential of open LLMs, suggesting they can effectively bridge accessibility divides while maintaining competitive performance and fairness.</p>

This is the challenge that Automated Feedback Generation attempts to address. In this paper, a technique to train such a system on a very small dataset with very long sequences is presented. Both of these attributes make this a very challenging task, however, by using a three stage transfer learning pipeline state-of-the-art results can be achieved with qualitatively accurate but unhuman sounding results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ximing Wen, Rezvaneh Rezapour</p>
<p>Abstract: Sarcasm detection, with its figurative nature, poses unique challenges for affective systems designed to perform sentiment analysis. While these systems typically perform well at identifying direct expressions of emotion, they struggle with sarcasm's inherent contradiction between literal and intended sentiment. Since transformer-based language models (LMs) are known for their efficient ability to capture contextual meanings, we propose a method that leverages LMs and prototype-based networks, enhanced by sentiment embeddings to conduct interpretable sarcasm detection. Our approach is intrinsically interpretable without extra post-hoc interpretability techniques. We test our model on three public benchmark datasets and show that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art. At the same time, the prototypical layer enhances the model's inherent interpretability by generating explanations through similar examples in the reference time. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of incongruity loss in the ablation study, which we construct using sentiment prototypes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan Kart\'a\v{c}, Mateusz Lango, Ond\v{r}ej Du\v{s}ek</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential as evaluators of NLG systems, allowing for high-quality, reference-free, and multi-aspect assessments. However, existing LLM-based metrics suffer from two major drawbacks: reliance on proprietary models to generate training data or perform evaluations, and a lack of fine-grained, explanatory feedback. In this paper, we introduce OpeNLGauge, a fully open-source, reference-free NLG evaluation metric that provides accurate explanations based on error spans. OpeNLGauge is available as a two-stage ensemble of larger open-weight LLMs, or as a small fine-tuned evaluation model, with confirmed generalizability to unseen tasks, domains and aspects. Our extensive meta-evaluation shows that OpeNLGauge achieves competitive correlation with human judgments, outperforming state-of-the-art models on certain tasks while maintaining full reproducibility and providing explanations more than twice as accurate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shadab Choudhury, Asha Kumar, Lara J. Martin</p>
<p>Abstract: In controlled text generation using large language models (LLMs), gaps arise between the language model's interpretation and human expectations. We look at the problem of controlling emotions in keyword-based sentence generation for both GPT-4 and LLaMA-3. We selected four emotion representations: Words, Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) dimensions expressed in both Lexical and Numeric forms, and Emojis. Our human evaluation looked at the Human-LLM alignment for each representation, as well as the accuracy and realism of the generated sentences. While representations like VAD break emotions into easy-to-compute components, our findings show that people agree more with how LLMs generate when conditioned on English words (e.g., "angry") rather than VAD scales. This difference is especially visible when comparing Numeric VAD to words. However, we found that converting the originally-numeric VAD scales to Lexical scales (e.g., +4.0 becomes "High") dramatically improved agreement. Furthermore, the perception of how much a generated sentence conveys an emotion is highly dependent on the LLM, representation type, and which emotion it is.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhiman Kumar Baghel, Scott M. Jordan, Zheyuan Ryan Shi, Xiang Lorraine Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are used in various downstream language tasks, making it crucial to keep their knowledge up-to-date, but both retraining and fine-tuning the model can be costly. Model editing offers an efficient and effective alternative by a single update to only a key subset of model parameters. While being efficient, these methods are not perfect. Sometimes knowledge edits are unsuccessful, i.e., UnderEdit, or the edit contaminated neighboring knowledge that should remain unchanged, i.e., OverEdit. To address these limitations, we propose iterative model editing, based on our hypothesis that a single parameter update is often insufficient, to mitigate UnderEdit, and neighbor-assisted model editing, which incorporates neighboring knowledge during editing to minimize OverEdit. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods effectively reduce UnderEdit up to 38 percentage points and OverEdit up to 6 percentage points across multiple model editing algorithms, LLMs, and benchmark datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11898">LLMs for Translation: Historical, Low-Resourced Languages and Contemporary AI Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Merve Tekgurler</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable adaptability in performing various tasks, including machine translation (MT), without explicit training. Models such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini are frequently evaluated on translation benchmarks and utilized as translation tools due to their high performance. This paper examines Gemini's performance in translating an 18th-century Ottoman Turkish manuscript, Prisoner of the Infidels: The Memoirs of Osman Agha of Timisoara, into English. The manuscript recounts the experiences of Osman Agha, an Ottoman subject who spent 11 years as a prisoner of war in Austria, and includes his accounts of warfare and violence. Our analysis reveals that Gemini's safety mechanisms flagged between 14 and 23 percent of the manuscript as harmful, resulting in untranslated passages. These safety settings, while effective in mitigating potential harm, hinder the model's ability to provide complete and accurate translations of historical texts. Through real historical examples, this study highlights the inherent challenges and limitations of current LLM safety implementations in the handling of sensitive and context-rich materials. These real-world instances underscore potential failures of LLMs in contemporary translation scenarios, where accurate and comprehensive translations are crucial-for example, translating the accounts of modern victims of war for legal proceedings or humanitarian documentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naome A. Etori, Kevin Lu, Randu Karisa, Arturs Kanepajs</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, evaluating their performance is critical. LLMs are trained on multilingual data, but their reasoning abilities are mainly evaluated using English datasets. Hence, robust evaluation frameworks are needed using high-quality non-English datasets, especially low-resource languages (LRLs). This study evaluates eight state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on Latvian and Giriama using a Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) subset curated with native speakers for linguistic and cultural relevance. Giriama is benchmarked for the first time. Our evaluation shows that OpenAI's o1 model outperforms others across all languages, scoring 92.8\% in English, 88.8\% in Latvian, and 70.8\% in Giriama on 0-shot tasks. Mistral-large (35.6\%) and Llama-70B IT (41\%) have weak performance, on both Latvian and Giriama. Our results underscore the need for localized benchmarks and human evaluations in advancing cultural AI contextualization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Su, Krishna Sayana, Hubert Pham, James Pine, Yuri Vasilevski, Raghavendra Vasudeva, Marialena Kyriakidi, Liam Hebert, Ambarish Jash, Anushya Subbiah, Sukhdeep Sodhi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dataset REGEN (Reviews Enhanced with GEnerative Narratives), designed to benchmark the conversational capabilities of recommender Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing the limitations of existing datasets that primarily focus on sequential item prediction. REGEN extends the Amazon Product Reviews dataset by inpainting two key natural language features: (1) user critiques, representing user "steering" queries that lead to the selection of a subsequent item, and (2) narratives, rich textual outputs associated with each recommended item taking into account prior context. The narratives include product endorsements, purchase explanations, and summaries of user preferences.
  Further, we establish an end-to-end modeling benchmark for the task of conversational recommendation, where models are trained to generate both recommendations and corresponding narratives conditioned on user history (items and critiques). For this joint task, we introduce a modeling framework LUMEN (LLM-based Unified Multi-task Model with Critiques, Recommendations, and Narratives) which uses an LLM as a backbone for critiquing, retrieval and generation. We also evaluate the dataset's quality using standard auto-rating techniques and benchmark it by training both traditional and LLM-based recommender models. Our results demonstrate that incorporating critiques enhances recommendation quality by enabling the recommender to learn language understanding and integrate it with recommendation signals. Furthermore, LLMs trained on our dataset effectively generate both recommendations and contextual narratives, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art recommenders and language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thivya Thogesan, Anupiya Nugaliyadde, Kok Wai Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpretability remains a key difficulty in sentiment analysis with Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in high-stakes applications where it is crucial to comprehend the rationale behind forecasts. This research addressed this by introducing a technique that applies SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) by breaking down LLMs into components such as embedding layer,encoder,decoder and attention layer to provide a layer-by-layer knowledge of sentiment prediction. The approach offers a clearer overview of how model interpret and categorise sentiment by breaking down LLMs into these parts. The method is evaluated using the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) dataset, which shows how different sentences affect different layers. The effectiveness of layer-wise SHAP analysis in clarifying sentiment-specific token attributions is demonstrated by experimental evaluations, which provide a notable enhancement over current whole-model explainability techniques. These results highlight how the suggested approach could improve the reliability and transparency of LLM-based sentiment analysis in crucial applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Badr Souani, Ezekiel Soremekun, Mike Papadakis, Setsuko Yokoyama, Sudipta Chattopadhyay, Yves Le Traon</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) may portray discrimination towards certain individuals, especially those characterized by multiple attributes (aka intersectional bias). Discovering intersectional bias in LLMs is challenging, as it involves complex inputs on multiple attributes (e.g. race and gender). To address this challenge, we propose HInter, a test technique that synergistically combines mutation analysis, dependency parsing and metamorphic oracles to automatically detect intersectional bias in LLMs. HInter generates test inputs by systematically mutating sentences using multiple mutations, validates inputs via a dependency invariant and detects biases by checking the LLM response on the original and mutated sentences. We evaluate HInter using six LLM architectures and 18 LLM models (GPT3.5, Llama2, BERT, etc) and find that 14.61% of the inputs generated by HInter expose intersectional bias. Results also show that our dependency invariant reduces false positives (incorrect test inputs) by an order of magnitude. Finally, we observed that 16.62% of intersectional bias errors are hidden, meaning that their corresponding atomic cases do not trigger biases. Overall, this work emphasize the importance of testing LLMs for intersectional bias.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased the performance of different natural language understanding as well as generation tasks. Although LLMs have breached the state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, they often reflect different forms of bias present in the training data. In the light of this perceived limitation, we provide a unified evaluation of benchmarks using a set of representative LLMs that cover different forms of biases starting from physical characteristics to socio-economic categories. Moreover, we propose five prompting approaches to carry out the bias detection task across different aspects of bias. Further, we formulate three research questions to gain valuable insight in detecting biases in LLMs using different approaches and evaluation metrics across benchmarks. The results indicate that each of the selected LLMs suffer from one or the other form of bias with the LLaMA3.1-8B model being the least biased. Finally, we conclude the paper with the identification of key challenges and possible future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dharani Chandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing through their state of art reasoning capabilities. This paper explores the convergence of LLM reasoning techniques and feature generation for machine learning tasks. We examine four key reasoning approaches: Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Thought Space Exploration. Our analysis reveals how these approaches can be used to identify effective feature generation rules without having to manually specify search spaces. The paper categorizes LLM-based feature generation methods across various domains including finance, healthcare, and text analytics. LLMs can extract key information from clinical notes and radiology reports in healthcare, by enabling more efficient data utilization. In finance, LLMs facilitate text generation, summarization, and entity extraction from complex documents. We analyze evaluation methodologies for assessing feature quality and downstream performance, with particular attention to OCTree's decision tree reasoning approach that provides language-based feedback for iterative improvements. Current challenges include hallucination, computational efficiency, and domain adaptation. As of March 2025, emerging approaches include inference-time compute scaling, reinforcement learning, and supervised fine-tuning with model distillation. Future directions point toward multimodal feature generation, self-improving systems, and neuro-symbolic approaches. This paper provides a detailed overview of an emerging field that promises to automate and enhance feature engineering through language model reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made tremendous progress in recent years, but low-resource languages, such as Tibetan, remain significantly underrepresented in their evaluation. Despite Tibetan being spoken by over seven million people, it has largely been neglected in the development and assessment of LLMs. To address this gap, we present TLUE (A Tibetan Language Understanding Evaluation Benchmark), the first large-scale benchmark for assessing LLMs' capabilities in Tibetan. TLUE comprises two major components: (1) a comprehensive multi-task understanding benchmark spanning 5 domains and 67 subdomains, and (2) a safety benchmark covering 7 subdomains. We evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that most LLMs perform below the random baseline, highlighting the considerable challenges LLMs face in processing Tibetan, a low-resource language. TLUE provides an essential foundation for driving future research and progress in Tibetan language understanding and underscores the need for greater inclusivity in LLM development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhilasha Ravichander, Jillian Fisher, Taylor Sorensen, Ximing Lu, Yuchen Lin, Maria Antoniak, Niloofar Mireshghallah, Chandra Bhagavatula, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality training data has proven crucial for developing performant large language models (LLMs). However, commercial LLM providers disclose few, if any, details about the data used for training. This lack of transparency creates multiple challenges: it limits external oversight and inspection of LLMs for issues such as copyright infringement, it undermines the agency of data authors, and it hinders scientific research on critical issues such as data contamination and data selection. How can we recover what training data is known to LLMs? In this work, we demonstrate a new method to identify training data known to proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 without requiring any access to model weights or token probabilities, by using information-guided probes. Our work builds on a key observation: text passages with high surprisal are good search material for memorization probes. By evaluating a model's ability to successfully reconstruct high-surprisal tokens in text, we can identify a surprising number of texts memorized by LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'e Schamschurko, Nenad Petrovic, Alois Christian Knoll</p>
<p>Abstract: The latest research on Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated significant advancement in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, despite this progress, there is still a lack of reliability in these models. This is due to the stochastic architecture of LLMs, which presents a challenge for users attempting to ascertain the reliability of a model's response. These responses may cause serious harm in high-risk environments or expensive failures in industrial contexts. Therefore, we introduce the framework REpeated Clustering of Scores Improving the Precision (RECSIP) which focuses on improving the precision of LLMs by asking multiple models in parallel, scoring and clustering their responses to ensure a higher reliability on the response. The evaluation of our reference implementation recsip on the benchmark MMLU-Pro using the models GPT-4o, Claude and Gemini shows an overall increase of 5.8 per cent points compared to the best used model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaopeng Feng, Jiahan Ren, Jiayuan Su, Jiamei Zheng, Zhihang Tang, Hongwei Wang, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have shown success in complex reasoning tasks for large language models (LLMs). However, their application to machine translation (MT) remains underexplored due to the lack of systematic methodologies and evaluation benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{MT-RewardTree}, a comprehensive framework for constructing, evaluating, and deploying process reward models in MT. Unlike traditional vanilla preference pair construction, we propose a novel method for automatically generating token-level preference pairs using approximate Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which mitigates the prohibitive cost of human annotation for fine-grained steps. Then, we establish the first MT-specific reward model benchmark and provide a systematic comparison of different reward modeling architectures, revealing that token-level supervision effectively captures fine-grained preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that our MT-PRM-Qwen-2.5-3B achieves state-of-the-art performance in both token-level and sequence-level evaluation given the same input prefix. Furthermore, we showcase practical applications where PRMs enable test-time alignment for LLMs without additional alignment training and significantly improve performance in hypothesis ensembling. Our work provides valuable insights into the role of reward models in MT research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shayan Rokhva, Babak Teimourpour, Romina Babaei</p>
<p>Abstract: This research presents an advanced sentiment analysis framework studied on Iranian restaurant reviews, combining fuzzy logic with conventional sentiment analysis techniques to assess both sentiment polarity and intensity. A dataset of 1266 reviews, alongside corresponding star ratings, was compiled and preprocessed for analysis. Initial sentiment analysis was conducted using the Sentiment Intensity Analyzer (VADER), a rule-based tool that assigns sentiment scores across positive, negative, and neutral categories. However, a noticeable bias toward neutrality often led to an inaccurate representation of sentiment intensity. To mitigate this issue, based on a fuzzy perspective, two refinement techniques were introduced, applying square-root and fourth-root transformations to amplify positive and negative sentiment scores while maintaining neutrality. This led to three distinct methodologies: Approach 1, utilizing unaltered VADER scores; Approach 2, modifying sentiment values using the square root; and Approach 3, applying the fourth root for further refinement. A Fuzzy Inference System incorporating comprehensive fuzzy rules was then developed to process these refined scores and generate a single, continuous sentiment value for each review based on each approach. Comparative analysis, including human supervision and alignment with customer star ratings, revealed that the refined approaches significantly improved sentiment analysis by reducing neutrality bias and better capturing sentiment intensity. Despite these advancements, minor over-amplification and persistent neutrality in domain-specific cases were identified, leading us to propose several future studies to tackle these occasional barriers. The study's methodology and outcomes offer valuable insights for businesses seeking a more precise understanding of consumer sentiment, enhancing sentiment analysis across various industries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Chen, Xuyang Liu, Subin Huang, Linfeng Zhang, Hang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrating increasingly human-like abilities, a pivotal question emerges: do different LVLMs interpret multimodal sarcasm differently, and can a single model grasp sarcasm from multiple perspectives like humans? To explore this, we introduce an analytical framework using systematically designed prompts on existing multimodal sarcasm datasets. Evaluating 12 state-of-the-art LVLMs over 2,409 samples, we examine interpretive variations within and across models, focusing on confidence levels, alignment with dataset labels, and recognition of ambiguous "neutral" cases. Our findings reveal notable discrepancies -- across LVLMs and within the same model under varied prompts. While classification-oriented prompts yield higher internal consistency, models diverge markedly when tasked with interpretive reasoning. These results challenge binary labeling paradigms by highlighting sarcasm's subjectivity. We advocate moving beyond rigid annotation schemes toward multi-perspective, uncertainty-aware modeling, offering deeper insights into multimodal sarcasm comprehension.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Liu, Xinglin Lyu, Junhui Li, Daimeng Wei, Min Zhang, Shimin Tao, Hao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies in prompting large language model (LLM) for document-level machine translation (DMT) primarily focus on the inter-sentence context by flatting the source document into a long sequence. This approach relies solely on the sequence of sentences within the document. However, the complexity of document-level sequences is greater than that of shorter sentence-level sequences, which may limit LLM's ability in DMT when only this single-source knowledge is used. In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach by incorporating multiple sources of knowledge, including both the document summarization and entity translation, to enhance the performance of LLM-based DMT. Given a source document, we first obtain its summarization and translation of entities via LLM as the additional knowledge. We then utilize LLMs to generate two translations of the source document by fusing these two single knowledge sources, respectively. Finally, recognizing that different sources of knowledge may aid or hinder the translation of different sentences, we refine and rank the translations by leveraging a multi-knowledge fusion strategy to ensure the best results. Experimental results in eight document-level translation tasks show that our approach achieves an average improvement of 0.8, 0.6, and 0.4 COMET scores over the baseline without extra knowledge for LLaMA3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct, and GPT-4o-mini, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Deng, Luoyang Sun, Jiwen Jiang, Yongcheng Zeng, Xinjian Wu, Wenxin Zhao, Qingfa Xiao, Jiachuan Wang, Lei Chen, Lionel M. Ni, Haifeng Zhang, Jun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: While scaling laws have been continuously validated in large language models (LLMs) with increasing model parameters, the inherent tension between the inference demands of LLMs and the limited resources of edge devices poses a critical challenge to the development of edge intelligence. Recently, numerous small language models have emerged, aiming to distill the capabilities of LLMs into smaller footprints. However, these models often retain the fundamental architectural principles of their larger counterparts, still imposing considerable strain on the storage and bandwidth capacities of edge devices. In this paper, we introduce the PLM, a Peripheral Language Model, developed through a co-design process that jointly optimizes model architecture and edge system constraints. The PLM utilizes a Multi-head Latent Attention mechanism and employs the squared ReLU activation function to encourage sparsity, thereby reducing peak memory footprint during inference. During training, we collect and reorganize open-source datasets, implement a multi-phase training strategy, and empirically investigate the Warmup-Stable-Decay-Constant (WSDC) learning rate scheduler. Additionally, we incorporate Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) by adopting the ARIES preference learning approach. Following a two-phase SFT process, this method yields performance gains of 2% in general tasks, 9% in the GSM8K task, and 11% in coding tasks. In addition to its novel architecture, evaluation results demonstrate that PLM outperforms existing small language models trained on publicly available data while maintaining the lowest number of activated parameters. Furthermore, deployment across various edge devices, including consumer-grade GPUs, mobile phones, and Raspberry Pis, validates PLM's suitability for peripheral applications. The PLM series models are publicly available at https://github.com/plm-team/PLM.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12286">Integrating Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval Augmented Generation Enhances Rare Disease Diagnosis from Clinical Notes</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Da Wu, Zhanliang Wang, Quan Nguyen, Kai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Several studies show that large language models (LLMs) struggle with phenotype-driven gene prioritization for rare diseases. These studies typically use Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms to prompt foundation models like GPT and LLaMA to predict candidate genes. However, in real-world settings, foundation models are not optimized for domain-specific tasks like clinical diagnosis, yet inputs are unstructured clinical notes rather than standardized terms. How LLMs can be instructed to predict candidate genes or disease diagnosis from unstructured clinical notes remains a major challenge. Methods: We introduce RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG, two methods that combine Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze clinical notes. A five-question CoT protocol mimics expert reasoning, while RAG retrieves data from sources like HPO and OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man). We evaluated these approaches on rare disease datasets, including 5,980 Phenopacket-derived notes, 255 literature-based narratives, and 220 in-house clinical notes from Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. Results: We found that recent foundations models, including Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, outperformed earlier versions such as Llama 2 and GPT-3.5. We also showed that RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG both outperform foundation models in candidate gene prioritization from clinical notes; in particular, both methods with DeepSeek backbone resulted in a top-10 gene accuracy of over 40% on Phenopacket-derived clinical notes. RAG-driven CoT works better for high-quality notes, where early retrieval can anchor the subsequent reasoning steps in domain-specific evidence, while CoT-driven RAG has advantage when processing lengthy and noisy notes.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present both the Lucie Training Dataset and the Lucie-7B foundation model. The Lucie Training Dataset is a multilingual collection of textual corpora centered around French and designed to offset anglo-centric biases found in many datasets for large language model pretraining. Its French data is pulled not only from traditional web sources, but also from French cultural heritage documents, filling an important gap in modern datasets. Beyond French, which makes up the largest share of the data, we added documents to support several other European languages, including English, Spanish, German, and Italian. Apart from its value as a resource for French language and culture, an important feature of this dataset is that it prioritizes data rights by minimizing copyrighted material. In addition, building on the philosophy of past open projects, it is redistributed in the form used for training and its processing is described on Hugging Face and GitHub. The Lucie-7B foundation model is trained on equal amounts of data in French and English -- roughly 33% each -- in an effort to better represent cultural aspects of French-speaking communities. We also describe two instruction fine-tuned models, Lucie-7B-Instruct-v1.1 and Lucie-7B-Instruct-human-data, which we release as demonstrations of Lucie-7B in use. These models achieve promising results compared to state-of-the-art models, demonstrating that an open approach prioritizing data rights can still deliver strong performance. We see these models as an initial step toward developing more performant, aligned models in the near future. Model weights for Lucie-7B and the Lucie instruct models, along with intermediate checkpoints for the former, are published on Hugging Face, while model training and data preparation code is available on GitHub. This makes Lucie-7B one of the first OSI compliant language models according to the new OSI definition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Wang, Samiul Alam, Zhongwei Wan, Hui Shen, Mi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements, the practical deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is often hampered by their immense sizes, highlighting the need for effective compression techniques. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising LLM compression technique. However, existing SVD-based compression methods fall short in reducing truncation losses, leading to less competitive performance in compressed models. In this work, we introduce SVD-LLM V2, a SVD-based LLM compression method that optimizes singular value truncation in SVD compression with two techniques. First, SVD-LLM V2 proposes to use theoretical truncation loss of weight matrices to assign a unique compression ratio to each weight matrix at different layers to accommodate weight redundancy heterogeneity. Second, SVD-LLM V2 proposes loss-optimized weight truncation to ensure that the truncated singular values result in a lower and more stable truncation loss in practice. We evaluate SVD-LLM V2 on ten datasets and five LLMs at various scales. Our results show SVD-LLM V2 outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods.

<p>Abstract: Advanced table question answering (TableQA) methods prompt large language models (LLMs) to generate answer text, SQL query, Python code, or custom operations, which impressively improve the complex reasoning problems in the TableQA task. However, these methods lack the versatility to cope with specific question types or table structures. In contrast, the Spreadsheet Formula, the widely-used and well-defined operation language for tabular data, has not been thoroughly explored to solve TableQA. In this paper, we first attempt to use Formula as the logical form for solving complex reasoning on the tables with different structures. Specifically, we construct a large Formula-annotated TableQA dataset \texttt{FromulaQA} from existing datasets. In addition, we propose \texttt{TabAF}, a general table answering framework to solve multiple types of tasks over multiple types of tables simultaneously. Unlike existing methods, \texttt{TabAF} decodes answers and Formulas with a single LLM backbone, demonstrating great versatility and generalization. \texttt{TabAF} based on Llama3.1-70B achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the WikiTableQuestion, HiTab and TabFact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Tan, Zheng Xu, Eric Xing, Zhiting Hu, Shanshan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic data offers a promising path to train models while preserving data privacy. Differentially private (DP) finetuning of large language models (LLMs) as data generator is effective, but is impractical when computation resources are limited. Meanwhile, prompt-based methods such as private evolution, depend heavily on the manual prompts, and ineffectively use private information in their iterative data selection process. To overcome these limitations, we propose CTCL (Data Synthesis with ConTrollability and CLustering), a novel framework for generating privacy-preserving synthetic data without extensive prompt engineering or billion-scale LLM finetuning. CTCL pretrains a lightweight 140M conditional generator and a clustering-based topic model on large-scale public data. To further adapt to the private domain, the generator is DP finetuned on private data for fine-grained textual information, while the topic model extracts a DP histogram representing distributional information. The DP generator then samples according to the DP histogram to synthesize a desired number of data examples. Evaluation across five diverse domains demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in the strong privacy regime. Systematic ablation validates the design of each framework component and highlights the scalability of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krishna Chaitanya Polavaram</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a fascinating linguistic property related to the number of letters in words and their corresponding numerical values. By selecting any arbitrary word, counting its constituent letters, and subsequently spelling out the resulting count and tallying the letters anew, an unanticipated pattern is observed. Remarkably, this iterative sequence, conducted on a dataset of 100,000 random words, invariably converges to the numeral four (4), termed the Linguistic Loop (LL) constant. Examining 73 languages utilizing the Latin alphabet, this research reveals distinctive patterns. Among them, 28 languages exhibit LL-positive behavior adhering to the established property, while 31 languages deviate as LL-negative. Additionally, 13 languages display nuanced tendencies: eight feature two LL constants (bi-positivity), and five feature three constants (tri-positivity). This discovery highlights a linguistic quirk within Latin alphabet-based language number-word representations, uncovering an intriguing facet across diverse alphabetic systems. It also raises questions about the underlying linguistic and cognitive mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Abstract: While it is commonly accepted that maintaining common ground plays a role in conversational success, little prior research exists connecting conversational grounding to success in task-oriented conversations. We study failures of grounding in the Ubuntu IRC dataset, where participants use text-only communication to resolve technical issues. We find that disruptions in conversational flow often stem from a misalignment in common ground, driven by a divergence in beliefs and assumptions held by participants. These disruptions, which we call conversational friction, significantly correlate with task success. We find that although LLMs can identify overt cases of conversational friction, they struggle with subtler and more context-dependent instances requiring pragmatic or domain-specific reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability of language models to comprehend and interact in diverse linguistic and cultural landscapes is crucial. The Cantonese language used in Hong Kong presents unique challenges for natural language processing due to its rich cultural nuances and lack of dedicated evaluation datasets. The HKCanto-Eval benchmark addresses this gap by evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) on Cantonese language understanding tasks, extending to English and Written Chinese for cross-lingual evaluation. HKCanto-Eval integrates cultural and linguistic nuances intrinsic to Hong Kong, providing a robust framework for assessing language models in realistic scenarios. Additionally, the benchmark includes questions designed to tap into the underlying linguistic metaknowledge of the models. Our findings indicate that while proprietary models generally outperform open-weight models, significant limitations remain in handling Cantonese-specific linguistic and cultural knowledge, highlighting the need for more targeted training data and evaluation methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziran Qin, Yuchen Cao, Mingbao Lin, Wen Hu, Shixuan Fan, Ke Cheng, Weiyao Lin, Jianguo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing long sequences, boosting demand for key-value (KV) caching. While recent efforts to evict KV cache have alleviated the inference burden, they often fail to allocate resources rationally across layers with different attention patterns. In this paper, we introduce Cascading and Adaptive KV cache Eviction (CAKE), a novel approach that frames KV cache eviction as a "cake-slicing problem." CAKE assesses layer-specific preferences by considering attention dynamics in both spatial and temporal dimensions, allocates rational cache size for layers accordingly, and manages memory constraints in a cascading manner. This approach enables a global view of cache allocation, adaptively distributing resources across diverse attention mechanisms while maintaining memory budgets. CAKE also employs a new eviction indicator that considers the shifting importance of tokens over time, addressing limitations in existing methods that overlook temporal dynamics. Comprehensive experiments on LongBench and NeedleBench show that CAKE maintains model performance with only 3.2% of the KV cache and consistently outperforms current baselines across various models and memory constraints, particularly in low-memory settings. Additionally, CAKE achieves over 10x speedup in decoding latency compared to full cache when processing contexts of 128K tokens with FlashAttention-2.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyle Moore, Jesse Roberts, Daryl Watson, Pamela Wisniewski</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has sought to quantify large language model uncertainty to facilitate model control and modulate user trust. Previous works focus on measures of uncertainty that are theoretically grounded or reflect the average overt behavior of the model. In this work, we investigate a variety of uncertainty measures, in order to identify measures that correlate with human group-level uncertainty. We find that Bayesian measures and a variation on entropy measures, top-k entropy, tend to agree with human behavior as a function of model size. We find that some strong measures decrease in human-similarity with model size, but, by multiple linear regression, we find that combining multiple uncertainty measures provide comparable human-alignment with reduced size-dependency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hunter Sawyer, Jesse Roberts, Kyle Moore</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of psychology has long recognized a basic level of categorization that humans use when labeling visual stimuli, a term coined by Rosch in 1976. This level of categorization has been found to be used most frequently, to have higher information density, and to aid in visual language tasks with priming in humans. Here, we investigate basic level categorization in two recently released, open-source vision-language models (VLMs). This paper demonstrates that Llama 3.2 Vision Instruct (11B) and Molmo 7B-D both prefer basic level categorization consistent with human behavior. Moreover, the models' preferences are consistent with nuanced human behaviors like the biological versus non-biological basic level effects and the well established expert basic level shift, further suggesting that VLMs acquire cognitive categorization behaviors from the human data on which they are trained.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarvesh Baskar, Tanmay Tulsidas Verelakar, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, Manas Gaur</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-turn dialogues, large language models (LLM) face a critical challenge of ensuring coherence while adapting to user-specific information. This study introduces the persona knowledge gap, the discrepancy between a model's internal understanding and the knowledge required for coherent, personalized conversations. While prior research has recognized these gaps, computational methods for their identification and resolution remain underexplored. We propose Conversation Preference Elicitation and Recommendation (CPER), a novel framework that dynamically detects and resolves persona knowledge gaps using intrinsic uncertainty quantification and feedback-driven refinement. CPER consists of three key modules: a Contextual Understanding Module for preference extraction, a Dynamic Feedback Module for measuring uncertainty and refining persona alignment, and a Persona-Driven Response Generation module for adapting responses based on accumulated user context. We evaluate CPER on two real-world datasets: CCPE-M for preferential movie recommendations and ESConv for mental health support. Using A/B testing, human evaluators preferred CPER's responses 42% more often than baseline models in CCPE-M and 27% more often in ESConv. A qualitative human evaluation confirms that CPER's responses are preferred for maintaining contextual relevance and coherence, particularly in longer (12+ turn) conversations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Zheng, Hao Fei, Ting Dai, Zuquan Peng, Fei Li, Huisheng Ma, Chong Teng, Donghong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: With the continuous emergence of various social media platforms frequently used in daily life, the multimodal meme understanding (MMU) task has been garnering increasing attention. MMU aims to explore and comprehend the meanings of memes from various perspectives by performing tasks such as metaphor recognition, sentiment analysis, intention detection, and offensiveness detection. Despite making progress, limitations persist due to the loss of fine-grained metaphorical visual clue and the neglect of multimodal text-image weak correlation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a multi-granular multimodal clue fusion model (MGMCF) to advance MMU. Firstly, we design an object-level semantic mining module to extract object-level image feature clues, achieving fine-grained feature clue extraction and enhancing the model's ability to capture metaphorical details and semantics. Secondly, we propose a brand-new global-local cross-modal interaction model to address the weak correlation between text and images. This model facilitates effective interaction between global multimodal contextual clues and local unimodal feature clues, strengthening their representations through a bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism. Finally, we devise a dual-semantic guided training strategy to enhance the model's understanding and alignment of multimodal representations in the semantic space. Experiments conducted on the widely-used MET-MEME bilingual dataset demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, there is an 8.14% increase in precision for offensiveness detection task, and respective accuracy enhancements of 3.53%, 3.89%, and 3.52% for metaphor recognition, sentiment analysis, and intention detection tasks. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing MMU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei He, Zhaopeng Tu, Xing Wang, Xingyu Chen, Zhijie Wang, Jiahao Xu, Tian Liang, Wenxiang Jiao, Zhuosheng Zhang, Rui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been prominently employed for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). However, the limited expressive capacity of LoRA, stemming from the low-rank constraint, has been recognized as a bottleneck, particularly in rigorous tasks like code generation and mathematical reasoning. To address this limitation, we introduce Rank-Sharing Low-Rank Adaptation (RaSA), an innovative extension that enhances the expressive capacity of LoRA by leveraging partial rank sharing across layers. By forming a shared rank pool and applying layer-specific weighting, RaSA effectively increases the number of ranks without augmenting parameter overhead. Our theoretically grounded and empirically validated approach demonstrates that RaSA not only maintains the core advantages of LoRA but also significantly boosts performance in challenging code and math tasks.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents UniBERT, a compact multilingual language model that leverages an innovative training framework integrating three components: masked language modeling, adversarial training, and knowledge distillation. Pre-trained on a meticulously curated Wikipedia corpus spanning 107 languages, UniBERT is designed to reduce the computational demands of large-scale models while maintaining competitive performance across various natural language processing tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on four tasks -- named entity recognition, natural language inference, question answering, and semantic textual similarity -- demonstrate that our multilingual training strategy enhanced by an adversarial objective significantly improves cross-lingual generalization. Specifically, UniBERT models show an average relative improvement of 7.72% over traditional baselines, which achieved an average relative improvement of only 1.17%, with statistical analysis confirming the significance of these gains (p-value = 0.0181). This work highlights the benefits of combining adversarial training and knowledge distillation to build scalable and robust language models, thereby advancing the field of multilingual and cross-lingual natural language processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Zong, Bingkang Shi, Hongzhu Yi, Jungang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised sentence embedding representation has become a hot research topic in natural language processing. As a tensor, sentence embedding has two critical properties: direction and norm. Existing works have been limited to constraining only the orientation of the samples' representations while ignoring the features of their module lengths. To address this issue, we propose a new training objective that optimizes the training of unsupervised contrastive learning by constraining the module length features between positive samples. We combine the training objective of Tensor's Norm Constraints with ensemble learning to propose a new Sentence Embedding representation framework, TNCSE. We evaluate seven semantic text similarity tasks, and the results show that TNCSE and derived models are the current state-of-the-art approach; in addition, we conduct extensive zero-shot evaluations, and the results show that TNCSE outperforms other baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent research highlights the challenges retrieval models face in retrieving useful contexts and the limitations of generation models in effectively utilizing those contexts in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) settings. To address these challenges, we introduce RAG-RL, the first reasoning language model (RLM) specifically trained for RAG. RAG-RL demonstrates that stronger answer generation models can identify relevant contexts within larger sets of retrieved information -- thereby alleviating the burden on retrievers -- while also being able to utilize those contexts more effectively. Moreover, we show that curriculum design in the reinforcement learning (RL) post-training process is a powerful approach to enhancing model performance. We benchmark our method on two open-domain question-answering datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous SOTA generative reader models. In addition, we offers empirical insights into various curriculum learning strategies, providing a deeper understanding of their impact on model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Li, Debo Cheng, Yasuhiko Morimoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis seeks to determine sentiment with a high level of detail. While graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are commonly used for extracting sentiment features, their straightforward use in syntactic feature extraction can lead to a loss of crucial information. This paper presents a novel edge-enhanced GCN, called EEGCN, which improves performance by preserving feature integrity as it processes syntactic graphs. We incorporate a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network alongside a self-attention-based transformer for effective text encoding, ensuring the retention of long-range dependencies. A bidirectional GCN (Bi-GCN) with message passing then captures the relationships between entities, while an aspect-specific masking technique removes extraneous information. Extensive evaluations and ablation studies on four benchmark datasets show that EEGCN significantly enhances aspect-based sentiment analysis, overcoming issues with syntactic feature extraction and advancing the field's methodologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work develops a probabilistic child language acquisition model to learn a range of linguistic phenonmena, most notably long-range syntactic dependencies of the sort found in object wh-questions, among other constructions. The model is trained on a corpus of real child-directed speech, where each utterance is paired with a logical form as a meaning representation. It then learns both word meanings and language-specific syntax simultaneously. After training, the model can deduce the correct parse tree and word meanings for a given utterance-meaning pair, and can infer the meaning if given only the utterance. The successful modelling of long-range dependencies is theoretically important because it exploits aspects of the model that are, in general, trans-context-free.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in post-training methodologies for large language models (LLMs) have highlighted reinforcement learning (RL) as a critical component for enhancing reasoning. However, the substantial computational costs associated with RL-based approaches have led to growing interest in alternative paradigms, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of DPO in facilitating self-improvement for LLMs through iterative preference-based learning. We demonstrate that a single round of DPO with coarse filtering significantly enhances mathematical reasoning performance, particularly for strong base model. Furthermore, we design an iterative enhancement framework for both the generator and the reward model (RM), enabling their mutual improvement through online interaction across multiple rounds of DPO. Finally, with simple verifiable rewards, our model DPO-VP achieves RL-level performance with significantly lower computational overhead. These findings highlight DPO as a scalable and cost-effective alternative to RL, offering a practical solution for enhancing LLM reasoning in resource-constrained situations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duke Nguyen, Aditya Joshi, Flora Salim</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) is an excellent method which helps generalize models across domains, tasks, and distributions without the use of labeled datasets. Thus, TTA is very useful in natural language processing (NLP) in the dialectal setting, since oftentimes, models are trained on Standard American English (SAE), evaluated on Indian English or Nigerian English, of which distribution differs significantly from the former. This is especially useful since dialectal datasets are scarce. In this paper, we explore one of the most famous TTA techniques, SHOT, in dialectal NLP. We finetune and evaluate SHOT on different combinations of dialectal GLUE. Our findings show that SHOT is a viable technique when labeled datasets are unavailable. We also theoretically propose the concept of dialectal gap and show that it has a positive correlation with the effectiveness of SHOT. We also find that in many cases, finetuning on SAE yields higher performance than finetuning on dialectal data. Our code is available at https://github.com/dukenguyenxyz/dialect-adaptation</p>

<p>Abstract: Natural Language to Visualization (NL2VIS) enables users to create visualizations from natural language queries, making data insights more accessible. However, NL2VIS faces challenges in interpreting ambiguous queries, as users often express their visualization needs in imprecise language. To address this challenge, we introduce nvBench 2.0, a new benchmark designed to evaluate NL2VIS systems in scenarios involving ambiguous queries. nvBench 2.0 includes 7,878 natural language queries and 24,076 corresponding visualizations, derived from 780 tables across 153 domains. It is built using a controlled ambiguity-injection pipeline that generates ambiguous queries through a reverse-generation workflow. By starting with unambiguous seed visualizations and selectively injecting ambiguities, the pipeline yields multiple valid interpretations for each query, with each ambiguous query traceable to its corresponding visualization through step-wise reasoning paths. We evaluate various Large Language Models (LLMs) on their ability to perform ambiguous NL2VIS tasks using nvBench 2.0. We also propose Step-NL2VIS, an LLM-based model trained on nvBench 2.0, which enhances performance in ambiguous scenarios through step-wise preference optimization. Our results show that Step-NL2VIS outperforms all baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art for ambiguous NL2VIS tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: There have been attempts to utilize linear probe for detoxification, with existing studies relying on a single toxicity probe vector to reduce toxicity. However, toxicity can be fine-grained into various subcategories, making it difficult to remove certain types of toxicity by using a single toxicity probe vector. To address this limitation, we propose a category-specific toxicity probe vector approach. First, we train multiple toxicity probe vectors for different toxicity categories. During generation, we dynamically select the most relevant toxicity probe vector based on the current context. Finally, the selected vector is dynamically scaled and subtracted from model. Our method successfully mitigated toxicity from categories that the single probe vector approach failed to detoxify. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 78.52% reduction in toxicity on the evaluation dataset, while fluency remains nearly unchanged, with only a 0.052% drop compared to the unsteered model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyan Jiang, Hang Ye, Yongxin Zhu, Xiaoying Zheng, Zikang Chen, Jun Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations, producing outputs that are contextually inaccurate or factually incorrect. We introduce HICD, a novel method designed to induce hallucinations for contrastive decoding to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing contrastive decoding methods, HICD selects attention heads crucial to the model's prediction as inducing heads, then induces hallucinations by dispersing attention of these inducing heads and compares the hallucinated outputs with the original outputs to obtain the final result. Our approach significantly improves performance on tasks requiring contextual faithfulness, such as context completion, reading comprehension, and question answering. It also improves factuality in tasks requiring accurate knowledge recall. We demonstrate that our inducing heads selection and attention dispersion method leads to more "contrast-effective" hallucinations for contrastive decoding, outperforming other hallucination-inducing methods. Our findings provide a promising strategy for reducing hallucinations by inducing hallucinations in a controlled manner, enhancing the performance of LLMs in a wide range of tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated enhanced performance through the \textit{Thinking then Responding} paradigm, where models generate internal thoughts before final responses (aka, System 2 thinking). However, existing research lacks a systematic understanding of the mechanisms underlying how thinking patterns affect performance across model sizes. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the impact of various thinking types on model performance and introduce ThinkPatterns-21k, a curated dataset comprising 21k instruction-response pairs (QA) collected from existing instruction-following datasets with five thinking types. For each pair, we augment it with five distinct internal thinking patterns: one unstructured thinking (monologue) and four structured variants (decomposition, self-ask, self-debate and self-critic), while maintaining the same instruction and response. Through extensive evaluation across different model sizes (3B-32B parameters), we have two key findings: (1) smaller models (<30B parameters) can benefit from most of structured thinking patterns, while larger models (32B) with structured thinking like decomposition would degrade performance and (2) unstructured monologue demonstrates broad effectiveness across different model sizes. Finally, we released all of our datasets, checkpoints, training logs of diverse thinking patterns to reproducibility, aiming to facilitate further research in this direction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning is widely used to improve a pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) by training it on curated task-specific datasets, enabling better comprehension of human instructions. However, it is infeasible to collect all possible instruction datasets simultaneously in real-world scenarios. Thus, enabling MLLM with continual instruction tuning is essential for maintaining their adaptability. However, existing methods often trade off memory efficiency for performance gains, significantly compromising overall efficiency. In this paper, we propose a task-specific expansion and task-general fusion framework based on the variations in Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity across different model layers when trained on diverse datasets. Furthermore, we analyze the information leakage present in the existing benchmark and propose a new and more challenging benchmark to rationally evaluate the performance of different methods. Comprehensive experiments showcase a significant performance improvement of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be public available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Palakorn Achananuparp, Ee-Peng Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatically annotating job data with standardized occupations from taxonomies, known as occupation classification, is crucial for labor market analysis. However, this task is often hindered by data scarcity and the challenges of manual annotations. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise due to their extensive world knowledge and in-context learning capabilities, their effectiveness depends on their knowledge of occupational taxonomies, which remains unclear. In this study, we assess the ability of LLMs to generate precise taxonomic entities from taxonomy, highlighting their limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-stage framework consisting of inference, retrieval, and reranking stages, which integrates taxonomy-guided reasoning examples to enhance performance by aligning outputs with taxonomic knowledge. Evaluations on a large-scale dataset show significant improvements in classification accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's adaptability for multi-label skill classification. Our results indicate that the framework outperforms existing LLM-based methods, offering a practical and scalable solution for occupation classification and related tasks across LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omri Suissa, Muhiim Ali, Ariana Azarbal, Hui Shen, Shekhar Pradhan</p>
<p>Abstract: CLIP has demonstrated exceptional image-text matching capabilities due to its training on contrastive learning tasks. Past research has suggested that whereas CLIP effectively matches text to images when the matching can be achieved just by matching the text with the objects in the image, CLIP struggles when the matching depends on representing the relationship among the objects in the images (i.e., inferring relations). Previous attempts to address this limitation by training CLIP on relation detection datasets with only linguistic supervision have met with limited success. In this paper, we offer insights and practical methods to advance the field of relation inference from images. This paper approaches the task of creating a model that effectively detects relations among the objects in images by producing text and image embeddings that capture relationships through linguistic supervision. To this end, we propose Dynamic Relation Inference via Verb Embeddings (DRIVE), which augments the COCO dataset, fine-tunes CLIP with hard negatives subject-relation-object triples and corresponding images, and introduces a novel loss function to improve relation detection. Evaluated on multiple CLIP-based models, our method significantly improves zero-shot relation inference accuracy in both frozen and fine-tuned settings, significantly outperforming CLIP and state-of-the-art models while generalizing well on unseen data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakob Sponholz, Andreas Weilinghoff, Juliane Schopf</p>
<p>Abstract: In qualitative research, data transcription is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. To expedite this process, a workflow utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) was developed. This workflow not only enhances transcription speed but also addresses the issue of AI-generated transcripts often lacking compatibility with standard content analysis software. Within this workflow, automatic speech recognition is employed to create initial transcripts from audio recordings, which are then formatted to be compatible with content analysis software such as ATLAS.ti or MAXQDA. Empirical data from a study of 12 interviews suggests that this workflow can reduce transcription time by up to 46.2%. Furthermore, by using widely used standard software, this process is suitable for both students and researchers while also being adaptable to a variety of learning, teaching, and research environments. It is also particularly beneficial for non-native speakers. In addition, the workflow is GDPR-compliant and facilitates local, offline transcript generation, which is crucial when dealing with sensitive data.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we provide an overview of the NTCIR-18 Automatic Evaluation of LLMs (AEOLLM) task. As large language models (LLMs) grow popular in both academia and industry, how to effectively evaluate the capacity of LLMs becomes an increasingly critical but still challenging issue. Existing methods can be divided into two types: manual evaluation, which is expensive, and automatic evaluation, which faces many limitations including task format (the majority belong to multiple-choice questions) and evaluation criteria (occupied by reference-based metrics). To advance the innovation of automatic evaluation, we propose the AEOLLM task which focuses on generative tasks and encourages reference-free methods. Besides, we set up diverse subtasks such as dialogue generation, text expansion, summary generation and non-factoid question answering to comprehensively test different methods. This year, we received 48 runs from 4 teams in total. This paper will describe the background of the task, the data set, the evaluation measures and the evaluation results, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Likai Tang, Niruth Bogahawatta, Yasod Ginige, Jiarui Xu, Shixuan Sun, Surangika Ranathunga, Suranga Seneviratne</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are acquiring a wider range of capabilities, including understanding and responding in multiple languages. While they undergo safety training to prevent them from answering illegal questions, imbalances in training data and human evaluation resources can make these models more susceptible to attacks in low-resource languages (LRL). This paper proposes a framework to automatically assess the multilingual vulnerabilities of commonly used LLMs. Using our framework, we evaluated six LLMs across eight languages representing varying levels of resource availability. We validated the assessments generated by our automated framework through human evaluation in two languages, demonstrating that the framework's results align with human judgments in most cases. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities in LRL; however, these may pose minimal risk as they often stem from the model's poor performance, resulting in incoherent responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baohao Liao, Christian Herold, Seyyed Hadi Hashemi, Stefan Vasilev, Shahram Khadivi, Christof Monz</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, model compression is crucial for edge deployment and accessibility. Weight-only quantization reduces model size but suffers from performance degradation at lower bit widths. Moreover, standard finetuning is incompatible with quantized models, and alternative methods often fall short of full finetuning. In this paper, we propose ClusComp, a simple yet effective compression paradigm that clusters weight matrices into codebooks and finetunes them block-by-block. ClusComp (1) achieves superior performance in 2-4 bit quantization, (2) pushes compression to 1-bit while outperforming ultra-low-bit methods with minimal finetuning, and (3) enables efficient finetuning, even surpassing existing quantization-based approaches and rivaling full FP16 finetuning. Notably, ClusComp supports compression and finetuning of 70B LLMs on a single A6000-48GB GPU.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has allowed them to be proficient in various tasks, including content generation. However, their unregulated usage can lead to malicious activities such as plagiarism and generating and spreading fake news, especially for low-resource languages. Most existing machine-generated text detectors are trained on high-resource languages like English, French, etc. In this study, we developed the first large-scale detector that can distinguish between human- and machine-generated content in Hausa. We scrapped seven Hausa-language media outlets for the human-generated text and the Gemini-2.0 flash model to automatically generate the corresponding Hausa-language articles based on the human-generated article headlines. We fine-tuned four pre-trained Afri-centric models (AfriTeVa, AfriBERTa, AfroXLMR, and AfroXLMR-76L) on the resulting dataset and assessed their performance using accuracy and F1-score metrics. AfroXLMR achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of 99.23% and an F1 score of 99.21%, demonstrating its effectiveness for Hausa text detection. Our dataset is made publicly available to enable further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Pugachev, Alena Fenogenova, Vladislav Mikhailov, Ekaterina Artemova</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced the novel paradigm of using LLMs as judges, where an LLM evaluates and scores the outputs of another LLM, which often correlates highly with human preferences. However, the use of LLM-as-a-judge has been primarily studied in English. In this paper, we evaluate this framework in Russian by introducing the Russian Error tyPes Annotation dataset (REPA), a dataset of 1k user queries and 2k LLM-generated responses. Human annotators labeled each response pair expressing their preferences across ten specific error types, as well as selecting an overall preference. We rank six generative LLMs across the error types using three rating systems based on human preferences. We also evaluate responses using eight LLM judges in zero-shot and few-shot settings. We describe the results of analyzing the judges and position and length biases. Our findings reveal a notable gap between LLM judge performance in Russian and English. However, rankings based on human and LLM preferences show partial alignment, suggesting that while current LLM judges struggle with fine-grained evaluation in Russian, there is potential for improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kedi Chen, Zhikai Lei, Fan Zhang, Yinqi Zhang, Qin Chen, Jie Zhou, Liang He, Qipeng Guo, Kai Chen, Wei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models make remarkable progress in reasoning capabilities. Existing works focus mainly on deductive reasoning tasks (e.g., code and math), while another type of reasoning mode that better aligns with human learning, inductive reasoning, is not well studied. We attribute the reason to the fact that obtaining high-quality process supervision data is challenging for inductive reasoning. Towards this end, we novelly employ number sequences as the source of inductive reasoning data. We package sequences into algorithmic problems to find the general term of each sequence through a code solution. In this way, we can verify whether the code solution holds for any term in the current sequence, and inject case-based supervision signals by using code unit tests. We build a sequence synthetic data pipeline and form a training dataset CodeSeq. Experimental results show that the models tuned with CodeSeq improve on both code and comprehensive reasoning benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sinan Fan, Liang Xie, Chen Shen, Ge Teng, Xiaosong Yuan, Xiaofeng Zhang, Chenxi Huang, Wenxiao Wang, Xiaofei He, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt-tuning (PT) for large language models (LLMs) can facilitate the performance on various conventional NLP tasks with significantly fewer trainable parameters. However, our investigation reveals that PT provides limited improvement and may even degrade the primitive performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks. Such a phenomenon suggests that soft prompts can positively impact certain instances while negatively affecting others, particularly during the later phases of reasoning. To address these challenges, We first identify an information accumulation within the soft prompts. Through detailed analysis, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is often accompanied by erroneous information flow patterns in the deeper layers of the model, which ultimately lead to incorrect reasoning outcomes. we propose a novel method called \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{C}orruption (DPC) to take better advantage of soft prompts in complex reasoning tasks, which dynamically adjusts the influence of soft prompts based on their impact on the reasoning process. Specifically, DPC consists of two stages: Dynamic Trigger and Dynamic Corruption. First, Dynamic Trigger measures the impact of soft prompts, identifying whether beneficial or detrimental. Then, Dynamic Corruption mitigates the negative effects of soft prompts by selectively masking key tokens that interfere with the reasoning process. We validate the proposed approach through extensive experiments on various LLMs and reasoning tasks, including GSM8K, MATH, and AQuA. Experimental results demonstrate that DPC can consistently enhance the performance of PT, achieving 4\%-8\% accuracy gains compared to vanilla prompt tuning, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach and its potential to enhance complex reasoning in LLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13222">Can Language Models Follow Multiple Turns of Entangled Instructions?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant achievements in improving the instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the ability to process multiple potentially entangled or conflicting instructions remains a considerable challenge. Real-world scenarios often require consistency across multiple instructions over time, such as secret privacy, personal preferences, and prioritization, which demand sophisticated abilities to integrate multiple turns and carefully balance competing objectives when instructions intersect or conflict. This work presents a systematic investigation of LLMs' capabilities in handling multiple turns of instructions, covering three levels of difficulty: (1) retrieving information from instructions, (2) tracking and reasoning across turns, and (3) resolving conflicts among instructions. We construct MultiTurnInstruct with around 1.1K high-quality multi-turn conversations through the human-in-the-loop approach and result in nine capability categories, including statics and dynamics, reasoning, and multitasking. Our finding reveals an intriguing trade-off between different capabilities. While GPT models demonstrate superior memorization, they show reduced effectiveness in privacy-protection tasks requiring selective information withholding. Larger models exhibit stronger reasoning capabilities but still struggle with resolving conflicting instructions. Importantly, these performance gaps cannot be attributed solely to information loss, as models demonstrate strong BLEU scores on memorization tasks but their attention mechanisms fail to integrate multiple related instructions effectively. These findings highlight critical areas for improvement in complex real-world tasks involving multi-turn instructions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tabular data analysis is crucial in many scenarios, yet efficiently identifying the most relevant data analysis queries and results for a new table remains a significant challenge. The complexity of tabular data, diverse analytical operations, and the demand for high-quality analysis make the process tedious. To address these challenges, we aim to recommend query-code-result triplets tailored for new tables in tabular data analysis workflows. In this paper, we present TablePilot, a pioneering tabular data analysis framework leveraging large language models to autonomously generate comprehensive and superior analytical results without relying on user profiles or prior interactions. The framework incorporates key designs in analysis preparation and analysis optimization to enhance accuracy. Additionally, we propose Rec-Align, a novel method to further improve recommendation quality and better align with human preferences. Experiments on DART, a dataset specifically designed for comprehensive tabular data analysis recommendation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Based on GPT-4o, the tuned TablePilot achieves 77.0% top-5 recommendation recall. Human evaluations further highlight its effectiveness in optimizing tabular data analysis workflows.</p>

<p>Abstract: Patient matching is the process of linking patients to appropriate clinical trials by accurately identifying and matching their medical records with trial eligibility criteria. We propose LLM-Match, a novel framework for patient matching leveraging fine-tuned open-source large language models. Our approach consists of four key components. First, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module extracts relevant patient context from a vast pool of electronic health records (EHRs). Second, a prompt generation module constructs input prompts by integrating trial eligibility criteria (both inclusion and exclusion criteria), patient context, and system instructions. Third, a fine-tuning module with a classification head optimizes the model parameters using structured prompts and ground-truth labels. Fourth, an evaluation module assesses the fine-tuned model's performance on the testing datasets. We evaluated LLM-Match on four open datasets, n2c2, SIGIR, TREC 2021, and TREC 2022, using open-source models, comparing it against TrialGPT, Zero-Shot, and GPT-4-based closed models. LLM-Match outperformed all baselines.</p>

However, when it comes to long context scenarios, the performance of LLMs degrades due to some challenges. To alleviate this phenomenon, there is a number of work proposed recently. In this survey, we first list the challenges of applying pre-trained LLMs to process long contexts. Then systematically review the approaches related to long context and propose our taxonomy categorizing them into four main types: positional encoding, context compression, retrieval augmented, and attention pattern. In addition to the approaches, we focus on the evaluation of long context, organizing relevant data, tasks, and metrics based on existing long context benchmarks. Finally, we summarize unresolved issues in the long context domain and put forward our views on future developments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi Han, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Most written natural languages are composed of sequences of words and sentences. Similar to humans, large language models (LLMs) exhibit flexibility in handling textual positions - a phenomenon we term position generalization. They can understand texts with position perturbations and generalize to longer texts than those encountered during training with the latest techniques. These phenomena suggest that LLMs handle positions tolerantly, but how LLMs computationally process positional relevance remains largely unexplored. This work connects the linguistic phenomenon with LLMs' computational mechanisms. We show how LLMs enforce certain computational mechanisms for the aforementioned tolerance in position perturbations. Despite the complex design of the self-attention mechanism, this work reveals that LLMs learn a counterintuitive disentanglement of attention logits. Their values show a 0.959 linear correlation with an approximation of the arithmetic sum of positional relevance and semantic importance. Furthermore, we identify a prevalent pattern in intermediate features, which we prove theoretically enables this effect. The pattern, which is different from how randomly initialized parameters would behave, suggests that it is a learned behavior rather than a natural result of the model architecture. Based on these findings, we provide computational explanations and criteria for LLMs' position flexibilities. This work takes a pioneering step in linking position generalization with modern LLMs' internal mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sang Truong, Yuheng Tu, Percy Liang, Bo Li, Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: Comprehensive evaluations of language models (LM) during both development and deployment phases are necessary because these models possess numerous capabilities (e.g., mathematical reasoning, legal support, or medical diagnostic) as well as safety risks (e.g., racial bias, toxicity, or misinformation). The average score across a wide range of benchmarks provides a signal that helps guide the use of these LMs in practice. Currently, holistic evaluations are costly due to the large volume of benchmark questions, making frequent evaluations impractical. A popular attempt to lower the cost is to compute the average score on a subset of the benchmark. This approach, unfortunately, often renders an unreliable measure of LM performance because the average score is often confounded with the difficulty of the questions in the benchmark subset. Item response theory (IRT) was designed to address this challenge, providing a reliable measurement by careful controlling for question difficulty. Unfortunately, question difficulty is expensive to estimate. Facing this challenge, we train a model that predicts question difficulty from its content, enabling a reliable measurement at a fraction of the cost. In addition, we leverage this difficulty predictor to further improve the evaluation efficiency through training a question generator given a difficulty level. This question generator is essential in adaptive testing, where, instead of using a random subset of the benchmark questions, informative questions are adaptively chosen based on the current estimation of LLM performance. Experiments on 22 common natural language benchmarks and 172 LMs show that this approach is more reliable and efficient compared to current common practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models have been used to translate natural language questions to SQL queries. Without hard constraints on syntax and database schema, they occasionally produce invalid queries that are not executable. These failures limit the usage of these systems in real-life scenarios. We propose a neurosymbolic framework that imposes SQL syntax and schema constraints with unification-based definite clause grammars and thus guarantees the generation of valid queries. Our framework also builds a bi-directional interface to language models to leverage their natural language understanding abilities. The evaluation results on a subset of SQL grammars show that all our output queries are valid. This work is the first step towards extending language models with unification-based grammars. We demonstrate this extension enhances the validity, execution accuracy, and ground truth alignment of the underlying language model by a large margin.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Waldis, Vagrant Gautam, Anne Lauscher, Dietrich Klakow, Iryna Gurevych</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce aligned probing, a novel interpretability framework that aligns the behavior of language models (LMs), based on their outputs, and their internal representations (internals). Using this framework, we examine over 20 OLMo, Llama, and Mistral models, bridging behavioral and internal perspectives for toxicity for the first time. Our results show that LMs strongly encode information about the toxicity level of inputs and subsequent outputs, particularly in lower layers. Focusing on how unique LMs differ offers both correlative and causal evidence that they generate less toxic output when strongly encoding information about the input toxicity. We also highlight the heterogeneity of toxicity, as model behavior and internals vary across unique attributes such as Threat. Finally, four case studies analyzing detoxification, multi-prompt evaluations, model quantization, and pre-training dynamics underline the practical impact of aligned probing with further concrete insights. Our findings contribute to a more holistic understanding of LMs, both within and beyond the context of toxicity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks, largely driven by well-designed prompts. However, crafting and selecting such prompts often requires considerable human effort, significantly limiting its scalability. To mitigate this, recent studies have explored automated prompt optimization as a promising solution. Despite these efforts, existing methods still face critical challenges in robustness, efficiency, and generalization. To systematically address these challenges, we first conduct an empirical analysis to identify the limitations of current reflection-based prompt optimization paradigm. Building on these insights, we propose 7 innovative approaches inspired by traditional deep learning paradigms for prompt optimization (DLPO), seamlessly integrating these concepts into text-based gradient optimization. Through these advancements, we progressively tackle the aforementioned challenges and validate our methods through extensive experimentation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alisa Liu, Jonathan Hayase, Valentin Hofmann, Sewoong Oh, Noah A. Smith, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: The assumption across nearly all language model (LM) tokenization schemes is that tokens should be subwords, i.e., contained within word boundaries. While providing a seemingly reasonable inductive bias, is this common practice limiting the potential of modern LMs? Whitespace is not a reliable delimiter of meaning, as evidenced by multi-word expressions (e.g., "by the way"), crosslingual variation in the number of words needed to express a concept (e.g., "spacesuit helmet" in German is "raumanzughelm"), and languages that do not use whitespace at all (e.g., Chinese). To explore the potential of tokenization beyond subwords, we introduce a "superword" tokenizer, SuperBPE, which incorporates a simple pretokenization curriculum into the byte-pair encoding (BPE) algorithm to first learn subwords, then superwords that bridge whitespace. This brings dramatic improvements in encoding efficiency: when fixing the vocabulary size to 200k, SuperBPE encodes a fixed piece of text with up to 33% fewer tokens than BPE on average. In experiments, we pretrain 8B transformer LMs from scratch while fixing the model size, vocabulary size, and train compute, varying *only* the algorithm for learning the vocabulary. Our model trained with SuperBPE achieves an average +4.0% absolute improvement over the BPE baseline across 30 downstream tasks (including +8.2% on MMLU), while simultaneously requiring 27% less compute at inference time. In analysis, we find that SuperBPE results in segmentations of text that are more uniform in per-token difficulty. Qualitatively, this may be because SuperBPE tokens often capture common multi-word expressions that function semantically as a single unit. SuperBPE is a straightforward, local modification to tokenization that improves both encoding efficiency and downstream performance, yielding better language models overall.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noah Y. Siegel, Nicolas Heess, Maria Perez-Ortiz, Oana-Maria Camburu</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable, ensuring that their self-generated explanations are faithful to their internal decision-making process is critical for safety and oversight. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive counterfactual faithfulness analysis across 62 models from 8 families, encompassing both pretrained and instruction-tuned variants and significantly extending prior studies of counterfactual tests. We introduce phi-CCT, a simplified variant of the Correlational Counterfactual Test, which avoids the need for token probabilities while explaining most of the variance of the original test. Our findings reveal clear scaling trends: larger models are consistently more faithful on our metrics. However, when comparing instruction-tuned and human-imitated explanations, we find that observed differences in faithfulness can often be attributed to explanation verbosity, leading to shifts along the true-positive/false-positive Pareto frontier. While instruction-tuning and prompting can influence this trade-off, we find limited evidence that they fundamentally expand the frontier of explanatory faithfulness beyond what is achievable with pretrained models of comparable size. Our analysis highlights the nuanced relationship between instruction-tuning, verbosity, and the faithful representation of model decision processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qin Liu, Wenxuan Zhou, Nan Xu, James Y. Huang, Fei Wang, Sheng Zhang, Hoifung Poon, Muhao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: One critical challenge for large language models (LLMs) for making complex reasoning is their reliance on matching reasoning patterns from training data, instead of proactively selecting the most appropriate cognitive strategy to solve a given task. Existing approaches impose fixed cognitive structures that enhance performance in specific tasks but lack adaptability across diverse scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce METASCALE, a test-time scaling framework based on meta-thoughts -- adaptive thinking strategies tailored to each task. METASCALE initializes a pool of candidate meta-thoughts, then iteratively selects and evaluates them using a multi-armed bandit algorithm with upper confidence bound selection, guided by a reward model. To further enhance adaptability, a genetic algorithm evolves high-reward meta-thoughts, refining and extending the strategy pool over time. By dynamically proposing and optimizing meta-thoughts at inference time, METASCALE improves both accuracy and generalization across a wide range of tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaScale consistently outperforms standard inference approaches, achieving an 11% performance gain in win rate on Arena-Hard for GPT-4o, surpassing o1-mini by 0.9% under style control. Notably, METASCALE scales more effectively with increasing sampling budgets and produces more structured, expert-level responses.</p>

<p>Abstract: In chip design planning, obtaining reliable performance and power forecasts for various design options is of critical importance. Traditionally, this involves using system-level models, which often lack accuracy, or trial synthesis, which is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. We introduce a new methodology, called Lorecast, which accepts English prompts as input to rapidly generate layout-aware performance and power estimates. This approach bypasses the need for HDL code development or synthesis, making it both fast and user-friendly. Experimental results demonstrate that Lorecast achieves accuracy within a few percent of error compared to post-layout analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating insightful and actionable information from databases is critical in data analysis. This paper introduces a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate textual insights. Given a multi-table database as input, our method leverages LLMs to produce concise, text-based insights that reflect interesting patterns in the tables. Our framework includes a Hypothesis Generator to formulate domain-relevant questions, a Query Agent to answer such questions by generating SQL queries against a database, and a Summarization module to verbalize the insights. The insights are evaluated for both correctness and subjective insightfulness using a hybrid model of human judgment and automated metrics. Experimental results on public and enterprise databases demonstrate that our approach generates more insightful insights than other approaches while maintaining correctness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Indoor navigation presents unique challenges due to complex layouts, lack of GPS signals, and accessibility concerns. Existing solutions often struggle with real-time adaptability and user-specific needs. In this work, we explore the potential of a Large Language Model (LLM), i.e., ChatGPT, to generate natural, context-aware navigation instructions from indoor map images. We design and evaluate test cases across different real-world environments, analyzing the effectiveness of LLMs in interpreting spatial layouts, handling user constraints, and planning efficient routes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for supporting personalized indoor navigation, with an average of 52% correct indications and a maximum of 62%. The results do not appear to depend on the complexity of the layout or the complexity of the expected path, but rather on the number of points of interest and the abundance of visual information, which negatively affect the performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bangzheng Li, Fei Wang, Wenxuan Zhou, Nan Xu, Ben Zhou, Sheng Zhang, Hoifung Poon, Muhao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage aligned visual encoders to transform images into visual tokens, allowing them to be processed similarly to text by the backbone large language model (LLM). This unified input paradigm enables VLMs to excel in vision-language tasks such as visual question answering (VQA). To improve fine-grained visual reasoning, recent advancements in vision-language modeling introduce image cropping techniques that feed all encoded sub-images into the model. However, this approach significantly increases the number of visual tokens, leading to inefficiency and potential distractions for the LLM. To address the generalization challenges of image representation in VLMs, we propose a lightweight, universal framework that seamlessly integrates with existing VLMs to enhance their ability to process finegrained details. Our method leverages textual semantics to identify key visual areas, improving VQA performance without requiring any retraining of the VLM. Additionally, it incorporates textual signals into the visual encoding process, enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness. The proposed method, SEMCLIP, strengthens the visual understanding of a 7B VLM, LLaVA-1.5 by 3.3% on average across 7 benchmarks, and particularly by 5.3% on the challenging detailed understanding benchmark V*.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobia Poppi, Tejaswi Kasarla, Pascal Mettes, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara</p>
<p>Abstract: Addressing the retrieval of unsafe content from vision-language models such as CLIP is an important step towards real-world integration. Current efforts have relied on unlearning techniques that try to erase the model's knowledge of unsafe concepts. While effective in reducing unwanted outputs, unlearning limits the model's capacity to discern between safe and unsafe content. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that shifts from unlearning to an awareness paradigm by leveraging the inherent hierarchical properties of the hyperbolic space. We propose to encode safe and unsafe content as an entailment hierarchy, where both are placed in different regions of hyperbolic space. Our HySAC, Hyperbolic Safety-Aware CLIP, employs entailment loss functions to model the hierarchical and asymmetrical relations between safe and unsafe image-text pairs. This modelling, ineffective in standard vision-language models due to their reliance on Euclidean embeddings, endows the model with awareness of unsafe content, enabling it to serve as both a multimodal unsafe classifier and a flexible content retriever, with the option to dynamically redirect unsafe queries toward safer alternatives or retain the original output. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only enhances safety recognition but also establishes a more adaptable and interpretable framework for content moderation in vision-language models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirabbas Afzali, Amirhossein Afsharrad, Seyed Shahabeddin Mousavi, Sanjay Lall</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in generating human-like responses, largely due to preference alignment techniques. However, these methods often assume unbiased human feedback, which is rarely the case in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces Content-Aware Noise-Resilient Preference Optimization (CNRPO), a novel framework that addresses multiple sources of content-dependent noise in preference learning. CNRPO employs a multi-objective optimization approach to separate true preferences from content-aware noises, effectively mitigating their impact. We leverage backdoor attack mechanisms to efficiently learn and control various noise sources within a single model. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on different synthetic noisy datasets demonstrate that CNRPO significantly improves alignment with primary human preferences while controlling for secondary noises and biases, such as response length and harmfulness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanzhi Cheng, Wenpo Song, Jiaxin Fan, Zheng Ma, Qiushi Sun, Fangzhi Xu, Chenyang Yan, Nuo Chen, Jianbing Zhang, Jiajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Image captioning has been a longstanding challenge in vision-language research. With the rise of LLMs, modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) generate detailed and comprehensive image descriptions. However, benchmarking the quality of such captions remains unresolved. This paper addresses two key questions: (1) How well do current VLMs actually perform on image captioning, particularly compared to humans? We built CapArena, a platform with over 6000 pairwise caption battles and high-quality human preference votes. Our arena-style evaluation marks a milestone, showing that leading models like GPT-4o achieve or even surpass human performance, while most open-source models lag behind. (2) Can automated metrics reliably assess detailed caption quality? Using human annotations from CapArena, we evaluate traditional and recent captioning metrics, as well as VLM-as-a-Judge. Our analysis reveals that while some metrics (e.g., METEOR) show decent caption-level agreement with humans, their systematic biases lead to inconsistencies in model ranking. In contrast, VLM-as-a-Judge demonstrates robust discernment at both the caption and model levels. Building on these insights, we release CapArena-Auto, an accurate and efficient automated benchmark for detailed captioning, achieving 94.3% correlation with human rankings at just $4 per test.

<p>Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the significance of natural language in enhancing the controllability of generative models. While various efforts have been made to leverage natural language for content generation, research on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents utilizing text-based instructions for procedural content generation remains limited. In this paper, we propose IPCGRL, an instruction-based procedural content generation method via reinforcement learning, which incorporates a sentence embedding model. IPCGRL fine-tunes task-specific embedding representations to effectively compress game-level conditions. We evaluate IPCGRL in a two-dimensional level generation task and compare its performance with a general-purpose embedding method. The results indicate that IPCGRL achieves up to a 21.4% improvement in controllability and a 17.2% improvement in generalizability for unseen instructions. Furthermore, the proposed method extends the modality of conditional input, enabling a more flexible and expressive interaction framework for procedural content generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many communities, including the scientific community, develop implicit writing norms. Understanding them is crucial for effective communication with that community. Writers gradually develop an implicit understanding of norms by reading papers and receiving feedback on their writing. However, it is difficult to both externalize this knowledge and apply it to one's own writing. We propose two new writing support concepts that reify document and sentence-level patterns in a given text corpus: (1) an ordered distribution over section titles and (2) given the user's draft and cursor location, many retrieved contextually relevant sentences. Recurring words in the latter are algorithmically highlighted to help users see any emergent norms. Study results (N=16) show that participants revised the structure and content using these concepts, gaining confidence in aligning with or breaking norms after reviewing many examples. These results demonstrate the value of reifying distributions over other authors' writing choices during the writing process.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have revolutionized video understanding, yet are still limited by context length when processing long videos. Recent methods compress videos by leveraging visual redundancy uniformly, yielding promising results. Nevertheless, our quantitative analysis shows that redundancy varies significantly across time and model layers, necessitating a more flexible compression strategy. We propose AdaReTaKe, a training-free method that flexibly reduces visual redundancy by allocating compression ratios among time and layers with theoretical guarantees. Integrated into state-of-the-art MLLMs, AdaReTaKe improves processing capacity from 256 to 2048 frames while preserving critical information. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench datasets demonstrate that AdaReTaKe outperforms existing methods by 2.3% and 2.8% for 7B and 72B models, respectively, with even greater improvements of 5.9% and 6.0% on the longest LVBench.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoo Yeon Sung, Hannah Kim, Dan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: AI practitioners increasingly use large language model (LLM) agents in compound AI systems to solve complex reasoning tasks, these agent executions often fail to meet human standards, leading to errors that compromise the system's overall performance. Addressing these failures through human intervention is challenging due to the agents' opaque reasoning processes, misalignment with human expectations, the complexity of agent dependencies, and the high cost of manual inspection. This paper thus introduces a human-centered evaluation framework for Verifying LLM Agent failures (VeriLA), which systematically assesses agent failures to reduce human effort and make these agent failures interpretable to humans. The framework first defines clear expectations of each agent by curating human-designed agent criteria. Then, it develops a human-aligned agent verifier module, trained with human gold standards, to assess each agent's execution output. This approach enables granular evaluation of each agent's performance by revealing failures from a human standard, offering clear guidelines for revision, and reducing human cognitive load. Our case study results show that VeriLA is both interpretable and efficient in helping practitioners interact more effectively with the system. By upholding accountability in human-agent collaboration, VeriLA paves the way for more trustworthy and human-aligned compound AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) are increasingly integrated into autonomous driving systems for user interaction. However, their limitations in fine-grained spatial reasoning pose challenges for system interpretability and user trust. We introduce Logic-RAG, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that improves LMMs' spatial understanding in driving scenarios. Logic-RAG constructs a dynamic knowledge base (KB) about object-object relationships in first-order logic (FOL) using a perception module, a query-to-logic embedder, and a logical inference engine. We evaluated Logic-RAG on visual-spatial queries using both synthetic and real-world driving videos. When using popular LMMs (GPT-4V, Claude 3.5) as proxies for an autonomous driving system, these models achieved only 55% accuracy on synthetic driving scenes and under 75% on real-world driving scenes. Augmenting them with Logic-RAG increased their accuracies to over 80% and 90%, respectively. An ablation study showed that even without logical inference, the fact-based context constructed by Logic-RAG alone improved accuracy by 15%. Logic-RAG is extensible: it allows seamless replacement of individual components with improved versions and enables domain experts to compose new knowledge in both FOL and natural language. In sum, Logic-RAG addresses critical spatial reasoning deficiencies in LMMs for autonomous driving applications. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Imran2205/LogicRAG.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating molecules with desired chemical properties presents a critical challenge in fields such as chemical synthesis and drug discovery. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have significantly contributed to data-driven molecular generation. However, challenges persist due to the inherent sensitivity of simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) representations and the difficulties in applying generative adversarial networks (GANs) to discrete data. This study introduces RL-MolGAN, a novel Transformer-based discrete GAN framework designed to address these challenges. Unlike traditional Transformer architectures, RL-MolGAN utilizes a first-decoder-then-encoder structure, facilitating the generation of drug-like molecules from both $de~novo$ and scaffold-based designs. In addition, RL-MolGAN integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) techniques to enhance the stability of GAN training and optimize the chemical properties of the generated molecules. To further improve the model's performance, RL-MolWGAN, an extension of RL-MolGAN, incorporates Wasserstein distance and mini-batch discrimination, which together enhance the stability of the GAN. Experimental results on two widely used molecular datasets, QM9 and ZINC, validate the effectiveness of our models in generating high-quality molecular structures with diverse and desirable chemical properties.</p>

To bridge this gap, we introduce knowledge-intensive visual grounding (KVG), a novel visual grounding task that requires both fine-grained perception and domain-specific knowledge integration. To address the challenges of KVG, we propose DeepPerception, an MLLM enhanced with cognitive visual perception capabilities. Our approach consists of (1) an automated data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality, knowledge-aligned training samples, and (2) a two-stage training framework combining supervised fine-tuning for cognitive reasoning scaffolding and reinforcement learning to optimize perception-cognition synergy. To benchmark performance, we introduce KVG-Bench a comprehensive dataset spanning 10 domains with 1.3K manually curated test cases. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepPerception significantly outperforms direct fine-tuning, achieving +8.08\% accuracy improvements on KVG-Bench and exhibiting +4.60\% superior cross-domain generalization over baseline approaches. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating cognitive processes into MLLMs for human-like visual perception and open new directions for multimodal reasoning research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kairong Luo, Haodong Wen, Shengding Hu, Zhenbo Sun, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun, Kaifeng Lyu, Wenguang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large models is both resource-intensive and time-consuming, making it crucial to understand the quantitative relationship between model performance and hyperparameters. In this paper, we present an empirical law that describes how the pretraining loss of large language models evolves under different learning rate schedules, such as constant, cosine, and step decay schedules. Our proposed law takes a multi-power form, combining a power law based on the sum of learning rates and additional power laws to account for a loss reduction effect induced by learning rate decay. We extensively validate this law on various model sizes and architectures, and demonstrate that after fitting on a few learning rate schedules, the law accurately predicts the loss curves for unseen schedules of different shapes and horizons. Moreover, by minimizing the predicted final pretraining loss across learning rate schedules, we are able to find a schedule that outperforms the widely used cosine learning rate schedule. Interestingly, this automatically discovered schedule bears some resemblance to the recently proposed Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) schedule (Hu et al, 2024) but achieves a slightly lower final loss. We believe these results could offer valuable insights for understanding the dynamics of pretraining and designing learning rate schedules to improve efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Lu, Yale Song, William Wang, Lorenzo Torresani, Tushar Nagarajan</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate complex video question answering via chain-of-evidence reasoning -- identifying sequences of temporal spans from multiple relevant parts of the video, together with visual evidence within them. Existing models struggle with multi-step reasoning as they uniformly sample a fixed number of frames, which can miss critical evidence distributed nonuniformly throughout the video. Moreover, they lack the ability to temporally localize such evidence in the broader context of the full video, which is required for answering complex questions. We propose a framework to enhance existing VideoQA datasets with evidence reasoning chains, automatically constructed by searching for optimal intervals of interest in the video with supporting evidence, that maximizes the likelihood of answering a given question. We train our model (VITED) to generate these evidence chains directly, enabling it to both localize evidence windows as well as perform multi-step reasoning across them in long-form video content. We show the value of our evidence-distilled models on a suite of long video QA benchmarks where we outperform state-of-the-art approaches that lack evidence reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Gu, Aldeida Aleti, Chunyang Chen, Hongyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are widely used in software engineering for code generation, but they may produce code with errors. Rather than repairing the generated code, an alternative way is to address the underlying failures of models. LM repair offers a lightweight solution to this challenge: it requires minimal data, reduces computational costs, and reduces the side effects. Unlike retraining, LM repair focuses on applying tailored updates to targeted neurons, making it ideal for scenarios with limited resources, high-performance demands, or strict safety requirements. In this paper, we propose \ul{S}emantic \ul{T}argeting for \ul{A}nalytical \ul{R}epair (\textsc{STAR}), a pioneering and novel semantic-based optimization approach for repairing LLMs. \textsc{STAR} realizes main operations in LM repair methods in an optimization process, including locating ``buggy neurons'', solving ``neuron patches'', and patching ``buggy neurons''. Correspondingly, it computes the deltas of weight matrix as the prior information to guide optimization; and attributes the targeted layers and neurons leveraging statistical insights. The neuron patches are computed with a solid semantic-based analytical formula, which directly bridges the changes to logits with the deltas of neurons, by steering latent representations. Compared to the prior work of LM repair (\textsc{MINT}) and optimization methods (\textsc{SGD}), \textsc{STAR} integrates their strengths while mitigating their limitations. \textsc{STAR} supports solving multiple failures together, significantly improving the usefulness. Evaluated on three code generation tasks using popular code LMs, \textsc{STAR} demonstrates superior effectiveness. Additionally, \textsc{STAR} exhibits better efficiency. In terms of side effects, namely the balance between generalization and specificity, \textsc{STAR} outperforms prior work by a significant margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyi Zhang, Jiaxing Huang, Huanjin Yao, Shunyu Liu, Xikun Zhang, Shijian Lu, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies generally enhance MLLMs' reasoning capabilities via supervised fine-tuning on high-quality chain-of-thought reasoning data, which often leads models to merely imitate successful reasoning paths without understanding what the wrong reasoning paths are. In this work, we aim to enhance the MLLMs' reasoning ability beyond passively imitating positive reasoning paths. To this end, we design Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (StepGRPO), a new online reinforcement learning framework that enables MLLMs to self-improve reasoning ability via simple, effective and dense step-wise rewarding. Specifically, StepGRPO introduces two novel rule-based reasoning rewards: Step-wise Reasoning Accuracy Reward (StepRAR) and Step-wise Reasoning Validity Reward (StepRVR). StepRAR rewards the reasoning paths that contain necessary intermediate reasoning steps via a soft key-step matching technique, while StepRAR rewards reasoning paths that follow a well-structured and logically consistent reasoning process through a reasoning completeness and logic evaluation strategy. With the proposed StepGRPO, we introduce R1-VL, a series of MLLMs with outstanding capabilities in step-by-step reasoning. Extensive experiments over 8 benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Pichat, William Pogrund, Paloma Pichat, Armanouche Gasparian, Samuel Demarchi, Corbet Alois Georgeon, Michael Veillet-Guillem</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the ability of perceptron-type neurons in language models to perform intra-neuronal attention; that is, to identify different homogeneous categorical segments within the synthetic thought category they encode, based on a segmentation of specific activation zones for the tokens to which they are particularly responsive. The objective of this work is therefore to determine to what extent formal neurons can establish a homomorphic relationship between activation-based and categorical segmentations. The results suggest the existence of such a relationship, albeit tenuous, only at the level of tokens with very high activation levels. This intra-neuronal attention subsequently enables categorical restructuring processes at the level of neurons in the following layer, thereby contributing to the progressive formation of high-level categorical abstractions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at 2D visual understanding but remain limited in their ability to reason about 3D space. In this work, we leverage large-scale high-quality 3D scene data with open-set annotations to introduce 1) a novel supervised fine-tuning dataset and 2) a new evaluation benchmark, focused on indoor scenes. Our Cubify Anything VQA (CA-VQA) data covers diverse spatial tasks including spatial relationship prediction, metric size and distance estimation, and 3D grounding. We show that CA-VQA enables us to train MM-Spatial, a strong generalist MLLM that also achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D spatial understanding benchmarks, including our own. We show how incorporating metric depth and multi-view inputs (provided in CA-VQA) can further improve 3D understanding, and demonstrate that data alone allows our model to achieve depth perception capabilities comparable to dedicated monocular depth estimation models. We will publish our SFT dataset and benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiyu Guo, Ziyang Chen, Shaoguang Wang, Jianxiang He, Yijie Xu, Jinhui Ye, Ying Sun, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding long video content is a complex endeavor that often relies on densely sampled frame captions or end-to-end feature selectors, yet these techniques commonly overlook the logical relationships between textual queries and visual elements. In practice, computational constraints necessitate coarse frame subsampling, a challenge analogous to ``finding a needle in a haystack.'' To address this issue, we introduce a semantics-driven search framework that reformulates keyframe selection under the paradigm of Visual Semantic-Logical Search. Specifically, we systematically define four fundamental logical dependencies: 1) spatial co-occurrence, 2) temporal proximity, 3) attribute dependency, and 4) causal order. These relations dynamically update frame sampling distributions through an iterative refinement process, enabling context-aware identification of semantically critical frames tailored to specific query requirements. Our method establishes new SOTA performance on the manually annotated benchmark in key-frame selection metrics. Furthermore, when applied to downstream video question-answering tasks, the proposed approach demonstrates the best performance gains over existing methods on LongVideoBench and Video-MME, validating its effectiveness in bridging the logical gap between textual queries and visual-temporal reasoning. The code will be publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce an Item Response Theory (IRT)-based framework to detect and quantify socioeconomic bias in large language models (LLMs) without relying on subjective human judgments. Unlike traditional methods, IRT accounts for item difficulty, improving ideological bias estimation. We fine-tune two LLM families (Meta-LLaMa 3.2-1B-Instruct and Chat- GPT 3.5) to represent distinct ideological positions and introduce a two-stage approach: (1) modeling response avoidance and (2) estimating perceived bias in answered responses. Our results show that off-the-shelf LLMs often avoid ideological engagement rather than exhibit bias, challenging prior claims of partisanship. This empirically validated framework enhances AI alignment research and promotes fairer AI governance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Chen, Zhihao Peng, Xusheng Liang, Cheng Wang, Peigan Liang, Linsheng Zeng, Minjie Ju, Yixuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Inpatient pathways demand complex clinical decision-making based on comprehensive patient information, posing critical challenges for clinicians. Despite advancements in large language models (LLMs) in medical applications, limited research focused on artificial intelligence (AI) inpatient pathways systems, due to the lack of large-scale inpatient datasets. Moreover, existing medical benchmarks typically concentrated on medical question-answering and examinations, ignoring the multifaceted nature of clinical decision-making in inpatient settings. To address these gaps, we first developed the Inpatient Pathway Decision Support (IPDS) benchmark from the MIMIC-IV database, encompassing 51,274 cases across nine triage departments and 17 major disease categories alongside 16 standardized treatment options. Then, we proposed the Multi-Agent Inpatient Pathways (MAP) framework to accomplish inpatient pathways with three clinical agents, including a triage agent managing the patient admission, a diagnosis agent serving as the primary decision maker at the department, and a treatment agent providing treatment plans. Additionally, our MAP framework includes a chief agent overseeing the inpatient pathways to guide and promote these three clinician agents. Extensive experiments showed our MAP improved the diagnosis accuracy by 25.10% compared to the state-of-the-art LLM HuatuoGPT2-13B. It is worth noting that our MAP demonstrated significant clinical compliance, outperforming three board-certified clinicians by 10%-12%, establishing a foundation for inpatient pathways systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangzhi Xu, Hang Yan, Chang Ma, Haiteng Zhao, Jun Liu, Qika Lin, Zhiyong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Inference-time optimization scales computation to derive deliberate reasoning steps for effective performance. While previous search-based strategies address the short-sightedness of auto-regressive generation, the vast search space leads to excessive exploration and insufficient exploitation. To strike an efficient balance to derive the optimal step, we frame the decoding strategy as foresight sampling, leveraging simulated future steps to obtain globally optimal step estimation. Built on it, we propose a novel decoding strategy, named $\phi$-Decoding. To provide a precise and expressive estimation of step value, $\phi$-Decoding approximates two distributions via foresight and clustering. Sampling from the joint distribution, the optimal steps can be selected for exploitation. To support adaptive computation allocation, we propose in-width and in-depth pruning strategies, featuring a light-weight solution to achieve inference efficiency. Extensive experiments across seven benchmarks show $\phi$-Decoding outperforms strong baselines in both performance and efficiency. Additional analysis demonstrates its generalization across various LLMs and scalability across a wide range of computing budgets. The code will be released at https://github.com/xufangzhi/phi-Decoding, and the open-source PyPI package is coming soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scientific research demands sophisticated reasoning over multimodal data, a challenge especially prevalent in biology. Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for AI-assisted research, existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks only target up to college-level difficulty, while research-level benchmarks emphasize lower-level perception, falling short of the complex multimodal reasoning needed for scientific discovery. To bridge this gap, we introduce MicroVQA, a visual-question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to assess three reasoning capabilities vital in research workflows: expert image understanding, hypothesis generation, and experiment proposal. MicroVQA consists of 1,042 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) curated by biology experts across diverse microscopy modalities, ensuring VQA samples represent real scientific practice. In constructing the benchmark, we find that standard MCQ generation methods induce language shortcuts, motivating a new two-stage pipeline: an optimized LLM prompt structures question-answer pairs into MCQs; then, an agent-based `RefineBot' updates them to remove shortcuts. Benchmarking on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a peak performance of 53\%; models with smaller LLMs only slightly underperform top models, suggesting that language-based reasoning is less challenging than multimodal reasoning; and tuning with scientific articles enhances performance. Expert analysis of chain-of-thought responses shows that perception errors are the most frequent, followed by knowledge errors and then overgeneralization errors. These insights highlight the challenges in multimodal scientific reasoning, showing MicroVQA is a valuable resource advancing AI-driven biomedical research.

<p>Abstract: Large-scale language models (LLMs) has shown remarkable capability in various of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and attracted lots of attention recently. However, some studies indicated that large language models fail to achieve promising result beyond the state-of-the-art models in English grammatical error correction (GEC) tasks. In this report, we aim to explore the how large language models perform on Chinese grammatical error correction tasks and provide guidance for future work. We conduct experiments with 3 different LLMs of different model scale on 4 Chinese GEC dataset. Our experimental results indicate that the performances of LLMs on automatic evaluation metrics falls short of the previous sota models because of the problem of over-correction. Furthermore, we also discover notable variations in the performance of LLMs when evaluated on different data distributions. Our findings demonstrates that further investigation is required for the application of LLMs on Chinese GEC task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinran Zhao, Hongming Zhang, Xiaoman Pan, Wenlin Yao, Dong Yu, Jianshu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Although large-scale pre-trained language models (PTLMs) are shown to encode rich knowledge in their model parameters, the inherent knowledge in PTLMs can be opaque or static, making external knowledge necessary. However, the existing information retrieval techniques could be costly and may even introduce noisy and sometimes misleading knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose the instance-level adaptive propulsion of external knowledge (IAPEK), where we only conduct the retrieval when necessary. To achieve this goal, we propose measuring whether a PTLM contains enough knowledge to solve an instance with a novel metric, Thrust, which leverages the representation distribution of a small number of seen instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that thrust is a good measurement of PTLM models' instance-level knowledgeability. Moreover, we can achieve significantly higher cost-efficiency with the Thrust score as the retrieval indicator than the naive usage of external knowledge on 88% of the evaluated tasks with 26% average performance improvement. Such findings shed light on the real-world practice of knowledge-enhanced LMs with a limited knowledge-seeking budget due to computation latency or costs.</p>

<p>Abstract: In various work contexts, such as meeting scheduling, collaborating, and project planning, collective decision-making is essential but often challenging due to diverse individual preferences, varying work focuses, and power dynamics among members. To address this, we propose a system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate group decision-making by managing conversations and balancing preferences among individuals. Our system aims to extract individual preferences from each member's conversation with the system and suggest options that satisfy the preferences of the members. We specifically apply this system to corporate meeting scheduling. We create synthetic employee profiles and simulate conversations at scale, leveraging LLMs to evaluate the system performance as a novel approach to conducting a user study. Our results indicate efficient coordination with reduced interactions between the members and the LLM-based system. The system refines and improves its proposed options over time, ensuring that many of the members' individual preferences are satisfied in an equitable way. Finally, we conduct a survey study involving human participants to assess our system's ability to aggregate preferences and reasoning about them. Our findings show that the system exhibits strong performance in both dimensions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Rizwan Parvez</p>
<p>Abstract: While chain-of-thoughts (CoT) prompting has revolutionized how LLMs perform reasoning tasks, its current methods and variations (e.g, Self-consistency, ReACT, Reflexion, Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), Cumulative Reasoning (CR) etc.,) suffer from limitations like limited context grounding, hallucination/inconsistent output generation, and iterative sluggishness. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel mono/dual-step zero-shot prompting framework built upon two unique strategies Chain of Evidences (CoE)} and Evidence to Generate (E2G). Instead of unverified reasoning claims, our innovative approaches leverage the power of "evidence for decision making" by first focusing exclusively on the thought sequences explicitly mentioned in the context which then serve as extracted evidence, guiding the LLM's output generation process with greater precision and efficiency. This simple yet potent approach unlocks the full potential of chain-of-thoughts prompting, facilitating faster, more reliable, and contextually aware reasoning in LLMs. Our framework consistently achieves remarkable results across various knowledge-intensive reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing baseline approaches with state-of-the-art LLMs. For instance, (i) on the LogiQA benchmark using GPT-4, CoE achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 53.8%, surpassing CoT by 18%, ToT by 11%, and CR by 9%; (ii) CoE with PaLM-2 outperforms the variable-shot performance of Gemini Ultra by 0.9 F1 points, achieving an F1 score of 83.3 on DROP.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new decoding method called Permute-and-Flip (PF) decoder. It enjoys stability properties similar to the standard sampling decoder, but is provably up to 2x better in its quality-stability tradeoff than sampling and never worse than any other decoder. We also design a cryptographic watermarking scheme analogous to Aaronson (2023)'s Gumbel watermark, but naturally tailored for PF decoder. The watermarking scheme does not change the distribution to sample, while allowing arbitrarily low false positive rate and high recall whenever the generated text has high entropy. Our experiments show that the PF decoder (and its watermarked counterpart) significantly outperform(s) naive sampling (and its Gumbel watermarked counterpart) in terms of perplexity, while retaining the same stability (and detectability), hence making it a promising new approach for LLM decoding.

However, we reveal a paradoxical vulnerability: as LLMs advance in reasoning, they inadvertently become more susceptible to novel jailbreaking attacks. Enhanced reasoning enables LLMs to interpret complex instructions and decode complex user-defined ciphers, creating an exploitable security gap. To study this vulnerability, we introduce Attacks using Custom Encryptions (ACE), a jailbreaking technique that encodes malicious queries with novel ciphers. Extending ACE, we introduce Layered Attacks using Custom Encryptions (LACE), which applies multi-layer ciphers to amplify attack complexity. Furthermore, we develop CipherBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' accuracy in decoding encrypted benign text. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off: LLMs that are more capable of decoding ciphers are more vulnerable to these jailbreaking attacks, with success rates on GPT-4o escalating from 40% under ACE to 78% with LACE. These findings highlight a critical insight: as LLMs become more adept at deciphering complex user ciphers--many of which cannot be preemptively included in safety training--they become increasingly exploitable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Wang, Yu Zheng, Zhongwei Wan, Mi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been hindered by their substantial sizes, which necessitates LLM compression methods for practical deployment. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) offers a promising solution for LLM compression. However, state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods have two key limitations: truncating smaller singular values may lead to higher compression loss, and the lack of update on the compressed weights after SVD truncation. In this work, we propose SVD-LLM, a SVD-based post-training LLM compression method that addresses the limitations of existing methods. SVD-LLM incorporates a truncation-aware data whitening technique to ensure a direct mapping between singular values and compression loss. Moreover, SVD-LLM adopts a parameter update with sequential low-rank approximation to compensate for the accuracy degradation after SVD compression. We evaluate SVD-LLM on 10 datasets and seven models from three different LLM families at three different scales. Our results demonstrate the superiority of SVD-LLM over state-of-the-arts, especially at high model compression ratios. Our code is available at https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/SVD-LLM</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukyung Lee, Joonghoon Kim, Jaehee Kim, Hyowon Cho, Jaewook Kang, Pilsung Kang, Najoung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing LLM-as-a-Judge approaches for evaluating text generation suffer from rating inconsistencies, with low agreement and high rating variance across different evaluator models. We attribute this to subjective evaluation criteria combined with Likert scale scoring in existing protocols. To address this issue, we introduce CheckEval, a checklist-based evaluation framework that improves rating reliability via decomposed binary questions. Through experiments with 12 evaluator models across multiple datasets, we first demonstrate that CheckEval strongly correlates with human judgments, improving the average correlation with human judgments by 0.10. More importantly, CheckEval dramatically improves the average agreement across evaluator models by 0.45 and reduces the score variance. CheckEval scores furthermore have the benefit of being more interpretable because it decomposes evaluation criteria into traceable binary decisions, allowing analyses of specific attributes driving quality judgments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kabir Ahuja, Vidhisha Balachandran, Madhur Panwar, Tianxing He, Noah A. Smith, Navin Goyal, Yulia Tsvetkov</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers trained on natural language data have been shown to learn its hierarchical structure and generalize to sentences with unseen syntactic structures without explicitly encoding any structural bias. In this work, we investigate sources of inductive bias in transformer models and their training that could cause such generalization behavior to emerge. We extensively experiment with transformer models trained on multiple synthetic datasets and with different training objectives and show that while other objectives e.g. sequence-to-sequence modeling, prefix language modeling, often failed to lead to hierarchical generalization, models trained with the language modeling objective consistently learned to generalize hierarchically. We then conduct pruning experiments to study how transformers trained with the language modeling objective encode hierarchical structure. When pruned, we find joint existence of subnetworks within the model with different generalization behaviors (subnetworks corresponding to hierarchical structure and linear order). Finally, we take a Bayesian perspective to further uncover transformers' preference for hierarchical generalization: We establish a correlation between whether transformers generalize hierarchically on a dataset and whether the simplest explanation of that dataset is provided by a hierarchical grammar compared to regular grammars exhibiting linear generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanli He, Jun Wang, Qiongkai Xu, Pasquale Minervini, Pontus Stenetorp, Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein, Trevor Cohn</p>
<p>Abstract: The implications of backdoor attacks on English-centric large language models (LLMs) have been widely examined - such attacks can be achieved by embedding malicious behaviors during training and activated under specific conditions that trigger malicious outputs. Despite the increasing support for multilingual capabilities in open-source and proprietary LLMs, the impact of backdoor attacks on these systems remains largely under-explored. Our research focuses on cross-lingual backdoor attacks against multilingual LLMs, particularly investigating how poisoning the instruction-tuning data for one or two languages can affect the outputs for languages whose instruction-tuning data were not poisoned. Despite its simplicity, our empirical analysis reveals that our method exhibits remarkable efficacy in models like mT5 and GPT-4o, with high attack success rates, surpassing 90% in more than 7 out of 12 languages across various scenarios. Our findings also indicate that more powerful models show increased susceptibility to transferable cross-lingual backdoor attacks, which also applies to LLMs predominantly pre-trained on English data, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Gemma. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate 1) High Transferability: the backdoor mechanism operates successfully in cross-lingual response scenarios across 26 languages, achieving an average attack success rate of 99%, and 2) Robustness: the proposed attack remains effective even after defenses are applied. These findings expose critical security vulnerabilities in multilingual LLMs and highlight the urgent need for more robust, targeted defense strategies to address the unique challenges posed by cross-lingual backdoor transfer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zezhong Wang, Xingshan Zeng, Weiwen Liu, Yufei Wang, Liangyou Li, Yasheng Wang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Kam-Fai Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Current research found the issue of Early Answering in large language models (LLMs), where the models already have an answer before generating the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). This phenomenon suggests a potential lack of necessary dependency between the predicted answer and the reasoning process. Consequently, two important questions arise: (1) Is CoT still necessary if the model already has an answer? (2) Can the correctness of the answer serve as valid evidence for the correctness of CoT? To address these questions, we propose a method, namely Chain-of-Probe (CoP), to probe changes in the mind during the model's reasoning. The probing results show that in a significant number of question-answer cases, CoT appears to be unnecessary, and this necessity correlates with the simplicity of the task, defined by reasoning steps required. Furthermore, by analyzing patterns in mind change, we examine the correctness of the model's reasoning. Our validation reveals that many responses, although correct in their final answer, contain errors in their reasoning process. To this end, we propose a strategic approach based on CoP to prioritize answers with correct reasoning among multiple candidates, thereby bolstering the reliability of the model's reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Nguyen, Andrew Baker, Clement Neo, Allen Roush, Andreas Kirsch, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate text by sampling the next token from a probability distribution over the vocabulary at each decoding step. However, popular sampling methods like top-p (nucleus sampling) often struggle to balance quality and diversity, especially at higher temperatures, leading to incoherent or repetitive outputs. To address this challenge, we propose min-p sampling, a dynamic truncation method that adjusts the sampling threshold based on the model's confidence by scaling according to the top token's probability. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmarks including GPQA, GSM8K, and AlpacaEval Creative Writing, demonstrating that min-p sampling improves both the quality and diversity of generated text, particularly at high temperatures. Moreover, human evaluations reveal a clear preference for min-p sampling in terms of both text quality and diversity. Min-p sampling has been adopted by multiple open-source LLM implementations, highlighting its practical utility and potential impact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucio La Cava, Davide Costa, Andrea Tagarelli</p>
<p>Abstract: The significant progress in the development of Large Language Models has contributed to blurring the distinction between human and AI-generated text. The increasing pervasiveness of AI-generated text and the difficulty in detecting it poses new challenges for our society. In this paper, we tackle the problem of detecting and attributing AI-generated text by proposing WhosAI, a triplet-network contrastive learning framework designed to predict whether a given input text has been generated by humans or AI and to unveil the authorship of the text. Unlike most existing approaches, our proposed framework is conceived to learn semantic similarity representations from multiple generators at once, thus equally handling both detection and attribution tasks. Furthermore, WhosAI is model-agnostic and scalable to the release of new AI text-generation models by incorporating their generated instances into the embedding space learned by our framework. Experimental results on the TuringBench benchmark of 200K news articles show that our proposed framework achieves outstanding results in both the Turing Test and Authorship Attribution tasks, outperforming all the methods listed in the TuringBench benchmark leaderboards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Shen, Ran Xu, Yennie Jun, Zhen Qin, Tianqi Liu, Carl Yang, Yi Liang, Simon Baumgartner, Michael Bendersky</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. They are trained using preference datasets where each example consists of one input prompt, two responses, and a preference label. As curating a high-quality human labeled preference dataset is both time-consuming and expensive, people often rely on existing powerful LLMs for preference label generation. This can potentially introduce noise and impede RM training. In this work, we present RMBoost, a novel synthetic preference data generation paradigm to boost reward model quality. Unlike traditional methods, which generate two responses before obtaining the preference label, RMBoost first generates one response and selects a preference label, followed by generating the second more (or less) preferred response conditioned on the pre-selected preference label and the first response. This approach offers two main advantages. First, RMBoost reduces labeling noise since preference pairs are constructed intentionally. Second, RMBoost facilitates the creation of more diverse responses by incorporating various quality aspects (e.g., helpfulness, relevance, completeness) into the prompts. We conduct extensive experiments across three diverse datasets and demonstrate that RMBoost outperforms other synthetic preference data generation techniques and significantly boosts the performance of four distinct reward models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Using LLMs for Multi-Document Topic Extraction has recently gained popularity due to their apparent high-quality outputs, expressiveness, and ease of use. However, most existing evaluation practices are not designed for LLM-generated topics and result in low inter-annotator agreement scores, hindering the reliable use of LLMs for the task. To address this, we introduce $T^5Score$, an evaluation methodology that decomposes the quality of a topic set into quantifiable aspects, measurable through easy-to-perform annotation tasks. This framing enables a convenient, manual or automatic, evaluation procedure resulting in a strong inter-annotator agreement score. To substantiate our methodology and claims, we perform extensive experimentation on multiple datasets and report the results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiansheng Huang, Sihao Hu, Fatih Ilhan, Selim Furkan Tekin, Ling Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning attack poses serious safety concerns for large language models' fine-tuning-as-a-service. While existing defenses have been proposed to mitigate the issue, their performances are still far away from satisfactory, and the root cause of the problem has not been fully recovered. To this end, we in this paper show that harmful perturbation over the model weights could be a probable cause of alignment-broken. In order to attenuate the negative impact of harmful perturbation, we propose an alignment-stage solution, dubbed Booster. Technically, along with the original alignment loss, we append a loss regularizer in the alignment stage's optimization. The regularizer ensures that the model's harmful loss reduction after the simulated harmful perturbation is attenuated, thereby mitigating the subsequent fine-tuning risk. Empirical results show that Booster can effectively reduce the harmful score of the fine-tuned models while maintaining the performance of downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Ying Chiu, Liwei Jiang, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: As users increasingly seek guidance from LLMs for decision-making in daily life, many of these decisions are not clear-cut and depend significantly on the personal values and ethical standards of people. We present DailyDilemmas, a dataset of 1,360 moral dilemmas encountered in everyday life. Each dilemma presents two possible actions, along with affected parties and relevant human values for each action. Based on these dilemmas, we gather a repository of human values covering diverse everyday topics, such as interpersonal relationships, workplace, and environmental issues. With DailyDilemmas, we evaluate LLMs on these dilemmas to determine what action they will choose and the values represented by these action choices. Then, we analyze values through the lens of five theoretical frameworks inspired by sociology, psychology, and philosophy, including the World Values Survey, Moral Foundations Theory, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, Aristotle's Virtues, and Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions. For instance, we find LLMs are most aligned with self-expression over survival in World Values Survey and care over loyalty in Moral Foundations Theory. Interestingly, we find substantial preference differences in models for some core values. For example, for truthfulness, Mixtral-8x7B neglects it by 9.7% while GPT-4-turbo selects it by 9.4%. We also study the recent guidance released by OpenAI (ModelSpec), and Anthropic (Constitutional AI) to understand how their designated principles reflect their models' actual value prioritization when facing nuanced moral reasoning in daily-life settings. Finally, we find that end users cannot effectively steer such prioritization using system prompts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the increasing effectiveness of language models, their reasoning capabilities remain underdeveloped. In particular, causal reasoning through counterfactual question answering is lacking. This work aims to bridge this gap. We first derive novel metrics that balance accuracy in factual and counterfactual questions, capturing a more complete view of the reasoning abilities of language models than traditional factual-only based metrics. Second, we propose several fine-tuning approaches that aim to elicit better reasoning mechanisms, in the sense of the proposed metrics. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned language models in a variety of realistic scenarios. In particular, we investigate to what extent our fine-tuning approaches systemically achieve better generalization with respect to the base models in several problems that require, among others, inductive and deductive reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro Cisneros-Velarde</p>
<p>Abstract: Social balance is a well-established concept in sociology which dictates how individual interactions can lead a population to become one faction of positive interactions or be divided in two or more antagonistic factions. In this paper, we consider a group of large language models (LLMs) and study how, after continuous interactions, they can achieve social balance. Across three different LLM models, we find that achieving social balance depends on (i) the type of interaction; (ii) whether agents consider homophily or influence from their peers; and (iii) the population size. We characterize how each model achieves social balance with different frequency, diversity of positive or negative interactions, and interaction stability across conditions (i) to (iii). We show that models achieve different notions of social balance and justify their social dynamics differently. Remarkably, the largest model is not necessarily more likely to achieve social balance with more frequency, stability, and diversity than the smaller ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> HyoJung Han, Akiko Eriguchi, Haoran Xu, Hieu Hoang, Marine Carpuat, Huda Khayrallah</p>
<p>Abstract: Vocabulary adaptation, which integrates new vocabulary into pre-trained language models, enables expansion to new languages and mitigates token over-fragmentation. However, existing approaches are limited by their reliance on heuristics or external embeddings. We propose VocADT, a novel method for vocabulary adaptation using adapter modules that are trained to learn the optimal linear combination of existing embeddings while keeping the model's weights fixed. VocADT offers a flexible and scalable solution without depending on external resources or language constraints. Across 11 languages-with diverse scripts, resource availability, and fragmentation-we demonstrate that VocADT outperforms the original Mistral model and other baselines across various multilingual tasks including natural language understanding and machine translation. We find that Latin-script languages and highly fragmented languages benefit the most from vocabulary adaptation. We further fine-tune the adapted model on the generative task of machine translation and find that vocabulary adaptation is still beneficial after fine-tuning and that VocADT is the most effective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zechen Li, Shohreh Deldari, Linyao Chen, Hao Xue, Flora D. Salim</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce SensorLLM, a two-stage framework that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform human activity recognition (HAR) from sensor data. Despite their strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs remain underutilized for motion sensor data due to the lack of semantic context in time-series, computational constraints, and challenges in processing numerical inputs. SensorLLM addresses these limitations through a Sensor-Language Alignment stage, where we introduce special tokens for each sensor channel and automatically generate textual trend descriptions. This alignment enables LLMs to capture numerical variations, channel-specific features, and data of varying duration--without requiring human annotations. In the subsequent Task-Aware Tuning stage, we refine the model for HAR classification, achieving performance that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that SensorLLM evolves into an effective sensor learner, reasoner, and classifier through Sensor-Language Alignment, generalizing across diverse HAR datasets. We believe this work establishes a foundation for future research on time-series and text alignment, paving the way for foundation models in sensor data analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengxiang Zhang, Songxin Zhang, Bingyi Jing, Hongxin Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), detecting pretraining data has been increasingly important due to concerns about fair evaluation and ethical risks. Current methods differentiate members and non-members by designing scoring functions, like Perplexity and Min-k%. However, the diversity and complexity of training data magnifies the difficulty of distinguishing, leading to suboptimal performance in detecting pretraining data. In this paper, we first explore the benefits of unseen data, which can be easily collected after the release of the LLM. We find that the perplexities of LLMs shift differently for members and non-members, after fine-tuning with a small amount of previously unseen data. In light of this, we introduce a novel and effective method termed Fine-tuned Score Deviation(FSD), which improves the performance of current scoring functions for pretraining data detection. In particular, we propose to measure the deviation distance of current scores after fine-tuning on a small amount of unseen data within the same domain. In effect, using a few unseen data can largely decrease the scores of all non-members, leading to a larger deviation distance than members. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, significantly improving the AUC score on common benchmark datasets across various models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukun Huang, Sanxing Chen, Hongyi Cai, Bhuwan Dhingra</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often augmented with external contexts, such as those used in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, these contexts can be inaccurate or intentionally misleading, leading to conflicts with the model's internal knowledge. We argue that robust LLMs should demonstrate situated faithfulness, dynamically calibrating their trust in external information based on their confidence in the internal knowledge and the external context to resolve knowledge conflicts. To benchmark this capability, we evaluate LLMs across several QA datasets, including a newly created dataset featuring in-the-wild incorrect contexts sourced from Reddit posts. We show that when provided with both correct and incorrect contexts, both open-source and proprietary models tend to overly rely on external information, regardless of its factual accuracy. To enhance situated faithfulness, we propose two approaches: Self-Guided Confidence Reasoning (SCR) and Rule-Based Confidence Reasoning (RCR). SCR enables models to self-assess the confidence of external information relative to their own internal knowledge to produce the most accurate answer. RCR, in contrast, extracts explicit confidence signals from the LLM and determines the final answer using predefined rules. Our results show that for LLMs with strong reasoning capabilities, such as GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, SCR outperforms RCR, achieving improvements of up to 24.2% over a direct input augmentation baseline. Conversely, for a smaller model like Llama-3-8B, RCR outperforms SCR. Fine-tuning SCR with our proposed Confidence Reasoning Direct Preference Optimization (CR-DPO) method improves performance on both seen and unseen datasets, yielding an average improvement of 8.9% on Llama-3-8B. In addition to quantitative results, we offer insights into the relative strengths of SCR and RCR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zezhong Wang, Xingshan Zeng, Weiwen Liu, Liangyou Li, Yasheng Wang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Kam-Fai Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a common method to enhance the tool calling capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), with the training data often being synthesized. The current data synthesis process generally involves sampling a set of tools, formulating a requirement based on these tools, and generating the call statements. However, tools sampled randomly lack relevance, making them difficult to combine and thus reducing the diversity of the data. Additionally, current work overlooks the coherence between turns of dialogues, leading to a gap between the synthesized data and real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Graph-based Sampling strategy to sample more relevant tool combinations, and a Planned-generation strategy to create plans that guide the synthesis of coherent dialogues. We integrate these two strategies and enable multiple agents to synthesize the dialogue data interactively, resulting in our tool-calling data synthesis pipeline ToolFlow. Data quality assessments demonstrate improvements in the naturalness and coherence of our synthesized dialogues. Finally, we apply SFT on LLaMA-3.1-8B using 8,000 synthetic dialogues generated with ToolFlow. Results show that the model achieves tool-calling performance comparable to or even surpassing GPT-4, while maintaining strong general capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julie Kallini, Shikhar Murty, Christopher D. Manning, Christopher Potts, R\'obert Csord\'as</p>
<p>Abstract: Models that rely on subword tokenization have significant drawbacks, such as sensitivity to character-level noise like spelling errors and inconsistent compression rates across different languages and scripts. While character- or byte-level models like ByT5 attempt to address these concerns, they have not gained widespread adoption -- processing raw byte streams without tokenization results in significantly longer sequence lengths, making training and inference inefficient. This work introduces MrT5 (MergeT5), a more efficient variant of ByT5 that integrates a token deletion mechanism in its encoder to dynamically shorten the input sequence length. After processing through a fixed number of encoder layers, a learned delete gate determines which tokens are to be removed and which are to be retained for subsequent layers. MrT5 effectively "merges" critical information from deleted tokens into a more compact sequence, leveraging contextual information from the remaining tokens. In continued pre-training experiments, we find that MrT5 can achieve significant gains in inference runtime with minimal effect on performance, as measured by bits-per-byte. Additionally, with multilingual training, MrT5 adapts to the orthographic characteristics of each language, learning language-specific compression rates. Furthermore, MrT5 shows comparable accuracy to ByT5 on downstream evaluations such as XNLI, TyDi QA, and character-level tasks while reducing sequence lengths by up to 75%. Our approach presents a solution to the practical limitations of existing byte-level models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dennis Fucci, Marco Gaido, Beatrice Savoldi, Matteo Negri, Mauro Cettolo, Luisa Bentivogli</p>
<p>Abstract: Spurred by the demand for interpretable models, research on eXplainable AI for language technologies has experienced significant growth, with feature attribution methods emerging as a cornerstone of this progress. While prior work in NLP explored such methods for classification tasks and textual applications, explainability intersecting generation and speech is lagging, with existing techniques failing to account for the autoregressive nature of state-of-the-art models and to provide fine-grained, phonetically meaningful explanations. We address this gap by introducing Spectrogram Perturbation for Explainable Speech-to-text Generation (SPES), a feature attribution technique applicable to sequence generation tasks with autoregressive models. SPES provides explanations for each predicted token based on both the input spectrogram and the previously generated tokens. Extensive evaluation on speech recognition and translation demonstrates that SPES generates explanations that are faithful and plausible to humans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ekaterina Artemova, Jason Lucas, Saranya Venkatraman, Jooyoung Lee, Sergei Tilga, Adaku Uchendu, Vladislav Mikhailov</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has increased the volume of machine-generated texts (MGTs) and blurred text authorship in various domains. However, most existing MGT benchmarks include single-author texts (human-written and machine-generated). This conventional design fails to capture more practical multi-author scenarios, where the user refines the LLM response for natural flow, coherence, and factual correctness. Our paper introduces the Benchmark of Expert-edited Machine-generated Outputs (Beemo), which includes 6.5k texts written by humans, generated by ten instruction-finetuned LLMs, and edited by experts for various use cases, ranging from creative writing to summarization. Beemo additionally comprises 13.1k machine-generated and LLM-edited texts, allowing for diverse MGT detection evaluation across various edit types. We document Beemo's creation protocol and present the results of benchmarking 33 configurations of MGT detectors in different experimental setups. We find that expert-based editing evades MGT detection, while LLM-edited texts are unlikely to be recognized as human-written. Beemo and all materials are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandra Butoi, Ghazal Khalighinejad, Anej Svete, Josef Valvoda, Ryan Cotterell, Brian DuSell</p>
<p>Abstract: Characterizing the computational power of neural network architectures in terms of formal language theory remains a crucial line of research, as it describes lower and upper bounds on the reasoning capabilities of modern AI. However, when empirically testing these bounds, existing work often leaves a discrepancy between experiments and the formal claims they are meant to support. The problem is that formal language theory pertains specifically to recognizers: machines that receive a string as input and classify whether it belongs to a language. On the other hand, it is common instead to evaluate language models on proxy tasks, e.g., language modeling or sequence-to-sequence transduction, that are similar in only an informal sense to the underlying theory. We correct this mismatch by training and evaluating neural networks directly as binary classifiers of strings, using a general method that can be applied to a wide variety of languages. As part of this, we extend an algorithm recently proposed by Sn{\ae}bjarnarson et al. (2025) for efficient length-controlled sampling of strings from regular languages. We provide results on a variety of languages across the Chomsky hierarchy for three neural architectures: a simple RNN, an LSTM, and a causally-masked transformer. We find that the RNN and LSTM often outperform the transformer, and that auxiliary training objectives such as language modeling can help, although no single objective uniformly improves performance across languages and architectures. Our contributions will facilitate theoretically sound empirical testing of language recognition claims in future work. We have released our datasets as a benchmark called FLaRe (Formal Language Recognition), along with our code.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-world enterprise text-to-SQL workflows often involve complex cloud or local data across various database systems, multiple SQL queries in various dialects, and diverse operations from data transformation to analytics. We introduce Spider 2.0, an evaluation framework comprising 632 real-world text-to-SQL workflow problems derived from enterprise-level database use cases. The databases in Spider 2.0 are sourced from real data applications, often containing over 1,000 columns and stored in local or cloud database systems such as BigQuery and Snowflake. We show that solving problems in Spider 2.0 frequently requires understanding and searching through database metadata, dialect documentation, and even project-level codebases. This challenge calls for models to interact with complex SQL workflow environments, process extremely long contexts, perform intricate reasoning, and generate multiple SQL queries with diverse operations, often exceeding 100 lines, which goes far beyond traditional text-to-SQL challenges. Our evaluations indicate that based on o1-preview, our code agent framework successfully solves only 21.3% of the tasks, compared with 91.2% on Spider 1.0 and 73.0% on BIRD. Our results on Spider 2.0 show that while language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in code generation -- especially in prior text-to-SQL benchmarks -- they require significant improvement in order to achieve adequate performance for real-world enterprise usage. Progress on Spider 2.0 represents crucial steps towards developing intelligent, autonomous, code agents for real-world enterprise settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Huang, Chong Chen, Conghui He, Yang Li, Jiawei Jiang, Wentao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world scenarios, most of the data obtained from information retrieval (IR) system is unstructured. Converting natural language sentences into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) remains a critical challenge. The quality of constructed KGs may also impact the performance of some KG-dependent domains like GraphRAG systems and recommendation systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in addressing a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, there are still challenges when utilizing LLMs to address the task of generating structured KGs. And we have identified three limitations with respect to existing KG construction methods. (1)There is a large amount of information and excessive noise in real-world documents, which could result in extracting messy information. (2)Native LLMs struggle to effectively extract accuracy knowledge from some domain-specific documents. (3)Hallucinations phenomenon cannot be overlooked when utilizing LLMs directly as an unsupervised method for constructing KGs.
  In this paper, we propose GraphJudger, a knowledge graph construction framework to address the aforementioned challenges. We introduce three innovative modules in our method, which are entity-centric iterative text denoising, knowledge aware instruction tuning and graph judgement, respectively. We seek to utilize the capacity of LLMs to function as a graph judger, a capability superior to their role only as a predictor for KG construction problems. Experiments conducted on two general text-graph pair datasets and one domain-specific text-graph pair dataset show superior performances compared to baseline methods. The code of our proposed method is available at https://github.com/hhy-huang/GraphJudger.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) gained immense popularity due to their impressive capabilities in unstructured conversations. Empowering LLMs with advanced prompting strategies such as reasoning and acting (ReAct) (Yao et al., 2022) has shown promise in solving complex tasks traditionally requiring reinforcement learning. In this work, we apply the ReAct strategy to guide LLMs performing task-oriented dialogue (TOD). We evaluate ReAct-based LLMs (ReAct-LLMs) both in simulation and with real users. While ReAct-LLMs severely underperform state-of-the-art approaches on success rate in simulation, this difference becomes less pronounced in human evaluation. Moreover, compared to the baseline, humans report higher subjective satisfaction with ReAct-LLM despite its lower success rate, most likely thanks to its natural and confidently phrased responses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Search is an ability foundational in many important tasks, and recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) struggle to perform search robustly. It is unknown whether this inability is due to a lack of data, insufficient model parameters, or fundamental limitations of the transformer architecture. In this work, we use the foundational graph connectivity problem as a testbed to generate effectively limitless high-coverage data to train small transformers and test whether they can learn to perform search. We find that, when given the right training distribution, the transformer is able to learn to search.
  We analyze the algorithm that the transformer has learned through a novel mechanistic interpretability technique that enables us to extract the computation graph from the trained model. We find that transformers perform search at every vertex in parallel: For each vertex in the input graph, transformers compute the set of vertices reachable from that vertex. Each layer then progressively expands these sets, allowing the model to search over a number of vertices exponential in $n_{\text{layers}}$.
  However, we find that as the input graph size increases, the transformer has greater difficulty in learning the task. This difficulty is not resolved even as the number of parameters is increased, suggesting that increasing model scale will not lead to robust search abilities. We also find that performing search in-context (i.e., chain-of-thought) does not resolve this inability to learn to search on larger graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Cheng, Xiao Liu, Cunxiang Wang, Xiaotao Gu, Yida Lu, Dan Zhang, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-following is a fundamental capability of language models, requiring the model to recognize even the most subtle requirements in the instructions and accurately reflect them in its output. Such an ability is well-suited for and often optimized by preference learning. However, existing methods often directly sample multiple independent responses from the model when creating preference pairs. Such practice can introduce content variations irrelevant to whether the instruction is precisely followed (e.g., different expressions about the same semantic), interfering with the goal of teaching models to recognize the key differences that lead to improved instruction following. In light of this, we introduce SPaR, a self-play framework integrating tree-search self-refinement to yield valid and comparable preference pairs free from distractions. By playing against itself, an LLM employs a tree-search strategy to refine its previous responses with respect to the instruction while minimizing unnecessary variations. Our experiments show that a LLaMA3-8B model, trained over three iterations guided by SPaR, surpasses GPT-4-Turbo on the IFEval benchmark without losing general capabilities. Furthermore, SPaR demonstrates promising scalability, greatly enhancing models like GLM-4-9B and LLaMA3-70B. We also identify how inference scaling in tree search would impact model performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheqi Lv, Wenkai Wang, Jiawei Wang, Shengyu Zhang, Fei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (EMLLMs) can improve performance through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but they have poor self-evaluation capabilities during the CoT reasoning process. This is due to their tendency to simplify the reasoning process and the degradation of self-evaluation ability during downstream task fine-tuning. To address this, we intuitively propose \textit{Self-Evaluation Augmented Training (SEAT)}, which uses more powerful EMLLMs to evaluate CoT reasoning data. The evaluation data is then used to train EMLLMs. However, due to the difficulties EMLLMs face with processing long token input-output sequences, and the degradation of self-evaluation ability as a basis for CoT reasoning, the SEAT method is not fully adapted. Therefore, we further propose \textit{Cascaded Self-Evaluation Augmented Training (Cas-SEAT)}, which converts long prompts into cascaded short prompts, each focusing on a specific task. Additionally, we mix CoT reasoning and self-evaluation data to preserve its CoT reasoning ability while enhancing the self-evaluation capability of EMLLMs. We also conduct \textit{Double-level Data Filtering (DDF)}, which includes source data filtering and labeled data filtering, using both manual selection and MLLMs for filtering. Cas-SEAT and DDF work together to improve the performance of EMLLMs. Experiments show that Cas-SEAT achieves an average improvement of 22.16% across multiple datasets, and DDF significantly reduces the resource consumption of training</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaustubh D. Dhole</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation equips large language models with the capability to retrieve external knowledge, thereby mitigating hallucinations by incorporating information beyond the model's intrinsic abilities. However, most prior works have focused on invoking retrieval deterministically, which makes it unsuitable for tasks such as long-form question answering. Instead, dynamically performing retrieval by invoking it only when the underlying LLM lacks the required knowledge can be more efficient. In this context, we delve deeper into the question, "To Retrieve or Not to Retrieve?" by exploring multiple uncertainty detection methods. We evaluate these methods for the task of long-form question answering, employing dynamic retrieval, and present our comparisons. Our findings suggest that uncertainty detection metrics, such as Degree Matrix Jaccard and Eccentricity, can reduce the number of retrieval calls by almost half, with only a slight reduction in question-answering accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent studies have raised concerns about the reliability of current mathematical benchmarks, highlighting issues such as simplistic design and potential data contamination. Therefore, creating a reliable benchmark that effectively evaluates the genuine capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose RV-Bench, a framework for Benchmarking LLMs via Random Variables in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, the background content of a random variable question (RV question) mirrors the original problem in existing benchmarks, but the variable combinations are randomized, making it "unseen" by the LLMs. Models must completely understand the question pattern of the original problem to correctly answer RV questions with various variable values. As a result, the LLM's genuine capability in mathematical reasoning is reflected by its accuracy and robustness on RV-Bench. We conducted extensive experiments on over 30 representative LLMs across more than 1000 RV questions. Our findings suggest that LLMs exhibit an imbalance in proficiency between encountered and "unseen" data domains. Proficiency generalization across similar mathematical reasoning tasks is verified to be limited by accuracy and robustness, but it can still be enhanced through test-time scaling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) provide a new opportunity to address the long-standing question of how concepts are represented and organized in the mind, which is central to unravelling the nature of human cognition. Here, we reframed the classic reverse dictionary task to simulate human concept inference in context and investigated the emergence of human-like conceptual representations within LLMs. We found that LLMs were able to infer concepts from definitional descriptions and construct representation spaces that converge towards a shared, context-independent structure. These representations effectively predicted human behavioural judgments and aligned well with neural activity patterns in the human brain, offering evidence for biological plausibility. These findings demonstrate that human-like conceptual representations and organization can naturally emerge from language prediction, even without real-world grounding. Our work supports the view that LLMs serve as valuable tools for understanding complex human cognition and paves the way for better alignment between artificial and human intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: In designing multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in education, creating plausible distractors is crucial for identifying students' misconceptions and gaps in knowledge and accurately assessing their understanding. However, prior studies on distractor generation have not paid sufficient attention to enhancing the difficulty of distractors, resulting in reduced effectiveness of MCQs. This study presents a pipeline for training a model to generate distractors that are more likely to be selected by students. First, we train a pairwise ranker to reason about students' misconceptions and assess the relative plausibility of two distractors. Using this model, we create a dataset of pairwise distractor ranks and then train a distractor generator via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to generate more plausible distractors. Experiments on computer science subjects (Python, DB, MLDL) demonstrate that our pairwise ranker effectively identifies students' potential misunderstandings and achieves ranking accuracy comparable to human experts. Furthermore, our distractor generator outperforms several baselines in generating plausible distractors and produces questions with a higher item discrimination index (DI).</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly recognized for their exceptional generative capabilities and versatility across various tasks. However, the high inference costs associated with these models have not received adequate attention, particularly when compared to the focus on training costs in existing research. In response to this gap, our study conducts a comprehensive benchmarking of LLM inference energy across a wide range of NLP tasks, where we analyze the impact of different models, tasks, prompts, and system-related factors on inference energy. Specifically, our experiments reveal several interesting insights, including strong correlation of inference energy with output token length and response time. Also, we find that quantization and optimal batch sizes, along with targeted prompt phrases, can significantly reduce energy usage. This study is the first to thoroughly benchmark LLM inference across such a diverse range of aspects, providing insights and offering several recommendations for improving energy efficiency in model deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingze Zhang, Ellie Pavlick</p>
<p>Abstract: An increasingly common practice is to train large language models (LLMs) using synthetic data. Often this synthetic data is produced by the same or similar LLMs as those it is being used to train. This raises the question of whether the synthetic data might in fact exacerbate certain "blindspots" by reinforcing heuristics that the LLM already encodes. In this paper, we conduct simulated experiments on the natural language inference (NLI) task with Llama-2-7B-hf models. We use MultiNLI as the general task and HANS, a targeted evaluation set designed to measure the presence of specific heuristic strategies for NLI, as our "blindspot" task. Our goal is to determine whether performance disparities between the general and blind spot tasks emerge. Our results indicate that synthetic data does not reinforce blindspots in the way we expected. Specifically, we see that, while fine-tuning with synthetic data doesn't necessarily reduce the use of the heuristic, it also does not make it worse as we hypothesized.</p>

These datasets offer a strong basis for evaluating user profile modeling techniques in dynamic settings. We also show a methodology that uses large language models (LLMs) to tackle both profile construction and updating. Our method uses a probabilistic framework to predict user profiles from input text, allowing for precise and context-aware profile generation. Our experiments demonstrate that models like Mistral-7b and Llama2-7b perform strongly in both tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> George Drayson, Vasileios Lampos</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their generated outputs are proliferating across the web, risking a future where machine-generated content dilutes human-authored text. Since online data is the primary resource for LLM pre-training, subsequent models could be trained on an unknown portion of synthetic samples. This will lead to model collapse, a degenerative process whereby LLMs reinforce their own errors, and ultimately yield a declining performance. In this study, we investigate the impact of decoding strategy on model collapse, analysing the characteristics of text at each model generation, the similarity to human references, and the resulting model performance. Using the decoding strategies that lead to the most significant degradation, we evaluate model collapse in more realistic scenarios where the origin of the data (human or synthetic) is unknown. We train a machine-generated text detector and propose an importance sampling approach to alleviate model collapse. Our method is validated on two LLM variants (GPT-2 and SmolLM2) on the open-ended text generation task. We demonstrate that it can not only prevent model collapse but also improve performance when sufficient human-authored samples are present.</p>

<p>Abstract: Providing Large Language Models with relevant contextual knowledge at inference time has been shown to greatly improve the quality of their generations. This is often achieved by prepending informative passages of text, or 'contexts', retrieved from external knowledge bases to their input. However, processing additional contexts online incurs significant computation costs that scale with their length. State Space Models (SSMs) offer a promising solution by allowing a database of contexts to be mapped onto fixed-dimensional states from which to start the generation. A key challenge arises when attempting to leverage information present across multiple contexts, since there is no straightforward way to condition generation on multiple independent states in existing SSMs. To address this, we leverage a simple mathematical relation derived from SSM dynamics to compose multiple states into one that efficiently approximates the effect of concatenating raw context tokens. Since the temporal ordering of contexts can often be uninformative, we enforce permutation-invariance by efficiently averaging states obtained via our composition algorithm across all possible context orderings. We evaluate our resulting method on WikiText and MSMARCO in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and show that we can match the strongest performing baseline while enjoying on average 5.4x speedup.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianghao Chen, Zhenlin Wei, Zhenjiang Ren, Ziyong Li, Jiajun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in o1-like models has significantly enhanced the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), empowering them to tackle increasingly complex tasks through reflection capabilities, such as making assumptions, backtracking, and self-refinement. However, effectively evaluating such reflection capabilities remains challenging due to the lack of appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce LR$^2$Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the Long-chain Reflective Reasoning capabilities of LLMs. LR$^2$Bench comprises 850 samples across six Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) where reflective reasoning is crucial for deriving solutions that meet all given constraints. Each type of task focuses on distinct constraint patterns, such as knowledge-based, logical, and spatial constraints, providing a comprehensive evaluation of diverse problem-solving scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluation on both conventional models and o1-like models. Our experimental results reveal that even the most advanced reasoning-specific models, such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1-preview, struggle with tasks in LR$^2$Bench, achieving an average Exact Match score of only 20.0% and 23.6%, respectively. These findings underscore the significant room for improvement in the reflective reasoning capabilities of current LLMs. The leaderboard of our benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/UltraRonin/LR2Bench</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taishi Nakamura, Takuya Akiba, Kazuki Fujii, Yusuke Oda, Rio Yokota, Jun Suzuki</p>
<p>Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture reduces the training and inference cost significantly compared to a dense model of equivalent capacity. Upcycling is an approach that initializes and trains an MoE model using a pre-trained dense model. While upcycling leads to initial performance gains, the training progresses slower than when trained from scratch, leading to suboptimal performance in the long term. We propose Drop-Upcycling - a method that effectively addresses this problem. Drop-Upcycling combines two seemingly contradictory approaches: utilizing the knowledge of pre-trained dense models while statistically re-initializing some parts of the weights. This approach strategically promotes expert specialization, significantly enhancing the MoE model's efficiency in knowledge acquisition. Extensive large-scale experiments demonstrate that Drop-Upcycling significantly outperforms previous MoE construction methods in the long term, specifically when training on hundreds of billions of tokens or more. As a result, our MoE model with 5.9B active parameters achieves comparable performance to a 13B dense model in the same model family, while requiring approximately 1/4 of the training FLOPs. All experimental resources, including source code, training data, model checkpoints and logs, are publicly available to promote reproducibility and future research on MoE.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of 22 large language models LLMs on the Spanish Medical Intern Resident MIR examinations for 2024 and 2025 with a focus on clinical reasoning domain specific expertise and multimodal processing capabilities The MIR exam consisting of 210 multiple choice questions some requiring image interpretation serves as a stringent benchmark for assessing both factual recall and complex clinical problem solving skills Our investigation encompasses general purpose models such as GPT4 Claude LLaMA and Gemini as well as specialized fine tuned systems like Miri Pro which leverages proprietary Spanish healthcare data to excel in medical contexts
  Recent market entries Deepseek and Grok have further enriched the evaluation landscape particularly for tasks that demand advanced visual and semantic analysis The findings indicate that while general purpose LLMs perform robustly overall fine tuned models consistently achieve superior accuracy especially in addressing nuanced domain specific challenges A modest performance decline observed between the two exam cycles appears attributable to the implementation of modified questions designed to mitigate reliance on memorization
  The results underscore the transformative potential of domain specific fine tuning and multimodal integration in advancing medical AI applications They also highlight critical implications for the future integration of LLMs into medical education training and clinical decision making emphasizing the importance of balancing automated reasoning with ethical and context aware judgment</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowen Pan, Xiaozhi Wang, Yixin Cao, Zenglin Shi, Xun Yang, Juanzi Li, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to update outdated information in Large Language Models (LLMs). A representative line of study is locate-then-edit methods, which typically employ causal tracing to identify the modules responsible for recalling factual knowledge about entities. However, we find these methods are often sensitive only to changes in the subject entity, leaving them less effective at adapting to changes in relations. This limitation results in poor editing locality, which can lead to the persistence of irrelevant or inaccurate facts, ultimately compromising the reliability of LLMs. We believe this issue arises from the insufficient precision of knowledge localization. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Neuron-level Knowledge Editing (FiNE) method that enhances editing locality without affecting overall success rates. By precisely identifying and modifying specific neurons within feed-forward networks, FiNE significantly improves knowledge localization and editing. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that FiNE efficiently achieves better overall performance compared to existing techniques, providing new insights into the localization and modification of knowledge within LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Ponce, Thierry Etchegoyhen</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction following is a critical ability for Large Language Models to perform downstream tasks. The standard approach to instruction alignment has relied on a specific phase of model tuning over curated instruction datasets, optionally complemented with an alignment step over human preferences. Recent work has shown the potential of in-context learning (ICL) alternatives to guide base models towards instruction following. This type of approach is particularly relevant to extend instruction following across languages and models of varying sizes adapted to different types of usage. In this work we compare ICL and instruction fine-tuning in English, French and Spanish, on Small Language Models, and provide experimental results on applying Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) over base models. Our results show that scenarios involving multilingual and smaller models result in downgraded ICL instruction following performance, only partially mitigated by DPO alignment. This study aims to further our understanding of current strengths and limitations of alternative methods for instruction following.</p>

<p>Abstract: Causal reasoning and compositional reasoning are two core aspirations in generative AI. Measuring the extent of these behaviors requires principled evaluation methods. We explore a unified perspective that considers both behaviors simultaneously, termed compositional causal reasoning (CCR): the ability to infer how causal measures compose and, equivalently, how causal quantities propagate through graphs. We instantiate a framework for the systematic evaluation of CCR for the average treatment effect and the probability of necessity and sufficiency. As proof of concept, we demonstrate the design of CCR tasks for language models in the LLama, Phi, and GPT families. On a math word problem, our framework revealed a range of taxonomically distinct error patterns. Additionally, CCR errors increased with the complexity of causal paths for all models except o1.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijie Xu, Aiwei Liu, Xuming Hu, Lijie Wen, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: As open-source large language models (LLMs) like Llama3 become more capable, it is crucial to develop watermarking techniques to detect their potential misuse. Existing watermarking methods either add watermarks during LLM inference, which is unsuitable for open-source LLMs, or primarily target classification LLMs rather than recent generative LLMs. Adapting these watermarks to open-source LLMs for misuse detection remains an open challenge. This work defines two misuse scenarios for open-source LLMs: intellectual property (IP) violation and LLM Usage Violation. Then, we explore the application of inference-time watermark distillation and backdoor watermarking in these contexts. We propose comprehensive evaluation methods to assess the impact of various real-world further fine-tuning scenarios on watermarks and the effect of these watermarks on LLM performance. Our experiments reveal that backdoor watermarking could effectively detect IP Violation, while inference-time watermark distillation is applicable in both scenarios but less robust to further fine-tuning and has a more significant impact on LLM performance compared to backdoor watermarking. Exploring more advanced watermarking methods for open-source LLMs to detect their misuse should be an important future direction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hank Gerba</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI promises to finally realize dynamic, personalized storytelling technologies across a range of media. To date, experimentation with generative AI in the field of procedural narrative generation has been quite promising from a technical perspective. However, fundamental narrative dilemmas remain, such as the balance between player agency and narrative coherence, and no rigorous narrative standard has been proposed to specifically leverage the strengths of generative AI. In this paper, we propose the Universal Narrative Model (UNM), an open and extensible standard designed to place writers at the center of future narrative design workflows and enable interoperability across authoring platforms. By encoding an author's intent according to an objective narrative model, the UNM enables narrative portability as well as intent-based constraints for generative systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The challenge of reducing the size of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining their performance has gained significant attention. However, existing methods, such as model distillation and transfer learning, often fail to achieve high accuracy. To address this limitation, we introduce the Branch-Merge distillation approach, which enhances model compression through two phases: (1) the Branch Phase, where knowledge from a large teacher model is \textit{selectively distilled} into specialized student models via domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT); And (2) the Merge Phase, where these student models are merged to enable cross-domain knowledge transfer and improve generalization. We validate our distillation approach using DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B as the student. The resulting merged model, TinyR1-32B-Preview, outperforms its counterpart DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks, including Mathematics (+5.5 points), Coding (+4.4 points) and Science (+2.9 points), while achieving near-equal performance to DeepSeek-R1 on AIME 2024. The Branch-Merge distillation approach provides a scalable solution for creating smaller, high-performing LLMs with reduced computational cost and time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanjun Chen, Yirong Sun, Xinghao Chen, Jian Wang, Xiaoyu Shen, Wenjie Li, Wei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has proven effective in natural language tasks but remains underexplored in multimodal alignment. This study investigates its integration into 3D vision-language learning by embedding structured reasoning into alignment training. We introduce the 3D-CoT Benchmark, a dataset with hierarchical CoT annotations covering shape recognition, functional inference, and causal reasoning. Through controlled experiments, we compare CoT-structured and standard textual annotations across large reasoning models (LRMs) and large language models (LLMs). Our evaluation employs a dual-layer framework assessing both intermediate reasoning and final inference quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoT significantly improves 3D semantic grounding, with LRMs leveraging CoT more effectively than LLMs. Furthermore, we highlight that annotation structure influences performance-explicit reasoning markers aid LLMs, while unmarked CoT better aligns with LRM inference patterns. Our analyses suggest that CoT is crucial for enhancing multimodal reasoning, with implications beyond 3D tasks.

<p>Abstract: We present NSF-SciFy, a large-scale dataset for scientific claim extraction derived from the National Science Foundation (NSF) awards database, comprising over 400K grant abstracts spanning five decades. While previous datasets relied on published literature, we leverage grant abstracts which offer a unique advantage: they capture claims at an earlier stage in the research lifecycle before publication takes effect. We also introduce a new task to distinguish between existing scientific claims and aspirational research intentions in proposals. Using zero-shot prompting with frontier large language models, we jointly extract 114K scientific claims and 145K investigation proposals from 16K grant abstracts in the materials science domain to create a focused subset called NSF-SciFy-MatSci. We use this dataset to evaluate 3 three key tasks: (1) technical to non-technical abstract generation, where models achieve high BERTScore (0.85+ F1); (2) scientific claim extraction, where fine-tuned models outperform base models by 100% relative improvement; and (3) investigation proposal extraction, showing 90%+ improvement with fine-tuning. We introduce novel LLM-based evaluation metrics for robust assessment of claim/proposal extraction quality. As the largest scientific claim dataset to date -- with an estimated 2.8 million claims across all STEM disciplines funded by the NSF -- NSF-SciFy enables new opportunities for claim verification and meta-scientific research. We publicly release all datasets, trained models, and evaluation code to facilitate further research.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the current literature, most embedding models are based on the encoder-only transformer architecture to extract a dense and meaningful representation of the given input, which can be a text, an image, and more. With the recent advances in language modeling thanks to the introduction of Large Language Models, the possibility of extracting embeddings from these large and extensively trained models has been explored. However, current studies focus on textual embeddings in English, which is also the main language on which these models have been trained. Furthermore, there are very few models that consider multimodal and multilingual input. In light of this, we propose an adaptation methodology for Large Vision-Language Models trained on English language data to improve their performance in extracting multilingual and multimodal embeddings. Finally, we design and introduce a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of multilingual and multimodal embedding models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kourosh Shahnazari, Seyed Moein Ayyoubzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: In personalized technology and psychological research, precisely detecting demographic features and personality traits from digital interactions becomes ever more important. This work investigates implicit categorization, inferring personality and gender variables directly from linguistic patterns in Telegram conversation data, while conventional personality prediction techniques mostly depend on explicitly self-reported labels. We refine a Transformer-based language model (RoBERTa) to capture complex linguistic cues indicative of personality traits and gender differences using a dataset comprising 138,866 messages from 1,602 users annotated with MBTI types and 195,016 messages from 2,598 users annotated with gender. Confidence levels help to greatly raise model accuracy to 86.16\%, hence proving RoBERTa's capacity to consistently identify implicit personality types from conversational text data. Our results highlight the usefulness of Transformer topologies for implicit personality and gender classification, hence stressing their efficiency and stressing important trade-offs between accuracy and coverage in realistic conversational environments. With regard to gender classification, the model obtained an accuracy of 74.4\%, therefore capturing gender-specific language patterns. Personality dimension analysis showed that people with introverted and intuitive preferences are especially more active in text-based interactions. This study emphasizes practical issues in balancing accuracy and data coverage as Transformer-based models show their efficiency in implicit personality and gender prediction tasks from conversational texts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning techniques have conquered many different tasks in speech and natural language processing, such as speech recognition, information extraction, text and speech generation, and human machine interaction using natural language or speech (chatbots). Modern techniques typically rely on large models for representing general knowledge of one or several languages (Large Language Models, LLMs), or for representing speech and general audio characteristics. These models have been trained with large amounts of speech and language data, typically including web content. When humans interact with such technologies, the effectiveness of the interaction will be influenced by how far humans make use of the same type of language the models have been trained on or, in other words, if the models are able to generalize to the language used by humans when interacting with the technology. This may lead to some gradual forms of adaptation in human speech and language production, and users who do not adapt may be excluded from efficient use of such technologies. On top of this, as commercial model development follows market needs, under-represented languages and dialects/sociolects may decrease in terms of priorities. Furthermore, for many lesser spoken languages the necessary data is not available, which will worsen a digital divide in speech and language technology usage. The workshop sets out to discuss this problem based on scientific contributions from the perspective of computer science and linguistics (including computational linguistics and NLP).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andy Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting large language models to multiple tasks can cause cross-skill interference, where improvements for one skill degrade another. While methods such as LoRA impose orthogonality constraints at the weight level, they do not fully address interference in hidden-state representations. We propose Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning (CS-ReFT), a novel representation-based approach that learns multiple orthonormal subspace transformations, each specializing in a distinct skill, and composes them via a lightweight router. By isolating these subspace edits in the hidden state, rather than weight matrices, CS-ReFT prevents cross-task conflicts more effectively. On the AlpacaEval benchmark, applying CS-ReFT to Llama-2-7B achieves a 93.94% win rate, surpassing GPT-3.5 Turbo (86.30%) while requiring only 0.0098% of model parameters. These findings show that specialized representation edits, composed via a simple router, significantly enhance multi-task instruction following with minimal overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained significant attention in recent years for its potential to enhance natural language understanding and generation by combining large-scale retrieval systems with generative models. RAG leverages external knowledge sources, such as documents, databases, or structured data, to improve model performance and generate more accurate and contextually relevant outputs. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of RAG by examining its fundamental components, including retrieval mechanisms, generation processes, and the integration between the two. We discuss the key characteristics of RAG, such as its ability to augment generative models with dynamic external knowledge, and the challenges associated with aligning retrieved information with generative objectives. We also present a taxonomy that categorizes RAG methods, ranging from basic retrieval-augmented approaches to more advanced models incorporating multi-modal data and reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we review the evaluation benchmarks and datasets commonly used to assess RAG systems, along with a detailed exploration of its applications in fields such as question answering, summarization, and information retrieval. Finally, we highlight emerging research directions and opportunities for improving RAG systems, such as enhanced retrieval efficiency, model interpretability, and domain-specific adaptations. This paper concludes by outlining the prospects for RAG in addressing real-world challenges and its potential to drive further advancements in natural language processing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with remarkable conversational capability, have emerged as AI assistants that can handle both visual and textual modalities. However, their effectiveness in joint video and language understanding has not been extensively explored. In the paper, we introduce Valley, a multi-modal foundation model that is designed to enable enhanced video comprehension and instruction-following capabilities. To this end, we construct two datasets, namely Valley-702k and Valley-instruct-73k, to cover a diverse range of video-text alignment and video-based instruction tasks, such as multi-shot captions, long video descriptions, action recognition, causal inference, etc. Then, we adopt ViT-L/14 as the vision encoder and explore three different temporal modeling modules to learn multifaceted features for enhanced video understanding. In addition, we implement a two-phase training approach for Valley: the first phase focuses solely on training the projection module to facilitate the LLM's capacity to understand visual input, and the second phase jointly trains the projection module and the LLM to improve their instruction following ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Valley has the potential to serve as an effective video assistant, simplifying complex video-understanding scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Payam Jome Yazdian, Rachel Lagasse, Hamid Mohammadi, Eric Liu, Li Cheng, Angelica Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce MotionScript, a novel framework for generating highly detailed, natural language descriptions of 3D human motions. Unlike existing motion datasets that rely on broad action labels or generic captions, MotionScript provides fine-grained, structured descriptions that capture the full complexity of human movement including expressive actions (e.g., emotions, stylistic walking) and interactions beyond standard motion capture datasets. MotionScript serves as both a descriptive tool and a training resource for text-to-motion models, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and diverse human motions from text. By augmenting motion datasets with MotionScript captions, we demonstrate significant improvements in out-of-distribution motion generation, allowing large language models (LLMs) to generate motions that extend beyond existing data. Additionally, MotionScript opens new applications in animation, virtual human simulation, and robotics, providing an interpretable bridge between intuitive descriptions and motion synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically translate 3D motion into structured natural language without requiring training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranab Sahoo, Ayush Kumar Singh, Sriparna Saha, Vinija Jain, Samrat Mondal, Aman Chadha</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt engineering has emerged as an indispensable technique for extending the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). This approach leverages task-specific instructions, known as prompts, to enhance model efficacy without modifying the core model parameters. Rather than updating the model parameters, prompts allow seamless integration of pre-trained models into downstream tasks by eliciting desired model behaviors solely based on the given prompt. Prompts can be natural language instructions that provide context to guide the model or learned vector representations that activate relevant knowledge. This burgeoning field has enabled success across various applications, from question-answering to commonsense reasoning. However, there remains a lack of systematic organization and understanding of the diverse prompt engineering methods and techniques. This survey paper addresses the gap by providing a structured overview of recent advancements in prompt engineering, categorized by application area. For each prompting approach, we provide a summary detailing the prompting methodology, its applications, the models involved, and the datasets utilized. We also delve into the strengths and limitations of each approach and include a taxonomy diagram and table summarizing datasets, models, and critical points of each prompting technique. This systematic analysis enables a better understanding of this rapidly developing field and facilitates future research by illuminating open challenges and opportunities for prompt engineering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Chen, Zihan Wang, Ran Tao, Hongxin Wei, Xing Xie, Masashi Sugiyama, Bhiksha Raj, Jindong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models are usually pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then adapted to downstream tasks through tuning. However, the large-scale pre-training datasets, often inaccessible or too expensive to handle, can contain label noise that may adversely affect the generalization of the model and pose unexpected risks. This paper stands out as the first work to comprehensively understand and analyze the nature of noise in pre-training datasets and then effectively mitigate its impacts on downstream tasks. Specifically, through extensive experiments of fully-supervised and image-text contrastive pre-training on synthetic noisy ImageNet-1K, YFCC15M, and CC12M datasets, we demonstrate that, while slight noise in pre-training can benefit in-domain (ID) performance, where the training and testing data share a similar distribution, it always deteriorates out-of-domain (OOD) performance, where training and testing distributions are significantly different. These observations are agnostic to scales of pre-training datasets, pre-training noise types, model architectures, pre-training objectives, downstream tuning methods, and downstream applications. We empirically ascertain that the reason behind this is that the pre-training noise shapes the feature space differently. We then propose a tuning method (NMTune) to affine the feature space to mitigate the malignant effect of noise and improve generalization, which is applicable in both parameter-efficient and black-box tuning manners. We additionally conduct extensive experiments on popular vision and language models, including APIs, which are supervised and self-supervised pre-trained on realistic noisy data for evaluation. Our analysis and results demonstrate the importance of this novel and fundamental research direction, which we term as Noisy Model Learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nadav Timor, Jonathan Mamou, Daniel Korat, Moshe Berchansky, Oren Pereg, Moshe Wasserblat, Tomer Galanti, Michal Gordon, David Harel</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces distributed speculative inference (DSI), a novel inference algorithm that is provably faster than speculative inference (SI) [leviathan2023, chen2023, miao2024, sun2025, timor2025] and standard autoregressive inference (non-SI). Like other SI algorithms, DSI operates on frozen language models (LMs), requiring no training or architectural modifications, and it preserves the target distribution. Prior studies on SI have demonstrated empirical speedups over non-SI--but rely on sufficiently fast and accurate drafters, which are often unavailable in practice. We identify a gap where SI can be slower than non-SI if drafters are too slow or inaccurate. We close this gap by proving that DSI is faster than both SI and non-SI--given any drafters. DSI is therefore not only faster than SI, but also unlocks the acceleration of LMs for which SI fails. DSI leverages speculation parallelism (SP), a novel type of task parallelism, to orchestrate target and drafter instances that overlap in time, establishing a new foundational tradeoff between computational resources and latency. Our simulations show that DSI is 1.29-1.92x faster than SI in single-node setups for various off-the-shelf LMs and tasks. We open-source all our code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgios Efstathiadis, Vijay Yadav, Anzar Abbas</p>
<p>Abstract: Speaker diarization is necessary for interpreting conversations transcribed using automated speech recognition (ASR) tools. Despite significant developments in diarization methods, diarization accuracy remains an issue. Here, we investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) for diarization correction as a post-processing step. LLMs were fine-tuned using the Fisher corpus, a large dataset of transcribed conversations. The ability of the models to improve diarization accuracy in a holdout dataset from the Fisher corpus as well as an independent dataset was measured. We report that fine-tuned LLMs can markedly improve diarization accuracy. However, model performance is constrained to transcripts produced using the same ASR tool as the transcripts used for fine-tuning, limiting generalizability. To address this constraint, an ensemble model was developed by combining weights from three separate models, each fine-tuned using transcripts from a different ASR tool. The ensemble model demonstrated better overall performance than each of the ASR-specific models, suggesting that a generalizable and ASR-agnostic approach may be achievable. We have made the weights of these models publicly available on HuggingFace at https://huggingface.co/bklynhlth.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language model-driven autonomous agents have revealed that multi-agent collaboration often surpasses each individual through collective reasoning. Inspired by the neural scaling law--increasing neurons enhances performance, this study explores whether the continuous addition of collaborative agents can yield similar benefits. Technically, we utilize directed acyclic graphs to organize agents into a multi-agent collaboration network (MacNet), upon which their interactive reasoning is topologically orchestrated for autonomous task solving. Extensive evaluations reveal that it effectively supports collaboration among over a thousand agents, with irregular topologies outperforming regular ones. We also identify a collaborative scaling law--the overall performance follows a logistic growth pattern as agents scale, with collaborative emergence occurring earlier than traditional neural emergence. We speculate this may be because scaling agents catalyzes their multidimensional considerations during interactive reflection and refinement, thereby producing more comprehensive artifacts.

<p>Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability (MI) is an emerging sub-field of interpretability that seeks to understand a neural network model by reverse-engineering its internal computations. Recently, MI has garnered significant attention for interpreting transformer-based language models (LMs), resulting in many novel insights yet introducing new challenges. However, there has not been work that comprehensively reviews these insights and challenges, particularly as a guide for newcomers to this field. To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey from a task-centric perspective, organizing the taxonomy of MI research around specific research questions or tasks. We outline the fundamental objects of study in MI, along with the techniques, evaluation methods, and key findings for each task in the taxonomy. In particular, we present a task-centric taxonomy as a roadmap for beginners to navigate the field by helping them quickly identify impactful problems in which they are most interested and leverage MI for their benefit. Finally, we discuss the current gaps in the field and suggest potential future directions for MI research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arinbjorn Kolbeinsson, Kyle O'Brien, Tianjin Huang, Shanghua Gao, Shiwei Liu, Jonathan Richard Schwarz, Anurag Vaidya, Faisal Mahmood, Marinka Zitnik, Tianlong Chen, Thomas Hartvigsen</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time interventions for language models can enhance factual accuracy, mitigate harmful outputs, and improve model efficiency without costly retraining. But despite a flood of new methods, different types of interventions are largely developing independently. In practice, multiple interventions must be applied sequentially to the same model, yet we lack standardized ways to study how interventions interact. We fill this gap by introducing composable interventions, a framework to study the effects of using multiple interventions on the same language models, featuring new metrics and a unified codebase. Using our framework, we conduct extensive experiments and compose popular methods from three emerging intervention categories -- Knowledge Editing, Model Compression, and Machine Unlearning. Our results from 310 different compositions uncover meaningful interactions: compression hinders editing and unlearning, composing interventions hinges on their order of application, and popular general-purpose metrics are inadequate for assessing composability. Taken together, our findings showcase clear gaps in composability, suggesting a need for new multi-objective interventions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danfeng Guo, Demetri Terzopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant success in recent years, and they have been extended to the medical domain. Although demonstrating satisfactory performance on medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, Medical LVLMs (MLVLMs) suffer from the hallucination problem, which makes them fail to diagnose complex pathologies. Moreover, they readily fail to learn minority pathologies due to imbalanced training data. We propose two prompting strategies for MLVLMs that reduce hallucination and improve VQA performance. In the first strategy, we provide a detailed explanation of the queried pathology. In the second strategy, we fine-tune a cheap, weak learner to achieve high performance on a specific metric, and textually provide its judgment to the MLVLM. Tested on the MIMIC-CXR-JPG and Chexpert datasets, our methods significantly improve the diagnostic F1 score, with the highest increase being 0.27. We also demonstrate that our prompting strategies can be extended to general LVLM domains. Based on POPE metrics, it effectively suppresses the false negative predictions of existing LVLMs and improves Recall by approximately 0.07.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moussa Koulako Bala Doumbouya, Ananjan Nandi, Gabriel Poesia, Davide Ghilardi, Anna Goldie, Federico Bianchi, Dan Jurafsky, Christopher D. Manning</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their demonstrated valuable capabilities, state-of-the-art (SOTA) widely deployed large language models (LLMs) still have the potential to cause harm to society due to the ineffectiveness of their safety filters, which can be bypassed by prompt transformations called jailbreak attacks. Current approaches to LLM safety assessment, which employ datasets of templated prompts and benchmarking pipelines, fail to cover sufficiently large and diverse sets of jailbreak attacks, leading to the widespread deployment of unsafe LLMs. Recent research showed that novel jailbreak attacks could be derived by composition; however, a formal composable representation for jailbreak attacks, which, among other benefits, could enable the exploration of a large compositional space of jailbreak attacks through program synthesis methods, has not been previously proposed. We introduce h4rm3l, a novel approach that addresses this gap with a human-readable domain-specific language (DSL). Our framework comprises: (1) The h4rm3l DSL, which formally expresses jailbreak attacks as compositions of parameterized string transformation primitives. (2) A synthesizer with bandit algorithms that efficiently generates jailbreak attacks optimized for a target black box LLM. (3) The h4rm3l red-teaming software toolkit that employs the previous two components and an automated harmful LLM behavior classifier that is strongly aligned with human judgment. We demonstrate h4rm3l's efficacy by synthesizing a dataset of 2656 successful novel jailbreak attacks targeting 6 SOTA open-source and proprietary LLMs, and by benchmarking those models against a subset of these synthesized attacks. Our results show that h4rm3l's synthesized attacks are diverse and more successful than existing jailbreak attacks in literature, with success rates exceeding 90% on SOTA LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungmin Cha, Sungjun Cho, Dasol Hwang, Moontae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning and memorization capabilities via pretraining on massive textual corpora. However, this poses risk of privacy and copyright violations, highlighting the need for efficient machine unlearning methods that remove sensitive data without retraining from scratch. While Gradient Ascent (GA) is commonly used to unlearn by reducing the likelihood of generating unwanted content, it leads to unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting of retrained knowledge. We find that combining GA with low-rank adaptation results in poor trade-offs between computational cost and generative performance. To address these challenges, we propose two novel techniques for robust and efficient unlearning for LLMs. First, we introduce Inverted Hinge Loss, which suppresses unwanted tokens while maintaining fluency by boosting the probability of the next most likely token. Second, we develop a data-adaptive initialization for LoRA adapters via low-rank approximation weighted with relative Fisher information, thereby focusing updates on parameters critical for removing targeted knowledge. Experiments on the Training Data Extraction Challenge dataset using GPT-Neo models as well as on the TOFU benchmark with Phi-1.5B and Llama2-7B models demonstrate that our approach effectively removes sensitive information while maintaining reasoning and generative capabilities with minimal impact. Our implementation can be found in https://github.com/csm9493/efficient-llm-unlearning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atharva Naik, Marcus Alenius, Daniel Fried, Carolyn Rose</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of automated code review has recently gained a lot of attention from the machine learning community. However, current review comment evaluation metrics rely on comparisons with a human-written reference for a given code change (also called a diff). Furthermore, code review is a one-to-many problem, like generation and summarization, with many "valid reviews" for a diff. Thus, we develop CRScore - a reference-free metric to measure dimensions of review quality like conciseness, comprehensiveness, and relevance. We design CRScore to evaluate reviews in a way that is grounded in claims and potential issues detected in the code by LLMs and static analyzers. We demonstrate that CRScore can produce valid, fine-grained scores of review quality that have the greatest alignment with human judgment among open source metrics (0.54 Spearman correlation) and are more sensitive than reference-based metrics. We also release a corpus of 2.9k human-annotated review quality scores for machine-generated and GitHub review comments to support the development of automated metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Lan, Philip Torr, Austin Meek, Ashkan Khakzar, David Krueger, Fazl Barez</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate feature universality in large language models (LLMs), a research field that aims to understand how different models similarly represent concepts in the latent spaces of their intermediate layers. Demonstrating feature universality allows discoveries about latent representations to generalize across several models. However, comparing features across LLMs is challenging due to polysemanticity, in which individual neurons often correspond to multiple features rather than distinct ones, making it difficult to disentangle and match features across different models. To address this issue, we employ a method known as dictionary learning by using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to transform LLM activations into more interpretable spaces spanned by neurons corresponding to individual features. After matching feature neurons across models via activation correlation, we apply representational space similarity metrics on SAE feature spaces across different LLMs. Our experiments reveal significant similarities in SAE feature spaces across various LLMs, providing new evidence for feature universality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are advancing the ability to reason about complex sports scenarios by integrating textual and visual information. To comprehensively evaluate their capabilities, we introduce SPORTU, a benchmark designed to assess MLLMs across multi-level sports reasoning tasks. SPORTU comprises two key components: SPORTU-text, featuring 900 multiple-choice questions with human-annotated explanations for rule comprehension and strategy understanding. This component focuses on testing models' ability to reason about sports solely through question-answering (QA), without requiring visual inputs; SPORTU-video, consisting of 1,701 slow-motion video clips across 7 different sports and 12,048 QA pairs, designed to assess multi-level reasoning, from simple sports recognition to complex tasks like foul detection and rule application. We evaluate four prevalent LLMs mainly utilizing few-shot learning paradigms supplemented by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on the SPORTU-text part. We evaluate four LLMs using few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on SPORTU-text. GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy of 71%, but still falls short of human-level performance, highlighting room for improvement in rule comprehension and reasoning. The evaluation for the SPORTU-video part includes 7 proprietary and 6 open-source MLLMs. Experiments show that models fall short on hard tasks that require deep reasoning and rule-based understanding. Claude-3.5-Sonnet performs the best with only 52.6% accuracy on the hard task, showing large room for improvement. We hope that SPORTU will serve as a critical step toward evaluating models' capabilities in sports understanding and reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyang Wang, Weilei He, Zhiyuan Liang, Xuchao Zhang, Chetan Bansal, Ying Wei, Weitong Zhang, Huaxiu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent self-rewarding large language models (LLM) have successfully applied LLM-as-a-Judge to iteratively improve the alignment performance without the need of human annotations for preference data. These methods commonly utilize the same LLM to act as both the policy model (which generates responses) and the reward model (which scores and ranks those responses). The ranked responses are then used as preference pairs to train the LLM via direct alignment technologies (e.g. DPO). However, it is noteworthy that throughout this process, there is no guarantee of accuracy in the rewarding and ranking, which is critical for ensuring accurate rewards and high-quality preference data. Empirical results from relatively small LLMs (e.g., 7B parameters) also indicate that improvements from self-rewarding may diminish after several iterations in certain situations, which we hypothesize is due to accumulated bias in the reward system. This bias can lead to unreliable preference data for training the LLM. To address this issue, we first formulate and analyze the generalized iterative preference fine-tuning framework for self-rewarding language model. We then introduce the regularization to this generalized framework to mitigate the overconfident preference labeling in the self-rewarding process. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose a Consistency Regularized sElf-rewarding lAnguage Model (CREAM) that leverages the consistency of rewards across different iterations to regularize the self-rewarding training, helping the model to learn from more reliable preference data. With this explicit regularization, our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of CREAM in improving both reward consistency and alignment performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yida Yin, Zekai Wang, Yuvan Sharma, Dantong Niu, Trevor Darrell, Roei Herzig</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success using in-context learning (ICL) in the language domain. However, leveraging the ICL capabilities within LLMs to directly predict robot actions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RoboPrompt, a framework that enables off-the-shelf text-only LLMs to directly predict robot actions through ICL without training. Our approach first heuristically identifies keyframes that capture important moments from an episode. Next, we extract end-effector actions from these keyframes as well as the estimated initial object poses, and both are converted into textual descriptions. Finally, we construct a structured template to form ICL demonstrations from these textual descriptions and a task instruction. This enables an LLM to directly predict robot actions at test time. Through extensive experiments and analysis, RoboPrompt shows stronger performance over zero-shot and ICL baselines in simulated and real-world settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Addison Kristanto Julistiono, Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Navid Azizan</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention mechanisms have revolutionized several domains of artificial intelligence, such as natural language processing and computer vision, by enabling models to selectively focus on relevant parts of the input data. While recent work has characterized the optimization dynamics of gradient descent (GD) in attention-based models and the structural properties of its preferred solutions, less is known about more general optimization algorithms such as mirror descent (MD). In this paper, we investigate the convergence properties and implicit biases of a family of MD algorithms tailored for softmax attention mechanisms, with the potential function chosen as the $p$-th power of the $\ell_p$-norm. Specifically, we show that these algorithms converge in direction to a generalized hard-margin SVM with an $\ell_p$-norm objective when applied to a classification problem using a softmax attention model. Notably, our theoretical results reveal that the convergence rate is comparable to that of traditional GD in simpler models, despite the highly nonlinear and nonconvex nature of the present problem. Additionally, we delve into the joint optimization dynamics of the key-query matrix and the decoder, establishing conditions under which this complex joint optimization converges to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions. Lastly, our numerical experiments on real data demonstrate that MD algorithms improve generalization over standard GD and excel in optimal token selection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at learning generalizable image representations but often falls short in zero-shot inference on certain downstream datasets. Test-time adaptation (TTA) mitigates this issue by adjusting components like normalization layers or context prompts, yet it typically requires large batch sizes and extensive augmentations, leading to high computational costs. This raises a key question: Can VLMs' performance drop in specific test cases be mitigated through efficient, training-free approaches? To explore the solution, we investigate token condensation (TC) techniques, originally designed to enhance vision transformer efficiency by refining token usage during inference. We observe that informative tokens improve visual-text alignment in VLMs like CLIP on unseen datasets. However, existing TC methods often fail to maintain in-distribution performance when reducing tokens, prompting us to ask: How can we transform TC into an effective ``free-lunch'' adaptation strategy for VLMs? To address this, we propose Token Condensation as Adaptation (TCA), a training-free adaptation method that takes a step beyond standard TC. Rather than passively discarding tokens, TCA condenses token representation by introducing reservoir-based domain anchor tokens for information-preserving token reduction and logits correction. TCA achieves up to a 21.4% performance improvement over the strongest baseline on cross-dataset benchmark and the CIFAR-100-Corrupted dataset while reducing GFLOPs by 12.2% to 48.9%, with minimal hyperparameter dependency on both CLIP and SigLIP series.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Noukhovitch, Shengyi Huang, Sophie Xhonneux, Arian Hosseini, Rishabh Agarwal, Aaron Courville</p>
<p>Abstract: The dominant paradigm for RLHF is online and on-policy RL: synchronously generating from the large language model (LLM) policy, labelling with a reward model, and learning using feedback on the LLM's own outputs. While performant, this paradigm is computationally inefficient. Inspired by classical deep RL literature, we propose separating generation and learning in RLHF. This enables asynchronous generation of new samples while simultaneously training on old samples, leading to faster training and more compute-optimal scaling. However, asynchronous training relies on an underexplored regime, online but off-policy RLHF: learning on samples from previous iterations of our model which give a worse training signal. We tackle the fundamental challenge in this regime: how much off-policyness can we tolerate for asynchronous training to speed up learning but maintain performance? Among several RLHF algorithms we test, online DPO is found to be most robust to off-policy data, and robustness increases with the scale of the policy model. We study further compute optimizations for asynchronous RLHF but find that they come at a performance cost, giving rise to a trade-off. We verify the scalability of asynchronous RLHF by training a general-purpose chatbot from LLaMA 3.1 8B on an instruction-following task ~40% faster than a synchronous run while matching final performance. Finally, we extend our results to math and reasoning to demonstrate asynchronous RL can finetune Rho 1B on GSM8k ~70% faster while matching synchronous accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guneet S. Dhillon, Xingjian Shi, Yee Whye Teh, Alex Smola</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and alignment of large language models (LLMs) are key steps in providing a good user experience. However, the concept of an appropriate alignment is inherently application-dependent, and current methods often rely on heuristic choices to drive optimization. In this work, we formulate SFT and alignment as a constrained optimization problem: the LLM is fine-tuned on a task while being required to meet application-specific requirements, without resorting to heuristics. To solve this, we propose Lagrange Large Language Models (L3Ms), which employ logarithmic barriers to enforce the constraints. This approach allows for the customization of L3Ms across diverse applications while avoiding heuristic-driven processes. We experimentally demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of L3Ms in achieving tailored alignments for various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuele Marconato, S\'ebastien Lachapelle, Sebastian Weichwald, Luigi Gresele</p>
<p>Abstract: We analyze identifiability as a possible explanation for the ubiquity of linear properties across language models, such as the vector difference between the representations of "easy" and "easiest" being parallel to that between "lucky" and "luckiest". For this, we ask whether finding a linear property in one model implies that any model that induces the same distribution has that property, too. To answer that, we first prove an identifiability result to characterize distribution-equivalent next-token predictors, lifting a diversity requirement of previous results. Second, based on a refinement of relational linearity [Paccanaro and Hinton, 2001; Hernandez et al., 2024], we show how many notions of linearity are amenable to our analysis. Finally, we show that under suitable conditions, these linear properties either hold in all or none distribution-equivalent next-token predictors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fu Feng, Yucheng Xie, Xu Yang, Jing Wang, Xin Geng</p>
<p>Abstract: ``Creative'' remains an inherently abstract concept for both humans and diffusion models. While text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models can easily generate out-of-distribution concepts like ``a blue banana'', they struggle with generating combinatorial objects such as ``a creative mixture that resembles a lettuce and a mantis'', due to difficulties in understanding the semantic depth of ``creative''. Current methods rely heavily on synthesizing reference prompts or images to achieve a creative effect, typically requiring retraining for each unique creative output-a process that is computationally intensive and limits practical applications. To address this, we introduce CreTok, which brings meta-creativity to diffusion models by redefining ``creative'' as a new token, \texttt{<CreTok>}, thus enhancing models' semantic understanding for combinatorial creativity. CreTok achieves such redefinition by iteratively sampling diverse text pairs from our proposed CangJie dataset to form adaptive prompts and restrictive prompts, and then optimizing the similarity between their respective text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that <CreTok> enables the universal and direct generation of combinatorial creativity across diverse concepts without additional training, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved text-image alignment and higher human preference ratings. Code will be made available at https://github.com/fu-feng/CreTok.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shi Dong, Xiaobei Niu, Rui Zhong, Zhifeng Wang, Mingzhang Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate annotation of educational resources is crucial for effective personalized learning and resource recommendation in online education. However, fine-grained knowledge labels often overlap or share similarities, making it difficult for existing multi-label classification methods to differentiate them. The label distribution imbalance due to sparsity of human annotations further intensifies these challenges. To address these issues, this paper introduces RR2QC, a novel Retrieval Reranking method to multi-label Question Classification by leveraging label semantics and meta-label refinement. First, RR2QC improves the pre-training strategy by utilizing semantic relationships within and across label groups. Second, it introduces a class center learning task to align questions with label semantics during downstream training. Finally, this method decomposes labels into meta-labels and uses a meta-label classifier to rerank the retrieved label sequences. In doing so, RR2QC enhances the understanding and prediction capability of long-tail labels by learning from meta-labels that frequently appear in other labels. Additionally, a mathematical LLM is used to generate solutions for questions, extracting latent information to further refine the model's insights. Experimental results show that RR2QC outperforms existing methods in Precision@K and F1 scores across multiple educational datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for online education applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Grazzi, Julien Siems, J\"org K. H. Franke, Arber Zela, Frank Hutter, Massimiliano Pontil</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (LRNNs) such as Mamba, RWKV, GLA, mLSTM, and DeltaNet have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers for long sequences. However, both Transformers and LRNNs struggle to perform state-tracking, which may impair performance in tasks such as code evaluation. In one forward pass, current architectures are unable to solve even parity, the simplest state-tracking task, which non-linear RNNs can handle effectively. Recently, Sarrof et al. (2024) demonstrated that the failure of LRNNs like Mamba to solve parity stems from restricting the value range of their diagonal state-transition matrices to $[0, 1]$ and that incorporating negative values can resolve this issue. We extend this result to non-diagonal LRNNs such as DeltaNet. We prove that finite precision LRNNs with state-transition matrices having only positive eigenvalues cannot solve parity, while non-triangular matrices are needed to count modulo $3$. Notably, we also prove that LRNNs can learn any regular language when their state-transition matrices are products of identity minus vector outer product matrices, each with eigenvalues in the range $[-1, 1]$. Our experiments confirm that extending the eigenvalue range of Mamba and DeltaNet to include negative values not only enables them to solve parity but consistently improves their performance on state-tracking tasks. We also show that state-tracking enabled LRNNs can be pretrained stably and efficiently at scale (1.3B parameters), achieving competitive performance on language modeling and showing promise on code and math tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjia Wang, Liang Pan, Zhiyang Dou, Jidong Mei, Zhouyingcheng Liao, Yuke Lou, Yifan Wu, Lei Yang, Jingbo Wang, Taku Komura</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulating stylized human-scene interactions (HSI) in physical environments is a challenging yet fascinating task. Prior works emphasize long-term execution but fall short in achieving both diverse style and physical plausibility. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel hierarchical framework named SIMS that seamlessly bridges highlevel script-driven intent with a low-level control policy, enabling more expressive and diverse human-scene interactions. Specifically, we employ Large Language Models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate coherent and diverse long-form scripts, providing a rich foundation for motion planning. A versatile multicondition physics-based control policy is also developed, which leverages text embeddings from the generated scripts to encode stylistic cues, simultaneously perceiving environmental geometries and accomplishing task goals. By integrating the retrieval-augmented script generation with the multi-condition controller, our approach provides a unified solution for generating stylized HSI motions. We further introduce a comprehensive planning dataset produced by RAG and a stylized motion dataset featuring diverse locomotions and interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate SIMS's effectiveness in executing various tasks and generalizing across different scenarios, significantly outperforming previous methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the vision understanding domain. The success of these models can largely be attributed to the dominant scaling law, which states that larger parameter sizes and data volumes contribute to better performance. Notably, data scaling has mainly been powered by automatic data pipelines, which center around the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted for quite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these data has been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits scaling with synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a data-centric perspective. Our main study approach is fine-tuning pre-trained image-LLMs with video data and investigating learning efficiency through data scaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning efficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through our probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes video-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic samples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves performance comparable to or even superior to baselines trained with many more samples. Meanwhile, we find that incorporating these synthetic samples can boost the performance of long video understanding without training with long video data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Wang, Weichao Zhou, Shantanu Ghosh, Kayhan Batmanghelich, Wenchao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) has shown great potential in assisting radiologists by automating the labor-intensive task of report writing. While recent advancements have improved the quality and coherence of generated reports, ensuring their factual correctness remains a critical challenge. Although generative medical Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have been proposed to address this issue, these models are prone to hallucinations and can produce inaccurate diagnostic information. To address these concerns, we introduce a novel Semantic Consistency-Based Uncertainty Quantification framework that provides both report-level and sentence-level uncertainties. Unlike existing approaches, our method does not require modifications to the underlying model or access to its inner state, such as output token logits, thus serving as a plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method in detecting hallucinations and enhancing the factual accuracy of automatically generated radiology reports. By abstaining from high-uncertainty reports, our approach improves factuality scores by $10$\%, achieved by rejecting $20$\% of reports using the \texttt{Radialog} model on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. Furthermore, sentence-level uncertainty flags the lowest-precision sentence in each report with an $82.9$\% success rate.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal AI has the potential to significantly enhance document-understanding tasks, such as processing receipts, understanding workflows, extracting data from documents, and summarizing reports. Code generation tasks that require long-structured outputs can also be enhanced by multimodality. Despite this, their use in commercial applications is often limited due to limited access to training data and restrictive licensing, which hinders open access. To address these limitations, we introduce BigDocs-7.5M, a high-quality, open-access dataset comprising 7.5 million multimodal documents across 30 tasks. We use an efficient data curation process to ensure our data is high-quality and license-permissive. Our process emphasizes accountability, responsibility, and transparency through filtering rules, traceable metadata, and careful content analysis. Additionally, we introduce BigDocs-Bench, a benchmark suite with 10 novel tasks where we create datasets that reflect real-world use cases involving reasoning over Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and code generation from images. Our experiments show that training with BigDocs-Bench improves average performance up to 25.8% over closed-source GPT-4o in document reasoning and structured output tasks such as Screenshot2HTML or Image2Latex generation. Finally, human evaluations showed a preference for outputs from models trained on BigDocs over GPT-4o. This suggests that BigDocs can help both academics and the open-source community utilize and improve AI tools to enhance multimodal capabilities and document reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongwei Wang, Huanrui Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization is a critical step to enable efficient LLM serving under limited resource. However, previous research observes that certain weights in the LLM, known as outliers, are significantly sensitive to quantization noises. Existing quantization methods leave these outliers as floating points or higher precisions to retain performance, posting challenges on the efficient hardware deployment of the mixed-precision model. This work investigates an alternative way to tame the sensitive weights' impact on the quantization error, by reducing the loss Hessian trace with respect to outliers through an efficient fine-tuning process. We propose Noise Perturbation Fine-tuning (NPFT), which identifies outlier weights and add random weight perturbations on the outliers as the model going through a PEFT optimization. NPFT tames the sensitivity of outlier weights so that the quantized model performance can be improved without special treatment to the outliers. When applied to OPT and LLaMA models, our NPFT method achieves stable performance improvements for both uniform and non-uniform quantizers, while also offering better inference efficiency. Notably, the simplest RTN can achieve performance on par with GPTQ using our NPFT on LLaMA2-7B-4bits benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dewu Zheng, Yanlin Wang, Ensheng Shi, Xilin Liu, Yuchi Ma, Hongyu Zhang, Zibin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), extensive research has been conducted to investigate the code generation capabilities of LLMs. However, existing efforts primarily focus on general-domain tasks, leaving LLMs' code generation performance in real-world application domains underexplored. This raises a critical question: can a model's general-domain coding ability reliably represent its ability in specialized domains? In this paper, we introduce DomainCodeBench, a multi-domain code generation benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs across 12 software application domains and 15 programming languages. DomainCodeBench contains 2,400 manually verified tasks with ground truth, human-annotated docstrings, and fine-grained dependency information to ensure more coverage of domain-specific challenges. Specifically, we first identify the most popular application domains by topic mining. Then, we curate coding tasks based on commonly used frameworks and platforms in each domain. We obtain several findings through extensive experiments on DomainCodeBench with ten mainstream LLMs. (1) Performance decoupling: experiments reveal that top general-domain models do not consistently excel in specific application domains; (2) Domain-specific weaknesses: LLMs often fail due to domain knowledge gaps and third-party library misusage; (3) Contextual enhancement: we show that augmenting prompts with domain-specific knowledge improves performance by around 38.17%, providing actionable insights for performance optimization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Wang, Qingyi Si, Jianlong Wu, Shiyu Zhu, Li Cao, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have made significant strides in video understanding but struggle with long videos due to the limitations of their backbone LLMs. Existing solutions rely on length extrapolation, which is memory-constrained, or visual token compression, which primarily leverages low-level temporal redundancy while overlooking the more effective high-level knowledge redundancy. To address this, we propose $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, a training-free method with two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for video compression. To align with the way of human temporal perception, DPSelect identifies keyframes based on inter-frame distance peaks. To leverage LLMs' learned prior knowledge, PivotKV marks the keyframes as pivots and compress non-pivot frames by pruning low-attention tokens in their KV cache. ReTaKe enables VideoLLMs to process 8 times longer frames (up to 2048), outperforming similar-sized models by 3-5% and even rivaling much larger ones on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench. Moreover, by overlapping compression operations with prefilling, ReTaKe introduces only ~10% prefilling latency overhead while reducing decoding latency by ~20%.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Vision Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a transformative technology at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, enabling machines to perceive and reason about the world through both visual and textual modalities. For example, models such as CLIP, Claude, and GPT-4V demonstrate strong reasoning and understanding abilities on visual and textual data and beat classical single modality vision models on zero-shot classification. Despite their rapid advancements in research and growing popularity in applications, a comprehensive survey of existing studies on VLMs is notably lacking, particularly for researchers aiming to leverage VLMs in their specific domains. To this end, we provide a systematic overview of VLMs in the following aspects: model information of the major VLMs developed over the past five years (2019-2024); the main architectures and training methods of these VLMs; summary and categorization of the popular benchmarks and evaluation metrics of VLMs; the applications of VLMs including embodied agents, robotics, and video generation; the challenges and issues faced by current VLMs such as hallucination, fairness, and safety.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tian Jin, Ahmed Imtiaz Humayun, Utku Evci, Suvinay Subramanian, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Dan Alistarh, Gintare Karolina Dziugaite</p>
<p>Abstract: Pruning eliminates unnecessary parameters in neural networks; it offers a promising solution to the growing computational demands of large language models (LLMs). While many focus on post-training pruning, sparse pre-training--which combines pruning and pre-training into a single phase--provides a simpler alternative. In this work, we present the first systematic exploration of optimal sparse pre-training configurations for LLMs through an examination of 80 unique pruning schedules across different sparsity levels and training durations. We find that initiating pruning at 25% of total training compute and concluding at 75% achieves near-optimal final evaluation loss. These findings provide valuable insights for efficient and effective sparse pre-training of LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a new scaling law that modifies the Chinchilla scaling law to use the average parameter count over pre-training. Through empirical and theoretical validation, we demonstrate that this modified scaling law accurately models evaluation loss for both sparsely and densely pre-trained LLMs, unifying scaling laws across pre-training paradigms. Our findings indicate that while sparse pre-training achieves the same final model quality as dense pre-training for equivalent compute budgets, it provides substantial benefits through reduced model size, enabling significant potential computational savings during inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: In knowledge-intensive tasks, especially in high-stakes domains like medicine and law, it is critical not only to retrieve relevant information but also to provide causal reasoning and explainability. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, they often suffer from limitations such as difficulty in incorporating new knowledge, generating hallucinations, and explaining their reasoning process. To address these challenges, integrating knowledge graphs with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) has emerged as an effective solution. Traditional Graph RAG methods often rely on simple graph traversal or semantic similarity, which do not capture causal relationships or align well with the model's internal reasoning steps. This paper proposes a novel pipeline that filters large knowledge graphs to emphasize cause-effect edges, aligns the retrieval process with the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), and enhances reasoning through multi-stage path improvements. Experiments on medical question-answering tasks show consistent gains, with up to a 10\% absolute improvement across multiple large language models (LLMs). This approach demonstrates the value of combining causal reasoning with stepwise retrieval, leading to more interpretable and logically grounded solutions for complex queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacong Xu, Shao-Yuan Lo, Bardia Safaei, Vishal M. Patel, Isht Dwivedi</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) is an emerging AD paradigm. Unlike the traditional unsupervised AD setting that requires a large number of normal samples to train a model, ZSAD is more practical for handling data-restricted real-world scenarios. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning capabilities in various vision tasks. However, the reasoning of image abnormalities remains underexplored due to the lack of corresponding datasets and benchmarks. To facilitate research in AD & reasoning, we establish the first visual instruction tuning dataset, Anomaly-Instruct-125k, and the evaluation benchmark, VisA-D&R. Through investigation with our benchmark, we reveal that current MLLMs like GPT-4o cannot accurately detect and describe fine-grained anomalous details in images. To address this, we propose Anomaly-OneVision (Anomaly-OV), the first specialist visual assistant for ZSAD and reasoning. Inspired by human behavior in visual inspection, Anomaly-OV leverages a Look-Twice Feature Matching (LTFM) mechanism to adaptively select and emphasize abnormal visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomaly-OV achieves significant improvements over advanced generalist models in both detection and reasoning. Extensions to medical and 3D AD are provided for future study. The link to our project page: https://xujiacong.github.io/Anomaly-OV/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoran Chen, Bingsheng Yao, Ruishi Zou, Wenyue Hua, Weimin Lyu, Yanfang Ye, Toby Jia-Jun Li, Dakuo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Role-Playing Agent (RPA) is an increasingly popular type of LLM Agent that simulates human-like behaviors in a variety of tasks. However, evaluating RPAs is challenging due to diverse task requirements and agent designs. This paper proposes an evidence-based, actionable, and generalizable evaluation design guideline for LLM-based RPA by systematically reviewing 1,676 papers published between Jan. 2021 and Dec. 2024. Our analysis identifies six agent attributes, seven task attributes, and seven evaluation metrics from existing literature. Based on these findings, we present an RPA evaluation design guideline to help researchers develop more systematic and consistent evaluation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Zhang, Jue Wang, Huan Li, Lidan Shou, Ke Chen, Yang You, Guiming Xie, Xuejian Gong, Kunlong Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing with exceptional task generalization capabilities. Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) offers a cost-effective fine-tuning solution, freezing the original model parameters and training only lightweight, low-rank adapter matrices. However, the memory footprint of LoRA is largely dominated by the original model parameters. To mitigate this, we propose LoRAM, a memory-efficient LoRA training scheme founded on the intuition that many neurons in over-parameterized LLMs have low training utility but are essential for inference. LoRAM presents a unique twist: it trains on a pruned (small) model to obtain pruned low-rank matrices, which are then recovered and utilized with the original (large) model for inference. Additionally, minimal-cost continual pre-training, performed by the model publishers in advance, aligns the knowledge discrepancy between pruned and original models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of LoRAM across various pruning strategies and downstream tasks. For a model with 70 billion parameters, LoRAM enables training on a GPU with only 20G HBM, replacing an A100-80G GPU for LoRA training and 15 GPUs for full fine-tuning. Specifically, QLoRAM implemented by structured pruning combined with 4-bit quantization, for LLaMA-3.1-70B (LLaMA-2-70B), reduces the parameter storage cost that dominates the memory usage in low-rank matrix training by 15.81$\times$ (16.95$\times$), while achieving dominant performance gains over both the original LLaMA-3.1-70B (LLaMA-2-70B) and LoRA-trained LLaMA-3.1-8B (LLaMA-2-13B).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xilin Jiang, Sukru Samet Dindar, Vishal Choudhari, Stephan Bickel, Ashesh Mehta, Guy M McKhann, Daniel Friedman, Adeen Flinker, Nima Mesgarani</p>
<p>Abstract: Auditory foundation models, including auditory large language models (LLMs), process all sound inputs equally, independent of listener perception. However, human auditory perception is inherently selective: listeners focus on specific speakers while ignoring others in complex auditory scenes. Existing models do not incorporate this selectivity, limiting their ability to generate perception-aligned responses. To address this, we introduce Intention-Informed Auditory Scene Understanding (II-ASU) and present Auditory Attention-Driven LLM (AAD-LLM), a prototype system that integrates brain signals to infer listener attention. AAD-LLM extends an auditory LLM by incorporating intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings to decode which speaker a listener is attending to and refine responses accordingly. The model first predicts the attended speaker from neural activity, then conditions response generation on this inferred attentional state. We evaluate AAD-LLM on speaker description, speech transcription and extraction, and question answering in multitalker scenarios, with both objective and subjective ratings showing improved alignment with listener intention. By taking a first step toward intention-aware auditory AI, this work explores a new paradigm where listener perception informs machine listening, paving the way for future listener-centered auditory systems.

<p>Abstract: Ensuring safe and effective use of AI requires understanding and anticipating its performance on novel tasks, from advanced scientific challenges to transformed workplace activities. So far, benchmarking has guided progress in AI, but it has offered limited explanatory and predictive power for general-purpose AI systems, given the low transferability across diverse tasks. In this paper, we introduce general scales for AI evaluation that can explain what common AI benchmarks really measure, extract ability profiles of AI systems, and predict their performance for new task instances, in- and out-of-distribution. Our fully-automated methodology builds on 18 newly-crafted rubrics that place instance demands on general scales that do not saturate. Illustrated for 15 large language models and 63 tasks, high explanatory power is unleashed from inspecting the demand and ability profiles, bringing insights on the sensitivity and specificity exhibited by different benchmarks, and how knowledge, metacognition and reasoning are affected by model size, chain-of-thought and distillation. Surprisingly, high predictive power at the instance level becomes possible using these demand levels, providing superior estimates over black-box baseline predictors based on embeddings or finetuning, especially in out-of-distribution settings (new tasks and new benchmarks). The scales, rubrics, battery, techniques and results presented here represent a major step for AI evaluation, underpinning the reliable deployment of AI in the years ahead.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jikai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-SQL systems have improved the conversion of natural language queries into SQL, but challenges remain in ensuring accuracy and reliability. While self-correction techniques refine outputs, they often introduce new errors. Existing methods focused on execution feedback mainly address syntax issues, leaving semantic errors -- where the query's logic fails to align with the user's intent -- largely unaddressed. We propose a novel approach combining structured execution feedback with a trained critic agent that provides detailed, interpretable critiques. This method effectively identifies and corrects both syntactic and semantic errors, enhancing accuracy and interpretability. Experimental results show significant improvements on two major Text-to-SQL benchmarks, Spider and BIRD, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abe Bohan Hou, Hongru Du, Yichen Wang, Jingyu Zhang, Zixiao Wang, Paul Pu Liang, Daniel Khashabi, Lauren Gardner, Tianxing He</p>
<p>Abstract: Can we simulate a sandbox society with generative agents to model human behavior, thereby reducing the over-reliance on real human trials for assessing public policies? In this work, we investigate the feasibility of simulating health-related decision-making, using vaccine hesitancy, defined as the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccination services (MacDonald, 2015), as a case study. To this end, we introduce the VacSim framework with 100 generative agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). VacSim simulates vaccine policy outcomes with the following steps: 1) instantiate a population of agents with demographics based on census data; 2) connect the agents via a social network and model vaccine attitudes as a function of social dynamics and disease-related information; 3) design and evaluate various public health interventions aimed at mitigating vaccine hesitancy. To align with real-world results, we also introduce simulation warmup and attitude modulation to adjust agents' attitudes. We propose a series of evaluations to assess the reliability of various LLM simulations. Experiments indicate that models like Llama and Qwen can simulate aspects of human behavior but also highlight real-world alignment challenges, such as inconsistent responses with demographic profiles. This early exploration of LLM-driven simulations is not meant to serve as definitive policy guidance; instead, it serves as a call for action to examine social simulation for policy development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Jia, Jiachen Li, Xiang Yue, Bo Li, Ping Nie, Kai Zou, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models have made significant progress on many perception-focused tasks. However, their progress on reasoning-focused tasks remains limited due to the lack of high-quality and diverse training data. In this work, we aim to address the scarcity of reasoning-focused multimodal datasets. We propose VisualWebInstruct, a novel approach that leverages search engines to create a diverse and high-quality dataset spanning multiple disciplines, including mathematics, physics, finance, and chemistry, etc. Starting with a meticulously selected set of 30,000 seed images, we employ Google Image Search to identify websites containing similar images. We collect and process HTML data from over 700K unique URLs. Through a pipeline of content extraction, filtering, and synthesis, we construct a dataset of approximately 900K question-answer (QA) pairs, with 40% consisting of visual QA pairs and the remaining comprising text-based QA pairs. Models fine-tuned on VisualWebInstruct demonstrate significant performance improvements: (1) fine-tuning on Llava-OV results in 10-20 absolute points improvement across benchmarks, and (2) fine-tuning from MAmmoTH-VL yields a 5 absolute points gain across benchmarks. Our best model, MAmmoTH-VL2, achieves state-of-the-art performance within the 10B parameter class on MMMU-Pro (40.7), MathVerse (42.6), and DynaMath (55.7). These results highlight the effectiveness of our dataset in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models for complex multimodal tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andy Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Siege, a multi-turn adversarial framework that models the gradual erosion of Large Language Model (LLM) safety through a tree search perspective. Unlike single-turn jailbreaks that rely on one meticulously engineered prompt, Siege expands the conversation at each turn in a breadth-first fashion, branching out multiple adversarial prompts that exploit partial compliance from previous responses. By tracking these incremental policy leaks and re-injecting them into subsequent queries, Siege reveals how minor concessions can accumulate into fully disallowed outputs. Evaluations on the JailbreakBench dataset show that Siege achieves a 100% success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo and 97% on GPT-4 in a single multi-turn run, using fewer queries than baselines such as Crescendo or GOAT. This tree search methodology offers an in-depth view of how model safeguards degrade over successive dialogue turns, underscoring the urgency of robust multi-turn testing procedures for language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gang Li, Jizhong Liu, Heinrich Dinkel, Yadong Niu, Junbo Zhang, Jian Luan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to greatly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), and RL-based approaches have been progressively applied to visual multimodal tasks. However, the audio modality has largely been overlooked in these developments. Thus, we conduct a series of RL explorations in audio understanding and reasoning, specifically focusing on the audio question answering (AQA) task. We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct, and our experiments demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the MMAU Test-mini benchmark, achieving an accuracy rate of 64.5%. The main findings in this technical report are as follows: 1) The GRPO algorithm can be effectively applied to large audio language models (LALMs), even when the model has only 8.2B parameters; 2) With only 38k post-training samples, RL significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning (SFT), indicating that RL-based approaches can be effective without large datasets; 3) The explicit reasoning process has not shown significant benefits for AQA tasks, and how to efficiently utilize deep thinking remains an open question for further research; 4) LALMs still lag far behind humans auditory-language reasoning, suggesting that the RL-based approaches warrant further exploration.
