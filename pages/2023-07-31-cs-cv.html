<p>In this work, we propose a set-membership inference attack for generative
models using deep image watermarking techniques. In particular, we demonstrate
how conditional sampling from a generative model can reveal the watermark that
was injected into parts of the training data. Our empirical results demonstrate
that the proposed watermarking technique is a principled approach for detecting
the non-consensual use of image data in training generative models.

<p>We have combined transmission speckle photography and machine learning for
direct classification and recognition of milk fat content classes. Our aim was
hinged on the fact that parameters of scattering particles (and the dispersion
medium) can be linked to the intensity distribution (speckle) observed when
coherent light is transmitted through a scattering medium. For milk, it is
primarily the size distribution and concentration of fat globules, which
constitutes the total fat content. Consequently, we trained convolutional
neural network to recognise and classify laser speckle from different fat
content classes (0.5, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.2%). We investigated four exposure-time
protocols and obtained the highest performance for shorter exposure times, in
which the intensity histograms are kept similar for all images and the most
probable intensity in the speckle pattern is close to zero. Our neural network
was able to recognize the milk fat content classes unambiguously and we
obtained the highest test and independent classification accuracies of 100 and
~99% respectively. It indicates that the parameters of other complex realistic
suspensions could be classified with similar methods.

<p>Handwriting recognition has seen significant success with the use of deep
learning. However, a persistent shortcoming of neural networks is that they are
not well-equipped to deal with shifting data distributions. In the field of
handwritten text recognition (HTR), this shows itself in poor recognition
accuracy for writers that are not similar to those seen during training. An
ideal HTR model should be adaptive to new writing styles in order to handle the
vast amount of possible writing styles. In this paper, we explore how HTR
models can be made writer adaptive by using only a handful of examples from a
new writer (e.g., 16 examples) for adaptation. Two HTR architectures are used
as base models, using a ResNet backbone along with either an LSTM or
Transformer sequence decoder. Using these base models, two methods are
considered to make them writer adaptive: 1) model-agnostic meta-learning
(MAML), an algorithm commonly used for tasks such as few-shot classification,
and 2) writer codes, an idea originating from automatic speech recognition.
Results show that an HTR-specific version of MAML known as MetaHTR improves
performance compared to the baseline with a 1.4 to 2.0 improvement in word
error rate (WER). The improvement due to writer adaptation is between 0.2 and
0.7 WER, where a deeper model seems to lend itself better to adaptation using
MetaHTR than a shallower model. However, applying MetaHTR to larger HTR models
or sentence-level HTR may become prohibitive due to its high computational and
memory requirements. Lastly, writer codes based on learned features or Hinge
statistical features did not lead to improved recognition performance.

<p>Recent progress in the fields of AI and cognitive sciences opens up new
challenges that were previously inaccessible to study. One of such modern tasks
is recovering lost data of one modality by using the data from another one. A
similar effect (called the McGurk Effect) has been found in the functioning of
the human brain. Observing this effect, one modality of information interferes
with another, changing its perception. In this paper, we propose a way to
simulate such an effect and use it to reconstruct lost data modalities by
combining Variational Auto-Encoders, Self-Organizing Maps, and Hebb connections
in a unified ReD-SOM (Reentering Deep Self-organizing Map) model. We are
inspired by human's capability to use different zones of the brain in different
modalities, in case of having a lack of information in one of the modalities.
This new approach not only improves the analysis of ambiguous data but also
restores the intended signal! The results obtained on the multimodal dataset
demonstrate an increase of quality of the signal reconstruction. The effect is
remarkable both visually and quantitatively, specifically in presence of a
significant degree of signal's distortion.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15098">Self-Supervised Learning for Improved Synthetic Aperture Sonar Target Recognition. (arXiv:2307.15098v1 [cs.CV])</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Sheffield_B/0/1/0/all/0/1">BW Sheffield</a></p>
<p>This study explores the application of self-supervised learning (SSL) for
improved target recognition in synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) imagery. The
unique challenges of underwater environments make traditional computer vision
techniques, which rely heavily on optical camera imagery, less effective. SAS,
with its ability to generate high-resolution imagery, emerges as a preferred
choice for underwater imaging. However, the voluminous high-resolution SAS data
presents a significant challenge for labeling; a crucial step for training deep
neural networks (DNNs).
</p>
<p>SSL, which enables models to learn features in data without the need for
labels, is proposed as a potential solution to the data labeling challenge in
SAS. The study evaluates the performance of two prominent SSL algorithms,
MoCov2 and BYOL, against the well-regarded supervised learning model, ResNet18,
for binary image classification tasks. The findings suggest that while both SSL
models can outperform a fully supervised model with access to a small number of
labels in a few-shot scenario, they do not exceed it when all the labels are
used.
</p>
<p>The results underscore the potential of SSL as a viable alternative to
traditional supervised learning, capable of maintaining task performance while
reducing the time and costs associated with data labeling. The study also
contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of SSL in remote
sensing and could stimulate further research in this area.

<p>The distribution of illustrations on social media, such as Twitter and Pixiv
has increased with the growing popularity of animation, games, and animated
movies. The "atmosphere" of illustrations plays an important role in user
preferences. Classifying illustrations by atmosphere can be helpful for
recommendations and searches. However, assigning clear labels to the elusive
"atmosphere" and conventional supervised classification is not always
practical. Furthermore, even images with similar colors, edges, and low-level
features may not have similar atmospheres, making classification based on
low-level features challenging. In this paper, this problem is solved using
both supervised and unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels. The feature
vectors are obtained using the supervised method with pseudo-labels that
contribute to an ambiguous atmosphere. Further, clustering is performed based
on these feature vectors. Experimental analyses show that our method
outperforms conventional methods in human-like clustering on datasets manually
classified by humans.

<p>Scenarios in which restrictions in data transfer and storage limit the
possibility to compose a single dataset -- also exploiting different data
sources -- to perform a batch-based training procedure, make the development of
robust models particularly challenging. We hypothesize that the recent
Continual Learning (CL) paradigm may represent an effective solution to enable
incremental training, even through multiple sites. Indeed, a basic assumption
of CL is that once a model has been trained, old data can no longer be used in
successive training iterations and in principle can be deleted. Therefore, in
this paper, we investigate the performance of different Continual Learning
methods in this scenario, simulating a learning model that is updated every
time a new chunk of data, even of variable size, is available. Experimental
results reveal that a particular CL method, namely Learning without Forgetting
(LwF), is one of the best-performing algorithms. Then, we investigate its usage
and parametrization in Morphing Attack Detection and Object Classification
tasks, specifically with respect to the amount of new training data that became
available.

<p>Change detection based on remote sensing images has been a prominent area of
interest in the field of remote sensing. Deep networks have demonstrated
significant success in detecting changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images
and have found applications in various fields. Given the degradation of natural
environments and the frequent occurrence of natural disasters, accurately and
swiftly identifying damaged buildings in disaster-stricken areas through remote
sensing images holds immense significance. This paper aims to investigate
change detection specifically for natural disasters. Considering that existing
public datasets used in change detection research are registered, which does
not align with the practical scenario where bi-temporal images are not matched,
this paper introduces an unregistered end-to-end change detection synthetic
dataset called xBD-E2ECD. Furthermore, we propose an end-to-end change
detection network named E2ECDNet, which takes an unregistered bi-temporal image
pair as input and simultaneously generates the flow field prediction result and
the change detection prediction result. It is worth noting that our E2ECDNet
also supports change detection for registered image pairs, as registration can
be seen as a special case of non-registration. Additionally, this paper
redefines the criteria for correctly predicting a positive case and introduces
neighborhood-based change detection evaluation metrics. The experimental
results have demonstrated significant improvements.

<p>With the popularity of implicit neural representations, or neural radiance
fields (NeRF), there is a pressing need for editing methods to interact with
the implicit 3D models for tasks like post-processing reconstructed scenes and
3D content creation. While previous works have explored NeRF editing from
various perspectives, they are restricted in editing flexibility, quality, and
speed, failing to offer direct editing response and instant preview. The key
challenge is to conceive a locally editable neural representation that can
directly reflect the editing instructions and update instantly. To bridge the
gap, we propose a new interactive editing method and system for implicit
representations, called Seal-3D, which allows users to edit NeRF models in a
pixel-level and free manner with a wide range of NeRF-like backbone and preview
the editing effects instantly. To achieve the effects, the challenges are
addressed by our proposed proxy function mapping the editing instructions to
the original space of NeRF models and a teacher-student training strategy with
local pretraining and global finetuning. A NeRF editing system is built to
showcase various editing types. Our system can achieve compelling editing
effects with an interactive speed of about 1 second.

<p>Vector Quantisation (VQ) is experiencing a comeback in machine learning,
where it is increasingly used in representation learning. However, optimizing
the codevectors in existing VQ-VAE is not entirely trivial. A problem is
codebook collapse, where only a small subset of codevectors receive gradients
useful for their optimisation, whereas a majority of them simply ``dies off''
and is never updated or used. This limits the effectiveness of VQ for learning
larger codebooks in complex computer vision tasks that require high-capacity
representations. In this paper, we present a simple alternative method for
online codebook learning, Clustering VQ-VAE (CVQ-VAE). Our approach selects
encoded features as anchors to update the ``dead'' codevectors, while
optimising the codebooks which are alive via the original loss. This strategy
brings unused codevectors closer in distribution to the encoded features,
increasing the likelihood of being chosen and optimized. We extensively
validate the generalization capability of our quantiser on various datasets,
tasks (e.g. reconstruction and generation), and architectures (e.g. VQ-VAE,
VQGAN, LDM). Our CVQ-VAE can be easily integrated into the existing models with
just a few lines of code.

<p>Dropout as a regularization technique is widely used in fully connected
layers while is less effective in convolutional layers. Therefore more
structured forms of dropout have been proposed to regularize convolutional
networks. The disadvantage of these methods is that the randomness introduced
causes inconsistency between training and inference. In this paper, we apply a
mutual learning training strategy for convolutional layer regularization,
namely R-Block, which forces two outputs of the generated difference maximizing
sub models to be consistent with each other. Concretely, R-Block minimizes the
losses between the output distributions of two sub models with different drop
regions for each sample in the training dataset. We design two approaches to
construct such sub models. Our experiments demonstrate that R-Block achieves
better performance than other existing structured dropout variants. We also
demonstrate that our approaches to construct sub models outperforms others.

<p>Similarity metrics have played a significant role in computer vision to
capture the underlying semantics of images. In recent years, advanced
similarity metrics, such as the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity
(LPIPS), have emerged. These metrics leverage deep features extracted from
trained neural networks and have demonstrated a remarkable ability to closely
align with human perception when evaluating relative image similarity. However,
it is now well-known that neural networks are susceptible to adversarial
examples, i.e., small perturbations invisible to humans crafted to deliberately
mislead the model. Consequently, the LPIPS metric is also sensitive to such
adversarial examples. This susceptibility introduces significant security
concerns, especially considering the widespread adoption of LPIPS in
large-scale applications. In this paper, we propose the Robust Learned
Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (R-LPIPS) metric, a new metric that leverages
adversarially trained deep features. Through a comprehensive set of

<p>The popularity of text-based CAPTCHA as a security mechanism to protect
websites from automated bots has prompted researches in CAPTCHA solvers, with
the aim of understanding its failure cases and subsequently making CAPTCHAs
more secure. Recently proposed solvers, built on advances in deep learning, are
able to crack even the very challenging CAPTCHAs with high accuracy. However,
these solvers often perform poorly on out-of-distribution samples that contain
visual features different from those in the training set. Furthermore, they
lack the ability to detect and avoid such samples, making them susceptible to
being locked out by defense systems after a certain number of failed attempts.
In this paper, we propose EnSolver, a novel CAPTCHA solver that utilizes deep
ensemble uncertainty estimation to detect and skip out-of-distribution
CAPTCHAs, making it harder to be detected. We demonstrate the use of our solver
with object detection models and show empirically that it performs well on both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, achieving up to 98.1% accuracy
when detecting out-of-distribution data and up to 93% success rate when solving

<p>Medicine, by its nature, is a multifaceted domain that requires the synthesis
of information across various modalities. Medical generative vision-language
models (VLMs) make a first step in this direction and promise many exciting
clinical applications. However, existing models typically have to be fine-tuned
on sizeable down-stream datasets, which poses a significant limitation as in
many medical applications data is scarce, necessitating models that are capable
of learning from few examples in real-time. Here we propose Med-Flamingo, a
multimodal few-shot learner adapted to the medical domain. Based on
OpenFlamingo-9B, we continue pre-training on paired and interleaved medical
image-text data from publications and textbooks. Med-Flamingo unlocks few-shot
generative medical visual question answering (VQA) abilities, which we evaluate
on several datasets including a novel challenging open-ended VQA dataset of
visual USMLE-style problems. Furthermore, we conduct the first human evaluation
for generative medical VQA where physicians review the problems and blinded
generations in an interactive app. Med-Flamingo improves performance in
generative medical VQA by up to 20\% in clinician's rating and firstly enables

produce good results on large traffic lights, detecting small and tiny ones is
often overlooked. A key problem here is the inherent downsampling in CNNs,
leading to low-resolution features for detection. To mitigate this problem, we
propose a new traffic light detection system, comprising a novel traffic light
proposal generator that utilizes findings from general object proposal
generation, fine-grained multi-scale features, and attention for efficient
processing. Moreover, we design a new detection head for classifying and
refining our proposals. We evaluate our system on three challenging, publicly
available datasets and compare it against six methods. The results show
substantial improvements of at least $12.6\%$ on small and tiny traffic lights,
as well as strong results across all sizes of traffic lights.

<p>Brain extraction, registration and segmentation are indispensable
preprocessing steps in neuroimaging studies. The aim is to extract the brain
from raw imaging scans (i.e., extraction step), align it with a target brain
image (i.e., registration step) and label the anatomical brain regions (i.e.,
segmentation step). Conventional studies typically focus on developing separate
methods for the extraction, registration and segmentation tasks in a supervised
setting. The performance of these methods is largely contingent on the quantity
of training samples and the extent of visual inspections carried out by experts
for error correction. Nevertheless, collecting voxel-level labels and
performing manual quality control on high-dimensional neuroimages (e.g., 3D
MRI) are expensive and time-consuming in many medical studies. In this paper,
we study the problem of one-shot joint extraction, registration and
segmentation in neuroimaging data, which exploits only one labeled template
image (a.k.a. atlas) and a few unlabeled raw images for training. We propose a
unified end-to-end framework, called JERS, to jointly optimize the extraction,
registration and segmentation tasks, allowing feedback among them.
Specifically, we use a group of extraction, registration and segmentation
modules to learn the extraction mask, transformation and segmentation mask,
where modules are interconnected and mutually reinforced by self-supervision.
Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method
performs exceptionally in the extraction, registration and segmentation tasks.

<p>In a joint vision-language space, a text feature (e.g., from "a photo of a
dog") could effectively represent its relevant image features (e.g., from dog
photos). Inspired by this, we propose PromptStyler which simulates various
distribution shifts in the joint space by synthesizing diverse styles via
prompts without using any images to deal with source-free domain
generalization. Our method learns to generate a variety of style features (from
"a S* style of a") via learnable style word vectors for pseudo-words S*. To
ensure that learned styles do not distort content information, we force
style-content features (from "a S* style of a [class]") to be located nearby
their corresponding content features (from "[class]") in the joint
vision-language space. After learning style word vectors, we train a linear
classifier using synthesized style-content features. PromptStyler achieves the
state of the art on PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome and DomainNet, although it does not
require any images and takes just ~30 minutes for training using a single GPU.

<p>Recent advances in generative AI have brought incredible breakthroughs in
several areas, including medical imaging. These generative models have
tremendous potential not only to help safely share medical data via synthetic
datasets but also to perform an array of diverse applications, such as anomaly
detection, image-to-image translation, denoising, and MRI reconstruction.
However, due to the complexity of these models, their implementation and
reproducibility can be difficult. This complexity can hinder progress, act as a
use barrier, and dissuade the comparison of new methods with existing works. In
this study, we present MONAI Generative Models, a freely available open-source
platform that allows researchers and developers to easily train, evaluate, and
deploy generative models and related applications. Our platform reproduces
state-of-art studies in a standardised way involving different architectures
(such as diffusion models, autoregressive transformers, and GANs), and provides
pre-trained models for the community. We have implemented these models in a
generalisable fashion, illustrating that their results can be extended to 2D or
3D scenarios, including medical images with different modalities (like CT, MRI,
and X-Ray data) and from different anatomical areas. Finally, we adopt a

<p>Recent advancements in surgical computer vision applications have been driven
by fully-supervised methods, primarily using only visual data. These methods
rely on manually annotated surgical videos to predict a fixed set of object
categories, limiting their generalizability to unseen surgical procedures and
downstream tasks. In this work, we put forward the idea that the surgical video
lectures available through open surgical e-learning platforms can provide
effective supervisory signals for multi-modal representation learning without
relying on manual annotations. We address the surgery-specific linguistic
challenges present in surgical video lectures by employing multiple
complementary automatic speech recognition systems to generate text
transcriptions. We then present a novel method, SurgVLP - Surgical Vision
Language Pre-training, for multi-modal representation learning. SurgVLP
constructs a new contrastive learning objective to align video clip embeddings
with the corresponding multiple text embeddings by bringing them together
within a joint latent space. To effectively show the representation capability
of the learned joint latent space, we introduce several vision-and-language
tasks for surgery, such as text-based video retrieval, temporal activity
grounding, and video captioning, as benchmarks for evaluation. We further
demonstrate that without using any labeled ground truth, our approach can be
employed for traditional vision-only surgical downstream tasks, such as
surgical tool, phase, and triplet recognition. The code will be made available

<p>Images captured in dusty environments suffering from poor visibility and
quality. Enhancement of these images such as sand dust images plays a critical
role in various atmospheric optics applications. In this work, proposed a new
model based on Color Correction and new membership function to enhance san dust
images. The proposed model consists of three phases: correction of color shift,
removal of haze, and enhancement of contrast and brightness. The color shift is
corrected using a new membership function to adjust the values of U and V in
the YUV color space. The Adaptive Dark Channel Prior (A-DCP) is used for haze
removal. The stretching contrast and improving image brightness are based on
Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). The proposed model
tests and evaluates through many real sand dust images. The experimental
results show that the proposed solution is outperformed the current studies in
terms of effectively removing the red and yellow cast and provides high quality
and quantity dust images.

<p>Tropical cyclones (TCs) are among the most destructive weather systems.
Realistically and efficiently detecting and tracking TCs are critical for
assessing their impacts and risks. Recently, a multilevel robustness framework
has been introduced to study the critical points of time-varying vector fields.
The framework quantifies the robustness of critical points across varying
neighborhoods. By relating the multilevel robustness with critical point
tracking, the framework has demonstrated its potential in cyclone tracking. An
advantage is that it identifies cyclonic features using only 2D wind vector
fields, which is encouraging as most tracking algorithms require multiple
dynamic and thermodynamic variables at different altitudes. A disadvantage is
that the framework does not scale well computationally for datasets containing
a large number of cyclones. This paper introduces a topologically robust
physics-informed tracking framework (TROPHY) for TC tracking. The main idea is
to integrate physical knowledge of TC to drastically improve the computational
efficiency of multilevel robustness framework for large-scale climate datasets.
First, during preprocessing, we propose a physics-informed feature selection
strategy to filter 90% of critical points that are short-lived and have low
stability, thus preserving good candidates for TC tracking. Second, during
in-processing, we impose constraints during the multilevel robustness
computation to focus only on physics-informed neighborhoods of TCs. We apply
TROPHY to 30 years of 2D wind fields from reanalysis data in ERA5 and generate
a number of TC tracks. In comparison with the observed tracks, we demonstrate
that TROPHY can capture TC characteristics that are comparable to and sometimes
even better than a well-validated TC tracking algorithm that requires multiple
dynamic and thermodynamic scalar fields.

<p>State-of-the-art visual localization methods mostly rely on complex
procedures to match local descriptors and 3D point clouds. However, these
procedures can incur significant cost in terms of inference, storage, and
updates over time. In this study, we propose a direct learning-based approach
that utilizes a simple network named D2S to represent local descriptors and
their scene coordinates. Our method is characterized by its simplicity and
cost-effectiveness. It solely leverages a single RGB image for localization
during the testing phase and only requires a lightweight model to encode a
complex sparse scene. The proposed D2S employs a combination of a simple loss
function and graph attention to selectively focus on robust descriptors while
disregarding areas such as clouds, trees, and several dynamic objects. This
selective attention enables D2S to effectively perform a binary-semantic
classification for sparse descriptors. Additionally, we propose a new outdoor
dataset to evaluate the capabilities of visual localization methods in terms of
scene generalization and self-updating from unlabeled observations. Our
approach outperforms the state-of-the-art CNN-based methods in scene coordinate
regression in indoor and outdoor environments. It demonstrates the ability to
generalize beyond training data, including scenarios involving transitions from
day to night and adapting to domain shifts, even in the absence of the labeled
data sources. The source code, trained models, dataset, and demo videos are

<p>Recent studies on pedestrian attribute recognition progress with either
explicit or implicit modeling of the co-occurrence among attributes.
Considering that this known a prior is highly variable and unforeseeable
regarding the specific scenarios, we show that current methods can actually
suffer in generalizing such fitted attributes interdependencies onto scenes or
identities off the dataset distribution, resulting in the underlined bias of
attributes co-occurrence. To render models robust in realistic scenes, we
propose the attributes-disentangled feature learning to ensure the recognition
of an attribute not inferring on the existence of others, and which is
sequentially formulated as a problem of mutual information minimization.
Rooting from it, practical strategies are devised to efficiently decouple
attributes, which substantially improve the baseline and establish
state-of-the-art performance on realistic datasets like PETAzs and RAPzs. Code

<p>The whole slide image (WSI) classification is often formulated as a multiple
instance learning (MIL) problem. Since the positive tissue is only a small
fraction of the gigapixel WSI,existing MIL methods intuitively focus on
identifying salient instances via attention mechanisms. However, this leads to
a bias towards easy-to-classify instances while neglecting hard-to-classify
instances.Some literature has revealed that hard examples are beneficial for
modeling a discriminative boundary accurately.By applying such an idea at the
instance level,we elaborate a novel MIL framework with masked hard instance
mining (MHIM-MIL), which uses a Siamese structure (Teacher-Student) with a
consistency constraint to explore the potential hard instances. With several
instance masking strategies based on attention scores, MHIM-MIL employs a
momentum teacher to implicitly mine hard instances for training the student
model, which can be any attention-based MIL model.This counter-intuitive
strategy essentially enables the student to learn a better discriminating
boundary.Moreover, the student is used to update the teacher with an
exponential moving average (EMA), which in turn identifies new hard instances
for subsequent training iterations and stabilizes the optimization.Experimental
results on the CAMELYON-16 and TCGA Lung Cancer datasets demonstrate that
MHIM-MIL outperforms other latest methods in terms of performance and training
cost. The code is available at:https://github.com/DearCaat/MHIM-MIL.

<p>The complexity of learning problems, such as Generative Adversarial Network

and a variety of real-world vision applications, demands a deeper understanding
of their underlying coupling mechanisms. Existing approaches often address
these problems in isolation, lacking a unified perspective that can reveal
commonalities and enable effective solutions. Therefore, in this work, we
proposed a new framework, named Learning with Constraint Learning (LwCL), that
can holistically examine challenges and provide a unified methodology to tackle
all the above-mentioned complex learning and vision problems. Specifically,
LwCL is designed as a general hierarchical optimization model that captures the
essence of these diverse learning and vision problems. Furthermore, we develop
a gradient-response based fast solution strategy to overcome optimization
challenges of the LwCL framework. Our proposed framework efficiently addresses
a wide range of applications in learning and vision, encompassing three

<p>The emergence of large-scale large language models, with GPT-4 as a prominent
example, has significantly propelled the rapid advancement of artificial
general intelligence and sparked the revolution of Artificial Intelligence 2.0.
In the realm of remote sensing (RS), there is a growing interest in developing
large vision language models (VLMs) specifically tailored for data analysis in
this domain. However, current research predominantly revolves around visual
recognition tasks, lacking comprehensive, large-scale image-text datasets that
are aligned and suitable for training large VLMs, which poses significant
challenges to effectively training such models for RS applications. In computer
vision, recent research has demonstrated that fine-tuning large vision language
models on small-scale, high-quality datasets can yield impressive performance
in visual and language understanding. These results are comparable to
state-of-the-art VLMs trained from scratch on massive amounts of data, such as
GPT-4. Inspired by this captivating idea, in this work, we build a high-quality
Remote Sensing Image Captioning dataset (RSICap) that facilitates the
development of large VLMs in the RS field. Unlike previous RS datasets that
either employ model-generated captions or short descriptions, RSICap comprises
2,585 human-annotated captions with rich and high-quality information. This
dataset offers detailed descriptions for each image, encompassing scene
descriptions (e.g., residential area, airport, or farmland) as well as object
information (e.g., color, shape, quantity, absolute position, etc). To
facilitate the evaluation of VLMs in the field of RS, we also provide a

<p>Finding abnormal lymph nodes in radiological images is highly important for
various medical tasks such as cancer metastasis staging and radiotherapy
planning. Lymph nodes (LNs) are small glands scattered throughout the body.
They are grouped or defined to various LN stations according to their
anatomical locations. The CT imaging appearance and context of LNs in different
stations vary significantly, posing challenges for automated detection,
especially for pathological LNs. Motivated by this observation, we propose a
novel end-to-end framework to improve LN detection performance by leveraging
their station information. We design a multi-head detector and make each head
focus on differentiating the LN and non-LN structures of certain stations.
Pseudo station labels are generated by an LN station classifier as a form of
multi-task learning during training, so we do not need another explicit LN
station prediction model during inference. Our algorithm is evaluated on 82
patients with lung cancer and 91 patients with esophageal cancer. The proposed
implicit station stratification method improves the detection sensitivity of
thoracic lymph nodes from 65.1% to 71.4% and from 80.3% to 85.5% at 2 false
positives per patient on the two datasets, respectively, which significantly
outperforms various existing state-of-the-art baseline techniques such as
nnUNet, nnDetection and LENS.

<p>Fibre orientation distribution (FOD) reconstruction using deep learning has
the potential to produce accurate FODs from a reduced number of
diffusion-weighted images (DWIs), decreasing total imaging time. Diffusion
acquisition invariant representations of the DWI signals are typically used as
input to these methods to ensure that they can be applied flexibly to data with
different b-vectors and b-values; however, this means the network cannot
condition its output directly on the DWI signal. In this work, we propose a
spherical deconvolution network, a model-driven deep learning FOD
reconstruction architecture, that ensures intermediate and output FODs produced
by the network are consistent with the input DWI signals. Furthermore, we
implement a fixel classification penalty within our loss function, encouraging
the network to produce FODs that can subsequently be segmented into the correct
number of fixels and improve downstream fixel-based analysis. Our results show
that the model-based deep learning architecture achieves competitive
performance compared to a state-of-the-art FOD super-resolution network,
FOD-Net. Moreover, we show that the fixel classification penalty can be tuned
to offer improved performance with respect to metrics that rely on accurately
segmented of FODs. Our code is publicly available at

<p>Driven by the latest trend towards self-supervised learning (SSL), the
paradigm of "pretraining-then-finetuning" has been extensively explored to
enhance the performance of clinical applications with limited annotations.
Previous literature on model finetuning has mainly focused on regularization
terms and specific policy models, while the misalignment of channels between
source and target models has not received sufficient attention. In this work,
we revisited the dynamics of batch normalization (BN) layers and observed that
the trainable affine parameters of BN serve as sensitive indicators of domain
information. Therefore, Affine Collaborative Normalization (AC-Norm) is
proposed for finetuning, which dynamically recalibrates the channels in the
target model according to the cross-domain channel-wise correlations without
adding extra parameters. Based on a single-step backpropagation, AC-Norm can
also be utilized to measure the transferability of pretrained models. We
evaluated AC-Norm against the vanilla finetuning and state-of-the-art
fine-tuning methods on transferring diverse pretrained models to the diabetic
retinopathy grade classification, retinal vessel segmentation, CT lung nodule
segmentation/classification, CT liver-tumor segmentation and MRI cardiac
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AC-Norm unanimously
outperforms the vanilla finetuning by up to 4% improvement, even under
significant domain shifts where the state-of-the-art methods bring no gains. We
also prove the capability of AC-Norm in fast transferability estimation. Our
code is available at https://github.com/EndoluminalSurgicalVision-IMR/ACNorm.

<p>This paper presents an investigation into the estimation of optical and scene
flow using RGBD information in scenarios where the RGB modality is affected by
noise or captured in dark environments. Existing methods typically rely solely
on RGB images or fuse the modalities at later stages, which can result in lower
accuracy when the RGB information is unreliable. To address this issue, we
propose a novel deep neural network approach named FusionRAFT, which enables
early-stage information fusion between sensor modalities (RGB and depth). Our
approach incorporates self- and cross-attention layers at different network
levels to construct informative features that leverage the strengths of both
modalities. Through comparative experiments, we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms recent methods in terms of performance on the synthetic dataset
Flyingthings3D, as well as the generalization on the real-world dataset KITTI.
We illustrate that our approach exhibits improved robustness in the presence of
noise and low-lighting conditions that affect the RGB images. We release the

<p>Few-shot learning aims to adapt models trained on the base dataset to novel
tasks where the categories are not seen by the model before. This often leads
to a relatively uniform distribution of feature values across channels on novel
classes, posing challenges in determining channel importance for novel tasks.
Standard few-shot learning methods employ geometric similarity metrics such as
cosine similarity and negative Euclidean distance to gauge the semantic
relatedness between two features. However, features with high geometric
similarities may carry distinct semantics, especially in the context of
few-shot learning. In this paper, we demonstrate that the importance ranking of
feature channels is a more reliable indicator for few-shot learning than
geometric similarity metrics. We observe that replacing the geometric
similarity metric with Kendall's rank correlation only during inference is able
to improve the performance of few-shot learning across a wide range of datasets
with different domains. Furthermore, we propose a carefully designed
differentiable loss for meta-training to address the non-differentiability
issue of Kendall's rank correlation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed rank-correlation-based approach substantially enhances few-shot
learning performance.

<p>The presence of shadows significantly impacts the visual quality of scanned
documents. However, the existing traditional techniques and deep learning
methods used for shadow removal have several limitations. These methods either
rely heavily on heuristics, resulting in suboptimal performance, or require
large datasets to learn shadow-related features. In this study, we propose the
DocDeshadower, a multi-frequency Transformer-based model built on Laplacian
Pyramid. DocDeshadower is designed to remove shadows at different frequencies
in a coarse-to-fine manner. To achieve this, we decompose the shadow image into
different frequency bands using Laplacian Pyramid. In addition, we introduce
two novel components to this model: the Attention-Aggregation Network and the
Gated Multi-scale Fusion Transformer. The Attention-Aggregation Network is
designed to remove shadows in the low-frequency part of the image, whereas the
Gated Multi-scale Fusion Transformer refines the entire image at a global scale
with its large perceptive field. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that
DocDeshadower outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in both
qualitative and quantitative terms.

<p>Learning visuomotor policies in simulation is much safer and cheaper than in
the real world. However, due to discrepancies between the simulated and real
data, simulator-trained policies often fail when transferred to real robots.
One common approach to bridge the visual sim-to-real domain gap is domain
randomization (DR). While previous work mainly evaluates DR for disembodied
tasks, such as pose estimation and object detection, here we systematically
explore visual domain randomization methods and benchmark them on a rich set of
challenging robotic manipulation tasks. In particular, we propose an off-line
proxy task of cube localization to select DR parameters for texture
randomization, lighting randomization, variations of object colors and camera
parameters. Notably, we demonstrate that DR parameters have similar impact on
our off-line proxy task and on-line policies. We, hence, use off-line optimized
DR parameters to train visuomotor policies in simulation and directly apply
such policies to a real robot. Our approach achieves 93% success rate on
average when tested on a diverse set of challenging manipulation tasks.
Moreover, we evaluate the robustness of policies to visual variations in real
scenes and show that our simulator-trained policies outperform policies learned
using real but limited data. Code, simulation environment, real robot datasets
and trained models are available at

<p>Learning discriminative task-specific features simultaneously for multiple
distinct tasks is a fundamental problem in multi-task learning. Recent
state-of-the-art models consider directly decoding task-specific features from
one shared task-generic feature (e.g., feature from a backbone layer), and
utilize carefully designed decoders to produce multi-task features. However, as
the input feature is fully shared and each task decoder also shares decoding
parameters for different input samples, it leads to a static feature decoding
process, producing less discriminative task-specific representations. To tackle
this limitation, we propose TaskExpert, a novel multi-task mixture-of-experts
model that enables learning multiple representative task-generic feature spaces
and decoding task-specific features in a dynamic manner. Specifically,
TaskExpert introduces a set of expert networks to decompose the backbone
feature into several representative task-generic features. Then, the
task-specific features are decoded by using dynamic task-specific gating
networks operating on the decomposed task-generic features. Furthermore, to
establish long-range modeling of the task-specific representations from
different layers of TaskExpert, we design a multi-task feature memory that
updates at each layer and acts as an additional feature expert for dynamic
task-specific feature decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
TaskExpert clearly outperforms previous best-performing methods on all 9
metrics of two competitive multi-task learning benchmarks for visual scene
understanding (i.e., PASCAL-Context and NYUD-v2). Codes and models will be made

<p>Online ads showing e-commerce products typically rely on the product images
in a catalog sent to the advertising platform by an e-commerce platform. In the
broader ads industry such ads are called dynamic product ads (DPA). It is
common for DPA catalogs to be in the scale of millions (corresponding to the
scale of products which can be bought from the e-commerce platform). However,
not all product images in the catalog may be appealing when directly
re-purposed as an ad image, and this may lead to lower click-through rates
(CTRs). In particular, products just placed against a solid background may not
be as enticing and realistic as a product staged in a natural environment. To
address such shortcomings of DPA images at scale, we propose a generative
adversarial network (GAN) based approach to generate staged backgrounds for
un-staged product images. Generating the entire staged background is a
challenging task susceptible to hallucinations. To get around this, we
introduce a simpler approach called copy-paste staging using retrieval assisted
GANs. In copy paste staging, we first retrieve (from the catalog) staged
products similar to the un-staged input product, and then copy-paste the
background of the retrieved product in the input image. A GAN based in-painting
model is used to fill the holes left after this copy-paste operation. We show
the efficacy of our copy-paste staging method via offline metrics, and human
evaluation. In addition, we show how our staging approach can enable animations
of moving products leading to a video ad from a product image.

<p>The explicit neural radiance field (NeRF) has gained considerable interest
for its efficient training and fast inference capabilities, making it a
promising direction such as virtual reality and gaming. In particular,
PlenOctree (POT)[1], an explicit hierarchical multi-scale octree
representation, has emerged as a structural and influential framework. However,
POT's fixed structure for direct optimization is sub-optimal as the scene
complexity evolves continuously with updates to cached color and density,
necessitating refining the sampling distribution to capture signal complexity
accordingly. To address this issue, we propose the dynamic PlenOctree DOT,
which adaptively refines the sample distribution to adjust to changing scene
complexity. Specifically, DOT proposes a concise yet novel hierarchical feature
fusion strategy during the iterative rendering process. Firstly, it identifies
the regions of interest through training signals to ensure adaptive and
efficient refinement. Next, rather than directly filtering out valueless nodes,
DOT introduces the sampling and pruning operations for octrees to aggregate
features, enabling rapid parameter learning. Compared with POT, our DOT
outperforms it by enhancing visual quality, reducing over $55.15$/$68.84\%$
parameters, and providing 1.7/1.9 times FPS for NeRF-synthetic and Tanks $\&amp;$
Temples, respectively. Project homepage:https://vlislab22.github.io/DOT.

combination of the well-known Radon transform for images and a recent signal
representation method called the Signed Cumulative Distribution Transform. The
newly proposed method generalizes previous transport-related image
representation methods to arbitrary functions (images), and thus can be used in
more applications. We describe the new transform, and some of its mathematical
properties and demonstrate its ability to partition image classes with real and
simulated data. In comparison to existing transport transform methods, as well
as deep learning-based classification methods, the new transform more
accurately represents the information content of signed images, and thus can be
used to obtain higher classification accuracies. The implementation of the

<p>In this paper, we propose an iterative framework, which consists of two
phases: a generation phase and a training phase, to generate realistic training
data and yield a supervised homography network. In the generation phase, given
an unlabeled image pair, we utilize the pre-estimated dominant plane masks and
homography of the pair, along with another sampled homography that serves as
ground truth to generate a new labeled training pair with realistic motion. In
the training phase, the generated data is used to train the supervised
homography network, in which the training data is refined via a content
consistency module and a quality assessment module. Once an iteration is
finished, the trained network is used in the next data generation phase to
update the pre-estimated homography. Through such an iterative strategy, the
quality of the dataset and the performance of the network can be gradually and
simultaneously improved. Experimental results show that our method achieves

<p>Task-conditional architecture offers advantage in parameter efficiency but
falls short in performance compared to state-of-the-art multi-decoder methods.
How to trade off performance and model parameters is an important and difficult
problem. In this paper, we introduce a simple and lightweight task-conditional
model called Prompt Guided Transformer (PGT) to optimize this challenge. Our
approach designs a Prompt-conditioned Transformer block, which incorporates
task-specific prompts in the self-attention mechanism to achieve global
dependency modeling and parameter-efficient feature adaptation across multiple
tasks. This block is integrated into both the shared encoder and decoder,
enhancing the capture of intra- and inter-task features. Moreover, we design a
lightweight decoder to further reduce parameter usage, which accounts for only
2.7% of the total model parameters. Extensive experiments on two multi-task
dense prediction benchmarks, PASCAL-Context and NYUD-v2, demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results among task-conditional methods while
using fewer parameters, and maintains a significant balance between performance

<p>We propose AffineGlue, a method for joint two-view feature matching and
robust estimation that reduces the combinatorial complexity of the problem by
employing single-point minimal solvers. AffineGlue selects potential matches
from one-to-many correspondences to estimate minimal models. Guided matching is
then used to find matches consistent with the model, suffering less from the
ambiguities of one-to-one matches. Moreover, we derive a new minimal solver for
homography estimation, requiring only a single affine correspondence (AC) and a
gravity prior. Furthermore, we train a neural network to reject ACs that are
unlikely to lead to a good model. AffineGlue is superior to the SOTA on
real-world datasets, even when assuming that the gravity direction points
downwards. On PhotoTourism, the AUC@10{\deg} score is improved by 6.6 points
compared to the SOTA. On ScanNet, AffineGlue makes SuperPoint and SuperGlue
achieve similar accuracy as the detector-free LoFTR.

<p>Without manually annotated identities, unsupervised multi-object trackers are
inferior to learning reliable feature embeddings. It causes the
similarity-based inter-frame association stage also be error-prone, where an
uncertainty problem arises. The frame-by-frame accumulated uncertainty prevents
trackers from learning the consistent feature embedding against time variation.
To avoid this uncertainty problem, recent self-supervised techniques are
adopted, whereas they failed to capture temporal relations. The interframe
uncertainty still exists. In fact, this paper argues that though the
uncertainty problem is inevitable, it is possible to leverage the uncertainty
itself to improve the learned consistency in turn. Specifically, an
uncertainty-based metric is developed to verify and rectify the risky
associations. The resulting accurate pseudo-tracklets boost learning the
feature consistency. And accurate tracklets can incorporate temporal
information into spatial transformation. This paper proposes a tracklet-guided
augmentation strategy to simulate tracklets' motion, which adopts a
hierarchical uncertainty-based sampling mechanism for hard sample mining. The
ultimate unsupervised MOT framework, namely U2MOT, is proven effective on
MOT-Challenges and VisDrone-MOT benchmark. U2MOT achieves a SOTA performance
among the published supervised and unsupervised trackers.

<p>Biodiversity monitoring is crucial for tracking and counteracting adverse
trends in population fluctuations. However, automatic recognition systems are
rarely applied so far, and experts evaluate the generated data masses manually.
Especially the support of deep learning methods for visual monitoring is not
yet established in biodiversity research, compared to other areas like
advertising or entertainment. In this paper, we present a deep learning
pipeline for analyzing images captured by a moth scanner, an automated visual
monitoring system of moth species developed within the AMMOD project. We first
localize individuals with a moth detector and afterward determine the species
of detected insects with a classifier. Our detector achieves up to 99.01% mean
average precision and our classifier distinguishes 200 moth species with an
accuracy of 93.13% on image cutouts depicting single insects. Combining both in
our pipeline improves the accuracy for species identification in images of the
moth scanner from 79.62% to 88.05%.

<p>Detecting changes that occurred in a pair of 3D airborne LiDAR point clouds,
acquired at two different times over the same geographical area, is a
challenging task because of unmatching spatial supports and acquisition system
noise. Most recent attempts to detect changes on point clouds are based on
supervised methods, which require large labelled data unavailable in real-world
applications. To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised approach that
comprises two components: Neural Field (NF) for continuous shape reconstruction
and a Gaussian Mixture Model for categorising changes. NF offer a grid-agnostic
representation to encode bi-temporal point clouds with unmatched spatial
support that can be regularised to increase high-frequency details and reduce
noise. The reconstructions at each timestamp are compared at arbitrary spatial
scales, leading to a significant increase in detection capabilities. We apply
our method to a benchmark dataset of simulated LiDAR point clouds for urban
sprawling. The dataset offers different challenging scenarios with different
resolutions, input modalities and noise levels, allowing a multi-scenario
comparison of our method with the current state-of-the-art. We boast the
previous methods on this dataset by a 10% margin in intersection over union

<p>In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient balancing has recently attracted more
research interest than loss balancing since it often leads to better
performance. However, loss balancing is much more efficient than gradient
balancing, and thus it is still worth further exploration in MTL. Note that
prior studies typically ignore that there exist varying improvable gaps across
multiple tasks, where the improvable gap per task is defined as the distance
between the current training progress and desired final training progress.
Therefore, after loss balancing, the performance imbalance still arises in many
cases. In this paper, following the loss balancing framework, we propose two
novel improvable gap balancing (IGB) algorithms for MTL: one takes a simple
heuristic, and the other (for the first time) deploys deep reinforcement
learning for MTL. Particularly, instead of directly balancing the losses in
MTL, both algorithms choose to dynamically assign task weights for improvable
gap balancing. Moreover, we combine IGB and gradient balancing to show the
complementarity between the two types of algorithms. Extensive experiments on
two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our IGB algorithms lead to the best
results in MTL via loss balancing and achieve further improvements when
combined with gradient balancing. Code is available at

<p>Automatic camera-assisted monitoring of insects for abundance estimations is
crucial to understand and counteract ongoing insect decline. In this paper, we
present two datasets of nocturnal insects, especially moths as a subset of
Lepidoptera, photographed in Central Europe. One of the datasets, the EU-Moths
dataset, was captured manually by citizen scientists and contains species
annotations for 200 different species and bounding box annotations for those.
We used this dataset to develop and evaluate a two-stage pipeline for insect
detection and moth species classification in previous work. We further
introduce a prototype for an automated visual monitoring system. This prototype
produced the second dataset consisting of more than 27,000 images captured on
95 nights. For evaluation and bootstrapping purposes, we annotated a subset of
the images with bounding boxes enframing nocturnal insects. Finally, we present
first detection and classification baselines for these datasets and encourage
other scientists to use this publicly available data.

<p>Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP,
establish the correlation between texts and images, achieving remarkable
success on various downstream tasks with fine-tuning. In existing fine-tuning
methods, the class-specific text description is matched against the whole
image. We recognize that this whole image matching is not effective since
images from the same class often contain a set of different semantic objects,
and an object further consists of a set of semantic parts or concepts.
Individual semantic parts or concepts may appear in image samples from
different classes. To address this issue, in this paper, we develop a new
method called cross-model concept learning and inference (CCLI). Using the
powerful text-image correlation capability of CLIP, our method automatically
learns a large set of distinctive visual concepts from images using a set of
semantic text concepts. Based on these visual concepts, we construct a
discriminative representation of images and learn a concept inference network
to perform downstream image classification tasks, such as few-shot learning and
domain generalization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our CCLI
method is able to improve the performance upon the current state-of-the-art
methods by large margins, for example, by up to 8.0% improvement on few-shot
learning and by up to 1.3% for domain generalization.

<p>Though modern microscopes have an autofocusing system to ensure optimal
focus, out-of-focus images can still occur when cells within the medium are not
all in the same focal plane, affecting the image quality for medical diagnosis
and analysis of diseases. We propose a method that can deblur images as well as
synthesize defocus blur. We train autoencoders with implicit and explicit
regularization techniques to enforce linearity relations among the
representations of different blur levels in the latent space. This allows for
the exploration of different blur levels of an object by linearly
interpolating/extrapolating the latent representations of images taken at
different focal planes. Compared to existing works, we use a simple
architecture to synthesize images with flexible blur levels, leveraging the
linear latent space. Our regularized autoencoders can effectively mimic blur
and deblur, increasing data variety as a data augmentation technique and
improving the quality of microscopic images, which would be beneficial for
further processing and analysis.

<p>Reliable obstacle detection on railways could help prevent collisions that
result in injuries and potentially damage or derail the train. Unfortunately,
generic object detectors do not have enough classes to account for all possible
scenarios, and datasets featuring objects on railways are challenging to
obtain. We propose utilizing a shallow network to learn railway segmentation
from normal railway images. The limited receptive field of the network prevents
overconfident predictions and allows the network to focus on the locally very
distinct and repetitive patterns of the railway environment. Additionally, we
explore the controlled inclusion of global information by learning to
hallucinate obstacle-free images. We evaluate our method on a custom dataset
featuring railway images with artificially augmented obstacles. Our proposed
method outperforms other learning-based baseline methods.

<p>Purpose: To improve the image quality of sparse-view computed tomography (CT)
images with a U-Net for lung cancer detection and to determine the best
trade-off between number of views, image quality, and diagnostic confidence.
</p>
<p>Methods: CT images from 41 subjects (34 with lung cancer, seven healthy) were
retrospectively selected (01.2016-12.2018) and forward projected onto 2048-view
sinograms. Six corresponding sparse-view CT data subsets at varying levels of
undersampling were reconstructed from sinograms using filtered backprojection
with 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512 views, respectively. A dual-frame U-Net was
trained and evaluated for each subsampling level on 8,658 images from 22
diseased subjects. A representative image per scan was selected from 19
subjects (12 diseased, seven healthy) for a single-blinded reader study. The
selected slices, for all levels of subsampling, with and without
post-processing by the U-Net model, were presented to three readers. Image
quality and diagnostic confidence were ranked using pre-defined scales.
Subjective nodule segmentation was evaluated utilizing sensitivity (Se) and
Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
</p>
<p>Results: The 64-projection sparse-view images resulted in Se = 0.89 and DSC =
0.81 [0.75,0.86] while their counterparts, post-processed with the U-Net, had
improved metrics (Se = 0.94, DSC = 0.85 [0.82,0.87]). Fewer views lead to
insufficient quality for diagnostic purposes. For increased views, no
substantial discrepancies were noted between the sparse-view and post-processed
images.
</p>
<p>Conclusion: Projection views can be reduced from 2048 to 64 while maintaining
image quality and the confidence of the radiologists on a satisfactory level.

<p>Recent works on 6D object pose estimation focus on learning keypoint
correspondences between images and object models, and then determine the object
pose through RANSAC-based algorithms or by directly regressing the pose with
end-to-end optimisations. We argue that learning point-level discriminative
features is overlooked in the literature. To this end, we revisit Fully
Convolutional Geometric Features (FCGF) and tailor it for object 6D pose
estimation to achieve state-of-the-art performance. FCGF employs sparse
convolutions and learns point-level features using a fully-convolutional
network by optimising a hardest contrastive loss. We can outperform recent
competitors on popular benchmarks by adopting key modifications to the loss and
to the input data representations, by carefully tuning the training strategies,
and by employing data augmentations suitable for the underlying problem. We
carry out a thorough ablation to study the contribution of each modification.

<p>Shrinking pattern dimensions leads to an increased variety of defect types in
semiconductor devices. This has spurred innovation in patterning approaches
such as Directed self-assembly (DSA) for which no traditional, automatic defect
inspection software exists. Machine Learning-based SEM image analysis has
become an increasingly popular research topic for defect inspection with
supervised ML models often showing the best performance. However, little
research has been done on obtaining a dataset with high-quality labels for
these supervised models. In this work, we propose a method for obtaining
coherent and complete labels for a dataset of hexagonal contact hole DSA
patterns while requiring minimal quality control effort from a DSA expert. We
show that YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art neural network, achieves defect detection
precisions of more than 0.9 mAP on our final dataset which best reflects DSA
expert defect labeling expectations. We discuss the strengths and limitations
of our proposed labeling approach and suggest directions for future work in
data-centric ML-based defect inspection.

<p>Few-shot image classification aims to accurately classify unlabeled images
using only a few labeled samples. The state-of-the-art solutions are built by
deep learning, which focuses on designing increasingly complex deep backbones.
Unfortunately, the task remains very challenging due to the difficulty of
transferring the knowledge learned in training classes to new ones. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach based on the non-i.i.d paradigm of gradual
machine learning (GML). It begins with only a few labeled observations, and
then gradually labels target images in the increasing order of hardness by
iterative factor inference in a factor graph. Specifically, our proposed
solution extracts indicative feature representations by deep backbones, and
then constructs both unary and binary factors based on the extracted features
to facilitate gradual learning. The unary factors are constructed based on
class center distance in an embedding space, while the binary factors are
constructed based on k-nearest neighborhood. We have empirically validated the
performance of the proposed approach on benchmark datasets by a comparative
study. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can
improve the SOTA performance by 1-5% in terms of accuracy. More notably, it is
more robust than the existing deep models in that its performance can
consistently improve as the size of query set increases while the performance
of deep models remains essentially flat or even becomes worse.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15539">Backdoor Defense with Non-Adversarial Backdoor. (arXiv:2307.15539v1 [cs.LG])</a></h1>

<p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attack, which does not
affect the network's performance on clean data but would manipulate the network
behavior once a trigger pattern is added. Existing defense methods have greatly
reduced attack success rate, but their prediction accuracy on clean data still
lags behind a clean model by a large margin. Inspired by the stealthiness and
effectiveness of backdoor attack, we propose a simple but highly effective
defense framework which injects non-adversarial backdoors targeting poisoned
samples. Following the general steps in backdoor attack, we detect a small set
of suspected samples and then apply a poisoning strategy to them. The
non-adversarial backdoor, once triggered, suppresses the attacker's backdoor on
poisoned data, but has limited influence on clean data. The defense can be
carried out during data preprocessing, without any modification to the standard
end-to-end training pipeline. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks with different architectures and representative attacks. Results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art defense effectiveness
with by far the lowest performance drop on clean data. Considering the
surprising defense ability displayed by our framework, we call for more
attention to utilizing backdoor for backdoor defense. Code is available at

<p>Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) parses objects and predicts their
relationships (predicate) to connect human language and visual scenes. However,
different language preferences of annotators and semantic overlaps between
predicates lead to biased predicate annotations in the dataset, i.e. different
predicates for same object pairs. Biased predicate annotations make PSG models
struggle in constructing a clear decision plane among predicates, which greatly
hinders the real application of PSG models. To address the intrinsic bias
above, we propose a novel framework named ADTrans to adaptively transfer biased
predicate annotations to informative and unified ones. To promise consistency
and accuracy during the transfer process, we propose to measure the invariance
of representations in each predicate class, and learn unbiased prototypes of
predicates with different intensities. Meanwhile, we continuously measure the
distribution changes between each presentation and its prototype, and
constantly screen potential biased data. Finally, with the unbiased
predicate-prototype representation embedding space, biased annotations are
easily identified. Experiments show that ADTrans significantly improves the
performance of benchmark models, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance,
and shows great generalization and effectiveness on multiple datasets.

<p>Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has gained increasing
attention in point cloud understanding, in addressing the challenges posed by
3D data scarcity and high annotation costs. This paper presents PCExpert, a
novel SSRL approach that reinterprets point clouds as "specialized images".
This conceptual shift allows PCExpert to leverage knowledge derived from
large-scale image modality in a more direct and deeper manner, via extensively
sharing the parameters with a pre-trained image encoder in a multi-way
Transformer architecture. The parameter sharing strategy, combined with a novel
pretext task for pre-training, i.e., transformation estimation, empowers
PCExpert to outperform the state of the arts in a variety of tasks, with a
remarkable reduction in the number of trainable parameters. Notably, PCExpert's
performance under LINEAR fine-tuning (e.g., yielding a 90.02% overall accuracy
on ScanObjectNN) has already approached the results obtained with FULL model
fine-tuning (92.66%), demonstrating its effective and robust representation
capability.

<p>Light field cameras can provide rich angular and spatial information to
enhance image semantic segmentation for scene understanding in the field of
autonomous driving. However, the extensive angular information of light field
cameras contains a large amount of redundant data, which is overwhelming for
the limited hardware resource of intelligent vehicles. Besides, inappropriate
compression leads to information corruption and data loss. To excavate
representative information, we propose an Omni-Aperture Fusion model (OAFuser),
which leverages dense context from the central view and discovers the angular
information from sub-aperture images to generate a semantically-consistent
result. To avoid feature loss during network propagation and simultaneously
streamline the redundant information from the light field camera, we present a
simple yet very effective Sub-Aperture Fusion Module (SAFM) to embed
sub-aperture images into angular features without any additional memory cost.
Furthermore, to address the mismatched spatial information across viewpoints,
we present Center Angular Rectification Module (CARM) realized feature
resorting and prevent feature occlusion caused by asymmetric information. Our
proposed OAFuser achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UrbanLF-Real and
-Syn datasets and sets a new record of 84.93% in mIoU on the UrbanLF-Real
Extended dataset, with a gain of +4.53%. The source code of OAFuser will be

<p>In the design of offshore jacket foundations, fatigue life is crucial.
Post-weld treatment has been proposed to enhance the fatigue performance of
welded joints, where particularly high-frequency mechanical impact (HFMI)
treatment has been shown to improve fatigue performance significantly.
Automated HFMI treatment has improved quality assurance and can lead to
cost-effective design when combined with accurate fatigue life prediction.
However, the finite element method (FEM), commonly used for predicting fatigue
life in complex or multi-axial joints, relies on a basic CAD depiction of the
weld, failing to consider the actual weld geometry and defects. Including the
actual weld geometry in the FE model improves fatigue life prediction and
possible crack location prediction but requires a digital reconstruction of the
weld. Current digital reconstruction methods are time-consuming or require
specialised scanning equipment and potential component relocation. The proposed
framework instead uses an industrial manipulator combined with a line scanner
to integrate digital reconstruction as part of the automated HFMI treatment
setup. This approach applies standard image processing, simple filtering
techniques, and non-linear optimisation for aligning and merging overlapping
scans. A screened Poisson surface reconstruction finalises the 3D model to
create a meshed surface. The outcome is a generic, cost-effective, flexible,
and rapid method that enables generic digital reconstruction of welded parts,
aiding in component design, overall quality assurance, and documentation of the
HFMI treatment.

<p>Over the past decade, deep learning technologies have greatly advanced the
field of medical image registration. The initial developments, such as
ResNet-based and U-Net-based networks, laid the groundwork for deep
learning-driven image registration. Subsequent progress has been made in
various aspects of deep learning-based registration, including similarity
measures, deformation regularizations, and uncertainty estimation. These
advancements have not only enriched the field of deformable image registration
but have also facilitated its application in a wide range of tasks, including
atlas construction, multi-atlas segmentation, motion estimation, and 2D-3D
registration. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the most
recent advancements in deep learning-based image registration. We begin with a
concise introduction to the core concepts of deep learning-based image
registration. Then, we delve into innovative network architectures, loss
functions specific to registration, and methods for estimating registration
uncertainty. Additionally, this paper explores appropriate evaluation metrics
for assessing the performance of deep learning models in registration tasks.
Finally, we highlight the practical applications of these novel techniques in

<p>The volume of a brain lesion (e.g. infarct or tumor) is a powerful indicator
of patient prognosis and can be used to guide the therapeutic strategy.
Lesional volume estimation is usually performed by segmentation with deep
convolutional neural networks (CNN), currently the state-of-the-art approach.
However, to date, few work has been done to equip volume segmentation tools
with adequate quantitative predictive intervals, which can hinder their
usefulness and acceptation in clinical practice. In this work, we propose
TriadNet, a segmentation approach relying on a multi-head CNN architecture,
which provides both the lesion volumes and the associated predictive intervals

<p>The success of pre-training approaches on a variety of downstream tasks has

Specifically, we first integrate and leverage a multi-source unlabeled dataset
to align rich features between a given visual encoder and an off-the-shelf CLIP
image encoder via feature alignment loss. Notably, the given visual encoder is
not limited by size or structure and, once well-trained, it can seamlessly
serve as a better visual aesthetic learner for both student and teacher. In the
second phase, the unlabeled data is also utilized in semi-supervised IAA
learning to further boost student model performance when applied in
latency-sensitive production scenarios. By analyzing the attention distance and
entropy before and after feature alignment, we notice an alleviation of feature
collapse issue, which in turn showcase the necessity of feature alignment
instead of training directly based on CLIP image encoder. Extensive experiments
indicate the superiority of CSKD, which achieves state-of-the-art performance

<p>Recent research in language-guided visual navigation has demonstrated a
significant demand for the diversity of traversable environments and the
quantity of supervision for training generalizable agents. To tackle the common
data scarcity issue in existing vision-and-language navigation datasets, we
propose an effective paradigm for generating large-scale data for learning,
which applies 1200+ photo-realistic environments from HM3D and Gibson datasets
and synthesizes 4.9 million instruction trajectory pairs using fully-accessible
resources on the web. Importantly, we investigate the influence of each
component in this paradigm on the agent's performance and study how to
adequately apply the augmented data to pre-train and fine-tune an agent. Thanks
to our large-scale dataset, the performance of an existing agent can be pushed
up (+11% absolute with regard to previous SoTA) to a significantly new best of
80% single-run success rate on the R2R test split by simple imitation learning.
The long-lasting generalization gap between navigating in seen and unseen
environments is also reduced to less than 1% (versus 8% in the previous best
method). Moreover, our paradigm also facilitates different models to achieve
new state-of-the-art navigation results on CVDN, REVERIE, and R2R in continuous

<p>Deep Learning models are easily disturbed by variations in the input images
that were not observed during the training stage, resulting in unpredictable
predictions. Detecting such Out-of-Distribution (OOD) images is particularly
crucial in the context of medical image analysis, where the range of possible
abnormalities is extremely wide. Recently, a new category of methods has
emerged, based on the analysis of the intermediate features of a trained model.
These methods can be divided into 2 groups: single-layer methods that consider
the feature map obtained at a fixed, carefully chosen layer, and multi-layer
methods that consider the ensemble of the feature maps generated by the model.
While promising, a proper comparison of these algorithms is still lacking. In
this work, we compared various feature-based OOD detection methods on a large
spectra of OOD (20 types), representing approximately 7800 3D MRIs. Our
experiments shed the light on two phenomenons. First, multi-layer methods
consistently outperform single-layer approaches, which tend to have
inconsistent behaviour depending on the type of anomaly. Second, the OOD
detection performance highly depends on the architecture of the underlying
neural network.

<p>Tracking an object's 6D pose, while either the object itself or the observing

applications. While exploiting temporal priors eases this problem,
object-specific knowledge is required to recover when tracking is lost. Under
the tight time constraints of the tracking task, RGB(D)-based methods are often

alignment task. This allows us to train a streamlined approach from scratch
with limited amounts of sparse 3D point clouds, compared to the large datasets
of diverse RGBD sequences required in previous works. We incorporate temporal
frame-to-frame registration with object-based recovery by frame-to-model
refinement using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that jointly solves for
both objectives. We also show that the RL agent's uncertainty and a
rendering-based mask propagation are effective reinitialization triggers.

<p>The recent trend in deep learning methods for 3D point cloud understanding is
to propose increasingly sophisticated architectures either to better capture 3D
geometries or by introducing possibly undesired inductive biases. Moreover,
prior works introducing novel architectures compared their performance on the
same domain, devoting less attention to their generalization to other domains.
We argue that the ability of a model to transfer the learnt knowledge to
different domains is an important feature that should be evaluated to
exhaustively assess the quality of a deep network architecture. In this work we
propose PatchMixer, a simple yet effective architecture that extends the ideas
behind the recent MLP-Mixer paper to 3D point clouds. The novelties of our
approach are the processing of local patches instead of the whole shape to
promote robustness to partial point clouds, and the aggregation of patch-wise
features using an MLP as a simpler alternative to the graph convolutions or the
attention mechanisms that are used in prior works. We evaluated our method on
the shape classification and part segmentation tasks, achieving superior
generalization performance compared to a selection of the most relevant deep
architectures.

<p>DETR-based object detectors have achieved remarkable performance but are
sample-inefficient and exhibit slow convergence. Unsupervised pretraining has
been found to be helpful to alleviate these impediments, allowing training with
large amounts of unlabeled data to improve the detector's performance. However,
existing methods have their own limitations, like keeping the detector's
backbone frozen in order to avoid performance degradation and utilizing
pretraining objectives misaligned with the downstream task. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a simple pretraining framework for DETR-based detectors
that consists of three simple yet key ingredients: (i) richer, semantics-based
initial proposals derived from high-level feature maps, (ii) discriminative
training using object pseudo-labels produced via clustering, (iii)
self-training to take advantage of the improved object proposals learned by the
detector. We report two main findings: (1) Our pretraining outperforms prior
DETR pretraining works on both the full and low data regimes by significant
margins. (2) We show we can pretrain DETR from scratch (including the backbone)
directly on complex image datasets like COCO, paving the path for unsupervised
representation learning directly using DETR.

<p>As a video task, Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is expected to capture temporal
information of targets effectively. Unfortunately, most existing methods only
explicitly exploit the object features between adjacent frames, while lacking
the capacity to model long-term temporal information. In this paper, we propose
MeMOTR, a long-term memory-augmented Transformer for multi-object tracking. Our
method is able to make the same object's track embedding more stable and
distinguishable by leveraging long-term memory injection with a customized
memory-attention layer. This significantly improves the target association
ability of our model. Experimental results on DanceTrack show that MeMOTR
impressively surpasses the state-of-the-art method by 7.9\% and 13.0\% on HOTA
and AssA metrics, respectively. Furthermore, our model also outperforms other
Transformer-based methods on association performance on MOT17 and generalizes
well on BDD100K. Code is available at

<p>Existing approaches for semi-supervised object detection assume a fixed set
of classes present in training and unlabeled datasets, i.e., in-distribution
(ID) data. The performance of these techniques significantly degrades when
these techniques are deployed in the open-world, due to the fact that the
unlabeled and test data may contain objects that were not seen during training,
i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The two key questions that we explore in
this paper are: can we detect these OOD samples and if so, can we learn from
them? With these considerations in mind, we propose the Open World
Semi-supervised Detection framework (OWSSD) that effectively detects OOD data
along with a semi-supervised learning pipeline that learns from both ID and OOD
data. We introduce an ensemble based OOD detector consisting of lightweight
auto-encoder networks trained only on ID data. Through extensive evalulation,
we demonstrate that our method performs competitively against state-of-the-art
OOD detection algorithms and also significantly boosts the semi-supervised
learning performance in open-world scenarios.

<p>Part-based approaches for fine-grained recognition do not show the expected
performance gain over global methods, although explicitly focusing on small
details that are relevant for distinguishing highly similar classes. We assume
that part-based methods suffer from a missing representation of local features,
which is invariant to the order of parts and can handle a varying number of
visible parts appropriately. The order of parts is artificial and often only
given by ground-truth annotations, whereas viewpoint variations and occlusions
result in not observable parts. Therefore, we propose integrating a Fisher
vector encoding of part features into convolutional neural networks. The
parameters for this encoding are estimated by an online EM algorithm jointly
with those of the neural network and are more precise than the estimates of
previous works. Our approach improves state-of-the-art accuracies for three

<p>Contrastive representation learning of videos highly relies on the
availability of millions of unlabelled videos. This is practical for videos
available on web but acquiring such large scale of videos for real-world
applications is very expensive and laborious.
</p>
<p>Therefore, in this paper we focus on designing video augmentation for
self-supervised learning, we first analyze the best strategy to mix videos to
create a new augmented video sample. Then, the question remains, can we make
use of the other modalities in videos for data mixing? To this end, we propose
Cross-Modal Manifold Cutmix (CMMC) that inserts a video tesseract into another
video tesseract in the feature space across two different modalities. We find
that our video mixing strategy STC-mix, i.e. preliminary mixing of videos
followed by CMMC across different modalities in a video, improves the quality
of learned video representations. We conduct thorough experiments for two
downstream tasks: action recognition and video retrieval on two small scale
video datasets UCF101, and HMDB51. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our
STC-mix on NTU dataset where domain knowledge is limited.

<p>Humour is a substantial element of human affect and cognition. Its automatic
understanding can facilitate a more naturalistic human-device interaction and
the humanisation of artificial intelligence. Current methods of humour
detection are solely based on staged data making them inadequate for
'real-world' applications. We address this deficiency by introducing the novel
Passau-Spontaneous Football Coach Humour (Passau-SFCH) dataset, comprising of
about 11 hours of recordings. The Passau-SFCH dataset is annotated for the
presence of humour and its dimensions (sentiment and direction) as proposed in
Martin's Humor Style Questionnaire. We conduct a series of experiments,
employing pretrained Transformers, convolutional neural networks, and
expert-designed features. The performance of each modality (text, audio, video)
for spontaneous humour recognition is analysed and their complementarity is
investigated. Our findings suggest that for the automatic analysis of humour
and its sentiment, facial expressions are most promising, while humour
direction can be best modelled via text-based features. The results reveal
considerable differences among various subjects, highlighting the individuality
of humour usage and style. Further, we observe that a decision-level fusion
yields the best recognition result. Finally, we make our code publicly
available at https://www.github.com/EIHW/passau-sfch. The Passau-SFCH dataset

<p>Transformer-based methods have swept the benchmarks on 2D and 3D detection on
images. Because tokenization before the attention mechanism drops the spatial
information, positional encoding becomes critical for those methods. Recent
works found that encodings based on samples of the 3D viewing rays can
significantly improve the quality of multi-camera 3D object detection. We
hypothesize that 3D point locations can provide more information than rays.
Therefore, we introduce 3D point positional encoding, 3DPPE, to the 3D
detection Transformer decoder. Although 3D measurements are not available at
the inference time of monocular 3D object detection, 3DPPE uses predicted depth
to approximate the real point positions. Our hybriddepth module combines direct
and categorical depth to estimate the refined depth of each pixel. Despite the
approximation, 3DPPE achieves 46.0 mAP and 51.4 NDS on the competitive nuScenes
dataset, significantly outperforming encodings based on ray samples. We make
the codes available at https://github.com/drilistbox/3DPPE.

<p>We present a novel camera path optimization framework for the task of online
video stabilization. Typically, a stabilization pipeline consists of three
steps: motion estimating, path smoothing, and novel view rendering. Most
previous methods concentrate on motion estimation, proposing various global or
local motion models. In contrast, path optimization receives relatively less
attention, especially in the important online setting, where no future frames
are available. In this work, we adopt recent off-the-shelf high-quality deep
motion models for motion estimation to recover the camera trajectory and focus
on the latter two steps. Our network takes a short 2D camera path in a sliding
window as input and outputs the stabilizing warp field of the last frame in the
window, which warps the coming frame to its stabilized position. A hybrid loss
is well-defined to constrain the spatial and temporal consistency. In addition,
we build a motion dataset that contains stable and unstable motion pairs for
the training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art online methods both qualitatively and
quantitatively and achieves comparable performance to offline methods. Our code

<p>In diverse microscopy modalities, sensors measure only real-valued
intensities. Additionally, the sensor readouts are affected by
Poissonian-distributed photon noise. Traditional restoration algorithms
typically aim to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the original and
recovered images. This often leads to blurry outcomes with poor perceptual
quality. Recently, deep diffusion models (DDMs) have proven to be highly
capable of sampling images from the a-posteriori probability of the sought
variables, resulting in visually pleasing high-quality images. These models
have mostly been suggested for real-valued images suffering from Gaussian
noise. In this study, we generalize annealed Langevin Dynamics, a type of DDM,
to tackle the fundamental challenges in optical imaging of complex-valued
objects (and real images) affected by Poisson noise. We apply our algorithm to
various optical scenarios, such as Fourier Ptychography, Phase Retrieval, and
Poisson denoising. Our algorithm is evaluated on simulations and biological
empirical data.

<p>The past few years have witnessed the great success and prevalence of
self-supervised representation learning within the language and 2D vision
communities. However, such advancements have not been fully migrated to the
field of 3D point cloud learning. Different from existing pre-training
paradigms designed for deep point cloud feature extractors that fall into the
scope of generative modeling or contrastive learning, this paper proposes a
translative pre-training framework, namely PointVST, driven by a novel
self-supervised pretext task of cross-modal translation from 3D point clouds to
their corresponding diverse forms of 2D rendered images. More specifically, we
begin with deducing view-conditioned point-wise embeddings through the
insertion of the viewpoint indicator, and then adaptively aggregate a
view-specific global codeword, which can be further fed into subsequent 2D
convolutional translation heads for image generation. Extensive experimental

<p>Open-set segmentation is often conceived by complementing closed-set
classification with anomaly detection. Existing dense anomaly detectors operate
either through generative modelling of regular training data or by
discriminating with respect to negative training data. These two approaches
optimize different objectives and therefore exhibit different failure modes.
Consequently, we propose the first dense hybrid anomaly score that fuses
generative and discriminative cues. The proposed score can be efficiently
implemented by upgrading any semantic segmentation model with dense estimates
of data likelihood and dataset posterior. Our design is a remarkably good fit
for efficient inference on large images due to negligible computational
overhead over the closed-set baseline. The resulting dense hybrid open-set
models require negative training images that can be sampled from an auxiliary
negative dataset, from a jointly trained generative model, or from a mixture of
both sources. We evaluate our contributions on benchmarks for dense anomaly
detection and open-set segmentation. The experiments reveal strong open-set
performance in spite of negligible computational overhead.

<p>The relations expressed in user queries are vital for cross-modal information
retrieval. Relation-focused cross-modal retrieval aims to retrieve information
that corresponds to these relations, enabling effective retrieval across
different modalities. Pre-trained networks, such as Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training (CLIP), have gained significant attention and acclaim for their
exceptional performance in various cross-modal learning tasks. However, the
Vision Transformer (ViT) used in these networks is limited in its ability to
focus on image region relations. Specifically, ViT is trained to match images
with relevant descriptions at the global level, without considering the
alignment between image regions and descriptions. This paper introduces VITR, a
novel network that enhances ViT by extracting and reasoning about image region
relations based on a local encoder. VITR is comprised of two key components.
Firstly, it extends the capabilities of ViT-based cross-modal networks by
enabling them to extract and reason with region relations present in images.
Secondly, VITR incorporates a fusion module that combines the reasoned results
with global knowledge to predict similarity scores between images and
descriptions. The proposed VITR network was evaluated through experiments on
the tasks of relation-focused cross-modal information retrieval. The results
derived from the analysis of the RefCOCOg, CLEVR, and Flickr30K datasets

<p>3D visual perception tasks based on multi-camera images are essential for
autonomous driving systems. Latest work in this field performs 3D object
detection by leveraging multi-view images as an input and iteratively enhancing
object queries (object proposals) by cross-attending multi-view features.
However, individual backbone features are not updated with multi-view features
and it stays as a mere collection of the output of the single-image backbone
network. Therefore we propose 3M3D: A Multi-view, Multi-path,
Multi-representation for 3D Object Detection where we update both multi-view
features and query features to enhance the representation of the scene in both
fine panoramic view and coarse global view. Firstly, we update multi-view
features by multi-view axis self-attention. It will incorporate panoramic
information in the multi-view features and enhance understanding of the global
scene. Secondly, we update multi-view features by self-attention of the ROI
(Region of Interest) windows which encodes local finer details in the features.
It will help exchange the information not only along the multi-view axis but
also along the other spatial dimension. Lastly, we leverage the fact of
multi-representation of queries in different domains to further boost the
performance. Here we use sparse floating queries along with dense BEV (Bird's
Eye View) queries, which are later post-processed to filter duplicate
detections. Moreover, we show performance improvements on nuScenes benchmark

<p>The digitization of different components of industry and inter-connectivity
among indigenous networks have increased the risk of network attacks. Designing
an intrusion detection system to ensure security of the industrial ecosystem is
difficult as network traffic encompasses various attack types, including new
and evolving ones with minor changes. The data used to construct a predictive
model for computer networks has a skewed class distribution and limited
representation of attack types, which differ from real network traffic. These
limitations result in dataset shift, negatively impacting the machine learning
models' predictive abilities and reducing the detection rate against novel
attacks. To address the challenges, we propose a novel deep neural network
based Meta-Learning framework; INformation FUsion and Stacking Ensemble
(INFUSE) for network intrusion detection. First, a hybrid feature space is
created by integrating decision and feature spaces. Five different classifiers
are utilized to generate a pool of decision spaces. The feature space is then
enriched through a deep sparse autoencoder that learns the semantic
relationships between attacks. Finally, the deep Meta-Learner acts as an
ensemble combiner to analyze the hybrid feature space and make a final
decision. Our evaluation on stringent benchmark datasets and comparison to
existing techniques showed the effectiveness of INFUSE with an F-Score of 0.91,
Accuracy of 91.6%, and Recall of 0.94 on the Test+ dataset, and an F-Score of
0.91, Accuracy of 85.6%, and Recall of 0.87 on the stringent Test-21 dataset.
These promising results indicate the strong generalization capability and the
potential to detect network attacks.

<p>Monocular depth estimation and image deblurring are two fundamental tasks in
computer vision, given their crucial role in understanding 3D scenes.
Performing any of them by relying on a single image is an ill-posed problem.
The recent advances in the field of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DNNs)
have revolutionized many tasks in computer vision, including depth estimation
and image deblurring. When it comes to using defocused images, the depth
estimation and the recovery of the All-in-Focus (Aif) image become related
problems due to defocus physics. Despite this, most of the existing models
treat them separately. There are, however, recent models that solve these
problems simultaneously by concatenating two networks in a sequence to first
estimate the depth or defocus map and then reconstruct the focused image based
on it. We propose a DNN that solves the depth estimation and image deblurring
in parallel. Our Two-headed Depth Estimation and Deblurring Network (2HDED:NET)
extends a conventional Depth from Defocus (DFD) networks with a deblurring
branch that shares the same encoder as the depth branch. The proposed method
has been successfully tested on two benchmarks, one for indoor and the other
for outdoor scenes: NYU-v2 and Make3D. Extensive experiments with 2HDED:NET on
these benchmarks have demonstrated superior or close performances to those of
the state-of-the-art models for depth estimation and image deblurring.

<p>The recent explosion of interest in multimodal applications has resulted in a
wide selection of datasets and methods for representing and integrating
information from different modalities. Despite these empirical advances, there
remain fundamental research questions: How can we quantify the interactions
that are necessary to solve a multimodal task? Subsequently, what are the most
suitable multimodal models to capture these interactions? To answer these
questions, we propose an information-theoretic approach to quantify the degree
of redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy relating input modalities with an output
task. We term these three measures as the PID statistics of a multimodal
distribution (or PID for short), and introduce two new estimators for these PID
statistics that scale to high-dimensional distributions. To validate PID
estimation, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets where
the PID is known and on large-scale multimodal benchmarks where PID estimations
are compared with human annotations. Finally, we demonstrate their usefulness
in (1) quantifying interactions within multimodal datasets, (2) quantifying
interactions captured by multimodal models, (3) principled approaches for model
selection, and (4) three real-world case studies engaging with domain experts
in pathology, mood prediction, and robotic perception where our framework helps
to recommend strong multimodal models for each application.

<p>Purpose: To optimize the binary detection of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease (COPD) based on emphysema presence in the lung with convolutional
neural networks (CNN) by exploring manually adjusted versus automated
window-setting optimization (WSO) on computed tomography (CT) images.
</p>
<p>Methods: 7,194 CT images (3,597 with COPD; 3,597 healthy controls) from 78
subjects (43 with COPD; 35 healthy controls) were selected retrospectively
(10.2018-12.2019) and preprocessed. For each image, intensity values were
manually clipped to the emphysema window setting and a baseline 'full-range'
window setting. Class-balanced train, validation, and test sets contained
3,392, 1,114, and 2,688 images. The network backbone was optimized by comparing
various CNN architectures. Furthermore, automated WSO was implemented by adding
a customized layer to the model. The image-level area under the Receiver
Operating Characteristics curve (AUC) [lower, upper limit 95% confidence] and
P-values calculated from one-sided Mann-Whitney U-test were utilized to compare
model variations.
</p>
<p>Results: Repeated inference (n=7) on the test set showed that the DenseNet
was the most efficient backbone and achieved a mean AUC of 0.80 [0.76, 0.85]
without WSO. Comparably, with input images manually adjusted to the emphysema
window, the DenseNet model predicted COPD with a mean AUC of 0.86 [0.82, 0.89]
(P=0.03). By adding a customized WSO layer to the DenseNet, an optimal window
in the proximity of the emphysema window setting was learned automatically, and
a mean AUC of 0.82 [0.78, 0.86] was achieved.
</p>
<p>Conclusion: Detection of COPD with DenseNet models was improved by WSO of CT
data to the emphysema window setting range.

<p>Visual place recognition has gained significant attention in recent years as
a crucial technology in autonomous driving and robotics. Currently, the two
main approaches are the perspective view retrieval (P2P) paradigm and the
equirectangular image retrieval (E2E) paradigm. However, it is practical and
natural to assume that users only have consumer-grade pinhole cameras to obtain
query perspective images and retrieve them in panoramic database images from
map providers. To address this, we propose \textit{PanoVPR}, a
perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) visual place recognition framework that
employs sliding windows to eliminate feature truncation caused by hard
cropping. Specifically, PanoVPR slides windows over the entire equirectangular
image and computes feature descriptors for each window, which are then compared
to determine place similarity. Notably, our unified framework enables direct
transfer of the backbone from P2P methods without any modification, supporting
not only CNNs but also Transformers. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
derive the Pitts250k-P2E dataset from the Pitts250k and establish YQ360, latter
is the first P2E visual place recognition dataset collected by a mobile robot
platform aiming to simulate real-world task scenarios better. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PanoVPR achieves state-of-the-art performance and
obtains 3.8% and 8.0% performance gain on Pitts250k-P2E and YQ360 compared to
the previous best method, respectively. Code and datasets will be publicly
available at https://github.com/zafirshi/PanoVPR.

<p>Indirect Time of Flight LiDARs can indirectly calculate the scene's depth
from the phase shift angle between transmitted and received laser signals with
amplitudes modulated at a predefined frequency. Unfortunately, this method
generates ambiguity in calculated depth when the phase shift angle value
exceeds $2\pi$. Current state-of-the-art methods use raw samples generated
using two distinct modulation frequencies to overcome this ambiguity problem.
However, this comes at the cost of increasing laser components' stress and
raising their temperature, which reduces their lifetime and increases power
consumption. In our work, we study two different methods to recover the entire
depth range of the LiDAR using fewer raw data sample shots from a single
modulation frequency with the support of sensor's gray scale output to reduce
the laser components' stress and power consumption.

<p>There have been many image denoisers using deep neural networks, which
outperform conventional model-based methods by large margins. Recently,
self-supervised methods have attracted attention because constructing a large
real noise dataset for supervised training is an enormous burden. The most
representative self-supervised denoisers are based on blind-spot networks,
which exclude the receptive field's center pixel. However, excluding any input
pixel is abandoning some information, especially when the input pixel at the
corresponding output position is excluded. In addition, a standard blind-spot
network fails to reduce real camera noise due to the pixel-wise correlation of
noise, though it successfully removes independently distributed synthetic
noise. Hence, to realize a more practical denoiser, we propose a novel
self-supervised training framework that can remove real noise. For this, we
derive the theoretic upper bound of a supervised loss where the network is
guided by the downsampled blinded output. Also, we design a conditional
blind-spot network (C-BSN), which selectively controls the blindness of the
network to use the center pixel information. Furthermore, we exploit a random
subsampler to decorrelate noise spatially, making the C-BSN free of visual
artifacts that were often seen in downsample-based methods. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed C-BSN achieves state-of-the-art performance
on real-world datasets as a self-supervised denoiser and shows qualitatively
pleasing results without any post-processing or refinement.

<p>Enhancing the robustness of vision algorithms in real-world scenarios is
challenging. One reason is that existing robustness benchmarks are limited, as
they either rely on synthetic data or ignore the effects of individual nuisance
factors. We introduce OOD-CV-v2, a benchmark dataset that includes
out-of-distribution examples of 10 object categories in terms of pose, shape,
texture, context and the weather conditions, and enables benchmarking of models
for image classification, object detection, and 3D pose estimation. In addition
to this novel dataset, we contribute extensive experiments using popular
baseline methods, which reveal that: 1) Some nuisance factors have a much
stronger negative effect on the performance compared to others, also depending
on the vision task. 2) Current approaches to enhance robustness have only
marginal effects, and can even reduce robustness. 3) We do not observe
significant differences between convolutional and transformer architectures. We

<p>Infrared imaging systems have a vast array of potential applications in
pedestrian detection and autonomous driving, and their safety performance is of
great concern. However, few studies have explored the safety of infrared
imaging systems in real-world settings. Previous research has used physical
perturbations such as small bulbs and thermal "QR codes" to attack infrared
imaging detectors, but such methods are highly visible and lack stealthiness.
Other researchers have used hot and cold blocks to deceive infrared imaging
detectors, but this method is limited in its ability to execute attacks from
various angles. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel physical
attack called adversarial infrared blocks (AdvIB). By optimizing the physical
parameters of the adversarial infrared blocks, this method can execute a
stealthy black-box attack on thermal imaging system from various angles. We
evaluate the proposed method based on its effectiveness, stealthiness, and
robustness. Our physical tests show that the proposed method achieves a success
rate of over 80% under most distance and angle conditions, validating its
effectiveness. For stealthiness, our method involves attaching the adversarial
infrared block to the inside of clothing, enhancing its stealthiness.
Additionally, we test the proposed method on advanced detectors, and
experimental results demonstrate an average attack success rate of 51.2%,
proving its robustness. Overall, our proposed AdvIB method offers a promising
avenue for conducting stealthy, effective and robust black-box attacks on
thermal imaging system, with potential implications for real-world safety and
security applications.

<p>Reconstructing the shape and spatially varying surface appearances of a
physical-world object as well as its surrounding illumination based on 2D
images (e.g., photographs) of the object has been a long-standing problem in
computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we introduce a robust object
reconstruction pipeline combining neural based object reconstruction and
physics-based inverse rendering (PBIR). Specifically, our pipeline firstly
leverages a neural stage to produce high-quality but potentially imperfect
predictions of object shape, reflectance, and illumination. Then, in the later
stage, initialized by the neural predictions, we perform PBIR to refine the
initial results and obtain the final high-quality reconstruction. Experimental
results demonstrate our pipeline significantly outperforms existing

<p>We discover that common diffusion noise schedules do not enforce the last
timestep to have zero signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and some implementations of
diffusion samplers do not start from the last timestep. Such designs are flawed
and do not reflect the fact that the model is given pure Gaussian noise at
inference, creating a discrepancy between training and inference. We show that
the flawed design causes real problems in existing implementations. In Stable
Diffusion, it severely limits the model to only generate images with medium
brightness and prevents it from generating very bright and dark samples. We
propose a few simple fixes: (1) rescale the noise schedule to enforce zero
terminal SNR; (2) train the model with v prediction; (3) change the sampler to
always start from the last timestep; (4) rescale classifier-free guidance to
prevent over-exposure. These simple changes ensure the diffusion process is
congruent between training and inference and allow the model to generate
samples more faithful to the original data distribution.

techniques. However, the real datasets of oropharyngeal organs are often
inaccessible due to limited open-source data and patient privacy. In this work,
we propose a domain adaptive Sim-to-Real framework called IoU-Ranking
Blend-ArtFlow (IRB-AF) for image segmentation of oropharyngeal organs. The
framework includes an image blending strategy called IoU-Ranking Blend (IRB)
and style-transfer method ArtFlow. Here, IRB alleviates the problem of poor
segmentation performance caused by significant datasets domain differences;
while ArtFlow is introduced to reduce the discrepancies between datasets
further. A virtual oropharynx image dataset generated by the SOFA framework is
used as the learning subject for semantic segmentation to deal with the limited
availability of actual endoscopic images. We adapted IRB-AF with the
state-of-the-art domain adaptive segmentation models. The results demonstrate
the superior performance of our approach in further improving the segmentation
accuracy and training stability.

<p>Recent advancements in deep learning have brought significant improvements to
plant disease recognition. However, achieving satisfactory performance often
requires high-quality training datasets, which are challenging and expensive to
collect. Consequently, the practical application of current deep learning-based
methods in real-world scenarios is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality
datasets. In this paper, we argue that embracing poor datasets is viable and
aim to explicitly define the challenges associated with using these datasets.
To delve into this topic, we analyze the characteristics of high-quality
datasets, namely large-scale images and desired annotation, and contrast them
with the \emph{limited} and \emph{imperfect} nature of poor datasets.
Challenges arise when the training datasets deviate from these characteristics.
To provide a comprehensive understanding, we propose a novel and informative
taxonomy that categorizes these challenges. Furthermore, we offer a brief
overview of existing studies and approaches that address these challenges. We
believe that our paper sheds light on the importance of embracing poor
datasets, enhances the understanding of the associated challenges, and
contributes to the ambitious objective of deploying deep learning in real-world
applications. To facilitate the progress, we finally describe several
outstanding questions and point out potential future directions. Although our
primary focus is on plant disease recognition, we emphasize that the principles
of embracing and analyzing poor datasets are applicable to a wider range of
domains, including agriculture.

<p>Audio-visual person recognition (AVPR) has received extensive attention.
However, most datasets used for AVPR research so far are collected in
constrained environments, and thus cannot reflect the true performance of AVPR
systems in real-world scenarios. To meet the request for research on AVPR in
unconstrained conditions, this paper presents a multi-genre AVPR dataset
collected `in the wild', named CN-Celeb-AV. This dataset contains more than
419k video segments from 1,136 persons from public media. In particular, we put
more emphasis on two real-world complexities: (1) data in multiple genres; (2)
segments with partial information. A comprehensive study was conducted to
compare CN-Celeb-AV with two popular public AVPR benchmark datasets, and the
results demonstrated that CN-Celeb-AV is more in line with real-world scenarios
and can be regarded as a new benchmark dataset for AVPR research. The dataset
also involves a development set that can be used to boost the performance of
AVPR systems in real-life situations. The dataset is free for researchers and

<p>Machine learning provides a powerful tool for building socially compliant
robotic systems that go beyond simple predictive models of human behavior. By
observing and understanding human interactions from past experiences, learning
can enable effective social navigation behaviors directly from data. In this
paper, our goal is to develop methods for training policies for socially
unobtrusive navigation, such that robots can navigate among humans in ways that
don't disturb human behavior. We introduce a definition for such behavior based
on the counterfactual perturbation of the human: if the robot had not intruded
into the space, would the human have acted in the same way? By minimizing this
counterfactual perturbation, we can induce robots to behave in ways that do not
alter the natural behavior of humans in the shared space. Instantiating this
principle requires training policies to minimize their effect on human
behavior, and this in turn requires data that allows us to model the behavior
of humans in the presence of robots. Therefore, our approach is based on two
key contributions. First, we collect a large dataset where an indoor mobile
robot interacts with human bystanders. Second, we utilize this dataset to train
policies that minimize counterfactual perturbation. We provide supplementary
videos and make publicly available the largest-of-its-kind visual navigation
dataset on our project page.

<p>3D shape modeling is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and requires years of
expertise. To facilitate 3D shape modeling, we propose a 3D shape generation
network that takes a 3D VR sketch as a condition. We assume that sketches are
created by novices without art training and aim to reconstruct geometrically
realistic 3D shapes of a given category. To handle potential sketch ambiguity,
our method creates multiple 3D shapes that align with the original sketch's
structure. We carefully design our method, training the model step-by-step and
leveraging multi-modal 3D shape representation to support training with limited
training data. To guarantee the realism of generated 3D shapes we leverage the
normalizing flow that models the distribution of the latent space of 3D shapes.
To encourage the fidelity of the generated 3D shapes to an input sketch, we
propose a dedicated loss that we deploy at different stages of the training
process. The code is available at https://github.com/Rowl1ng/3Dsketch2shape.

<p>The generation of virtual populations (VPs) of anatomy is essential for
conducting in silico trials of medical devices. Typically, the generated VP
should capture sufficient variability while remaining plausible and should
reflect the specific characteristics and demographics of the patients observed
in real populations. In several applications, it is desirable to synthesise
virtual populations in a \textit{controlled} manner, where relevant covariates
are used to conditionally synthesise virtual populations that fit a specific
target population/characteristics. We propose to equip a conditional
variational autoencoder (cVAE) with normalising flows to boost the flexibility
and complexity of the approximate posterior learnt, leading to enhanced
flexibility for controllable synthesis of VPs of anatomical structures. We
demonstrate the performance of our conditional flow VAE using a data set of
cardiac left ventricles acquired from 2360 patients, with associated
demographic information and clinical measurements (used as
covariates/conditional information). The results obtained indicate the
superiority of the proposed method for conditional synthesis of virtual
populations of cardiac left ventricles relative to a cVAE. Conditional
synthesis performance was evaluated in terms of generalisation and specificity
errors and in terms of the ability to preserve clinically relevant biomarkers
in synthesised VPs, that is, the left ventricular blood pool and myocardial
volume, relative to the real observed population.

<p>Few-shot classification aims to adapt to new tasks with limited labeled
examples. To fully use the accessible data, recent methods explore suitable
measures for the similarity between the query and support images and better
high-dimensional features with meta-training and pre-training strategies.
However, the potential of multi-modality information has barely been explored,
which may bring promising improvement for few-shot classification. In this
paper, we propose a Language-guided Prototypical Network (LPN) for few-shot
classification, which leverages the complementarity of vision and language
modalities via two parallel branches. Concretely, to introduce language
modality with limited samples in the visual task, we leverage a pre-trained
text encoder to extract class-level text features directly from class names
while processing images with a conventional image encoder. Then, a
language-guided decoder is introduced to obtain text features corresponding to
each image by aligning class-level features with visual features. In addition,
to take advantage of class-level features and prototypes, we build a refined
prototypical head that generates robust prototypes in the text branch for
follow-up measurement. Finally, we aggregate the visual and text logits to
calibrate the deviation of a single modality. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the competitiveness of LPN against state-of-the-art methods on benchmark
datasets.

<p>Visual Emotion Analysis (VEA) aims at predicting people's emotional responses
to visual stimuli. This is a promising, yet challenging, task in affective
computing, which has drawn increasing attention in recent years. Most of the
existing work in this area focuses on feature design, while little attention
has been paid to dataset construction. In this work, we introduce EmoSet, the
first large-scale visual emotion dataset annotated with rich attributes, which
is superior to existing datasets in four aspects: scale, annotation richness,
diversity, and data balance. EmoSet comprises 3.3 million images in total, with
118,102 of these images carefully labeled by human annotators, making it five
times larger than the largest existing dataset. EmoSet includes images from
social networks, as well as artistic images, and it is well balanced between
different emotion categories. Motivated by psychological studies, in addition
to emotion category, each image is also annotated with a set of describable
emotion attributes: brightness, colorfulness, scene type, object class, facial
expression, and human action, which can help understand visual emotions in a
precise and interpretable way. The relevance of these emotion attributes is
validated by analyzing the correlations between them and visual emotion, as
well as by designing an attribute module to help visual emotion recognition. We
believe EmoSet will bring some key insights and encourage further research in
visual emotion analysis and understanding. Project page:

<p>Image-text contrastive models such as CLIP are useful for a variety of
downstream applications including zero-shot classification, image-text
retrieval and transfer learning. However, these contrastively trained
vision-language models often fail on compositional visio-linguistic tasks such
as Winoground with performance equivalent to random chance. In our paper, we
address this issue and propose a sample-efficient light-weight method called
SDS-CLIP to improve the compositional visio-linguistic reasoning capabilities
of CLIP. The core idea of our method is to use differentiable image
parameterizations to fine-tune CLIP with a distillation objective from large
text-to-image generative models such as Stable-Diffusion which are relatively
good at visio-linguistic reasoning tasks. On the challenging Winoground
compositional reasoning benchmark, our method improves the absolute
visio-linguistic performance of different CLIP models by up to 7%, while on the
ARO dataset, our method improves the visio-linguistic performance by upto 3%.
As a byproduct of inducing visio-linguistic reasoning into CLIP, we also find
that the zero-shot performance improves marginally on a variety of downstream
datasets. Our method reinforces that carefully designed distillation objectives
from generative models can be leveraged to extend existing contrastive
image-text models with improved visio-linguistic reasoning capabilities.

<p>Recently, lightweight Vision Transformers (ViTs) demonstrate superior
performance and lower latency compared with lightweight Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained mobile devices. This improvement is
usually attributed to the multi-head self-attention module, which enables the
model to learn global representations. However, the architectural disparities
between lightweight ViTs and lightweight CNNs have not been adequately
examined. In this study, we revisit the efficient design of lightweight CNNs
and emphasize their potential for mobile devices. We incrementally enhance the
mobile-friendliness of a standard lightweight CNN, specifically MobileNetV3, by
integrating the efficient architectural choices of lightweight ViTs. This ends
up with a new family of pure lightweight CNNs, namely RepViT. Extensive
experiments show that RepViT outperforms existing state-of-the-art lightweight
ViTs and exhibits favorable latency in various vision tasks. On ImageNet,
RepViT achieves over 80\% top-1 accuracy with nearly 1ms latency on an iPhone

<p>The vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial samples has been a
major impediment to their broad applications, despite their success in various
fields. Recently, some works suggested that adversarially-trained models
emphasize the importance of low-frequency information to achieve higher
robustness. While several attempts have been made to leverage this frequency
characteristic, they have all faced the issue that applying low-pass filters
directly to input images leads to irreversible loss of discriminative
information and poor generalizability to datasets with distinct frequency
features. This paper presents a plug-and-play module called the Frequency
Preference Control Module that adaptively reconfigures the low- and
high-frequency components of intermediate feature representations, providing
better utilization of frequency in robust learning. Empirical studies show that
our proposed module can be easily incorporated into any adversarial training
framework, further improving model robustness across different architectures
and datasets. Additionally, experiments were conducted to examine how the
frequency bias of robust models impacts the adversarial training process and
its final robustness, revealing interesting insights.

<p>Scene coordinates regression (SCR), i.e., predicting 3D coordinates for every
pixel of a given image, has recently shown promising potential. However,
existing methods remain mostly scene-specific or limited to small scenes and
thus hardly scale to realistic datasets. In this paper, we propose a new
paradigm where a single generic SCR model is trained once to be then deployed
to new test scenes, regardless of their scale and without further finetuning.
For a given query image, it collects inputs from off-the-shelf image retrieval
techniques and Structure-from-Motion databases: a list of relevant database
images with sparse pointwise 2D-3D annotations. The model is based on the
transformer architecture and can take a variable number of images and sparse
2D-3D annotations as input. It is trained on a few diverse datasets and
significantly outperforms other scene regression approaches on several
benchmarks, including scene-specific models, for visual localization. In
particular, we set a new state of the art on the Cambridge localization
benchmark, even outperforming feature-matching-based approaches.

<p>Transformer-based detection and segmentation methods use a list of learned

learn to predict the location and category of one specific object from each
query. We empirically find that random convex combinations of the learned
queries are still good for the corresponding models. We then propose to learn a
convex combination with dynamic coefficients based on the high-level semantics
of the image. The generated dynamic queries, named modulated queries, better
capture the prior of object locations and categories in the different images.
Equipped with our modulated queries, a wide range of DETR-based models achieve

<p>The existing deepfake detection methods have reached a bottleneck in
generalizing to unseen forgeries and manipulation approaches. Based on the
observation that the deepfake detectors exhibit a preference for overfitting
the specific primary regions in input, this paper enhances the generalization
capability from a novel regularization perspective. This can be simply achieved
by augmenting the images through primary region removal, thereby preventing the
detector from over-relying on data bias. Our method consists of two stages,
namely the static localization for primary region maps, as well as the dynamic
exploitation of primary region masks. The proposed method can be seamlessly
integrated into different backbones without affecting their inference
efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments over three widely used deepfake
datasets - DFDC, DF-1.0, and Celeb-DF with five backbones. Our method

<p>CT images corrupted by metal artifacts have serious negative effects on
clinical diagnosis. Considering the difficulty of collecting paired data with
ground truth in clinical settings, unsupervised methods for metal artifact
reduction are of high interest. However, it is difficult for previous
unsupervised methods to retain structural information from CT images while
handling the non-local characteristics of metal artifacts. To address these
challenges, we proposed a novel Dense Transformer based Enhanced Coding Network
(DTEC-Net) for unsupervised metal artifact reduction. Specifically, we
introduce a Hierarchical Disentangling Encoder, supported by the high-order
dense process, and transformer to obtain densely encoded sequences with
long-range correspondence. Then, we present a second-order disentanglement
method to improve the dense sequence's decoding process. Extensive experiments
and model discussions illustrate DTEC-Net's effectiveness, which outperforms
the previous state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark dataset, and greatly
reduces metal artifacts while restoring richer texture details.

<p>Unsupervised anomaly detection in medical images such as chest radiographs is
stepping into the spotlight as it mitigates the scarcity of the labor-intensive
and costly expert annotation of anomaly data. However, nearly all existing
methods are formulated as a one-class classification trained only on
representations from the normal class and discard a potentially significant
portion of the unlabeled data. This paper focuses on a more practical setting,
dual distribution anomaly detection for chest X-rays, using the entire training
data, including both normal and unlabeled images. Inspired by a modern
self-supervised vision transformer model trained using partial image inputs to
reconstruct missing image regions -- we propose AMAE, a two-stage algorithm for
adaptation of the pre-trained masked autoencoder (MAE). Starting from MAE
initialization, AMAE first creates synthetic anomalies from only normal
training images and trains a lightweight classifier on frozen transformer
features. Subsequently, we propose an adaptation strategy to leverage unlabeled
images containing anomalies. The adaptation scheme is accomplished by assigning
pseudo-labels to unlabeled images and using two separate MAE based modules to
model the normative and anomalous distributions of pseudo-labeled images. The
effectiveness of the proposed adaptation strategy is evaluated with different
anomaly ratios in an unlabeled training set. AMAE leads to consistent
performance gains over competing self-supervised and dual distribution anomaly
detection methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on three public chest X-ray
benchmarks: RSNA, NIH-CXR, and VinDr-CXR.

<p>Training an image captioner without annotated image-sentence pairs has gained
traction in recent years. Previous approaches can be categorized into two
strategies: crawling sentences from mismatching corpora and aligning them with
the given images as pseudo annotations, or pre-training the captioner using
external image-text pairs. However, the aligning setting seems to reach its
performance limit due to the quality problem of pairs, and pre-training
requires significant computational resources. To address these challenges, we
propose a new strategy ``LPM + retrieval-augmented learning" where the prior
knowledge from large pre-trained models (LPMs) is leveraged as supervision, and
a retrieval process is integrated to further reinforce its effectiveness.
Specifically, we introduce Retrieval-augmented Pseudo Sentence Generation
(RaPSG), which adopts an efficient approach to retrieve highly relevant short
region descriptions from the mismatching corpora and use them to generate a
variety of pseudo sentences with distinct representations as well as high
quality via LPMs. In addition, a fluency filter and a CLIP-guided training
objective are further introduced to facilitate model optimization. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method surpasses the SOTA pre-training model
(Flamingo3B) by achieving a CIDEr score of 78.1 (+5.1) while utilizing only
0.3% of its trainable parameters (1.3B VS 33M). Importantly, our approach
eliminates the need of computationally expensive pre-training processes on
external datasets (e.g., the requirement of 312M image-text pairs for
Flamingo3B). We further show that with a simple extension, the generated pseudo
sentences can be deployed as weak supervision to boost the 1% semi-supervised
image caption benchmark up to 93.4 CIDEr score (+8.9) which showcases the
versatility and effectiveness of our approach.
