<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07185">Margin-bounded Confidence Scores for Out-of-Distribution Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lakpa D. Tamang, Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek, Richard Dazeley, Sunil Aryal</p>
<p>Abstract: In many critical Machine Learning applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image diagnosis, the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is as crucial as accurately classifying in-distribution (ID) inputs. Recently Outlier Exposure (OE) based methods have shown promising results in detecting OOD inputs via model fine-tuning with auxiliary outlier data. However, most of the previous OE-based approaches emphasize more on synthesizing extra outlier samples or introducing regularization to diversify OOD sample space, which is rather unquantifiable in practice. In this work, we propose a novel and straightforward method called Margin bounded Confidence Scores (MaCS) to address the nontrivial OOD detection problem by enlarging the disparity between ID and OOD scores, which in turn makes the decision boundary more compact facilitating effective segregation with a simple threshold. Specifically, we augment the learning objective of an OE regularized classifier with a supplementary constraint, which penalizes high confidence scores for OOD inputs compared to that of ID and significantly enhances the OOD detection performance while maintaining the ID classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets for image classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (S.O.T.A) methods on various benchmarking metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Camila Gonz\'alez, Yanis Miraoui, Yiran Fan, Ehsan Adeli, Kilian M. Pohl</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning can help uncover patterns in resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) associated with psychiatric disorders and personal traits. Yet the problem of interpreting deep learning findings is rarely more evident than in fMRI analyses, as the data is sensitive to scanning effects and inherently difficult to visualize. We propose a simple approach to mitigate these challenges grounded on sparsification and self-supervision. Instead of extracting post-hoc feature attributions to uncover functional connections that are important to the target task, we identify a small subset of highly informative connections during training and occlude the rest. To this end, we jointly train a (1) sparse input mask, (2) variational autoencoder (VAE), and (3) downstream classifier in an end-to-end fashion. While we need a portion of labeled samples to train the classifier, we optimize the sparse mask and VAE with unlabeled data from additional acquisition sites, retaining only the input features that generalize well. We evaluate our method - Sparsely Reconstructed Graphs (SpaRG) - on the public ABIDE dataset for the task of sex classification, training with labeled cases from 18 sites and adapting the model to two additional out-of-distribution sites with a portion of unlabeled samples. For a relatively coarse parcellation (64 regions), SpaRG utilizes only 1% of the original connections while improving the classification accuracy across domains. Our code can be found at github.com/yanismiraoui/SpaRG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marian Lupascu, Ionut Mironica, Mihai-Sorin Stupariu</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating visually appealing composites requires optimizing both text and background for compatibility. Previous methods have focused on simple design strategies, such as changing text color or adding background shapes for contrast. These approaches are often destructive, altering text color or partially obstructing the background image. Another method involves placing design elements in non-salient and contrasting regions, but this isn't always effective, especially with patterned backgrounds. To address these challenges, we propose a generative approach using a diffusion model. This method ensures the altered regions beneath design assets exhibit low saliency while enhancing contrast, thereby improving the visibility of the design asset.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07266">Spiking GS: Towards High-Accuracy and Low-Cost Surface Reconstruction via Spiking Neuron-based Gaussian Splatting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Weixing Zhang, Zongrui Li, De Ma, Huajin Tang, Xudong Jiang, Qian Zheng, Gang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting is capable of reconstructing 3D scenes in minutes. Despite recent advances in improving surface reconstruction accuracy, the reconstructed results still exhibit bias and suffer from inefficiency in storage and training. This paper provides a different observation on the cause of the inefficiency and the reconstruction bias, which is attributed to the integration of the low-opacity parts (LOPs) of the generated Gaussians. We show that LOPs consist of Gaussians with overall low-opacity (LOGs) and the low-opacity tails (LOTs) of Gaussians. We propose Spiking GS to reduce such two types of LOPs by integrating spiking neurons into the Gaussian Splatting pipeline. Specifically, we introduce global and local full-precision integrate-and-fire spiking neurons to the opacity and representation function of flattened 3D Gaussians, respectively. Furthermore, we enhance the density control strategy with spiking neurons' thresholds and an new criterion on the scale of Gaussians. Our method can represent more accurate reconstructed surfaces at a lower cost. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/shippoT/Spiking_GS}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Li, Yiheng Li, Xulei Yang, Mengying Yu, Zihang Huang, Xiaojun Wu, Chai Kiat Yeo</p>
<p>Abstract: In the landscape of autonomous driving, Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation has recently garnered substantial academic attention, serving as a transformative framework for the fusion of multi-modal sensor inputs. This BEV paradigm effectively shifts the sensor fusion challenge from a rule-based methodology to a data-centric approach, thereby facilitating more nuanced feature extraction from an array of heterogeneous sensors. Notwithstanding its evident merits, the computational overhead associated with BEV-based techniques often mandates high-capacity hardware infrastructures, thus posing challenges for practical, real-world implementations. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a novel content-aware multi-modal joint input pruning technique. Our method leverages BEV as a shared anchor to algorithmically identify and eliminate non-essential sensor regions prior to their introduction into the perception model's backbone. We validatethe efficacy of our approach through extensive experiments on the NuScenes dataset, demonstrating substantial computational efficiency without sacrificing perception accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to alleviate the computational burden from the input pruning point.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangyikang Wang, Hubery Yin, Yuejiang Dong, Huminhao Zhu, Chao Zhang, Hanbin Zhao, Hui Qian, Chen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The inversion of diffusion model sampling, which aims to find the corresponding initial noise of a sample, plays a critical role in various tasks. Recently, several heuristic exact inversion samplers have been proposed to address the inexact inversion issue in a training-free manner. However, the theoretical properties of these heuristic samplers remain unknown and they often exhibit mediocre sampling quality. In this paper, we introduce a generic formulation, \emph{Bidirectional Explicit Linear Multi-step} (BELM) samplers, of the exact inversion samplers, which includes all previously proposed heuristic exact inversion samplers as special cases. The BELM formulation is derived from the variable-stepsize-variable-formula linear multi-step method via integrating a bidirectional explicit constraint. We highlight this bidirectional explicit constraint is the key of mathematically exact inversion. We systematically investigate the Local Truncation Error (LTE) within the BELM framework and show that the existing heuristic designs of exact inversion samplers yield sub-optimal LTE. Consequently, we propose the Optimal BELM (O-BELM) sampler through the LTE minimization approach. We conduct additional analysis to substantiate the theoretical stability and global convergence property of the proposed optimal sampler. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our O-BELM sampler establishes the exact inversion property while achieving high-quality sampling. Additional experiments in image editing and image interpolation highlight the extensive potential of applying O-BELM in varying applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research on non-verbal behavior generation for social interactive agents focuses mainly on the believability and synchronization of non-verbal cues with speech. However, existing models, predominantly based on deep learning architectures, often perpetuate biases inherent in the training data. This raises ethical concerns, depending on the intended application of these agents. This paper addresses these issues by first examining the influence of gender on facial non-verbal behaviors. We concentrate on gaze, head movements, and facial expressions. We introduce a classifier capable of discerning the gender of a speaker from their non-verbal cues. This classifier achieves high accuracy on both real behavior data, extracted using state-of-the-art tools, and synthetic data, generated from a model developed in previous work.Building upon this work, we present a new model, FairGenderGen, which integrates a gender discriminator and a gradient reversal layer into our previous behavior generation model. This new model generates facial non-verbal behaviors from speech features, mitigating gender sensitivity in the generated behaviors. Our experiments demonstrate that the classifier, developed in the initial phase, is no longer effective in distinguishing the gender of the speaker from the generated non-verbal behaviors.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07278">Retrieval Replace Reduction: An effective visual token reduction method via semantic match</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingen Liu, Fan Wu, Ruihui Li, Zhuo Tang, Kenli Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various tasks without requiring training from scratch. However, they face significant computational and memory constraints, particularly when processing multimodal inputs that exceed context length, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we introduce a new approach, \textbf{TRSM} (\textbf{T}oken \textbf{R}eduction via \textbf{S}emantic \textbf{M}atch), which effectively reduces the number of visual tokens without compromising MLLM performance. Inspired by how humans process multimodal tasks, TRSM leverages semantic information from one modality to match relevant semantics in another, reducing the number of visual tokens.Specifically, to retain task relevant visual tokens, we use the text prompt as a query vector to retrieve the most similar vectors from the visual prompt and merge them with the text tokens. Based on experimental results, when applied to LLaVA-1.5\cite{liu2023}, our approach compresses the visual tokens by 20\%, achieving comparable performance across diverse visual question-answering and reasoning tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07298">Enhancing Performance of Point Cloud Completion Networks with Consistency Loss</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Tirta Wijaya, Christofel Rio Goenawan, Seung-Hyun Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud completion networks are conventionally trained to minimize the disparities between the completed point cloud and the ground-truth counterpart. However, an incomplete object-level point cloud can have multiple valid completion solutions when it is examined in isolation. This one-to-many mapping issue can cause contradictory supervision signals to the network because the loss function may produce different values for identical input-output pairs of the network. In many cases, this issue could adversely affect the network optimization process. In this work, we propose to enhance the conventional learning objective using a novel completion consistency loss to mitigate the one-to-many mapping problem. Specifically, the proposed consistency loss ensure that a point cloud completion network generates a coherent completion solution for incomplete objects originating from the same source point cloud. Experimental results across multiple well-established datasets and benchmarks demonstrated the proposed completion consistency loss have excellent capability to enhance the completion performance of various existing networks without any modification to the design of the networks. The proposed consistency loss enhances the performance of the point completion network without affecting the inference speed, thereby increasing the accuracy of point cloud completion. Notably, a state-of-the-art point completion network trained with the proposed consistency loss can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the challenging new MVP dataset.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07303">Rectified Diffusion: Straightness Is Not Your Need in Rectified Flow</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fu-Yun Wang, Ling Yang, Zhaoyang Huang, Mengdi Wang, Hongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have greatly improved visual generation but are hindered by slow generation speed due to the computationally intensive nature of solving generative ODEs. Rectified flow, a widely recognized solution, improves generation speed by straightening the ODE path. Its key components include: 1) using the diffusion form of flow-matching, 2) employing $\boldsymbol v$-prediction, and 3) performing rectification (a.k.a. reflow). In this paper, we argue that the success of rectification primarily lies in using a pretrained diffusion model to obtain matched pairs of noise and samples, followed by retraining with these matched noise-sample pairs. Based on this, components 1) and 2) are unnecessary. Furthermore, we highlight that straightness is not an essential training target for rectification; rather, it is a specific case of flow-matching models. The more critical training target is to achieve a first-order approximate ODE path, which is inherently curved for models like DDPM and Sub-VP. Building on this insight, we propose Rectified Diffusion, which generalizes the design space and application scope of rectification to encompass the broader category of diffusion models, rather than being restricted to flow-matching models. We validate our method on Stable Diffusion v1-5 and Stable Diffusion XL. Our method not only greatly simplifies the training procedure of rectified flow-based previous works (e.g., InstaFlow) but also achieves superior performance with even lower training cost.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Sarto, Nicholas Moratelli, Marcella Cornia, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in caption generation, existing evaluation metrics often fail to capture the full quality or fine-grained details of captions. This is mainly due to their reliance on non-specific human-written references or noisy pre-training data. Still, finding an effective metric is crucial not only for captions evaluation but also for the generation phase. Metrics can indeed play a key role in the fine-tuning stage of captioning models, ultimately enhancing the quality of the generated captions. In this paper, we propose PAC-S++, a learnable metric that leverages the CLIP model, pre-trained on both web-collected and cleaned data and regularized through additional pairs of generated visual and textual positive samples. Exploiting this stronger and curated pre-training, we also apply PAC-S++ as a reward in the Self-Critical Sequence Training (SCST) stage typically employed to fine-tune captioning models. Extensive experiments on different image and video datasets highlight the effectiveness of PAC-S++ compared to popular metrics for the task, including its sensitivity to object hallucinations. Furthermore, we show that integrating PAC-S++ into the fine-tuning stage of a captioning model results in semantically richer captions with fewer repetitions and grammatical errors. Evaluations on out-of-domain benchmarks further demonstrate the efficacy of our fine-tuning approach in enhancing model capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riley C. W. O'Neill, Katrina Yezzi Woodley, Jeff Calder, Peter J. Olver</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern archaeological methods increasingly utilize 3D virtual representations of objects, computationally intensive analyses, high resolution scanning, large datasets, and machine learning. With higher resolution scans, challenges surrounding computational power, memory, and file storage quickly arise. Processing and analyzing high resolution scans often requires memory-intensive workflows, which are infeasible for most computers and increasingly necessitate the use of super-computers or innovative methods for processing on standard computers. Here we introduce a novel protocol for en-masse micro-CT scanning of small objects with a {\em mostly-automated} processing workflow that functions in memory-limited settings. We scanned 1,112 animal bone fragments using just 10 micro-CT scans, which were post-processed into individual PLY files. Notably, our methods can be applied to any object (with discernible density from the packaging material) making this method applicable to a variety of inquiries and fields including paleontology, geology, electrical engineering, and materials science. Further, our methods may immediately be adopted by scanning institutes to pool customer orders together and offer more affordable scanning. The work presented herein is part of a larger program facilitated by the international and multi-disciplinary research consortium known as Anthropological and Mathematical Analysis of Archaeological and Zooarchaeological Evidence (AMAAZE). AMAAZE unites experts in anthropology, mathematics, and computer science to develop new methods for mass-scale virtual archaeological research. Overall, our new scanning method and processing workflows lay the groundwork and set the standard for future mass-scale, high resolution scanning studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Negar Nejatishahidin, Madhukar Reddy Vongala, Jana Kosecka</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning about spatial relationships between objects is essential for many real-world robotic tasks, such as fetch-and-delivery, object rearrangement, and object search. The ability to detect and disambiguate different objects and identify their location is key to successful completion of these tasks. Several recent works have used powerful Vision and Language Models (VLMs) to unlock this capability in robotic agents. In this paper we introduce a structured probabilistic approach that integrates rich 3D geometric features with state-of-the-art open-vocabulary object detectors to enhance spatial reasoning for robotic perception. The approach is evaluated and compared against zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art Vision and Language Models (VLMs) on spatial reasoning tasks. To enable this comparison, we annotate spatial clauses in real-world RGB-D Active Vision Dataset [1] and conduct experiments on this and the synthetic Semantic Abstraction [2] dataset. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing superior performance of grounding spatial relations over state of the art open-source VLMs by more than 20%.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07401">Enhancing Soccer Camera Calibration Through Keypoint Exploitation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolay S. Falaleev, Ruilong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate camera calibration is essential for transforming 2D images from camera sensors into 3D world coordinates, enabling precise scene geometry interpretation and supporting sports analytics tasks such as player tracking, offside detection, and performance analysis. However, obtaining a sufficient number of high-quality point pairs remains a significant challenge for both traditional and deep learning-based calibration methods. This paper introduces a multi-stage pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging the structural features of the football pitch. Our approach significantly increases the number of usable points for calibration by exploiting line-line and line-conic intersections, points on the conics, and other geometric features. To mitigate the impact of imperfect annotations, we employ data fitting techniques. Our pipeline utilizes deep learning for keypoint and line detection and incorporates geometric constraints based on real-world pitch dimensions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karan Samel, Apoorva Beedu, Nitish Sontakke, Irfan Essa</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundational models are able to generate text outputs given prompt instructions and text, audio, or image inputs. Recently these models have been combined to perform tasks on video, such as video summarization. Such video foundation models perform pre-training by aligning outputs from each modality-specific model into the same embedding space. Then the embeddings from each model are used within a language model, which is fine-tuned on a desired instruction set. Aligning each modality during pre-training is computationally expensive and prevents rapid testing of different base modality models. During fine-tuning, evaluation is carried out within in-domain videos where it is hard to understand the generalizability and data efficiency of these methods. To alleviate these issues we propose a plug-and-play video language model. It directly uses the texts generated from each input modality into the language model, avoiding pre-training alignment overhead. Instead of fine-tuning we leverage few-shot instruction adaptation strategies. We compare the performance versus the computational costs for our plug-and-play style method and baseline tuning methods. Finally, we explore the generalizability of each method during domain shift and present insights on what data is useful when training data is limited. Through this analysis, we present practical insights on how to leverage multi-modal foundational models for effective results given realistic compute and data limitations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonid Pogorelyuk, Stefan T. Radev</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new contrastive objective for learning overcomplete pixel-level features that are invariant to motion blur. Other invariances (e.g., pose, illumination, or weather) can be learned by applying the corresponding transformations on unlabeled images during self-supervised training. We showcase that a simple U-Net trained with our objective can produce local features useful for aligning the frames of an unseen video captured with a moving camera under realistic and challenging conditions. Using a carefully designed toy example, we also show that the overcomplete pixels can encode the identity of objects in an image and the pixel coordinates relative to these objects.</p>

<p>Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction has emerged as a prominent area of research, attracting significant attention from academia and industry alike. Among the various applications of 3D reconstruction, facial reconstruction poses some of the most formidable challenges. Additionally, each individuals facial structure is unique, requiring algorithms to be robust enough to handle this variability while maintaining fidelity to the original features. This article presents a comprehensive dataset of 3D meshes featuring a diverse range of facial structures and corresponding facial landmarks. The dataset comprises 188 3D facial meshes, including 73 from female candidates and 114 from male candidates. It encompasses a broad representation of ethnic backgrounds, with contributions from 45 different ethnicities, ensuring a rich diversity in facial characteristics. Each facial mesh is accompanied by key points that accurately annotate the relevant features, facilitating precise analysis and manipulation. This dataset is particularly valuable for applications such as facial re targeting, the study of facial structure components, and real-time person representation in video streams. By providing a robust resource for researchers and developers, it aims to advance the field of 3D facial reconstruction and related technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Korycki, Cory Yeaton, Gregory S. Gilbert, Colleen Josephson, Steve McGuire</p>
<p>Abstract: Forest mapping provides critical observational data needed to understand the dynamics of forest environments. Notably, tree diameter at breast height (DBH) is a metric used to estimate forest biomass and carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) sequestration. Manual methods of forest mapping are labor intensive and time consuming, a bottleneck for large-scale mapping efforts. Automated mapping relies on acquiring dense forest reconstructions, typically in the form of point clouds. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and mobile laser scanning (MLS) generate point clouds using expensive LiDAR sensing, and have been used successfully to estimate tree diameter. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are an emergent technology enabling photorealistic, vision-based reconstruction by training a neural network on a sparse set of input views. In this paper, we present a comparison of MLS and NeRF forest reconstructions for the purpose of trunk diameter estimation in a mixed-evergreen Redwood forest. In addition, we propose an improved DBH-estimation method using convex-hull modeling. Using this approach, we achieved 1.68 cm RMSE, which consistently outperformed standard cylinder modeling approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Przemyslaw Polewski, Jacquelyn Shelton, Wei Yao, Marco Heurich</p>
<p>Abstract: Instance segmentation is a core computer vision task with great practical significance. Recent advances, driven by large-scale benchmark datasets, have yielded good general-purpose Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods. Natural Resource Monitoring (NRM) utilizes remote sensing imagery with generally known scale and containing multiple overlapping instances of the same class, wherein the object contours are jagged and highly irregular. This is in stark contrast with the regular man-made objects found in classic benchmark datasets. We address this problem and propose a novel instance segmentation method geared towards NRM imagery. We formulate the problem as Bayesian maximum a posteriori inference which, in learning the individual object contours, incorporates shape, location, and position priors from state-of-the-art CNN architectures, driving a simultaneous level-set evolution of multiple object contours. We employ loose coupling between the CNNs that supply the priors and the active contour process, allowing a drop-in replacement of new network architectures. Moreover, we introduce a novel prior for contour shape, namely, a class of Deep Shape Models based on architectures from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These Deep Shape Models are in essence a non-linear generalization of the classic Eigenshape formulation. In experiments, we tackle the challenging, real-world problem of segmenting individual dead tree crowns and delineating precise contours. We compare our method to two leading general-purpose instance segmentation methods - Mask R-CNN and K-net - on color infrared aerial imagery. Results show our approach to significantly outperform both methods in terms of reconstruction quality of tree crown contours. Furthermore, use of the GAN-based deep shape model prior yields significant improvement of all results over the vanilla Eigenshape prior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ange Lou, Yamin Li, Yike Zhang, Jack Noble</p>
<p>Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is crucial for tracking and reconstruction algorithms, particularly in the context of surgical videos. However, the inherent challenges in directly obtaining ground truth depth maps during surgery render supervised learning approaches impractical. While many self-supervised methods based on Structure from Motion (SfM) have shown promising results, they rely heavily on high-quality camera motion and require optimization on a per-patient basis. These limitations can be mitigated by leveraging the current state-of-the-art foundational model for depth estimation, Depth Anything. However, when directly applied to surgical scenes, Depth Anything struggles with issues such as blurring, bleeding, and reflections, resulting in suboptimal performance. This paper presents a fine-tuning of the Depth Anything model specifically for the surgical domain, aiming to deliver more accurate pixel-wise depth maps tailored to the unique requirements and challenges of surgical environments. Our fine-tuning approach significantly improves the model's performance in surgical scenes, reducing errors related to blurring and reflections, and achieving a more reliable and precise depth estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alina Ciocarlan, Sylvie Le H\'egarat-Mascle, Sidonie Lefebvre, Arnaud Woiselle</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting small targets in infrared images poses significant challenges in defense applications due to the presence of complex backgrounds and the small size of the targets. Traditional object detection methods often struggle to balance high detection rates with low false alarm rates, especially when dealing with small objects. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that combines a contrario paradigm with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to improve Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD). On the one hand, the integration of an a contrario criterion into a YOLO detection head enhances feature map responses for small and unexpected objects while effectively controlling false alarms. On the other hand, we explore SSL techniques to overcome the challenges of limited annotated data, common in IRSTD tasks. Specifically, we benchmark several representative SSL strategies for their effectiveness in improving small object detection performance. Our findings show that instance discrimination methods outperform masked image modeling strategies when applied to YOLO-based small object detection. Moreover, the combination of the a contrario and SSL paradigms leads to significant performance improvements, narrowing the gap with state-of-the-art segmentation methods and even outperforming them in frugal settings. This two-pronged approach offers a robust solution for improving IRSTD performance, particularly under challenging conditions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07442">Self-Supervised Learning for Real-World Object Detection: a Survey</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alina Ciocarlan, Sidonie Lefebvre, Sylvie Le H\'egarat-Mascle, Arnaud Woiselle</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising approach in computer vision, enabling networks to learn meaningful representations from large unlabeled datasets. SSL methods fall into two main categories: instance discrimination and Masked Image Modeling (MIM). While instance discrimination is fundamental to SSL, it was originally designed for classification and may be less effective for object detection, particularly for small objects. In this survey, we focus on SSL methods specifically tailored for real-world object detection, with an emphasis on detecting small objects in complex environments. Unlike previous surveys, we offer a detailed comparison of SSL strategies, including object-level instance discrimination and MIM methods, and assess their effectiveness for small object detection using both CNN and ViT-based architectures. Specifically, our benchmark is performed on the widely-used COCO dataset, as well as on a specialized real-world dataset focused on vehicle detection in infrared remote sensing imagery. We also assess the impact of pre-training on custom domain-specific datasets, highlighting how certain SSL strategies are better suited for handling uncurated data.
  Our findings highlight that instance discrimination methods perform well with CNN-based encoders, while MIM methods are better suited for ViT-based architectures and custom dataset pre-training. This survey provides a practical guide for selecting optimal SSL strategies, taking into account factors such as backbone architecture, object size, and custom pre-training requirements. Ultimately, we show that choosing an appropriate SSL pre-training strategy, along with a suitable encoder, significantly enhances performance in real-world object detection, particularly for small object detection in frugal settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Wen, Evgenia Roussinova, Olivier Brina, Paolo Machi, Mohamed Bouri</p>
<p>Abstract: Guidewire segmentation during endovascular interventions holds the potential to significantly enhance procedural accuracy, improving visualization and providing critical feedback that can support both physicians and robotic systems in navigating complex vascular pathways. Unlike supervised segmentation networks, which need many expensive expert-annotated labels, sim-to-real domain adaptation approaches utilize synthetic data from simulations, offering a cost-effective solution. The success of models like Segment-Anything (SAM) has driven advancements in image segmentation foundation models with strong zero/few-shot generalization through prompt engineering. However, they struggle with medical images like X-ray fluoroscopy and the domain-shifts of the data. Given the challenges of acquiring annotation and the accessibility of labeled simulation data, we propose a sim-to-real domain adaption framework with a coarse-to-fine strategy to adapt SAM to X-ray fluoroscopy guidewire segmentation without any annotation on the target domain. We first generate the pseudo-labels by utilizing a simple source image style transfer technique that preserves the guidewire structure. Then, we develop a weakly supervised self-training architecture to fine-tune an end-to-end student SAM with the coarse labels by imposing consistency regularization and supervision from the teacher SAM network. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a publicly available Cardiac dataset and an in-house Neurovascular dataset, where our method surpasses both pre-trained SAM and many state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques by a large margin. Our code will be made public on GitHub soon.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07463">Language-Guided Joint Audio-Visual Editing via One-Shot Adaptation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Susan Liang, Chao Huang, Yapeng Tian, Anurag Kumar, Chenliang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel task called language-guided joint audio-visual editing. Given an audio and image pair of a sounding event, this task aims at generating new audio-visual content by editing the given sounding event conditioned on the language guidance. For instance, we can alter the background environment of a sounding object while keeping its appearance unchanged, or we can add new sounds contextualized to the visual content. To address this task, we propose a new diffusion-based framework for joint audio-visual editing and introduce two key ideas. Firstly, we propose a one-shot adaptation approach to tailor generative diffusion models for audio-visual content editing. With as few as one audio-visual sample, we jointly transfer the audio and vision diffusion models to the target domain. After fine-tuning, our model enables consistent generation of this audio-visual sample. Secondly, we introduce a cross-modal semantic enhancement approach. We observe that when using language as content editing guidance, the vision branch may overlook editing requirements. This phenomenon, termed catastrophic neglect, hampers audio-visual alignment during content editing. We therefore enhance semantic consistency between language and vision to mitigate this issue. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in language-based audio-visual editing and highlight its superiority over several baseline approaches.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07475">Progressive Multi-Modal Fusion for Robust 3D Object Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohit Mohan, Daniele Cattaneo, Florian Drews, Abhinav Valada</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion is crucial for accurate 3D object detection in autonomous driving, with cameras and LiDAR being the most commonly used sensors. However, existing methods perform sensor fusion in a single view by projecting features from both modalities either in Bird's Eye View (BEV) or Perspective View (PV), thus sacrificing complementary information such as height or geometric proportions. To address this limitation, we propose ProFusion3D, a progressive fusion framework that combines features in both BEV and PV at both intermediate and object query levels. Our architecture hierarchically fuses local and global features, enhancing the robustness of 3D object detection. Additionally, we introduce a self-supervised mask modeling pre-training strategy to improve multi-modal representation learning and data efficiency through three novel objectives. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets conclusively demonstrate the efficacy of ProFusion3D. Moreover, ProFusion3D is robust to sensor failure, demonstrating strong performance when only one modality is available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dense Convolutional Network has been continuously refined to adopt a highly efficient and compact architecture, owing to its lightweight and efficient structure. However, the current Dense-like architectures are mainly designed manually, it becomes increasingly difficult to adjust the channels and reuse level based on past experience. As such, we propose an architecture search method called Dense Optimizer that can search high-performance dense-like network automatically. In Dense Optimizer, we view the dense network as a hierarchical information system, maximize the network's information entropy while constraining the distribution of the entropy across each stage via a power law, thereby constructing an optimization problem. We also propose a branch-and-bound optimization algorithm, tightly integrates power-law principle with search space scaling to solve the optimization problem efficiently. The superiority of Dense Optimizer has been validated on different computer vision benchmark datasets. Specifically, Dense Optimizer completes high-quality search but only costs 4 hours with one CPU. Our searched model DenseNet-OPT achieved a top 1 accuracy of 84.3% on CIFAR-100, which is 5.97% higher than the original one.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhizheng Liu, Joe Lin, Wayne Wu, Bolei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and modeling pedestrian movements in the real world is crucial for applications like motion forecasting and scene simulation. Many factors influence pedestrian movements, such as scene context, individual characteristics, and goals, which are often ignored by the existing human generation methods. Web videos contain natural pedestrian behavior and rich motion context, but annotating them with pre-trained predictors leads to noisy labels. In this work, we propose learning diverse pedestrian movements from web videos. We first curate a large-scale dataset called CityWalkers that captures diverse real-world pedestrian movements in urban scenes. Then, based on CityWalkers, we propose a generative model called PedGen for diverse pedestrian movement generation. PedGen introduces automatic label filtering to remove the low-quality labels and a mask embedding to train with partial labels. It also contains a novel context encoder that lifts the 2D scene context to 3D and can incorporate various context factors in generating realistic pedestrian movements in urban scenes. Experiments show that PedGen outperforms existing baseline methods for pedestrian movement generation by learning from noisy labels and incorporating the context factors. In addition, PedGen achieves zero-shot generalization in both real-world and simulated environments. The code, model, and data will be made publicly available at https://genforce.github.io/PedGen/ .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M{\i}sra Yavuz, Fatma G\"uney</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection methods trained on a fixed set of known classes struggle to detect objects of unknown classes in the open-world setting. Current fixes involve adding approximate supervision with pseudo-labels corresponding to candidate locations of objects, typically obtained in a class-agnostic manner. While previous approaches mainly rely on the appearance of objects, we find that geometric cues improve unknown recall. Although additional supervision from pseudo-labels helps to detect unknown objects, it also introduces confusion for known classes. We observed a notable decline in the model's performance for detecting known objects in the presence of noisy pseudo-labels. Drawing inspiration from studies on human cognition, we propose to group known classes into superclasses. By identifying similarities between classes within a superclass, we can identify unknown classes through an odd-one-out scoring mechanism. Our experiments on open-world detection benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in unknown recall, consistently across all tasks. Crucially, we achieve this without compromising known performance, thanks to better partitioning of the feature space with superclasses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Plant counting is essential in every stage of agriculture, including seed breeding, germination, cultivation, fertilization, pollination yield estimation, and harvesting. Inspired by the fact that humans count objects in high-resolution images by sequential scanning, we explore the potential of handling plant counting tasks via state space models (SSMs) for generating counting results. In this paper, we propose a new counting approach named CountMamba that constructs multiple counting experts to scan from various directions simultaneously. Specifically, we design a Multi-directional State-Space Group to process the image patch sequences in multiple orders and aim to simulate different counting experts. We also design Global-Local Adaptive Fusion to adaptively aggregate global features extracted from multiple directions and local features extracted from the CNN branch in a sample-wise manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CountMamba performs competitively on various plant counting tasks, including maize tassels, wheat ears, and sorghum head counting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rectified Flow Transformers (RFTs) offer superior training and inference efficiency, making them likely the most viable direction for scaling up diffusion models. However, progress in generation resolution has been relatively slow due to data quality and training costs. Tuning-free resolution extrapolation presents an alternative, but current methods often reduce generative stability, limiting practical application. In this paper, we review existing resolution extrapolation methods and introduce the I-Max framework to maximize the resolution potential of Text-to-Image RFTs. I-Max features: (i) a novel Projected Flow strategy for stable extrapolation and (ii) an advanced inference toolkit for generalizing model knowledge to higher resolutions. Experiments with Lumina-Next-2K and Flux.1-dev demonstrate I-Max's ability to enhance stability in resolution extrapolation and show that it can bring image detail emergence and artifact correction, confirming the practical value of tuning-free resolution extrapolation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guankun Wang, Han Xiao, Huxin Gao, Renrui Zhang, Long Bai, Xiaoxiao Yang, Zhen Li, Hongsheng Li, Hongliang Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: submucosal dissection (ESD) enables rapid resection of large lesions, minimizing recurrence rates and improving long-term overall survival. Despite these advantages, ESD is technically challenging and carries high risks of complications, necessitating skilled surgeons and precise instruments. Recent advancements in Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) offer promising decision support and predictive planning capabilities for robotic systems, which can augment the accuracy of ESD and reduce procedural risks. However, existing datasets for multi-level fine-grained ESD surgical motion understanding are scarce and lack detailed annotations. In this paper, we design a hierarchical decomposition of ESD motion granularity and introduce a multi-level surgical motion dataset (CoPESD) for training LVLMs as the robotic \textbf{Co}-\textbf{P}ilot of \textbf{E}ndoscopic \textbf{S}ubmucosal \textbf{D}issection. CoPESD includes 17,679 images with 32,699 bounding boxes and 88,395 multi-level motions, from over 35 hours of ESD videos for both robot-assisted and conventional surgeries. CoPESD enables granular analysis of ESD motions, focusing on the complex task of submucosal dissection. Extensive experiments on the LVLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of CoPESD in training LVLMs to predict following surgical robotic motions. As the first multimodal ESD motion dataset, CoPESD supports advanced research in ESD instruction-following and surgical automation.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction methods and vision-language models have propelled the development of multi-modal 3D scene understanding, which has vital applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual/augmented reality. However, current multi-modal scene understanding approaches have naively embedded semantic representations into 3D reconstruction methods without striking a balance between visual and language modalities, which leads to unsatisfying semantic rasterization of translucent or reflective objects, as well as over-fitting on color modality. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a solution that adequately handles the distinct visual and semantic modalities, i.e., a 3D vision-language Gaussian splatting model for scene understanding, to put emphasis on the representation learning of language modality. We propose a novel cross-modal rasterizer, using modality fusion along with a smoothed semantic indicator for enhancing semantic rasterization. We also employ a camera-view blending technique to improve semantic consistency between existing and synthesized views, thereby effectively mitigating over-fitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruonan Yu, Songhua Liu, Jingwen Ye, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation or condensation refers to compressing a large-scale dataset into a much smaller one, enabling models trained on this synthetic dataset to generalize effectively on real data. Tackling this challenge, as defined, relies on a bi-level optimization algorithm: a novel model is trained in each iteration within a nested loop, with gradients propagated through an unrolled computation graph. However, this approach incurs high memory and time complexity, posing difficulties in scaling up to large datasets such as ImageNet. Addressing these concerns, this paper introduces Teddy, a Taylor-approximated dataset distillation framework designed to handle large-scale dataset and enhance efficiency. On the one hand, backed up by theoretical analysis, we propose a memory-efficient approximation derived from Taylor expansion, which transforms the original form dependent on multi-step gradients to a first-order one. On the other hand, rather than repeatedly training a novel model in each iteration, we unveil that employing a pre-cached pool of weak models, which can be generated from a single base model, enhances both time efficiency and performance concurrently, particularly when dealing with large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Teddy attains state-of-the-art efficiency and performance on the Tiny-ImageNet and original-sized ImageNet-1K dataset, notably surpassing prior methods by up to 12.8%, while reducing 46.6% runtime.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songshuo Lu, Hua Wang, Yutian Rong, Zhi Chen, Yaohua Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems concatenate and process numerous retrieved document chunks for prefill which requires a large volume of computation, therefore leading to significant latency in time-to-first-token (TTFT). To reduce the computation overhead as well as TTFT, we introduce TurboRAG, a novel RAG system that redesigns the inference paradigm of the current RAG system by first pre-computing and storing the key-value (KV) caches of documents offline, and then directly retrieving the saved KV cache for prefill. Hence, online computation of KV caches is eliminated during inference. In addition, we provide a number of insights into the mask matrix and positional embedding mechanisms, plus fine-tune a pretrained language model to maintain model accuracy of TurboRAG. Our approach is applicable to most existing large language models and their applications without any requirement in modification of models and inference systems. Experimental results across a suite of RAG benchmarks demonstrate that TurboRAG reduces TTFT by up to 9.4x compared to the conventional RAG systems (on an average of 8.6x), but reserving comparable performance to the standard RAG systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hoin Jung, Taeuk Jang, Xiaoqian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled complex multimodal tasks by processing text and image data simultaneously, significantly enhancing the field of artificial intelligence. However, these models often exhibit biases that can skew outputs towards societal stereotypes, thus necessitating debiasing strategies. Existing debiasing methods focus narrowly on specific modalities or tasks, and require extensive retraining. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Selective Feature Imputation for Debiasing (SFID), a novel methodology that integrates feature pruning and low confidence imputation (LCI) to effectively reduce biases in VLMs. SFID is versatile, maintaining the semantic integrity of outputs and costly effective by eliminating the need for retraining. Our experimental results demonstrate SFID's effectiveness across various VLMs tasks including zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, image captioning, and text-to-image generation, by significantly reducing gender biases without compromising performance. This approach not only enhances the fairness of VLMs applications but also preserves their efficiency and utility across diverse scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinghui Li, Yuchen Ji, Xiansong Lai, Wanting Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, neural implicit 3D reconstruction in indoor scenarios has become popular due to its simplicity and impressive performance. Previous works could produce complete results leveraging monocular priors of normal or depth. However, they may suffer from over-smoothed reconstructions and long-time optimization due to unbiased sampling and inaccurate monocular priors. In this paper, we propose a novel neural implicit surface reconstruction method, named FD-NeuS, to learn fine-detailed 3D models using multi-level importance sampling strategy and multi-view consistency methodology. Specifically, we leverage segmentation priors to guide region-based ray sampling, and use piecewise exponential functions as weights to pilot 3D points sampling along the rays, ensuring more attention on important regions. In addition, we introduce multi-view feature consistency and multi-view normal consistency as supervision and uncertainty respectively, which further improve the reconstruction of details. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results show that FD-NeuS outperforms existing methods in various scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Wang, Timing Yang, Yaodong Yu, Sucheng Ren, Guoyizhe Wei, Angtian Wang, Wei Shao, Yuyin Zhou, Alan Yuille, Cihang Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of causal image modeling and introduce the Adventurer series models where we treat images as sequences of patch tokens and employ uni-directional language models to learn visual representations. This modeling paradigm allows us to process images in a recurrent formulation with linear complexity relative to the sequence length, which can effectively address the memory and computation explosion issues posed by high-resolution and fine-grained images. In detail, we introduce two simple designs that seamlessly integrate image inputs into the causal inference framework: a global pooling token placed at the beginning of the sequence and a flipping operation between every two layers. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate the significant efficiency and effectiveness of this causal image modeling paradigm. For example, our base-sized Adventurer model attains a competitive test accuracy of 84.0% on the standard ImageNet-1k benchmark with 216 images/s training throughput, which is 5.3 times more efficient than vision transformers to achieve the same result.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaekyeong Lee, Geonung Kim, Sunghyun Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: With the recent growth of video-based Social Network Service (SNS) platforms, the demand for video editing among common users has increased. However, video editing can be challenging due to the temporally-varying factors such as camera movement and moving objects. While modern atlas-based video editing methods have addressed these issues, they often fail to edit videos including complex motion or multiple moving objects, and demand excessive computational cost, even for very simple edits. In this paper, we propose a novel region-of-interest (ROI)-based video editing framework: ROI-based Neural Atlas (RNA). Unlike prior work, RNA allows users to specify editing regions, simplifying the editing process by removing the need for foreground separation and atlas modeling for foreground objects. However, this simplification presents a unique challenge: acquiring a mask that effectively handles occlusions in the edited area caused by moving objects, without relying on an additional segmentation model. To tackle this, we propose a novel mask refinement approach designed for this specific challenge. Moreover, we introduce a soft neural atlas model for video reconstruction to ensure high-quality editing results. Extensive experiments show that RNA offers a more practical and efficient editing solution, applicable to a wider range of videos with superior quality compared to prior methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Wang, Shaofan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we have developed a variational Bayesian inference theory of elasticity, which is accomplished by using a mixed Variational Bayesian inference Finite Element Method (VBI-FEM) that can be used to solve the inverse deformation problems of continua. In the proposed variational Bayesian inference theory of continuum mechanics, the elastic strain energy is used as a prior in a Bayesian inference network, which can intelligently recover the detailed continuum deformation mappings with only given the information on the deformed and undeformed continuum body shapes without knowing the interior deformation and the precise actual boundary conditions, both traction as well as displacement boundary conditions, and the actual material constitutive relation. Moreover, we have implemented the related finite element formulation in a computational probabilistic mechanics framework. To numerically solve mixed variational problem, we developed an operator splitting or staggered algorithm that consists of the finite element (FE) step and the Bayesian learning (BL) step as an analogue of the well-known the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. By solving the mixed probabilistic Galerkin variational problem, we demonstrated that the proposed method is able to inversely predict continuum deformation mappings with strong discontinuity or fracture without knowing the external load conditions. The proposed method provides a robust machine intelligent solution for the long-sought-after inverse problem solution, which has been a major challenge in structure failure forensic pattern analysis in past several decades. The proposed method may become a promising artificial intelligence-based inverse method for solving general partial differential equations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S. Park, J. Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image classification is crucial for supporting healthcare professionals in decision-making and training. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have traditionally dominated this field, Transformer-based models are gaining attention. In this study, we apply explainable AI (XAI) techniques to assess the performance of various models on real-world medical data and identify areas for improvement. We compare CNN models such as VGG-16, ResNet-50, and EfficientNetV2L with a Transformer model: ViT-Base-16. Our results show that data augmentation has little impact, but hyperparameter tuning and advanced modeling improve performance. CNNs, particularly VGG-16 and ResNet-50, outperform ViT-Base-16 and EfficientNetV2L, likely due to underfitting from limited data. XAI methods like LIME and SHAP further reveal that better-performing models visualize tumors more effectively. These findings suggest that CNNs with shallower architectures are more effective for small datasets and can support medical decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ao Ke, Wenlong Chen, Chuanwen Feng, Yukun Cao, Xike Xie, S. Kevin Zhou, Lei Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting Out-of-Distribution (OOD) inputs is crucial for improving the reliability of deep neural networks in the real-world deployment. In this paper, inspired by the inherent distribution shift between ID and OOD data, we propose a novel method that leverages optimal transport to measure the distribution discrepancy between test inputs and ID prototypes. The resulting transport costs are used to quantify the individual contribution of each test input to the overall discrepancy, serving as a desirable measure for OOD detection. To address the issue that solely relying on the transport costs to ID prototypes is inadequate for identifying OOD inputs closer to ID data, we generate virtual outliers to approximate the OOD region via linear extrapolation. By combining the transport costs to ID prototypes with the costs to virtual outliers, the detection of OOD data near ID data is emphasized, thereby enhancing the distinction between ID and OOD inputs. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

To address this, we propose a new Chinese calligraphy generation model 'Moyun' , which replaces the Unet in the Diffusion model with Vision Mamba and introduces the TripleLabel control mechanism to achieve controllable calligraphy generation. The model was tested on our large-scale dataset 'Mobao' of over 1.9 million images, and the results demonstrate that 'Moyun' can effectively control the generation process and produce calligraphy in the specified style. Even for calligraphy the calligrapher has not written, 'Moyun' can generate calligraphy that matches the style of the calligrapher.</p>

<p>Abstract: Face recognition systems (FRS) can be compromised by face morphing attacks, which blend textural and geometric information from multiple facial images. The rapid evolution of generative AI, especially Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) or Diffusion models, where encoded images are interpolated to generate high-quality face morphing images. In this work, we present a novel method for the automatic face morphing generation method \textit{MorCode}, which leverages a contemporary encoder-decoder architecture conditioned on codebook learning to generate high-quality morphing images. Extensive experiments were performed on the newly constructed morphing dataset using five state-of-the-art morphing generation techniques using both digital and print-scan data. The attack potential of the proposed morphing generation technique, \textit{MorCode}, was benchmarked using three different face recognition systems. The obtained results indicate the highest attack potential of the proposed \textit{MorCode} when compared with five state-of-the-art morphing generation methods on both digital and print scan data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongliang Zhang, Yunfei Li, Jiaran Zhou, Yuezun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world DeepFake videos often undergo various compression operations, resulting in a range of video qualities. These varying qualities diversify the pattern of forgery traces, significantly increasing the difficulty of DeepFake detection. To address this challenge, we introduce a new Dual Progressive Learning (DPL) framework for cross-quality DeepFake detection. We liken this task to progressively drilling for underground water, where low-quality videos require more effort than high-quality ones. To achieve this, we develop two sequential-based branches to "drill waters" with different efforts. The first branch progressively excavates the forgery traces according to the levels of video quality, i.e., time steps, determined by a dedicated CLIP-based indicator. In this branch, a Feature Selection Module is designed to adaptively assign appropriate features to the corresponding time steps. Considering that different techniques may introduce varying forgery traces within the same video quality, we design a second branch targeting forgery identifiability as complementary. This branch operates similarly and shares the feature selection module with the first branch. Our design takes advantage of the sequential model where computational units share weights across different time steps and can memorize previous progress, elegantly achieving progressive learning while maintaining reasonable memory costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method for cross-quality DeepFake detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video segmentation is a popular task, but applying image segmentation models frame-by-frame to videos does not preserve temporal consistency. In this paper, we propose a method to extend a query-based image segmentation model to video using feature shift and query matching. The method uses a query-based architecture, where decoded queries represent segmentation masks. These queries should be matched before performing the feature shift to ensure that the shifted queries represent the same mask across different frames. Experimental results on CityScapes-VPS and VSPW show significant improvements from the baselines, highlighting the method's effectiveness in enhancing segmentation quality while efficiently reusing pre-trained weights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhinuo Zhou, Peng Zhou, Xiaoyong Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: As the boosting development of large vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), many CLIP-like methods have shown impressive abilities on visual recognition, especially in low-data regimes scenes. However, we have noticed that most of these methods are limited to introducing new modifications on text and image encoder. Recently, latent diffusion models (LDMs) have shown good ability on image generation. The potent capabilities of LDMs direct our focus towards the latent representations sampled by UNet. Inspired by the conjecture in CoOp that learned prompts encode meanings beyond the existing vocabulary, we assume that, for deep models, the latent representations are concise and accurate understanding of images, in which high-frequency, imperceptible details are abstracted away. In this paper, we propose a Few-shot Language Image model Embedded with latent Representations (FLIER) for image recognition by introducing a latent encoder jointly trained with CLIP's image encoder, it incorporates pre-trained vision-language knowledge of CLIP and the latent representations from Stable Diffusion. We first generate images and corresponding latent representations via Stable Diffusion with the textual inputs from GPT-3. With latent representations as "models-understandable pixels", we introduce a flexible convolutional neural network with two convolutional layers to be the latent encoder, which is simpler than most encoders in vision-language models. The latent encoder is jointly trained with CLIP's image encoder, transferring pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks better. Experiments and extensive ablation studies on various visual classification tasks demonstrate that FLIER performs state-of-the-art on 11 datasets for most few-shot classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Cai, Pengpeng Zeng, Lianli Gao, Junchen Zhu, Jiaxin Zhang, Sitong Su, Heng Tao Shen, Jingkuan Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generic 3D content generation from text prompts have been remarkable by fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion (T2I) models or employing these T2I models as priors to learn a general text-to-3D model. While fine-tuning-based methods ensure great alignment between text and generated views, i.e., semantic consistency, their ability to achieve multi-view consistency is hampered by the absence of 3D constraints, even in limited view. In contrast, prior-based methods focus on regressing 3D shapes with any view that maintains uniformity and coherence across views, i.e., multi-view consistency, but such approaches inevitably compromise visual-textual alignment, leading to a loss of semantic details in the generated objects. To achieve semantic and multi-view consistency simultaneously, we propose SeMv-3D, a novel framework for general text-to-3d generation. Specifically, we propose a Triplane Prior Learner (TPL) that learns triplane priors with 3D spatial features to maintain consistency among different views at the 3D level, e.g., geometry and texture. Moreover, we design a Semantic-aligned View Synthesizer (SVS) that preserves the alignment between 3D spatial features and textual semantics in latent space. In SVS, we devise a simple yet effective batch sampling and rendering strategy that can generate arbitrary views in a single feed-forward inference. Extensive experiments present our SeMv-3D's superiority over state-of-the-art performances with semantic and multi-view consistency in any view.

<p>Abstract: The spatio-temporal complexity of video data presents significant challenges in tasks such as compression, generation, and inpainting. We present four key contributions to address the challenges of spatiotemporal video processing. First, we introduce the 3D Mobile Inverted Vector-Quantization Variational Autoencoder (3D-MBQ-VAE), which combines Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with masked token modeling to enhance spatiotemporal video compression. The model achieves superior temporal consistency and state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction quality by employing a novel training strategy with full frame masking. Second, we present MotionAura, a text-to-video generation framework that utilizes vector-quantized diffusion models to discretize the latent space and capture complex motion dynamics, producing temporally coherent videos aligned with text prompts. Third, we propose a spectral transformer-based denoising network that processes video data in the frequency domain using the Fourier Transform. This method effectively captures global context and long-range dependencies for high-quality video generation and denoising. Lastly, we introduce a downstream task of Sketch Guided Video Inpainting. This task leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our models achieve SOTA performance on a range of benchmarks. Our work offers robust frameworks for spatiotemporal modeling and user-driven video content manipulation. We will release the code, datasets, and models in open-source.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takahiro Shindo, Taiju Watanabe, Yui Tatsumi, Hiroshi Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: Image Coding for Machines (ICM) is becoming more important as research in computer vision progresses. ICM is a vital research field that pursues the use of images for image recognition models, facilitating efficient image transmission and storage. The demand for recognition models is growing rapidly among the general public, and their performance continues to improve. To meet these needs, exchanging image data between consumer devices and cloud AI using ICM technology could be one possible solution. In ICM, various image compression methods have adopted Learned Image Compression (LIC). LIC includes an entropy model for estimating the bitrate of latent features, and the design of this model significantly affects its performance. Typically, LIC methods assume that the distribution of latent features follows a normal distribution. This assumption is effective for compressing images intended for human vision. However, employing an entropy model based on normal distribution is inefficient in ICM due to the limitation of image parts that require precise decoding. To address this, we propose Delta-ICM, which uses a probability distribution based on a delta function. Assuming the delta distribution as a distribution of latent features reduces the entropy of image portions unnecessary for machines. We compress the remaining portions using an entropy model based on normal distribution, similar to existing methods. Delta-ICM selects between the entropy model based on the delta distribution and the one based on the normal distribution for each latent feature. Our method outperforms existing ICM methods in image compression performance aimed at machines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weilun Feng, Chuanguang Yang, Zhulin An, Libo Huang, Boyu Diao, Fei Wang, Yongjun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Although the diffusion model has achieved remarkable performance in the field of image generation, its high inference delay hinders its wide application in edge devices with scarce computing resources. Therefore, many training-free sampling methods have been proposed to reduce the number of sampling steps required for diffusion models. However, they perform poorly under a very small number of sampling steps. Thanks to the emergence of knowledge distillation technology, the existing training scheme methods have achieved excellent results at very low step numbers. However, the current methods mainly focus on designing novel diffusion model sampling methods with knowledge distillation. How to transfer better diffusion knowledge from teacher models is a more valuable problem but rarely studied. Therefore, we propose Relational Diffusion Distillation (RDD), a novel distillation method tailored specifically for distilling diffusion models. Unlike existing methods that simply align teacher and student models at pixel level or feature distributions, our method introduces cross-sample relationship interaction during the distillation process and alleviates the memory constraints induced by multiple sample interactions. Our RDD significantly enhances the effectiveness of the progressive distillation framework within the diffusion model. Extensive experiments on several datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10 and ImageNet) demonstrate that our proposed RDD leads to 1.47 FID decrease under 1 sampling step compared to state-of-the-art diffusion distillation methods and achieving 256x speed-up compared to DDIM strategy.

<p>Abstract: The maintenance of sewerage networks, with their millions of kilometers of pipe, heavily relies on efficient Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) inspections. Many promising approaches based on multi-label image classification have leveraged databases of historical inspection reports to automate these inspections. However, the significant presence of label noise in these databases, although known, has not been addressed. While extensive research has explored the issue of label noise in singlelabel classification (SLC), little attention has been paid to label noise in multi-label classification (MLC). To address this, we first adapted three sample selection SLC methods (Co-teaching, CoSELFIE, and DISC) that have proven robust to label noise. Our findings revealed that sample selection based solely on the small-loss trick can handle complex label noise, but it is sub-optimal. Adapting hybrid sample selection methods to noisy MLC appeared to be a more promising approach. In light of this, we developed a novel method named MHSS (Multi-label Hybrid Sample Selection) based on CoSELFIE. Through an in-depth comparative study, we demonstrated the superior performance of our approach in dealing with both synthetic complex noise and real noise, thus contributing to the ongoing efforts towards effective automation of CCTV sewer pipe inspections.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leyi Zhu, Weihuang Liu, Xinyi Chen, Zimeng Li, Xuhang Chen, Zhen Wang, Chi-Man Pun</p>
<p>Abstract: Shadow detection is crucial for accurate scene understanding in computer vision, yet it is challenged by the diverse appearances of shadows caused by variations in illumination, object geometry, and scene context. Deep learning models often struggle to generalize to real-world images due to the limited size and diversity of training datasets. To address this, we introduce TICA, a novel framework that leverages light-intensity information during test-time adaptation to enhance shadow detection accuracy. TICA exploits the inherent inconsistencies in light intensity across shadow regions to guide the model toward a more consistent prediction. A basic encoder-decoder model is initially trained on a labeled dataset for shadow detection. Then, during the testing phase, the network is adjusted for each test sample by enforcing consistent intensity predictions between two augmented input image versions. This consistency training specifically targets both foreground and background intersection regions to identify shadow regions within images accurately for robust adaptation. Extensive evaluations on the ISTD and SBU shadow detection datasets reveal that TICA significantly demonstrates that TICA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior results in balanced error rate (BER).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruijie Zhu, Yanzhe Liang, Hanzhi Chang, Jiacheng Deng, Jiahao Lu, Wenfei Yang, Tianzhu Zhang, Yongdong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in the field of 3D vision. Recently, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has provided new insights into this problem. Although subsequent efforts rapidly extend static 3D Gaussian to dynamic scenes, they often lack explicit constraints on object motion, leading to optimization difficulties and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose a novel deformable 3D Gaussian splatting framework called MotionGS, which explores explicit motion priors to guide the deformation of 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we first introduce an optical flow decoupling module that decouples optical flow into camera flow and motion flow, corresponding to camera movement and object motion respectively. Then the motion flow can effectively constrain the deformation of 3D Gaussians, thus simulating the motion of dynamic objects. Additionally, a camera pose refinement module is proposed to alternately optimize 3D Gaussians and camera poses, mitigating the impact of inaccurate camera poses. Extensive experiments in the monocular dynamic scenes validate that MotionGS surpasses state-of-the-art methods and exhibits significant superiority in both qualitative and quantitative results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Cui, Hui Li, Yao Yao, Hao Zhu, Hanlin Shang, Kaihui Cheng, Hang Zhou, Siyu Zhu, Jingdong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion-based generative models for portrait image animation, such as Hallo, have achieved impressive results in short-duration video synthesis. In this paper, we present updates to Hallo, introducing several design enhancements to extend its capabilities. First, we extend the method to produce long-duration videos. To address substantial challenges such as appearance drift and temporal artifacts, we investigate augmentation strategies within the image space of conditional motion frames. Specifically, we introduce a patch-drop technique augmented with Gaussian noise to enhance visual consistency and temporal coherence over long duration. Second, we achieve 4K resolution portrait video generation. To accomplish this, we implement vector quantization of latent codes and apply temporal alignment techniques to maintain coherence across the temporal dimension. By integrating a high-quality decoder, we realize visual synthesis at 4K resolution. Third, we incorporate adjustable semantic textual labels for portrait expressions as conditional inputs. This extends beyond traditional audio cues to improve controllability and increase the diversity of the generated content. To the best of our knowledge, Hallo2, proposed in this paper, is the first method to achieve 4K resolution and generate hour-long, audio-driven portrait image animations enhanced with textual prompts. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our method on publicly available datasets, including HDTF, CelebV, and our introduced "Wild" dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-duration portrait video animation, successfully generating rich and controllable content at 4K resolution for duration extending up to tens of minutes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Yang, Minyue Jiang, Sen Yang, Xiao Tan, Yingying Li, Errui Ding, Hanli Wang, Jingdong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The construction of Vectorized High-Definition (HD) map typically requires capturing both category and geometry information of map elements. Current state-of-the-art methods often adopt solely either point-level or instance-level representation, overlooking the strong intrinsic relationships between points and instances. In this work, we propose a simple yet efficient framework named MGMapNet (Multi-Granularity Map Network) to model map element with a multi-granularity representation, integrating both coarse-grained instance-level and fine-grained point-level queries. Specifically, these two granularities of queries are generated from the multi-scale bird's eye view (BEV) features using a proposed Multi-Granularity Aggregator. In this module, instance-level query aggregates features over the entire scope covered by an instance, and the point-level query aggregates features locally. Furthermore, a Point Instance Interaction module is designed to encourage information exchange between instance-level and point-level queries. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MGMapNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing MapTRv2 by 5.3 mAP on nuScenes and 4.4 mAP on Argoverse2 respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Cores, Michael Dorkenwald, Manuel Mucientes, Cees G. M. Snoek, Yuki M. Asano</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive performance when integrated with vision models even enabling video understanding. However, evaluating these video models presents its own unique challenges, for which several benchmarks have been proposed. In this paper, we show that the currently most used video-language benchmarks can be solved without requiring much temporal reasoning. We identified three main issues in existing datasets: (i) static information from single frames is often sufficient to solve the tasks (ii) the text of the questions and candidate answers is overly informative, allowing models to answer correctly without relying on any visual input (iii) world knowledge alone can answer many of the questions, making the benchmarks a test of knowledge replication rather than visual reasoning. In addition, we found that open-ended question-answering benchmarks for video understanding suffer from similar issues while the automatic evaluation process with LLMs is unreliable, making it an unsuitable alternative. As a solution, we propose TVBench, a novel open-source video multiple-choice question-answering benchmark, and demonstrate through extensive evaluations that it requires a high level of temporal understanding. Surprisingly, we find that most recent state-of-the-art video-language models perform similarly to random performance on TVBench, with only Gemini-Pro and Tarsier clearly surpassing this baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danush Kumar Venkatesh, Dominik Rivoir, Micha Pfeiffer, Fiona Kolbinger, Stefanie Speidel</p>
<p>Abstract: In computer-assisted surgery, automatically recognizing anatomical organs is crucial for understanding the surgical scene and providing intraoperative assistance. While machine learning models can identify such structures, their deployment is hindered by the need for labeled, diverse surgical datasets with anatomical annotations. Labeling multiple classes (i.e., organs) in a surgical scene is time-intensive, requiring medical experts. Although synthetically generated images can enhance segmentation performance, maintaining both organ structure and texture during generation is challenging. We introduce a multi-stage approach using diffusion models to generate multi-class surgical datasets with annotations. Our framework improves anatomy awareness by training organ specific models with an inpainting objective guided by binary segmentation masks. The organs are generated with an inference pipeline using pre-trained ControlNet to maintain the organ structure. The synthetic multi-class datasets are constructed through an image composition step, ensuring structural and textural consistency. This versatile approach allows the generation of multi-class datasets from real binary datasets and simulated surgical masks. We thoroughly evaluate the generated datasets on image quality and downstream segmentation, achieving a $15\%$ improvement in segmentation scores when combined with real images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sijing Wu, Yunhao Li, Yichao Yan, Huiyu Duan, Ziwei Liu, Guangtao Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D facial animation has attracted considerable attention due to its extensive applications in the multimedia field. Audio-driven 3D facial animation has been widely explored with promising results. However, multi-modal 3D facial animation, especially text-guided 3D facial animation is rarely explored due to the lack of multi-modal 3D facial animation dataset. To fill this gap, we first construct a large-scale multi-modal 3D facial animation dataset, MMHead, which consists of 49 hours of 3D facial motion sequences, speech audios, and rich hierarchical text annotations. Each text annotation contains abstract action and emotion descriptions, fine-grained facial and head movements (i.e., expression and head pose) descriptions, and three possible scenarios that may cause such emotion. Concretely, we integrate five public 2D portrait video datasets, and propose an automatic pipeline to 1) reconstruct 3D facial motion sequences from monocular videos; and 2) obtain hierarchical text annotations with the help of AU detection and ChatGPT. Based on the MMHead dataset, we establish benchmarks for two new tasks: text-induced 3D talking head animation and text-to-3D facial motion generation. Moreover, a simple but efficient VQ-VAE-based method named MM2Face is proposed to unify the multi-modal information and generate diverse and plausible 3D facial motions, which achieves competitive results on both benchmarks. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analysis demonstrate the significant potential of our dataset and benchmarks in promoting the development of multi-modal 3D facial animation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The on-board 3D object detection technology has received extensive attention as a critical technology for autonomous driving, while few studies have focused on applying roadside sensors in 3D traffic object detection. Existing studies achieve the projection of 2D image features to 3D features through height estimation based on the frustum. However, they did not consider the height alignment and the extraction efficiency of bird's-eye-view features. We propose a novel 3D object detection framework integrating Spatial Former and Voxel Pooling Former to enhance 2D-to-3D projection based on height estimation. Extensive experiments were conducted using the Rope3D and DAIR-V2X-I dataset, and the results demonstrated the outperformance of the proposed algorithm in the detection of both vehicles and cyclists. These results indicate that the algorithm is robust and generalized under various detection scenarios. Improving the accuracy of 3D object detection on the roadside is conducive to building a safe and trustworthy intelligent transportation system of vehicle-road coordination and promoting the large-scale application of autonomous driving.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Zhu, Mingkai Sheng, Zhangmin Huang, Jingfei Chang, Jinling Jiang, Jian Long, Cheng Luo, Lei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal hashing methods are widely used in multimedia retrieval, which can fuse multi-source data to generate binary hash code. However, the individual backbone networks have limited feature expression capabilities and are not jointly pre-trained on large-scale unsupervised multi-modal data, resulting in low retrieval accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a novel CLIP Multi-modal Hashing (CLIPMH) method. Our method employs the CLIP framework to extract both text and vision features and then fuses them to generate hash code. Due to enhancement on each modal feature, our method has great improvement in the retrieval performance of multi-modal hashing methods. Compared with state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised multi-modal hashing methods, experiments reveal that the proposed CLIPMH can significantly improve performance (a maximum increase of 8.38% in mAP).</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07790">Enhancing Hyperspectral Image Prediction with Contrastive Learning in Low-Label Regime</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Salma Haidar, Jos\'e Oramas</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning is an effective approach for addressing the challenge of limited labelled data. This study builds upon the previously established two-stage patch-level, multi-label classification method for hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. We evaluate the method's performance for both the single-label and multi-label classification tasks, particularly under scenarios of limited training data. The methodology unfolds in two stages. Initially, we focus on training an encoder and a projection network using a contrastive learning approach. This step is crucial for enhancing the ability of the encoder to discern patterns within the unlabelled data. Next, we employ the pre-trained encoder to guide the training of two distinct predictors: one for multi-label and another for single-label classification. Empirical results on four public datasets show that the predictors trained with our method perform better than those trained under fully supervised techniques. Notably, the performance is maintained even when the amount of training data is reduced by $50\%$. This advantage is consistent across both tasks. The method's effectiveness comes from its streamlined architecture. This design allows for retraining the encoder along with the predictor. As a result, the encoder becomes more adaptable to the features identified by the classifier, improving the overall classification performance. Qualitative analysis reveals the contrastive-learning-based encoder's capability to provide representations that allow separation among classes and identify location-based features despite not being explicitly trained for that. This observation indicates the method's potential in uncovering implicit spatial information within the data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07795">Optimal-State Dynamics Estimation for Physics-based Human Motion Capture from Videos</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Cuong Le, Viktor Johansson, Manon Kok, Bastian Wandt</p>
<p>Abstract: Human motion capture from monocular videos has made significant progress in recent years. However, modern approaches often produce temporal artifacts, e.g. in form of jittery motion and struggle to achieve smooth and physically plausible motions. Explicitly integrating physics, in form of internal forces and exterior torques, helps alleviating these artifacts. Current state-of-the-art approaches make use of an automatic PD controller to predict torques and reaction forces in order to re-simulate the input kinematics, i.e. the joint angles of a predefined skeleton. However, due to imperfect physical models, these methods often require simplifying assumptions and extensive preprocessing of the input kinematics to achieve good performance. To this end, we propose a novel method to selectively incorporate the physics models with the kinematics observations in an online setting, inspired by a neural Kalman-filtering approach. We develop a control loop as a meta-PD controller to predict internal joint torques and external reaction forces, followed by a physics-based motion simulation. A recurrent neural network is introduced to realize a Kalman filter that attentively balances the kinematics input and simulated motion, resulting in an optimal-state dynamics prediction. We show that this filtering step is crucial to provide an online supervision that helps balancing the shortcoming of the respective input motions, thus being important for not only capturing accurate global motion trajectories but also producing physically plausible human poses. The proposed approach excels in the physics-based human pose estimation task and demonstrates the physical plausibility of the predictive dynamics, compared to state of the art.

<p>Abstract: Parking slot detection is an essential technology in autonomous parking systems. In general, the classification problem of parking slot detection consists of two tasks, a task determining whether localized candidates are junctions of parking slots or not, and the other that identifies a shape of detected junctions. Both classification tasks can easily face biased learning toward the majority class, degrading classification performances. Yet, the data imbalance issue has been overlooked in parking slot detection. We propose the first supervised contrastive learning framework for parking slot detection, Localized and Balanced Contrastive Learning for improving parking slot detection (LaB-CL). The proposed LaB-CL framework uses two main approaches. First, we propose to include class prototypes to consider representations from all classes in every mini batch, from the local perspective. Second, we propose a new hard negative sampling scheme that selects local representations with high prediction error. Experiments with the benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed LaB-CL framework can outperform existing parking slot detection methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhifeng Wang, Minghui Wang, Chunyan Zeng, Longlong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence into the modern educational system is rapidly evolving, particularly in monitoring student behavior in classrooms, a task traditionally dependent on manual observation. This conventional method is notably inefficient, prompting a shift toward more advanced solutions like computer vision. However, existing target detection models face significant challenges such as occlusion, blurring, and scale disparity, which are exacerbated by the dynamic and complex nature of classroom settings. Furthermore, these models must adeptly handle multiple target detection. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce the Student Learning Behavior Detection with Multi-Scale Deformable Transformers (SCB-DETR), an innovative approach that utilizes large convolutional kernels for upstream feature extraction, and multi-scale feature fusion. This technique significantly improves the detection capabilities for multi-scale and occluded targets, offering a robust solution for analyzing student behavior. SCB-DETR establishes an end-to-end framework that simplifies the detection process and consistently outperforms other deep learning methods. Employing our custom Student Classroom Behavior (SCBehavior) Dataset, SCB-DETR achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.626, which is a 1.5% improvement over the baseline model's mAP and a 6% increase in AP50. These results demonstrate SCB-DETR's superior performance in handling the uneven distribution of student behaviors and ensuring precise detection in dynamic classroom environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soobin Um, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the generation of minority samples using pretrained text-to-image (T2I) latent diffusion models. Minority instances, in the context of T2I generation, can be defined as ones living on low-density regions of text-conditional data distributions. They are valuable for various applications of modern T2I generators, such as data augmentation and creative AI. Unfortunately, existing pretrained T2I diffusion models primarily focus on high-density regions, largely due to the influence of guided samplers (like CFG) that are essential for producing high-quality generations. To address this, we present a novel framework to counter the high-density-focus of T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we first develop an online prompt optimization framework that can encourage the emergence of desired properties during inference while preserving semantic contents of user-provided prompts. We subsequently tailor this generic prompt optimizer into a specialized solver that promotes the generation of minority features by incorporating a carefully-crafted likelihood objective. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across various types of T2I models, demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the capability to produce high-quality minority instances compared to existing samplers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adapter-based tuning methods have shown significant potential in transferring knowledge from pre-trained Vision-Language Models to the downstream tasks. However, after reviewing existing adapters, we find they generally fail to fully explore the interactions between different modalities in constructing task-specific knowledge. Also, existing works usually only focus on similarity matching between positive text prompts, making it challenging to distinguish the classes with high similar visual contents. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Graph Adapter to achieve tuning VLMs for the downstream tasks. To be specific, we first construct a unified heterogeneous graph mode, which contains i) visual nodes, positive text nodes and negative text nodes, and ii) several types of edge connections to comprehensively model the intra-modality, inter-modality and inter-class structure knowledge together. Next, we employ a specific Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network to excavate multi-modality structure knowledge for adapting both visual and textual features for the downstream tasks. Finally, after HeGraphAdapter, we construct both text-based and visual-based classifiers simultaneously to comprehensively enhance the performance of the CLIP model. Experimental results on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed HeGraphAdapter.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial neural network based Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) has been widely studied in recent years, despite many progresses, however, the energy consumption is still high. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) based framework for energy-efficient attribute recognition. Specifically, we first adopt a spiking tokenizer module to transform the given pedestrian image into spiking feature representations. Then, the output will be fed into the spiking Transformer backbone networks for energy-efficient feature extraction. We feed the enhanced spiking features into a set of feed-forward networks for pedestrian attribute recognition. In addition to the widely used binary cross-entropy loss function, we also exploit knowledge distillation from the artificial neural network to the spiking Transformer network for more accurate attribute recognition. Extensive experiments on three widely used PAR benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed SNN-PAR framework.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronghui Zhang, Runzong Zou, Yue Zhao, Zirui Zhang, Junzhou Chen, Yue Cao, Chuan Hu, Houbing Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention mechanisms, particularly channel attention, have become highly influential in numerous computer vision tasks. Despite their effectiveness, many existing methods primarily focus on optimizing performance through complex attention modules applied at individual convolutional layers, often overlooking the synergistic interactions that can occur across multiple layers. In response to this gap, we introduce bridge attention, a novel approach designed to facilitate more effective integration and information flow between different convolutional layers. Our work extends the original bridge attention model (BAv1) by introducing an adaptive selection operator, which reduces information redundancy and optimizes the overall information exchange. This enhancement results in the development of BAv2, which achieves substantial performance improvements in the ImageNet classification task, obtaining Top-1 accuracies of 80.49% and 81.75% when using ResNet50 and ResNet101 as backbone networks, respectively. These results surpass the retrained baselines by 1.61% and 0.77%, respectively. Furthermore, BAv2 outperforms other existing channel attention techniques, such as the classical SENet101, exceeding its retrained performance by 0.52% Additionally, integrating BAv2 into advanced convolutional networks and vision transformers has led to significant gains in performance across a wide range of computer vision tasks, underscoring its broad applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Mandal, Susan Leavy, Suzanne Little</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-To-Image (TTI) Diffusion Models such as DALL-E and Stable Diffusion are capable of generating images from text prompts. However, they have been shown to perpetuate gender stereotypes. These models process data internally in multiple stages and employ several constituent models, often trained separately. In this paper, we propose two novel metrics to measure bias internally in these multistage multimodal models. Diffusion Bias was developed to detect and measures bias introduced by the diffusion stage of the models. Bias Amplification measures amplification of bias during the text-to-image conversion process. Our experiments reveal that TTI models amplify gender bias, the diffusion process itself contributes to bias and that Stable Diffusion v2 is more prone to gender bias than DALL-E 2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kirill Vyshegorodtsev, Dmitry Kudiyarov, Alexander Balashov, Alexander Kuzmin</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the development of facial manipulation techniques in recent years deepfake detection in video stream became an important problem for face biometrics, brand monitoring or online video conferencing solutions. In case of a biometric authentication, if you replace a real datastream with a deepfake, you can bypass a liveness detection system. Using a deepfake in a video conference, you can penetrate into a private meeting. Deepfakes of victims or public figures can also be used by fraudsters for blackmailing, extorsion and financial fraud. Therefore, the task of detecting deepfakes is relevant to ensuring privacy and security. In existing approaches to a deepfake detection their performance deteriorates when multiple faces are present in a video simultaneously or when there are other objects erroneously classified as faces. In our research we propose to use geometric-fakeness features (GFF) that characterize a dynamic degree of a face presence in a video and its per-frame deepfake scores. To analyze temporal inconsistencies in GFFs between the frames we train a complex deep learning model that outputs a final deepfake prediction. We employ our approach to analyze videos with multiple faces that are simultaneously present in a video. Such videos often occur in practice e.g., in an online video conference. In this case, real faces appearing in a frame together with a deepfake face will significantly affect a deepfake detection and our approach allows to counter this problem. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmark datasets such as FaceForensics++, DFDC, Celeb-DF and WildDeepFake. The proposed approach remains accurate when trained to detect multiple different deepfake generation techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongtao Wu, Yijun Yang, Angelica I Aviles-Rivero, Jingjing Ren, Sixiang Chen, Haoyu Chen, Lei Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Snow degradations present formidable challenges to the advancement of computer vision tasks by the undesirable corruption in outdoor scenarios. While current deep learning-based desnowing approaches achieve success on synthetic benchmark datasets, they struggle to restore out-of-distribution real-world snowy videos due to the deficiency of paired real-world training data. To address this bottleneck, we devise a new paradigm for video desnowing in a semi-supervised spirit to involve unlabeled real data for the generalizable snow removal. Specifically, we construct a real-world dataset with 85 snowy videos, and then present a Semi-supervised Video Desnowing Network (SemiVDN) equipped by a novel Distribution-driven Contrastive Regularization. The elaborated contrastive regularization mitigates the distribution gap between the synthetic and real data, and consequently maintains the desired snow-invariant background details. Furthermore, based on the atmospheric scattering model, we introduce a Prior-guided Temporal Decoupling Experts module to decompose the physical components that make up a snowy video in a frame-correlated manner. We evaluate our SemiVDN on benchmark datasets and the collected real snowy data. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art image- and video-level desnowing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Xing, Darius Burschka</p>
<p>Abstract: Human activities recognition is an important task for an intelligent robot, especially in the field of human-robot collaboration, it requires not only the label of sub-activities but also the temporal structure of the activity. In order to automatically recognize both the label and the temporal structure in sequence of human-object interaction, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Convolutional Network (PGCN), which employs a pyramidal encoder-decoder architecture consisting of an attention based graph convolution network and a temporal pyramid pooling module for downsampling and upsampling interaction sequence on the temporal axis, respectively. The system represents the 2D or 3D spatial relation of human and objects from the detection results in video data as a graph. To learn the human-object relations, a new attention graph convolutional network is trained to extract condensed information from the graph representation. To segment action into sub-actions, a novel temporal pyramid pooling module is proposed, which upsamples compressed features back to the original time scale and classifies actions per frame.
  We explore various attention layers, namely spatial attention, temporal attention and channel attention, and combine different upsampling decoders to test the performance on action recognition and segmentation. We evaluate our model on two challenging datasets in the field of human-object interaction recognition, i.e. Bimanual Actions and IKEA Assembly datasets. We demonstrate that our classifier significantly improves both framewise action recognition and segmentation, e.g., F1 micro and F1@50 scores on Bimanual Actions dataset are improved by $4.3\%$ and $8.5\%$ respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Su, Yiqing Zhou, Yu Zhang, Chao Wang, Yi Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Stereo matching for inland waterways is one of the key technologies for the autonomous navigation of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), which involves dividing the stereo images into reference images and target images for pixel-level matching. However, due to the challenges of the inland waterway environment, such as blurred textures, large spatial scales, and computational resource constraints of the USVs platform, the participation of geometric features from the target image is required for efficient target-driven matching. Based on this target-driven concept, we propose a lightweight target-driven stereo matching neural network, named LTNet. Specifically, a lightweight and efficient 4D cost volume, named the Geometry Target Volume (GTV), is designed to fully utilize the geometric information of target features by employing the shifted target features as the filtered feature volume. Subsequently, to address the substantial texture interference and object occlusions present in the waterway environment, a Left-Right Consistency Refinement (LRR) module is proposed. The \text{LRR} utilizes the pixel-level differences in left and right disparities to introduce soft constraints, thereby enhancing the accuracy of predictions during the intermediate stages of the network. Moreover, knowledge distillation is utilized to enhance the generalization capability of lightweight models on the USVInland dataset. Furthermore, a new large-scale benchmark, named Spring, is utilized to validate the applicability of LTNet across various scenarios. In experiments on the aforementioned two datasets, LTNet achieves competitive results, with only 3.7M parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/Open-YiQingZhou/LTNet .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ang He, Ximei Wu, Xing Xu, Jing Chen, Xiaobin Guo, Sheng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Precise segmentation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-captured images plays a vital role in tasks such as crop yield estimation and plant health assessment in banana plantations. By identifying and classifying planted areas, crop area can be calculated, which is indispensable for accurate yield predictions. However, segmenting banana plantation scenes requires a substantial amount of annotated data, and manual labeling of these images is both time-consuming and labor-intensive, limiting the development of large-scale datasets. Furthermore, challenges such as changing target sizes, complex ground backgrounds, limited computational resources, and correct identification of crop categories make segmentation even more difficult. To address these issues, we proposed a comprehensive solution. Firstly, we designed an iterative optimization annotation pipeline leveraging SAM2's zero-shot capabilities to generate high-quality segmentation annotations, thereby reducing the cost and time associated with data annotation significantly. Secondly, we developed ALSS-YOLO-Seg, an efficient lightweight segmentation model optimized for UAV imagery. The model's backbone includes an Adaptive Lightweight Channel Splitting and Shuffling (ALSS) module to improve information exchange between channels and optimize feature extraction, aiding accurate crop identification. Additionally, a Multi-Scale Channel Attention (MSCA) module combines multi-scale feature extraction with channel attention to tackle challenges of varying target sizes and complex ground backgrounds.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose Generalizable and Animatable Gaussian head Avatar (GAGAvatar) for one-shot animatable head avatar reconstruction. Existing methods rely on neural radiance fields, leading to heavy rendering consumption and low reenactment speeds. To address these limitations, we generate the parameters of 3D Gaussians from a single image in a single forward pass. The key innovation of our work is the proposed dual-lifting method, which produces high-fidelity 3D Gaussians that capture identity and facial details. Additionally, we leverage global image features and the 3D morphable model to construct 3D Gaussians for controlling expressions. After training, our model can reconstruct unseen identities without specific optimizations and perform reenactment rendering at real-time speeds. Experiments show that our method exhibits superior performance compared to previous methods in terms of reconstruction quality and expression accuracy. We believe our method can establish new benchmarks for future research and advance applications of digital avatars. Code and demos are available https://github.com/xg-chu/GAGAvatar.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Am\'erico Pereira, Pedro Carvalho, Lu\'is C\^orte-Real</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual scene understanding is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims to extract meaningful information from visual data. It traditionally involves disjoint and specialized algorithms for different tasks that are tailored for specific application scenarios. This can be cumbersome when designing complex systems that include processing of visual and semantic data extracted from visual scenes, which is even more noticeable nowadays with the influx of applications for virtual or augmented reality. When designing a system that employs automatic visual scene understanding to enable a precise and semantically coherent description of the underlying scene, which can be used to fuel a visualization component with 3D virtual synthesis, the lack of flexibility and unified frameworks become more prominent. To alleviate this issue and its inherent problems, we propose an architecture that addresses the challenges of visual scene understanding and description towards a 3D virtual synthesis that enables an adaptable, unified and coherent solution. Furthermore, we expose how our proposition can be of use into multiple application areas. Additionally, we also present a proof of concept system that employs our architecture to further prove its usability in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcel Grimmer, Christoph Busch</p>
<p>Abstract: Face morphing attacks pose a severe security threat to face recognition systems, enabling the morphed face image to be verified against multiple identities. To detect such manipulated images, the development of new face morphing methods becomes essential to increase the diversity of training datasets used for face morph detection. In this study, we present a representation-level face morphing approach, namely LADIMO, that performs morphing on two face recognition embeddings. Specifically, we train a Latent Diffusion Model to invert a biometric template - thus reconstructing the face image from an FRS latent representation. Our subsequent vulnerability analysis demonstrates the high morph attack potential in comparison to MIPGAN-II, an established GAN-based face morphing approach. Finally, we exploit the stochastic LADMIO model design in combination with our identity conditioning mechanism to create unlimited morphing attacks from a single face morph image pair. We show that each face morph variant has an individual attack success rate, enabling us to maximize the morph attack potential by applying a simple re-sampling strategy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilin Wang, Chuan Guo, Li Cheng, Hai Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Can machine automatically generate multiple distinct and natural hand grasps, given specific contact region of an object in 3D? This motivates us to consider a novel task of \textit{Region Controllable Hand Grasp Generation (RegionGrasp)}, as follows: given as input a 3D object, together with its specific surface area selected as the intended contact region, to generate a diverse set of plausible hand grasps of the object, where the thumb finger tip touches the object surface on the contact region. To address this task, RegionGrasp-CVAE is proposed, which consists of two main parts. First, to enable contact region-awareness, we propose ConditionNet as the condition encoder that includes in it a transformer-backboned object encoder, O-Enc; a pretraining strategy is adopted by O-Enc, where the point patches of object surface are randomly masked off and subsequently restored, to further capture surface geometric information of the object. Second, to realize interaction awareness, HOINet is introduced to encode hand-object interaction features by entangling high-level hand features with embedded object features through geometric-aware multi-head cross attention. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach qualitatively and quantitatively where it is shown to compare favorably with respect to the state of the art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: With 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) advancing real-time and high-fidelity rendering for novel view synthesis, storage requirements pose challenges for their widespread adoption. Although various compression techniques have been proposed, previous art suffers from a common limitation: for any existing 3DGS, per-scene optimization is needed to achieve compression, making the compression sluggish and slow. To address this issue, we introduce Fast Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting (FCGS), an optimization-free model that can compress 3DGS representations rapidly in a single feed-forward pass, which significantly reduces compression time from minutes to seconds. To enhance compression efficiency, we propose a multi-path entropy module that assigns Gaussian attributes to different entropy constraint paths for balance between size and fidelity. We also carefully design both inter- and intra-Gaussian context models to remove redundancies among the unstructured Gaussian blobs. Overall, FCGS achieves a compression ratio of over 20X while maintaining fidelity, surpassing most per-scene SOTA optimization-based methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linhui Xiao, Xiaoshan Yang, Fang Peng, Yaowei Wang, Changsheng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Constrained by the separate encoding of vision and language, existing grounding and referring segmentation works heavily rely on bulky Transformer-based fusion en-/decoders and a variety of early-stage interaction technologies. Simultaneously, the current mask visual language modeling (MVLM) fails to capture the nuanced referential relationship between image-text in referring tasks. In this paper, we propose OneRef, a minimalist referring framework built on the modality-shared one-tower transformer that unifies the visual and linguistic feature spaces. To modeling the referential relationship, we introduce a novel MVLM paradigm called Mask Referring Modeling (MRefM), which encompasses both referring-aware mask image modeling and referring-aware mask language modeling. Both modules not only reconstruct modality-related content but also cross-modal referring content. Within MRefM, we propose a referring-aware dynamic image masking strategy that is aware of the referred region rather than relying on fixed ratios or generic random masking schemes. By leveraging the unified visual language feature space and incorporating MRefM's ability to model the referential relations, our approach enables direct regression of the referring results without resorting to various complex techniques. Our method consistently surpasses existing approaches and achieves SoTA performance on both grounding and segmentation tasks, providing valuable insights for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junzhou Chen, Xuan Wen, Ronghui Zhang, Bingtao Ren, Di Wu, Zhigang Xu, Danwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to adapt a model trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain by addressing the domain shift. Existing Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods often fall short in fully leveraging contextual information from the target domain, leading to suboptimal decision boundary separation during source and target domain alignment. To address this, we introduce GrabDAE, an innovative UDA framework designed to tackle domain shift in visual classification tasks. GrabDAE incorporates two key innovations: the Grab-Mask module, which blurs background information in target domain images, enabling the model to focus on essential, domain-relevant features through contrastive learning; and the Denoising Auto-Encoder (DAE), which enhances feature alignment by reconstructing features and filtering noise, ensuring a more robust adaptation to the target domain. These components empower GrabDAE to effectively handle unlabeled target domain data, significantly improving both classification accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including VisDA-2017, Office-Home, and Office31, demonstrate that GrabDAE consistently surpasses state-of-the-art UDA methods, setting new performance benchmarks. By tackling UDA's critical challenges with its novel feature masking and denoising approach, GrabDAE offers both significant theoretical and practical advancements in domain adaptation.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes the paradigm of large convolutional kernels in designing modern Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). We establish that employing a few large kernels, instead of stacking multiple smaller ones, can be a superior design strategy. Our work introduces a set of architecture design guidelines for large-kernel ConvNets that optimize their efficiency and performance. We propose the UniRepLKNet architecture, which offers systematical architecture design principles specifically crafted for large-kernel ConvNets, emphasizing their unique ability to capture extensive spatial information without deep layer stacking. This results in a model that not only surpasses its predecessors with an ImageNet accuracy of 88.0%, an ADE20K mIoU of 55.6%, and a COCO box AP of 56.4% but also demonstrates impressive scalability and performance on various modalities such as time-series forecasting, audio, point cloud, and video recognition. These results indicate the universal modeling abilities of large-kernel ConvNets with faster inference speed compared with vision transformers. Our findings reveal that large-kernel ConvNets possess larger effective receptive fields and a higher shape bias, moving away from the texture bias typical of smaller-kernel CNNs.

The framework employs a greedy topology preserving reordering of original nodes which allows for seamless integration into existing data processing pipelines. This reordering process depends solely on mesh connectivity and can be performed offline for optimal efficiency. However, the algorithm's greedy nature also supports on-the-fly implementation. The proposed method is compatible with any compression algorithm that leverages spatial correlations within the data.

<p>Abstract: Recent deep-learning-based approaches to single-image reflection removal have shown promising advances, primarily for two reasons: 1) the utilization of recognition-pretrained features as inputs, and 2) the design of dual-stream interaction networks. However, according to the Information Bottleneck principle, high-level semantic clues tend to be compressed or discarded during layer-by-layer propagation. Additionally, interactions in dual-stream networks follow a fixed pattern across different layers, limiting overall performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel architecture called Reversible Decoupling Network (RDNet), which employs a reversible encoder to secure valuable information while flexibly decoupling transmission- and reflection-relevant features during the forward pass. Furthermore, we customize a transmission-rate-aware prompt generator to dynamically calibrate features, further boosting performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of RDNet over existing SOTA methods on five widely-adopted benchmark datasets. Our code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Zhan, Qingtian Zhu, Muyao Niu, Mingze Ma, Jiancheng Zhao, Zhihang Zhong, Xiao Sun, Yu Qiao, Yinqiang Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we highlight a critical yet often overlooked factor in most 3D human tasks, namely modeling humans with complex garments. It is known that the parameterized formulation of SMPL is able to fit human skin; while complex garments, e.g., hand-held objects and loose-fitting garments, are difficult to get modeled within the unified framework, since their movements are usually decoupled with the human body. To enhance the capability of SMPL skeleton in response to this situation, we propose a modular growth strategy that enables the joint tree of the skeleton to expand adaptively. Specifically, our method, called ToMiE, consists of parent joints localization and external joints optimization. For parent joints localization, we employ a gradient-based approach guided by both LBS blending weights and motion kernels. Once the external joints are obtained, we proceed to optimize their transformations in SE(3) across different frames, enabling rendering and explicit animation. ToMiE manages to outperform other methods across various cases with garments, not only in rendering quality but also by offering free animation of grown joints, thereby enhancing the expressive ability of SMPL skeleton for a broader range of applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite alleviating the dependence on dense annotations inherent to fully supervised methods, weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation suffers from inadequate supervision signals. In response to this challenge, we introduce a novel perspective that imparts auxiliary constraints by regulating the feature space under weak supervision. Our initial investigation identifies which distributions accurately characterize the feature space, subsequently leveraging this priori to guide the alignment of the weakly supervised embeddings. Specifically, we analyze the superiority of the mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions (moVMF) among several common distribution candidates. Accordingly, we develop a Distribution Guidance Network (DGNet), which comprises a weakly supervised learning branch and a distribution alignment branch. Leveraging reliable clustering initialization derived from the weakly supervised learning branch, the distribution alignment branch alternately updates the parameters of the moVMF and the network, ensuring alignment with the moVMF-defined latent space. Extensive experiments validate the rationality and effectiveness of our distribution choice and network design. Consequently, DGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance under multiple datasets and various weakly supervised settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Chen, Jingyi Tang, Gu Wang, Shengquan Li, Xinghui Li, Xiangyang Ji, Xiu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the unique characteristics of underwater environments, accurate 3D reconstruction of underwater objects poses a challenging problem in tasks such as underwater exploration and mapping. Traditional methods that rely on multiple sensor data for 3D reconstruction are time-consuming and face challenges in data acquisition in underwater scenarios. We propose UW-SDF, a framework for reconstructing target objects from multi-view underwater images based on neural SDF. We introduce hybrid geometric priors to optimize the reconstruction process, markedly enhancing the quality and efficiency of neural SDF reconstruction. Additionally, to address the challenge of segmentation consistency in multi-view images, we propose a novel few-shot multi-view target segmentation strategy using the general-purpose segmentation model (SAM), enabling rapid automatic segmentation of unseen objects. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on diverse datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the traditional underwater 3D reconstruction method and other neural rendering approaches in the field of underwater 3D reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyan Jiang, Licheng Jiang, Anjie Wang, Kaiying Zhu, Yongbin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating grayscale and depth data in road inspection robots could enhance the accuracy, reliability, and comprehensiveness of road condition assessments, leading to improved maintenance strategies and safer infrastructure. However, these data sources are often compromised by significant background noise from the pavement. Recent advancements in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPM) have demonstrated remarkable success in image segmentation tasks, showcasing potent denoising capabilities, as evidenced in studies like SegDiff \cite{amit2021segdiff}. Despite these advancements, current DPM-based segmentors do not fully capitalize on the potential of original image data. In this paper, we propose a novel DPM-based approach for crack segmentation, named CrackSegDiff, which uniquely fuses grayscale and range/depth images. This method enhances the reverse diffusion process by intensifying the interaction between local feature extraction via DPM and global feature extraction. Unlike traditional methods that utilize Transformers for global features, our approach employs Vm-unet \cite{ruan2024vm} to efficiently capture long-range information of the original data. The integration of features is further refined through two innovative modules: the Channel Fusion Module (CFM) and the Shallow Feature Compensation Module (SFCM). Our experimental evaluation on the three-class crack image segmentation tasks within the FIND dataset demonstrates that CrackSegDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly excelling in the detection of shallow cracks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Huang, Chengrui Dong, Peidong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit neural representation and explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) for novel view synthesis have achieved remarkable progress with frame-based camera (e.g. RGB and RGB-D cameras) recently. Compared to frame-based camera, a novel type of bio-inspired visual sensor, i.e. event camera, has demonstrated advantages in high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low power consumption and low latency. Due to its unique asynchronous and irregular data capturing process, limited work has been proposed to apply neural representation or 3D Gaussian splatting for an event camera. In this work, we present IncEventGS, an incremental 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction algorithm with a single event camera. To recover the 3D scene representation incrementally, we exploit the tracking and mapping paradigm of conventional SLAM pipelines for IncEventGS. Given the incoming event stream, the tracker firstly estimates an initial camera motion based on prior reconstructed 3D-GS scene representation. The mapper then jointly refines both the 3D scene representation and camera motion based on the previously estimated motion trajectory from the tracker. The experimental results demonstrate that IncEventGS delivers superior performance compared to prior NeRF-based methods and other related baselines, even we do not have the ground-truth camera poses. Furthermore, our method can also deliver better performance compared to state-of-the-art event visual odometry methods in terms of camera motion estimation.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08114">Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning in Spectral Domain for Point Cloud Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingkang Liang, Tianrui Feng, Xin Zhou, Yumeng Zhang, Zhikang Zou, Xiang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, leveraging pre-training techniques to enhance point cloud models has become a hot research topic. However, existing approaches typically require full fine-tuning of pre-trained models to achieve satisfied performance on downstream tasks, accompanying storage-intensive and computationally demanding. To address this issue, we propose a novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method for point cloud, called PointGST (Point cloud Graph Spectral Tuning). PointGST freezes the pre-trained model and introduces a lightweight, trainable Point Cloud Spectral Adapter (PCSA) to fine-tune parameters in the spectral domain. The core idea is built on two observations: 1) The inner tokens from frozen models might present confusion in the spatial domain; 2) Task-specific intrinsic information is important for transferring the general knowledge to the downstream task. Specifically, PointGST transfers the point tokens from the spatial domain to the spectral domain, effectively de-correlating confusion among tokens via using orthogonal components for separating. Moreover, the generated spectral basis involves intrinsic information about the downstream point clouds, enabling more targeted tuning. As a result, PointGST facilitates the efficient transfer of general knowledge to downstream tasks while significantly reducing training costs. Extensive experiments on challenging point cloud datasets across various tasks demonstrate that PointGST not only outperforms its fully fine-tuning counterpart but also significantly reduces trainable parameters, making it a promising solution for efficient point cloud learning. It improves upon a solid baseline by +2.28%, 1.16%, and 2.78%, resulting in 99.48%, 97.76%, and 96.18% on the ScanObjNN OBJ BG, OBJ OBLY, and PB T50 RS datasets, respectively. This advancement establishes a new state-of-the-art, using only 0.67% of the trainable parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyu Chen, Ameenat L. Solebo, Weiye Bao, Paul Taylor</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image quality assessment (MIQA) is essential for reliable medical image analysis. While deep learning has shown promise in this field, current models could be misled by spurious correlations learned from data and struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To that end, we propose an MIQA framework based on a concept from causal inference: Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS). PNS measures how likely a set of features is to be both necessary (always present for an outcome) and sufficient (capable of guaranteeing an outcome) for a particular result. Our approach leverages this concept by learning hidden features from medical images with high PNS values for quality prediction. This encourages models to capture more essential predictive information, enhancing their robustness to OOD scenarios. We evaluate our framework on an Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) dataset for the MIQA task and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changyuan Wang, Ziwei Wang, Xiuwei Xu, Yansong Tang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a post-training quantization framework of large vision-language models (LVLMs) for efficient multi-modal inference. Conventional quantization methods sequentially search the layer-wise rounding functions by minimizing activation discretization errors, which fails to acquire optimal quantization strategy without considering cross-layer dependency. On the contrary, we mine the cross-layer dependency that significantly influences discretization errors of the entire vision-language model, and embed this dependency into optimal quantization strategy searching with low search cost. Specifically, we observe the strong correlation between the activation entropy and the cross-layer dependency concerning output discretization errors. Therefore, we employ the entropy as the proxy to partition blocks optimally, which aims to achieve satisfying trade-offs between discretization errors and the search cost. Moreover, we optimize the visual encoder to disentangle the cross-layer dependency for fine-grained decomposition of search space, so that the search cost is further reduced without harming the quantization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method compresses the memory by 2.78x and increase generate speed by 1.44x about 13B LLaVA model without performance degradation on diverse multi-modal reasoning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Desai Xie, Zhan Xu, Yicong Hong, Hao Tan, Difan Liu, Feng Liu, Arie Kaufman, Yang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Current frontier video diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable results at generating high-quality videos. However, they can only generate short video clips, normally around 10 seconds or 240 frames, due to computation limitations during training. In this work, we show that existing models can be naturally extended to autoregressive video diffusion models without changing the architectures. Our key idea is to assign the latent frames with progressively increasing noise levels rather than a single noise level, which allows for fine-grained condition among the latents and large overlaps between the attention windows. Such progressive video denoising allows our models to autoregressively generate video frames without quality degradation or abrupt scene changes. We present state-of-the-art results on long video generation at 1 minute (1440 frames at 24 FPS). Videos from this paper are available at https://desaixie.github.io/pa-vdm/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pragyan Shrestha, Chun Xie, Yuichi Yoshii, Itaru Kitahara</p>
<p>Abstract: Intra-operative 2D-3D registration of X-ray images with pre-operatively acquired CT scans is a crucial procedure in orthopedic surgeries. Anatomical landmarks pre-annotated in the CT volume can be detected in X-ray images to establish 2D-3D correspondences, which are then utilized for registration. However, registration often fails in certain view angles due to poor landmark visibility. We propose a novel method to address this issue by detecting arbitrary landmark points in X-ray images. Our approach represents 3D points as distinct subspaces, formed by feature vectors (referred to as ray embeddings) corresponding to intersecting rays. Establishing 2D-3D correspondences then becomes a task of finding ray embeddings that are close to a given subspace, essentially performing an intersection test. Unlike conventional methods for landmark estimation, our approach eliminates the need for manually annotating fixed landmarks. We trained our model using the synthetic images generated from CTPelvic1K CLINIC dataset, which contains 103 CT volumes, and evaluated it on the DeepFluoro dataset, comprising real X-ray images. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over conventional methods. The code is available at https://github.com/Pragyanstha/rayemb.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiatao Gu, Yuyang Wang, Yizhe Zhang, Qihang Zhang, Dinghuai Zhang, Navdeep Jaitly, Josh Susskind, Shuangfei Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have become the dominant approach for visual generation. They are trained by denoising a Markovian process that gradually adds noise to the input. We argue that the Markovian property limits the models ability to fully utilize the generation trajectory, leading to inefficiencies during training and inference. In this paper, we propose DART, a transformer-based model that unifies autoregressive (AR) and diffusion within a non-Markovian framework. DART iteratively denoises image patches spatially and spectrally using an AR model with the same architecture as standard language models. DART does not rely on image quantization, enabling more effective image modeling while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, DART seamlessly trains with both text and image data in a unified model. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance on class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks, offering a scalable, efficient alternative to traditional diffusion models. Through this unified framework, DART sets a new benchmark for scalable, high-quality image synthesis.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present ZeroComp, an effective zero-shot 3D object compositing approach that does not require paired composite-scene images during training. Our method leverages ControlNet to condition from intrinsic images and combines it with a Stable Diffusion model to utilize its scene priors, together operating as an effective rendering engine. During training, ZeroComp uses intrinsic images based on geometry, albedo, and masked shading, all without the need for paired images of scenes with and without composite objects. Once trained, it seamlessly integrates virtual 3D objects into scenes, adjusting shading to create realistic composites. We developed a high-quality evaluation dataset and demonstrate that ZeroComp outperforms methods using explicit lighting estimations and generative techniques in quantitative and human perception benchmarks. Additionally, ZeroComp extends to real and outdoor image compositing, even when trained solely on synthetic indoor data, showcasing its effectiveness in image compositing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hsing-Hua Wang, Fu-Jen Tsai, Yen-Yu Lin, Chia-Wen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Adverse weather image restoration aims to remove unwanted degraded artifacts, such as haze, rain, and snow, caused by adverse weather conditions. Existing methods achieve remarkable results for addressing single-weather conditions. However, they face challenges when encountering unpredictable weather conditions, which often happen in real-world scenarios. Although different weather conditions exhibit different degradation patterns, they share common characteristics that are highly related and complementary, such as occlusions caused by degradation patterns, color distortion, and contrast attenuation due to the scattering of atmospheric particles. Therefore, we focus on leveraging common knowledge across multiple weather conditions to restore images in a unified manner. In this paper, we propose a Triplet Attention Network (TANet) to efficiently and effectively address all-in-one adverse weather image restoration. TANet consists of Triplet Attention Block (TAB) that incorporates three types of attention mechanisms: Local Pixel-wise Attention (LPA) and Global Strip-wise Attention (GSA) to address occlusions caused by non-uniform degradation patterns, and Global Distribution Attention (GDA) to address color distortion and contrast attenuation caused by atmospheric phenomena. By leveraging common knowledge shared across different weather conditions, TANet successfully addresses multiple weather conditions in a unified manner. Experimental results show that TANet efficiently and effectively achieves state-of-the-art performance in all-in-one adverse weather image restoration.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxue Chen, Jv Zheng, Hao Huang, Haoran Xu, Weihao Gu, Kangliang Chen, He xiang, Huan-ang Gao, Hao Zhao, Guyue Zhou, Yaqin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The generation of high-quality 3D car assets is essential for various applications, including video games, autonomous driving, and virtual reality. Current 3D generation methods utilizing NeRF or 3D-GS as representations for 3D objects, generate a Lambertian object under fixed lighting and lack separated modelings for material and global illumination. As a result, the generated assets are unsuitable for relighting under varying lighting conditions, limiting their applicability in downstream tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel relightable 3D object generative framework that automates the creation of 3D car assets, enabling the swift and accurate reconstruction of a vehicle's geometry, texture, and material properties from a single input image. Our approach begins with introducing a large-scale synthetic car dataset comprising over 1,000 high-precision 3D vehicle models. We represent 3D objects using global illumination and relightable 3D Gaussian primitives integrating with BRDF parameters. Building on this representation, we introduce a feed-forward model that takes images as input and outputs both relightable 3D Gaussians and global illumination parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces photorealistic 3D car assets that can be seamlessly integrated into road scenes with different illuminations, which offers substantial practical benefits for industrial applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing multimodal retrieval benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether models can retrieve and utilize external textual knowledge for question answering. However, there are scenarios where retrieving visual information is either more beneficial or easier to access than textual data. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation benchmark, MRAG-Bench, in which we systematically identify and categorize scenarios where visually augmented knowledge is better than textual knowledge, for instance, more images from varying viewpoints. MRAG-Bench consists of 16,130 images and 1,353 human-annotated multiple-choice questions across 9 distinct scenarios. With MRAG-Bench, we conduct an evaluation of 10 open-source and 4 proprietary large vision-language models (LVLMs). Our results show that all LVLMs exhibit greater improvements when augmented with images compared to textual knowledge, confirming that MRAG-Bench is vision-centric. Additionally, we conduct extensive analysis with MRAG-Bench, which offers valuable insights into retrieval-augmented LVLMs. Notably, the top-performing model, GPT-4o, faces challenges in effectively leveraging retrieved knowledge, achieving only a 5.82% improvement with ground-truth information, in contrast to a 33.16% improvement observed in human participants. These findings highlight the importance of MRAG-Bench in encouraging the community to enhance LVLMs' ability to utilize retrieved visual knowledge more effectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion transformers (DiT) have already achieved appealing synthesis and scaling properties in content recreation, e.g., image and video generation. However, scaling laws of DiT are less explored, which usually offer precise predictions regarding optimal model size and data requirements given a specific compute budget. Therefore, experiments across a broad range of compute budgets, from 1e17 to 6e18 FLOPs are conducted to confirm the existence of scaling laws in DiT for the first time. Concretely, the loss of pretraining DiT also follows a power-law relationship with the involved compute. Based on the scaling law, we can not only determine the optimal model size and required data but also accurately predict the text-to-image generation loss given a model with 1B parameters and a compute budget of 1e21 FLOPs. Additionally, we also demonstrate that the trend of pre-training loss matches the generation performances (e.g., FID), even across various datasets, which complements the mapping from compute to synthesis quality and thus provides a predictable benchmark that assesses model performance and data quality at a reduced cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a novel framework for free-viewpoint facial performance relighting using diffusion-based image-to-image translation. Leveraging a subject-specific dataset containing diverse facial expressions captured under various lighting conditions, including flat-lit and one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) scenarios, we train a diffusion model for precise lighting control, enabling high-fidelity relit facial images from flat-lit inputs. Our framework includes spatially-aligned conditioning of flat-lit captures and random noise, along with integrated lighting information for global control, utilizing prior knowledge from the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. This model is then applied to dynamic facial performances captured in a consistent flat-lit environment and reconstructed for novel-view synthesis using a scalable dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting method to maintain quality and consistency in the relit results. In addition, we introduce unified lighting control by integrating a novel area lighting representation with directional lighting, allowing for joint adjustments in light size and direction. We also enable high dynamic range imaging (HDRI) composition using multiple directional lights to produce dynamic sequences under complex lighting conditions. Our evaluations demonstrate the models efficiency in achieving precise lighting control and generalizing across various facial expressions while preserving detailed features such as skintexture andhair. The model accurately reproduces complex lighting effects like eye reflections, subsurface scattering, self-shadowing, and translucency, advancing photorealism within our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Yin, Xiuwei Xu, Zhenyu Wu, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new framework for zero-shot object navigation. Existing zero-shot object navigation methods prompt LLM with the text of spatially closed objects, which lacks enough scene context for in-depth reasoning. To better preserve the information of environment and fully exploit the reasoning ability of LLM, we propose to represent the observed scene with 3D scene graph. The scene graph encodes the relationships between objects, groups and rooms with a LLM-friendly structure, for which we design a hierarchical chain-of-thought prompt to help LLM reason the goal location according to scene context by traversing the nodes and edges. Moreover, benefit from the scene graph representation, we further design a re-perception mechanism to empower the object navigation framework with the ability to correct perception error. We conduct extensive experiments on MP3D, HM3D and RoboTHOR environments, where SG-Nav surpasses previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by more than 10% SR on all benchmarks, while the decision process is explainable. To the best of our knowledge, SG-Nav is the first zero-shot method that achieves even higher performance than supervised object navigation methods on the challenging MP3D benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Lu, Yifan Zhang, Qiuhong Shen, Xinchao Wang, Shuicheng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), known for its groundbreaking performance and efficiency, has become a dominant 3D representation and brought progress to many 3D vision tasks. However, in this work, we reveal a significant security vulnerability that has been largely overlooked in 3DGS: the computation cost of training 3DGS could be maliciously tampered by poisoning the input data. By developing an attack named Poison-splat, we reveal a novel attack surface where the adversary can poison the input images to drastically increase the computation memory and time needed for 3DGS training, pushing the algorithm towards its worst computation complexity. In extreme cases, the attack can even consume all allocable memory, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) that disrupts servers, resulting in practical damages to real-world 3DGS service vendors. Such a computation cost attack is achieved by addressing a bi-level optimization problem through three tailored strategies: attack objective approximation, proxy model rendering, and optional constrained optimization. These strategies not only ensure the effectiveness of our attack but also make it difficult to defend with simple defensive measures. We hope the revelation of this novel attack surface can spark attention to this crucial yet overlooked vulnerability of 3DGS systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have shown remarkable creative capabilities with textual prompts, but generating personalized instances based on specific subjects, known as subject-driven generation, remains challenging. To tackle this issue, we present a new hybrid framework called HybridBooth, which merges the benefits of optimization-based and direct-regression methods. HybridBooth operates in two stages: the Word Embedding Probe, which generates a robust initial word embedding using a fine-tuned encoder, and the Word Embedding Refinement, which further adapts the encoder to specific subject images by optimizing key parameters. This approach allows for effective and fast inversion of visual concepts into textual embedding, even from a single image, while maintaining the model's generalization capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gen Luo, Xue Yang, Wenhan Dou, Zhaokai Wang, Jifeng Dai, Yu Qiao, Xizhou Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to an influx of efforts to extend their capabilities to multimodal tasks. Among them, growing attention has been focused on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single LLM. Despite the structural simplicity and deployment-friendliness, training a monolithic MLLM with promising performance still remains challenging. In particular, the popular approaches adopt continuous pre-training to extend a pre-trained LLM to a monolithic MLLM, which suffers from catastrophic forgetting and leads to performance degeneration. In this paper, we aim to overcome this limitation from the perspective of delta tuning. Specifically, our core idea is to embed visual parameters into a pre-trained LLM, thereby incrementally learning visual knowledge from massive data via delta tuning, i.e., freezing the LLM when optimizing the visual parameters. Based on this principle, we present Mono-InternVL, a novel monolithic MLLM that seamlessly integrates a set of visual experts via a multimodal mixture-of-experts structure. Moreover, we propose an innovative pre-training strategy to maximize the visual capability of Mono-InternVL, namely Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP). In particular, EViP is designed as a progressive learning process for visual experts, which aims to fully exploit the visual knowledge from noisy data to high-quality data. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on 16 benchmarks. Experimental results not only validate the superior performance of Mono-InternVL compared to the state-of-the-art MLLM on 6 multimodal benchmarks, e.g., +113 points over InternVL-1.5 on OCRBench, but also confirm its better deployment efficiency, with first token latency reduced by up to 67%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilya Fradlin, Idil Esen Zulfikar, Kadir Yilmaz, Theodora Kontogianni, Bastian Leibe</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactive segmentation has an important role in facilitating the annotation process of future LiDAR datasets. Existing approaches sequentially segment individual objects at each LiDAR scan, repeating the process throughout the entire sequence, which is redundant and ineffective. In this work, we propose interactive 4D segmentation, a new paradigm that allows segmenting multiple objects on multiple LiDAR scans simultaneously, and Interactive4D, the first interactive 4D segmentation model that segments multiple objects on superimposed consecutive LiDAR scans in a single iteration by utilizing the sequential nature of LiDAR data. While performing interactive segmentation, our model leverages the entire space-time volume, leading to more efficient segmentation. Operating on the 4D volume, it directly provides consistent instance IDs over time and also simplifies tracking annotations. Moreover, we show that click simulations are crucial for successful model training on LiDAR point clouds. To this end, we design a click simulation strategy that is better suited for the characteristics of LiDAR data. To demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness, we evaluate Interactive4D on multiple LiDAR datasets, where Interactive4D achieves a new state-of-the-art by a large margin. Upon acceptance, we will publicly release the code and models at https://vision.rwth-aachen.de/Interactive4D.</p>

<p>Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have achieved success in tasks like image generation and masked language modeling but face limitations in controlled content editing. We introduce DICE (Discrete Inversion for Controllable Editing), the first approach to enable precise inversion for discrete diffusion models, including multinomial diffusion and masked generative models. By recording noise sequences and masking patterns during the reverse diffusion process, DICE enables accurate reconstruction and flexible editing of discrete data without the need for predefined masks or attention manipulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DICE across both image and text domains, evaluating it on models such as VQ-Diffusion, Paella, and RoBERTa. Our results show that DICE preserves high data fidelity while enhancing editing capabilities, offering new opportunities for fine-grained content manipulation in discrete spaces.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SPA, a novel representation learning framework that emphasizes the importance of 3D spatial awareness in embodied AI. Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08209">Emerging Pixel Grounding in Large Multimodal Models Without Grounding Supervision</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengcao Cao, Liang-Yan Gui, Yu-Xiong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current large multimodal models (LMMs) face challenges in grounding, which requires the model to relate language components to visual entities. Contrary to the common practice that fine-tunes LMMs with additional grounding supervision, we find that the grounding ability can in fact emerge in LMMs trained without explicit grounding supervision. To reveal this emerging grounding, we introduce an "attend-and-segment" method which leverages attention maps from standard LMMs to perform pixel-level segmentation. Furthermore, to enhance the grounding ability, we propose DIFFLMM, an LMM utilizing a diffusion-based visual encoder, as opposed to the standard CLIP visual encoder, and trained with the same weak supervision. Without being constrained by the biases and limited scale of grounding-specific supervision data, our approach is more generalizable and scalable. We achieve competitive performance on both grounding-specific and general visual question answering benchmarks, compared with grounding LMMs and generalist LMMs, respectively. Notably, we achieve a 44.2 grounding mask recall on grounded conversation generation without any grounding supervision, outperforming the extensively supervised model GLaMM.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Botao Ren, Xue Yang, Yi Yu, Junwei Luo, Zhidong Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Single point supervised oriented object detection has gained attention and made initial progress within the community. Diverse from those approaches relying on one-shot samples or powerful pretrained models (e.g. SAM), PointOBB has shown promise due to its prior-free feature. In this paper, we propose PointOBB-v2, a simpler, faster, and stronger method to generate pseudo rotated boxes from points without relying on any other prior. Specifically, we first generate a Class Probability Map (CPM) by training the network with non-uniform positive and negative sampling. We show that the CPM is able to learn the approximate object regions and their contours. Then, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to accurately estimate the orientation and the boundary of objects. By further incorporating a separation mechanism, we resolve the confusion caused by the overlapping on the CPM, enabling its operation in high-density scenarios. Extensive comparisons demonstrate that our method achieves a training speed 15.58x faster and an accuracy improvement of 11.60%/25.15%/21.19% on the DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 datasets compared to the previous state-of-the-art, PointOBB. This significantly advances the cutting edge of single point supervised oriented detection in the modular track.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anh-Quan Cao, Maximilian Jaritz, Matthieu Guillaumin, Raoul de Charette, Loris Bazzani</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale vision-language pre-trained (VLP) models (e.g., CLIP) are renowned for their versatility, as they can be applied to diverse applications in a zero-shot setup. However, when these models are used in specific domains, their performance often falls short due to domain gaps or the under-representation of these domains in the training data. While fine-tuning VLP models on custom datasets with human-annotated labels can address this issue, annotating even a small-scale dataset (e.g., 100k samples) can be an expensive endeavor, often requiring expert annotators if the task is complex. To address these challenges, we propose LatteCLIP, an unsupervised method for fine-tuning CLIP models on classification with known class names in custom domains, without relying on human annotations. Our method leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to generate expressive textual descriptions for both individual images and groups of images. These provide additional contextual information to guide the fine-tuning process in the custom domains. Since LMM-generated descriptions are prone to hallucination or missing details, we introduce a novel strategy to distill only the useful information and stabilize the training. Specifically, we learn rich per-class prototype representations from noisy generated texts and dual pseudo-labels. Our experiments on 10 domain-specific datasets show that LatteCLIP outperforms pre-trained zero-shot methods by an average improvement of +4.74 points in top-1 accuracy and other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by +3.45 points.</p>

<p>Abstract: Applying deep learning (DL) for annotating surgical instruments in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgeries (MIS) represents a significant advancement in surgical technology. This systematic review examines 48 studies that and advanced DL methods and architectures. These sophisticated DL models have shown notable improvements in the precision and efficiency of detecting and segmenting surgical tools. The enhanced capabilities of these models support various clinical applications, including real-time intraoperative guidance, comprehensive postoperative evaluations, and objective assessments of surgical skills. By accurately identifying and segmenting surgical instruments in video data, DL models provide detailed feedback to surgeons, thereby improving surgical outcomes and reducing complication risks. Furthermore, the application of DL in surgical education is transformative. The review underscores the significant impact of DL on improving the accuracy of skill assessments and the overall quality of surgical training programs. However, implementing DL in surgical tool detection and segmentation faces challenges, such as the need for large, accurately annotated datasets to train these models effectively. The manual annotation process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, posing a significant bottleneck. Future research should focus on automating the detection and segmentation process and enhancing the robustness of DL models against environmental variations. Expanding the application of DL models across various surgical specialties will be essential to fully realize this technology's potential. Integrating DL with other emerging technologies, such as augmented reality (AR), also offers promising opportunities to further enhance the precision and efficacy of surgical procedures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \"Ozg\"un Turgut, Philip M\"uller, Martin J. Menten, Daniel Rueckert</p>
<p>Abstract: In natural language processing and computer vision, self-supervised pre-training on large datasets unlocks foundational model capabilities across domains and tasks. However, this potential has not yet been realised in time series analysis, where existing methods disregard the heterogeneous nature of time series characteristics. Time series are prevalent in many domains, including medicine, engineering, natural sciences, and finance, but their characteristics vary significantly in terms of variate count, inter-variate relationships, temporal dynamics, and sampling frequency. This inherent heterogeneity across domains prevents effective pre-training on large time series corpora. To address this issue, we introduce OTiS, an open model for general time series analysis, that has been specifically designed to handle multi-domain heterogeneity. We propose a novel pre-training paradigm including a tokeniser with learnable domain-specific signatures, a dual masking strategy to capture temporal causality, and a normalised cross-correlation loss to model long-range dependencies. Our model is pre-trained on a large corpus of 640,187 samples and 11 billion time points spanning 8 distinct domains, enabling it to analyse time series from any (unseen) domain. In comprehensive experiments across 15 diverse applications - including classification, regression, and forecasting - OTiS showcases its ability to accurately capture domain-specific data characteristics and demonstrates its competitiveness against state-of-the-art baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumeet Batra, Gaurav S. Sukhatme</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalizing vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) agents to novel environments remains a difficult and open challenge. Current trends are to collect large-scale datasets or use data augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting and improve downstream generalization. However, the computational and data collection costs increase exponentially with the number of task variations and can destabilize the already difficult task of training RL agents. In this work, we take inspiration from recent advances in computational neuroscience and propose a model, Associative Latent DisentAnglement (ALDA), that builds on standard off-policy RL towards zero-shot generalization. Specifically, we revisit the role of latent disentanglement in RL and show how combining it with a model of associative memory achieves zero-shot generalization on difficult task variations without relying on data augmentation. Finally, we formally show that data augmentation techniques are a form of weak disentanglement and discuss the implications of this insight.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sai Nag Anurag Nangunoori, Akshara Karthic Mahadevan</p>
<p>Abstract: We employ the Hopfield model as a simplified framework to explore both the memory deficits and the biochemical processes characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. By simulating neuronal death and synaptic degradation through increasing the number of stored patterns and introducing noise into the synaptic weights, we demonstrate hallmark symptoms of dementia, including memory loss, confusion, and delayed retrieval times. As the network's capacity is exceeded, retrieval errors increase, mirroring the cognitive confusion observed in Alzheimer's patients. Additionally, we simulate the impact of synaptic degradation by varying the sparsity of the weight matrix, showing impaired memory recall and reduced retrieval success as noise levels increase. Furthermore, we extend our model to connect memory loss with biochemical processes linked to Alzheimer's. By simulating the role of reduced insulin sensitivity over time, we show how it can trigger increased calcium influx into mitochondria, leading to misfolded proteins and the formation of amyloid plaques. These findings, modeled over time, suggest that both neuronal degradation and metabolic factors contribute to the progressive decline seen in Alzheimer's disease. Our work offers a computational framework for understanding the dual impact of synaptic and metabolic dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D single-pixel imaging (SPI) is a promising imaging technique that can be ffexibly applied to various wavebands. The main challenge in 3D SPI is that the calibration usually requires a large number of standard points as references, which are tricky to capture using single-pixel detectors. Conventional solutions involve sophisticated device deployment and cumbersome operations, resulting in hundreds of images needed for calibration. In our work, we construct a Calibration Field (CaliF) to efffciently generate the standard points from one single image. A high accuracy of the CaliF is guaranteed by the technique of deep learning and digital twin. We perform experiments with our new method to verify its validity and accuracy. We believe our work holds great potential in 3D SPI systems or even general imaging systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seongyun Lee, Geewook Kim, Jiyeon Kim, Hyunji Lee, Hoyeon Chang, Sue Hyun Park, Minjoon Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language adaptation (VL adaptation) transforms Large Language Models (LLMs) into Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for multimodal tasks, but this process often compromises the inherent safety capabilities embedded in the original LLMs. Despite potential harmfulness due to weakened safety measures, in-depth analysis on the effects of VL adaptation on safety remains under-explored. This study examines how VL adaptation influences safety and evaluates the impact of safety fine-tuning methods. Our analysis reveals that safety degradation occurs during VL adaptation, even when the training data is safe. While safety tuning techniques like supervised fine-tuning with safety datasets or reinforcement learning from human feedback mitigate some risks, they still lead to safety degradation and a reduction in helpfulness due to over-rejection issues. Further analysis of internal model weights suggests that VL adaptation may impact certain safety-related layers, potentially lowering overall safety levels. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that the objectives of VL adaptation and safety tuning are divergent, which often results in their simultaneous application being suboptimal. To address this, we suggest the weight merging approach as an optimal solution effectively reducing safety degradation while maintaining helpfulness. These insights help guide the development of more reliable and secure LVLMs for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal encoders like CLIP excel in tasks such as zero-shot image classification and cross-modal retrieval. However, they require excessive training data. We propose canonical similarity analysis (CSA), which uses two unimodal encoders to replicate multimodal encoders using limited data. CSA maps unimodal features into a multimodal space, using a new similarity score to retain only the multimodal information. CSA only involves the inference of unimodal encoders and a cubic-complexity matrix decomposition, eliminating the need for extensive GPU-based model training. Experiments show that CSA outperforms CLIP while requiring $300,000\times$ fewer multimodal data pairs and $6\times$ fewer unimodal data for ImageNet classification and misinformative news captions detection. CSA surpasses the state-of-the-art method to map unimodal features to multimodal features. We also demonstrate the ability of CSA with modalities beyond image and text, paving the way for future modality pairs with limited paired multimodal data but abundant unpaired unimodal data, such as lidar and text.</p>

<p>Abstract: Super-resolution methods are increasingly being specialized for both real-world and face-specific tasks. However, many existing approaches rely on simplistic degradation models, which limits their ability to handle complex and unknown degradation patterns effectively. While diffusion-based super-resolution techniques have recently shown impressive results, they are still constrained by the need for numerous inference steps. To address this, we propose TDDSR, an efficient single-step diffusion-based super-resolution method. Our method, distilled from a pre-trained teacher model and based on a diffusion network, performs super-resolution in a single step. It integrates a learnable downsampler to capture diverse degradation patterns and employs two discriminators, one for high-resolution and one for low-resolution images, to enhance the overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness across real-world and face-specific SR tasks, achieving performance comparable to, or even surpassing, another single-step method, previous state-of-the-art models, and the teacher model.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a structured multivariate density, subject to Markov conditions implied by an undirected graph. In the worst case, without Markovian assumptions, this problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Our main result shows how the curse of dimensionality can be avoided or greatly alleviated under the Markov property, and applies to arbitrary graphs. While existing results along these lines focus on sparsity or manifold assumptions, we introduce a new graphical quantity called "graph resilience" and show how it controls the sample complexity. Surprisingly, although one might expect the sample complexity of this problem to scale with local graph parameters such as the degree, this turns out not to be the case. Through explicit examples, we compute uniform deviation bounds and illustrate how the curse of dimensionality in density estimation can thus be circumvented. Notable examples where the rate improves substantially include sequential, hierarchical, and spatial data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data-driven methods have shown great potential in solving challenging manipulation tasks, however, their application in the domain of deformable objects has been constrained, in part, by the lack of data. To address this, we propose PokeFlex, a dataset featuring real-world paired and annotated multimodal data that includes 3D textured meshes, point clouds, RGB images, and depth maps. Such data can be leveraged for several downstream tasks such as online 3D mesh reconstruction, and it can potentially enable underexplored applications such as the real-world deployment of traditional control methods based on mesh simulations. To deal with the challenges posed by real-world 3D mesh reconstruction, we leverage a professional volumetric capture system that allows complete 360{\deg} reconstruction. PokeFlex consists of 18 deformable objects with varying stiffness and shapes. Deformations are generated by dropping objects onto a flat surface or by poking the objects with a robot arm.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vignesh Sundaresha, Naresh Shanbhag</p>
<p>Abstract: The ubiquitous deployment of deep learning systems on resource-constrained Edge devices is hindered by their high computational complexity coupled with their fragility to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, especially to naturally occurring common corruptions. Current solutions rely on the Cloud to train and compress models before deploying to the Edge. This incurs high energy and latency costs in transmitting locally acquired field data to the Cloud while also raising privacy concerns. We propose GEARnn (Growing Efficient, Accurate, and Robust neural networks) to grow and train robust networks in-situ, i.e., completely on the Edge device. Starting with a low-complexity initial backbone network, GEARnn employs One-Shot Growth (OSG) to grow a network satisfying the memory constraints of the Edge device using clean data, and robustifies the network using Efficient Robust Augmentation (ERA) to obtain the final network. We demonstrate results on a NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX, and analyze the trade-offs between accuracy, robustness, model size, energy consumption, and training time. Our results demonstrate the construction of efficient, accurate, and robust networks entirely on an Edge device.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong-Hyun Park, Chieh-Hsin Lai, Satoshi Hayakawa, Yuhta Takida, Yuki Mitsufuji</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have seen notable success in continuous domains, leading to the development of discrete diffusion models (DDMs) for discrete variables. Despite recent advances, DDMs face the challenge of slow sampling speeds. While parallel sampling methods like $\tau$-leaping accelerate this process, they introduce $\textit{Compounding Decoding Error}$ (CDE), where discrepancies arise between the true distribution and the approximation from parallel token generation, leading to degraded sample quality. In this work, we present $\textit{Jump Your Steps}$ (JYS), a novel approach that optimizes the allocation of discrete sampling timesteps by minimizing CDE without extra computational cost. More precisely, we derive a practical upper bound on CDE and propose an efficient algorithm for searching for the optimal sampling schedule. Extensive experiments across image, music, and text generation show that JYS significantly improves sampling quality, establishing it as a versatile framework for enhancing DDM performance for fast sampling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adriana Fernandez-Lopez, Shiwei Liu, Lu Yin, Stavros Petridis, Maja Pantic</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the under-explored area of low-rank weight training for large-scale Conformer-based speech recognition models from scratch. Our study demonstrates the viability of this training paradigm for such models, yielding several notable findings. Firstly, we discover that applying a low-rank structure exclusively to the attention modules can unexpectedly enhance performance, even with a significant rank reduction of 12%. In contrast, feed-forward layers present greater challenges, as they begin to exhibit performance degradation with a moderate 50% rank reduction. Furthermore, we find that both initialization and layer-wise rank assignment play critical roles in successful low-rank training. Specifically, employing SVD initialization and linear layer-wise rank mapping significantly boosts the efficacy of low-rank weight training. Building on these insights, we introduce the Low-Rank Speech Model from Scratch (LR-SMS), an approach that achieves performance parity with full-rank training while delivering substantial reductions in parameters count (by at least 2x), and training time speedups (by 1.3x for ASR and 1.15x for AVSR).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Markus Herb, Nassir Navab, Federico Tombari</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous vehicles demand detailed maps to maneuver reliably through traffic, which need to be kept up-to-date to ensure a safe operation. A promising way to adapt the maps to the ever-changing road-network is to use crowd-sourced data from a fleet of vehicles. In this work, we present a mapping system that fuses local submaps gathered from a fleet of vehicles at a central instance to produce a coherent map of the road environment including drivable area, lane markings, poles, obstacles and more as a 3D mesh. Each vehicle contributes locally reconstructed submaps as lightweight meshes, making our method applicable to a wide range of reconstruction methods and sensor modalities. Our method jointly aligns and merges the noisy and incomplete local submaps using a scene-specific Neural Signed Distance Field, which is supervised using the submap meshes to predict a fused environment representation. We leverage memory-efficient sparse feature-grids to scale to large areas and introduce a confidence score to model uncertainty in scene reconstruction. Our approach is evaluated on two datasets with different local mapping methods, showing improved pose alignment and reconstruction over existing methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the benefit of multi-session mapping and examine the required amount of data to enable high-fidelity map learning for autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria Makarova, Daria Trinitatova, Dzmitry Tsetserukou</p>
<p>Abstract: Many modern robotic systems operate autonomously, however they often lack the ability to accurately analyze the environment and adapt to changing external conditions, while teleoperation systems often require special operator skills. In the field of laboratory automation, the number of automated processes is growing, however such systems are usually developed to perform specific tasks. In addition, many of the objects used in this field are transparent, making it difficult to analyze them using visual channels. The contributions of this work include the development of a robotic framework with autonomous mode for manipulating liquid-filled objects with different degrees of transparency in complex pose combinations. The conducted experiments demonstrated the robustness of the designed visual perception system to accurately estimate object poses for autonomous manipulation, and confirmed the performance of the algorithms in dexterous operations such as liquid dispensing. The proposed robotic framework can be applied for laboratory automation, since it allows solving the problem of performing non-trivial manipulation tasks with the analysis of object poses of varying degrees of transparency and liquid levels, requiring high accuracy and repeatability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beomsu Kim, Yu-Guan Hsieh, Michal Klein, Marco Cuturi, Jong Chul Ye, Bahjat Kawar, James Thornton</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion and flow-matching models achieve remarkable generative performance but at the cost of many sampling steps, this slows inference and limits applicability to time-critical tasks. The ReFlow procedure can accelerate sampling by straightening generation trajectories. However, ReFlow is an iterative procedure, typically requiring training on simulated data, and results in reduced sample quality. To mitigate sample deterioration, we examine the design space of ReFlow and highlight potential pitfalls in prior heuristic practices. We then propose seven improvements for training dynamics, learning and inference, which are verified with thorough ablation studies on CIFAR10 $32 \times 32$, AFHQv2 $64 \times 64$, and FFHQ $64 \times 64$. Combining all our techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art FID scores (without / with guidance, resp.) for fast generation via neural ODEs: $2.23$ / $1.98$ on CIFAR10, $2.30$ / $1.91$ on AFHQv2, $2.84$ / $2.67$ on FFHQ, and $3.49$ / $1.74$ on ImageNet-64, all with merely $9$ neural function evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuele Palumbo, Moritz Vandenhirtz, Alain Ryser, Imant Daunhawer, Julia E. Vogt</p>
<p>Abstract: The structure of many real-world datasets is intrinsically hierarchical, making the modeling of such hierarchies a critical objective in both unsupervised and supervised machine learning. Recently, novel approaches for hierarchical clustering with deep architectures have been proposed. In this work, we take a critical perspective on this line of research and demonstrate that many approaches exhibit major limitations when applied to realistic datasets, partly due to their high computational complexity. In particular, we show that a lightweight procedure implemented on top of pre-trained non-hierarchical clustering models outperforms models designed specifically for hierarchical clustering. Our proposed approach is computationally efficient and applicable to any pre-trained clustering model that outputs logits, without requiring any fine-tuning. To highlight the generality of our findings, we illustrate how our method can also be applied in a supervised setup, recovering meaningful hierarchies from a pre-trained ImageNet classifier.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songming Liu, Lingxuan Wu, Bangguo Li, Hengkai Tan, Huayu Chen, Zhengyi Wang, Ke Xu, Hang Su, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Bimanual manipulation is essential in robotics, yet developing foundation models is extremely challenging due to the inherent complexity of coordinating two robot arms (leading to multi-modal action distributions) and the scarcity of training data. In this paper, we present the Robotics Diffusion Transformer (RDT), a pioneering diffusion foundation model for bimanual manipulation. RDT builds on diffusion models to effectively represent multi-modality, with innovative designs of a scalable Transformer to deal with the heterogeneity of multi-modal inputs and to capture the nonlinearity and high frequency of robotic data. To address data scarcity, we further introduce a Physically Interpretable Unified Action Space, which can unify the action representations of various robots while preserving the physical meanings of original actions, facilitating learning transferrable physical knowledge. With these designs, we managed to pre-train RDT on the largest collection of multi-robot datasets to date and scaled it up to 1.2B parameters, which is the largest diffusion-based foundation model for robotic manipulation. We finally fine-tuned RDT on a self-created multi-task bimanual dataset with over 6K+ episodes to refine its manipulation capabilities. Experiments on real robots demonstrate that RDT significantly outperforms existing methods. It exhibits zero-shot generalization to unseen objects and scenes, understands and follows language instructions, learns new skills with just 1~5 demonstrations, and effectively handles complex, dexterous tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Liao, Zhenghao Feng, Jianghong Xiao, Xingchen Peng, Yan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate dose distribution prediction is crucial in the radiotherapy planning. Although previous methods based on convolutional neural network have shown promising performance, they have the problem of over-smoothing, leading to prediction without important high-frequency details. Recently, diffusion model has achieved great success in computer vision, which excels in generating images with more high-frequency details, yet suffers from time-consuming and extensive computational resource consumption. To alleviate these problems, we propose Frequency-Decomposed Diffusion Model (FDDM) that refines the high-frequency subbands of the dose map. To be specific, we design a Coarse Dose Prediction Module (CDPM) to first predict a coarse dose map and then utilize discrete wavelet transform to decompose the coarse dose map into a low-frequency subband and three high?frequency subbands. There is a notable difference between the coarse predicted results and ground truth in high?frequency subbands. Therefore, we design a diffusion-based module called High-Frequency Refinement Module (HFRM) that performs diffusion operation in the high?frequency components of the dose map instead of the original dose map. Extensive experiments on an in-house dataset verify the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Carcinogenesis is a proteiform phenomenon, with tumors emerging in various locations and displaying complex, diverse shapes. At the crucial intersection of research and clinical practice, it demands precise and flexible assessment. However, current biomarkers, such as RECIST 1.1's long and short axis measurements, fall short of capturing this complexity, offering an approximate estimate of tumor burden and a simplistic representation of a more intricate process. Additionally, existing supervised AI models face challenges in addressing the variability in tumor presentations, limiting their clinical utility. These limitations arise from the scarcity of annotations and the models' focus on narrowly defined tasks.
  To address these challenges, we developed ONCOPILOT, an interactive radiological foundation model trained on approximately 7,500 CT scans covering the whole body, from both normal anatomy and a wide range of oncological cases. ONCOPILOT performs 3D tumor segmentation using visual prompts like point-click and bounding boxes, outperforming state-of-the-art models (e.g., nnUnet) and achieving radiologist-level accuracy in RECIST 1.1 measurements. The key advantage of this foundation model is its ability to surpass state-of-the-art performance while keeping the radiologist in the loop, a capability that previous models could not achieve. When radiologists interactively refine the segmentations, accuracy improves further. ONCOPILOT also accelerates measurement processes and reduces inter-reader variability, facilitating volumetric analysis and unlocking new biomarkers for deeper insights.
  This AI assistant is expected to enhance the precision of RECIST 1.1 measurements, unlock the potential of volumetric biomarkers, and improve patient stratification and clinical care, while seamlessly integrating into the radiological workflow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Xing, Darius Burschka</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding human activity is a crucial aspect of developing intelligent robots, particularly in the domain of human-robot collaboration. Nevertheless, existing systems encounter challenges such as over-segmentation, attributed to errors in the up-sampling process of the decoder. In response, we introduce a promising solution: the Temporal Fusion Graph Convolutional Network. This innovative approach aims to rectify the inadequate boundary estimation of individual actions within an activity stream and mitigate the issue of over-segmentation in the temporal dimension.
  Moreover, systems leveraging human activity recognition frameworks for decision-making necessitate more than just the identification of actions. They require a confidence value indicative of the certainty regarding the correspondence between observations and training examples. This is crucial to prevent overly confident responses to unforeseen scenarios that were not part of the training data and may have resulted in mismatches due to weak similarity measures within the system. To address this, we propose the incorporation of a Spectral Normalized Residual connection aimed at enhancing efficient estimation of novelty in observations. This innovative approach ensures the preservation of input distance within the feature space by imposing constraints on the maximum gradients of weight updates. By limiting these gradients, we promote a more robust handling of novel situations, thereby mitigating the risks associated with overconfidence. Our methodology involves the use of a Gaussian process to quantify the distance in feature space.</p>

We show that current baselines defined using static functions--constant mapping, averaging or blurring--inject harmful colour, texture or frequency assumptions that deviate from model behaviour. This leads to accumulation of irregular gradients, resulting in attribution maps that are biased, fragile and manipulable. Departing from the static approach, we propose UNI to compute an (un)learnable, debiased and adaptive baseline by perturbing the input towards an unlearning direction of steepest ascent. Our method discovers reliable baselines and succeeds in erasing salient features, which in turn locally smooths the high-curvature decision boundaries. Our analyses point to unlearning as a promising avenue for generating faithful, efficient and robust interpretations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vinith M. Suriyakumar, Rohan Alur, Ayush Sekhari, Manish Raghavan, Ashia C. Wilson</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models rely on massive, web-scale datasets. Training them from scratch is computationally expensive, and as a result, developers often prefer to make incremental updates to existing models. These updates often compose fine-tuning steps (to learn new concepts or improve model performance) with "unlearning" steps (to "forget" existing concepts, such as copyrighted works or explicit content). In this work, we demonstrate a critical and previously unknown vulnerability that arises in this paradigm: even under benign, non-adversarial conditions, fine-tuning a text-to-image diffusion model on seemingly unrelated images can cause it to "relearn" concepts that were previously "unlearned." We comprehensively investigate the causes and scope of this phenomenon, which we term concept resurgence, by performing a series of experiments which compose "mass concept erasure" (the current state of the art for unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models (Lu et al., 2024)) with subsequent fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion v1.4. Our findings underscore the fragility of composing incremental model updates, and raise serious new concerns about current approaches to ensuring the safety and alignment of text-to-image diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Hahlbohm, Fabian Friederichs, Tim Weyrich, Linus Franke, Moritz Kappel, Susana Castillo, Marc Stamminger, Martin Eisemann, Marcus Magnor</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGS) have proven a versatile rendering primitive, both for inverse rendering as well as real-time exploration of scenes. In these applications, coherence across camera frames and multiple views is crucial, be it for robust convergence of a scene reconstruction or for artifact-free fly-throughs. Recent work started mitigating artifacts that break multi-view coherence, including popping artifacts due to inconsistent transparency sorting and perspective-correct outlines of (2D) splats. At the same time, real-time requirements forced such implementations to accept compromises in how transparency of large assemblies of 3D Gaussians is resolved, in turn breaking coherence in other ways. In our work, we aim at achieving maximum coherence, by rendering fully perspective-correct 3D Gaussians while using a high-quality approximation of accurate blending, hybrid transparency, on a per-pixel level, in order to retain real-time frame rates. Our fast and perspectively accurate approach for evaluation of 3D Gaussians does not require matrix inversions, thereby ensuring numerical stability and eliminating the need for special handling of degenerate splats, and the hybrid transparency formulation for blending maintains similar quality as fully resolved per-pixel transparencies at a fraction of the rendering costs. We further show that each of these two components can be independently integrated into Gaussian splatting systems. In combination, they achieve up to 2$\times$ higher frame rates, 2$\times$ faster optimization, and equal or better image quality with fewer rendering artifacts compared to traditional 3DGS on common benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the problem of commonsense-level vision-knowledge conflict in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where visual information contradicts model's internal commonsense knowledge (see Figure 1). To study this issue, we introduce an automated pipeline, augmented with human-in-the-loop quality control, to establish a benchmark aimed at simulating and assessing the conflicts in MLLMs. Utilizing this pipeline, we have crafted a diagnostic benchmark comprising 374 original images and 1,122 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs. This benchmark covers two types of conflict target and three question difficulty levels, providing a thorough assessment tool. Through this benchmark, we evaluate the conflict-resolution capabilities of nine representative MLLMs across various model families and find a noticeable over-reliance on textual queries. Drawing on these findings, we propose a novel prompting strategy, "Focus-on-Vision" (FoV), which markedly enhances MLLMs' ability to favor visual data over conflicting textual knowledge. Our detailed analysis and the newly proposed strategy significantly advance the understanding and mitigating of vision-knowledge conflicts in MLLMs. The data and code are made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Agent S, an open agentic framework that enables autonomous interaction with computers through a Graphical User Interface (GUI), aimed at transforming human-computer interaction by automating complex, multi-step tasks. Agent S aims to address three key challenges in automating computer tasks: acquiring domain-specific knowledge, planning over long task horizons, and handling dynamic, non-uniform interfaces. To this end, Agent S introduces experience-augmented hierarchical planning, which learns from external knowledge search and internal experience retrieval at multiple levels, facilitating efficient task planning and subtask execution. In addition, it employs an Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) to better elicit the reasoning and control capabilities of GUI agents based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Evaluation on the OSWorld benchmark shows that Agent S outperforms the baseline by 9.37% on success rate (an 83.6% relative improvement) and achieves a new state-of-the-art. Comprehensive analysis highlights the effectiveness of individual components and provides insights for future improvements. Furthermore, Agent S demonstrates broad generalizability to different operating systems on a newly-released WindowsAgentArena benchmark. Code available at https://github.com/simular-ai/Agent-S.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryo Lotfi, Enrico Fini, Samy Bengio, Moin Nabi, Emmanuel Abbe</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern vision models have achieved remarkable success in benchmarks where local features provide critical information about the target. There is now a growing interest in solving tasks that require more global reasoning, where local features offer no significant information. These tasks are reminiscent of the connectivity tasks discussed by Minsky and Papert in 1969, which exposed the limitations of the perceptron model and contributed to the first AI winter. In this paper, we revisit such tasks by introducing four global visual benchmarks involving path findings and mazes. We show that: (1) although today's large vision models largely surpass the expressivity limitations of the early models, they still struggle with the learning efficiency; we put forward the "globality degree" notion to understand this limitation; (2) we then demonstrate that the picture changes and global reasoning becomes feasible with the introduction of "visual scratchpads"; similarly to the text scratchpads and chain-of-thoughts used in language models, visual scratchpads help break down global tasks into simpler ones; (3) we finally show that some scratchpads are better than others, in particular, "inductive scratchpads" that take steps relying on less information afford better out-of-distribution generalization and succeed for smaller model sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Chen, Botian Xu, Pu Hua, Peiqi Duan, Yanchao Yang, Yi Ma, Huazhe Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the difficulty of acquiring extensive real-world data, robot simulation has become crucial for parallel training and sim-to-real transfer, highlighting the importance of scalable simulated robotic tasks. Foundation models have demonstrated impressive capacities in autonomously generating feasible robotic tasks. However, this new paradigm underscores the challenge of adequately evaluating these autonomously generated tasks. To address this, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework tailored to generative simulations. Our framework segments evaluation into three core aspects: quality, diversity, and generalization. For single-task quality, we evaluate the realism of the generated task and the completeness of the generated trajectories using large language models and vision-language models. In terms of diversity, we measure both task and data diversity through text similarity of task descriptions and world model loss trained on collected task trajectories. For task-level generalization, we assess the zero-shot generalization ability on unseen tasks of a policy trained with multiple generated tasks. Experiments conducted on three representative task generation pipelines demonstrate that the results from our framework are highly consistent with human evaluations, confirming the feasibility and validity of our approach. The findings reveal that while metrics of quality and diversity can be achieved through certain methods, no single approach excels across all metrics, suggesting a need for greater focus on balancing these different metrics. Additionally, our analysis further highlights the common challenge of low generalization capability faced by current works. Our anonymous website: https://sites.google.com/view/evaltasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zimu Lu, Aojun Zhou, Ke Wang, Houxing Ren, Weikang Shi, Junting Pan, Mingjie Zhan, Hongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Code has been shown to be effective in enhancing the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models due to its precision and accuracy. Previous works involving continued mathematical pretraining often include code that utilizes math-related packages, which are primarily designed for fields such as engineering, machine learning, signal processing, or module testing, rather than being directly focused on mathematical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for generating mathematical code accompanied with corresponding reasoning steps for continued pretraining. Our approach begins with the construction of a high-quality mathematical continued pretraining dataset by incorporating math-related web data, code using mathematical packages, math textbooks, and synthetic data. Next, we construct reasoning steps by extracting LaTeX expressions, the conditions needed for the expressions, and the results of the expressions from the previously collected dataset. Based on this extracted information, we generate corresponding code to accurately capture the mathematical reasoning process. Appending the generated code to each reasoning step results in data consisting of paired natural language reasoning steps and their corresponding code. Combining this data with the original dataset results in a 19.2B-token high-performing mathematical pretraining corpus, which we name MathCode-Pile. Training several popular base models with this corpus significantly improves their mathematical abilities, leading to the creation of the MathCoder2 family of models. All of our data processing and training code is open-sourced, ensuring full transparency and easy reproducibility of the entire data collection and training pipeline.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Li, Jiantao Nie, Dan Guo, Richang Hong, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation learning and feature disentanglement have garnered significant research interest in the field of facial expression recognition (FER). The inherent ambiguity of emotion labels poses challenges for conventional supervised representation learning methods. Moreover, directly learning the mapping from a facial expression image to an emotion label lacks explicit supervision signals for capturing fine-grained facial features. In this paper, we propose a novel FER model, named Poker Face Vision Transformer or PF-ViT, to address these challenges. PF-ViT aims to separate and recognize the disturbance-agnostic emotion from a static facial image via generating its corresponding poker face, without the need for paired images. Inspired by the Facial Action Coding System, we regard an expressive face as the combined result of a set of facial muscle movements on one's poker face (i.e., an emotionless face). PF-ViT utilizes vanilla Vision Transformers, and its components are firstly pre-trained as Masked Autoencoders on a large facial expression dataset without emotion labels, yielding excellent representations. Subsequently, we train PF-ViT using a GAN framework. During training, the auxiliary task of poke face generation promotes the disentanglement between emotional and emotion-irrelevant components, guiding the FER model to holistically capture discriminative facial details. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods on four popular FER datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sifan Song, Jinfeng Wang, Zilong Wang, Hongxing Wang, Jionglong Su, Xiaowei Ding, Kang Dang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate fovea localization is essential for analyzing retinal diseases to prevent irreversible vision loss. While current deep learning-based methods outperform traditional ones, they still face challenges such as the lack of local anatomical landmarks around the fovea, the inability to robustly handle diseased retinal images, and the variations in image conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture called DualStreamFoveaNet (DSFN) for multi-cue fusion. This architecture explicitly incorporates long-range connections and global features using retina and vessel distributions for robust fovea localization. We introduce a spatial attention mechanism in the dual-stream encoder to extract and fuse self-learned anatomical information, focusing more on features distributed along blood vessels and significantly reducing computational costs by decreasing token numbers. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets and one large-scale private dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the DSFN is more robust on both normal and diseased retina images and has better generalization capacity in cross-dataset experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olga Fourkioti, Matt De Vries, Chen Jin, Daniel C. Alexander, Chris Bakal</p>
<p>Abstract: The visual examination of tissue biopsy sections is fundamental for cancer diagnosis, with pathologists analyzing sections at multiple magnifications to discern tumor cells and their subtypes. However, existing attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) models used for analyzing Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in cancer diagnostics often overlook the contextual information of tumor and neighboring tiles, leading to misclassifications. To address this, we propose the Context-Aware Multiple Instance Learning (CAMIL) architecture. CAMIL incorporates neighbor-constrained attention to consider dependencies among tiles within a WSI and integrates contextual constraints as prior knowledge into the MIL model. We evaluated CAMIL on subtyping non-small cell lung cancer (TCGA-NSCLC) and detecting lymph node (CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17) metastasis, achieving test AUCs of 97.5\%, 95.9\%, and 88.1\%, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, CAMIL enhances model interpretability by identifying regions of high diagnostic value.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Chen, Yutong Xie, Biao Wu, Xiaomin Chen, James Ang, Minh-Son To, Xiaojun Chang, Qi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Automating radiology report generation can ease the reporting workload for radiologists. However, existing works focus mainly on the chest area due to the limited availability of public datasets for other regions. Besides, they often rely on naive data-driven approaches, e.g., a basic encoder-decoder framework with captioning loss, which limits their ability to recognise complex patterns across diverse anatomical regions. To address these issues, we propose X-RGen, a radiologist-minded report generation framework across six anatomical regions. In X-RGen, we seek to mimic the behaviour of human radiologists, breaking them down into four principal phases: 1) initial observation, 2) cross-region analysis, 3) medical interpretation, and 4) report formation. Firstly, we adopt an image encoder for feature extraction, akin to a radiologist's preliminary review. Secondly, we enhance the recognition capacity of the image encoder by analysing images and reports across various regions, mimicking how radiologists gain their experience and improve their professional ability from past cases. Thirdly, just as radiologists apply their expertise to interpret radiology images, we introduce radiological knowledge of multiple anatomical regions to further analyse the features from a clinical perspective. Lastly, we generate reports based on the medical-aware features using a typical auto-regressive text decoder. Both natural language generation (NLG) and clinical efficacy metrics show the effectiveness of X-RGen on six X-ray datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jordan A. James, Heather K. Manching, Matthew R. Mattia, Kim D. Bowman, Amanda M. Hulse-Kemp, William J. Beksi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this letter, we present a new dataset to advance the state of the art in detecting citrus fruit and accurately estimate yield on trees affected by the Huanglongbing (HLB) disease in orchard environments via imaging. Despite the fact that significant progress has been made in solving the fruit detection problem, the lack of publicly available datasets has complicated direct comparison of results. For instance, citrus detection has long been of interest to the agricultural research community, yet there is an absence of work, particularly involving public datasets of citrus affected by HLB. To address this issue, we enhance state-of-the-art object detection methods for use in typical orchard settings. Concretely, we provide high-resolution images of citrus trees located in an area known to be highly affected by HLB, along with high-quality bounding box annotations of citrus fruit. Fruit on both the trees and the ground are labeled to allow for identification of fruit location, which contributes to advancements in yield estimation and potential measure of HLB impact via fruit drop. The dataset consists of over 32,000 bounding box annotations for fruit instances contained in 579 high-resolution images. In summary, our contributions are the following: (i) we introduce a novel dataset along with baseline performance benchmarks on multiple contemporary object detection algorithms, (ii) we show the ability to accurately capture fruit location on tree or on ground, and finally (ii) we present a correlation of our results with yield estimations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Chen, Yulun Zhang, Jinjin Gu, Xin Yuan, Linghe Kong, Guihai Chen, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image super-resolution (SR) methods typically model degradation to improve reconstruction accuracy in complex and unknown degradation scenarios. However, extracting degradation information from low-resolution images is challenging, which limits the model performance. To boost image SR performance, one feasible approach is to introduce additional priors. Inspired by advancements in multi-modal methods and text prompt image processing, we introduce text prompts to image SR to provide degradation priors. Specifically, we first design a text-image generation pipeline to integrate text into the SR dataset through the text degradation representation and degradation model. The text representation applies a discretization manner based on the binning method to describe the degradation abstractly. This method maintains the flexibility of the text and is user-friendly. Meanwhile, we propose the PromptSR to realize the text prompt SR. The PromptSR utilizes the pre-trained language model (e.g., T5 or CLIP) to enhance restoration. We train the PromptSR on the generated text-image dataset. Extensive experiments indicate that introducing text prompts into SR, yields excellent results on both synthetic and real-world images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Wei Zhan, Fan Liu, Xin Luo, Xin-Shun Xu, Liqiang Nie, Mohan Kankanhalli</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims at detecting human-object pairs and predicting their interactions. However, conventional HOI detection methods often struggle to fully capture the contextual information needed to accurately identify these interactions. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in tasks involving human interactions, they are not tailored for HOI detection. The complexity of human behavior and the diverse contexts in which these interactions occur make it further challenging. Contextual cues, such as the participants involved, body language, and the surrounding environment, play crucial roles in predicting these interactions, especially those that are unseen or ambiguous. Moreover, large VLMs are trained on vast image and text data, enabling them to generate contextual cues that help in understanding real-world contexts, object relationships, and typical interactions. Building on this, in this paper we introduce ConCue, a novel approach for improving visual feature extraction in HOI detection. Specifically, we first design specialized prompts to utilize large VLMs to generate contextual cues within an image. To fully leverage these cues, we develop a transformer-based feature extraction module with a multi-tower architecture that integrates contextual cues into both instance and interaction detectors. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of using these contextual cues for HOI detection. The experimental results show that integrating ConCue with existing state-of-the-art methods significantly enhances their performance on two widely used datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ce Zhang, Taixi Lu, Md Mohaiminul Islam, Ziyang Wang, Shoubin Yu, Mohit Bansal, Gedas Bertasius</p>
<p>Abstract: We present LLoVi, a language-based framework for long-range video question-answering (LVQA). Unlike prior long-range video understanding methods, which are often costly and require specialized long-range video modeling design (e.g., memory queues, state-space layers, etc.), our approach uses a frame/clip-level visual captioner (e.g., BLIP2, LaViLa, LLaVA) coupled with a Large Language Model (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) leading to a simple yet surprisingly effective LVQA framework. Specifically, we decompose short and long-range modeling aspects of LVQA into two stages. First, we use a short-term visual captioner to generate textual descriptions of short video clips (0.5-8s in length) densely sampled from a long input video. Afterward, an LLM aggregates the densely extracted short-term captions to perform long-range temporal reasoning needed to understand the whole video and answer a question. To analyze what makes our simple framework so effective, we thoroughly evaluate various components of our system. Our empirical analysis reveals that the choice of the visual captioner and LLM is critical for good LVQA performance. Furthermore, we show that a specialized prompt that asks the LLM first to summarize the noisy short-term visual captions and then answer a given input question leads to a significant LVQA performance boost. On EgoSchema, which is best known as a very long-form video question-answering benchmark, our method achieves 50.3% accuracy, outperforming the previous best-performing approach by 18.1% (absolute gain). In addition, our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 4.1% and 3.1% on NeXT-QA and IntentQA. We also extend LLoVi to grounded LVQA and show that it outperforms all prior methods on the NeXT-GQA dataset. We will release our code at https://github.com/CeeZh/LLoVi.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taekyung Kim, Byeongho Heo, Dongyoon Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked image modeling (MIM) has emerged as a promising approach for training Vision Transformers (ViTs). The essence of MIM lies in the token-wise prediction of masked tokens, which aims to predict targets tokenized from images or generated by pre-trained models like vision-language models. While using tokenizers or pre-trained models are plausible MIM targets, they often offer spatially inconsistent targets even for neighboring tokens, complicating models to learn unified and discriminative representations. Our pilot study identifies spatial inconsistencies and suggests that resolving them can accelerate representation learning. Building upon this insight, we introduce a novel self-supervision signal called Dynamic Token Morphing (DTM), which dynamically aggregates contextually related tokens to yield contextualized targets, thereby mitigating spatial inconsistency. DTM is compatible with various SSL frameworks; we showcase improved MIM results by employing DTM, barely introducing extra training costs. Our method facilitates training by using consistent targets, resulting in 1) faster training and 2) reduced losses. Experiments on ImageNet-1K and ADE20K demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art, complex MIM methods. Furthermore, the comparative evaluation of the iNaturalists and fine-grained visual classification datasets further validates the transferability of our method on various downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geonung Kim, Beomsu Kim, Eunhyeok Park, Sunghyun Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: As recent advances in large-scale Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have yielded remarkable high-quality image generation, diverse downstream Image-to-Image (I2I) applications have emerged. Despite the impressive results achieved by these I2I models, their practical utility is hampered by their large model size and the computational burden of the iterative denoising process. In this paper, we propose a novel compression method tailored for diffusion-based I2I models. Based on the observations that the image conditions of I2I models already provide rich information on image structures, and that the time steps with a larger impact tend to be biased, we develop surprisingly simple yet effective approaches for reducing the model size and latency. We validate the effectiveness of our method on three representative I2I tasks: InstructPix2Pix for image editing, StableSR for image restoration, and ControlNet for image-conditional image generation. Our approach achieves satisfactory output quality with 39.2%, 56.4% and 39.2% reduction in model footprint, as well as 81.4%, 68.7% and 31.1% decrease in latency to InstructPix2Pix, StableSR and ControlNet, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zidong Wang, Zeyu Lu, Di Huang, Cai Zhou, Wanli Ouyang, Lei Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Nature is infinitely resolution-free. In the context of this reality, existing diffusion models, such as Diffusion Transformers, often face challenges when processing image resolutions outside of their trained domain. To address this limitation, we conceptualize images as sequences of tokens with dynamic sizes, rather than traditional methods that perceive images as fixed-resolution grids. This perspective enables a flexible training strategy that seamlessly accommodates various aspect ratios during both training and inference, thus promoting resolution generalization and eliminating biases introduced by image cropping. On this basis, we present the Flexible Vision Transformer (FiT), a transformer architecture specifically designed for generating images with unrestricted resolutions and aspect ratios. We further upgrade the FiT to FiTv2 with several innovative designs, includingthe Query-Key vector normalization, the AdaLN-LoRA module, a rectified flow scheduler, and a Logit-Normal sampler. Enhanced by a meticulously adjusted network structure, FiTv2 exhibits 2x convergence speed of FiT. When incorporating advanced training-free extrapolation techniques, FiTv2 demonstrates remarkable adaptability in both resolution extrapolation and diverse resolution generation. Additionally, our exploration of the scalability of the FiTv2 model reveals that larger models exhibit better computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient post-training strategy to adapt a pre-trained model for the high-resolution generation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the exceptional performance of FiTv2 across a broad range of resolutions. We have released all the codes and models at https://github.com/whlzy/FiT to promote the exploration of diffusion transformer models for arbitrary-resolution image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aosong Feng, Weikang Qiu, Jinbin Bai, Xiao Zhang, Zhen Dong, Kaicheng Zhou, Rex Ying, Leandros Tassiulas</p>
<p>Abstract: Building on the success of text-to-image diffusion models (DPMs), image editing is an important application to enable human interaction with AI-generated content. Among various editing methods, editing within the prompt space gains more attention due to its capacity and simplicity of controlling semantics. However, since diffusion models are commonly pretrained on descriptive text captions, direct editing of words in text prompts usually leads to completely different generated images, violating the requirements for image editing. On the other hand, existing editing methods usually consider introducing spatial masks to preserve the identity of unedited regions, which are usually ignored by DPMs and therefore lead to inharmonic editing results. Targeting these two challenges, in this work, we propose to disentangle the comprehensive image-prompt interaction into several item-prompt interactions, with each item linked to a special learned prompt. The resulting framework, named D-Edit, is based on pretrained diffusion models with cross-attention layers disentangled and adopts a two-step optimization to build item-prompt associations. Versatile image editing can then be applied to specific items by manipulating the corresponding prompts. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results in four types of editing operations including image-based, text-based, mask-based editing, and item removal, covering most types of editing applications, all within a single unified framework. Notably, D-Edit is the first framework that can (1) achieve item editing through mask editing and (2) combine image and text-based editing. We demonstrate the quality and versatility of the editing results for a diverse collection of images through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beomsu Kim, Jaemin Kim, Jeongsol Kim, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the realm of digital pathology, multi-magnification Multiple Instance Learning (multi-mag MIL) has proven effective in leveraging the hierarchical structure of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to reduce information loss and redundant data. However, current methods fall short in bridging the domain gap between pretrained models and medical imaging, and often fail to account for spatial relationships across different magnifications. Addressing these challenges, we introduce the Concentric Dual Fusion Attention-MIL (CDFA-MIL) framework,which innovatively combines point-to-area feature-colum attention and point-to-point concentric-row attention using concentric patch. This approach is designed to effectively fuse correlated information, enhancing feature representation and providing stronger correlation guidance for WSI analysis. CDFA-MIL distinguishes itself by offering a robust fusion strategy that leads to superior WSI recognition. Its application has demonstrated exceptional performance, significantly surpassing existing MIL methods in accuracy and F1 scores on prominent datasets like Camelyon16 and TCGA-NSCLC. Specifically, CDFA-MIL achieved an average accuracy and F1-score of 93.7\% and 94.1\% respectively on these datasets, marking a notable advancement over traditional MIL approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Schrodi, David T. Hoffmann, Max Argus, Volker Fischer, Thomas Brox</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models (VLMs), like CLIP, have gained popularity for their versatile applicability to various downstream tasks. Despite their successes in some tasks, like zero-shot object recognition, they perform surprisingly poor on other tasks, like attribute recognition. Previous work has attributed these challenges to the modality gap, a separation of image and text in the shared representation space, and to a bias towards objects over other factors, such as attributes. In this analysis paper, we investigate both phenomena thoroughly. We evaluated off-the-shelf VLMs and find that while the gap's influence on performance is typically overshadowed by other factors, we find indications that closing the gap indeed leads to improvements. Moreover, we find that, contrary to intuition, only few embedding dimensions drive the gap and that the embedding spaces are differently organized. To allow for a clean study of object bias, we introduce a definition and a corresponding measure of it. Equipped with this tool, we find that object bias does not lead to worse performance on other concepts, such as attributes per se. However, why do both phenomena, modality gap and object bias, emerge in the first place? To answer this fundamental question and uncover some of the inner workings of contrastive VLMs, we conducted experiments that allowed us to control the amount of shared information between the modalities. These experiments revealed that the driving factor behind both the modality gap and the object bias, is an information imbalance between images and captions, and unveiled an intriguing connection between the modality gap and entropy of the logits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Somesh Singh, Harini S I, Yaman K Singla, Veeky Baths, Rajiv Ratn Shah, Changyou Chen, Balaji Krishnamurthy</p>
<p>Abstract: Communication is defined as "Who says what to whom with what effect". A message from a communicator generates downstream receiver effects, also known as behavior. Receiver behavior, being a downstream effect of the message, carries rich signals about it. Even after carrying signals about the message, the behavior data is often ignored while training large language models. We show that training LLMs on receiver behavior can actually help improve their content-understanding abilities. Specifically, we show that training LLMs to predict the receiver behavior of likes and comments improves the LLM's performance on a wide variety of downstream content understanding tasks. We show this performance increase over 46 video and image understanding tasks over 26 benchmark datasets across both 0-shot and fine-tuning settings, outperforming many supervised baselines. Moreover, since receiver behavior, such as likes and comments, is collected by default on the internet and does not need any human annotations to be useful, the performance improvement we get after training on this data is essentially free-lunch. We release the receiver behavior cleaned comments and likes of 750k images and videos collected from multiple platforms along with our instruction-tuning data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamad Al Mdfaa, Raghad Salameh, Sergey Zagoruyko, Gonzalo Ferrer</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of robotics and computer vision, efficient and accurate semantic mapping remains a significant challenge due to the growing demand for intelligent machines that can comprehend and interact with complex environments. Conventional panoptic mapping methods, however, are limited by predefined semantic classes, thus making them ineffective for handling novel or unforeseen objects. In response to this limitation, we introduce the Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping (UPPM) method. UPPM utilizes recent advances in foundation models to enable real-time, on-demand label generation using natural language prompts. By incorporating a dynamic labeling strategy into traditional panoptic mapping techniques, UPPM provides significant improvements in adaptability and versatility while maintaining high performance levels in map reconstruction. We demonstrate our approach on real-world and simulated datasets. Results show that UPPM can accurately reconstruct scenes and segment objects while generating rich semantic labels through natural language interactions. A series of ablation experiments validated the advantages of foundation model-based labeling over fixed label sets.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13459">Adapting Multi-modal Large Language Model to Concept Drift From Pre-training Onwards</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Yang, Jie Lu, En Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently face challenges from concept drift when dealing with real-world streaming data, wherein distributions change unpredictably. This mainly includes gradual drift due to long-tailed data and sudden drift from Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, both of which have increasingly drawn the attention of the research community. While these issues have been extensively studied in the individual domain of vision or language, their impacts on MLLMs in concept drift settings remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we reveal the susceptibility and vulnerability of Vision-Language (VL) models to significant biases arising from gradual drift and sudden drift, particularly in the pre-training. To effectively address these challenges, we propose a unified framework that extends concept drift theory to the multi-modal domain, enhancing the adaptability of the VL model to the distribution unpredictable changes. Additionally, a T-distribution based drift adapter is proposed to effectively mitigate the bias induced by the gradual drift, which also facilitates the model in distinguishing sudden distribution changes through explicit distribution modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method enhances the efficiency and accuracy of image-text alignment in the pre-training of VL models, particularly in the concept drift scenario. Moreover, various downstream tasks exhibit significant improvements in our model's ability to adapt to long-tailed open world. Furthermore, we create a set of multi-modal datasets called OpenMMlo, specifically tailored for the long-tailed open world settings, to validate our findings. To foster the development of the multi-modal community, we have made both OpenMMlo datasets and our code publicly available at: https://github.com/Anonymous0Knight/ConceptDriftMLLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Event cameras offer promising advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, making them well-suited for challenging lighting conditions and fast-moving scenarios. However, reconstructing 3D scenes from raw event streams is difficult because event data is sparse and does not carry absolute color information. To release its potential in 3D reconstruction, we propose the first event-based generalizable 3D reconstruction framework, called EvGGS, which reconstructs scenes as 3D Gaussians from only event input in a feedforward manner and can generalize to unseen cases without any retraining. This framework includes a depth estimation module, an intensity reconstruction module, and a Gaussian regression module. These submodules connect in a cascading manner, and we collaboratively train them with a designed joint loss to make them mutually promote. To facilitate related studies, we build a novel event-based 3D dataset with various material objects and calibrated labels of grayscale images, depth maps, camera poses, and silhouettes. Experiments show models that have jointly trained significantly outperform those trained individually. Our approach performs better than all baselines in reconstruction quality, and depth/intensity predictions with satisfactory rendering speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengming Xu, Chen Liu, Yikai Wang, Yuan Yao, Yanwei Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) is a prevailing way to transfer visual foundation models to new tasks by leveraging contextual information contained in in-context examples to enhance learning and prediction of query sample. The fundamental problem in VICL is how to select the best prompt to activate its power as much as possible, which is equivalent to the ranking problem to test the in-context behavior of each candidate in the alternative set and select the best one. To utilize more appropriate ranking metric and leverage more comprehensive information among the alternative set, we propose a novel in-context example selection framework to approximately identify the global optimal prompt, i.e. choosing the best performing in-context examples from all alternatives for each query sample. Our method, dubbed Partial2Global, adopts a transformer-based list-wise ranker to provide a more comprehensive comparison within several alternatives, and a consistency-aware ranking aggregator to generate globally consistent ranking. The effectiveness of Partial2Global is validated through experiments on foreground segmentation, single object detection and image colorization, demonstrating that Partial2Global selects consistently better in-context examples compared with other methods, and thus establish the new state-of-the-arts.</p>

<p>Abstract: While 2D diffusion models generate realistic, high-detail images, 3D shape generation methods like Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) built on these 2D diffusion models produce cartoon-like, over-smoothed shapes. To help explain this discrepancy, we show that the image guidance used in Score Distillation can be understood as the velocity field of a 2D denoising generative process, up to the choice of a noise term. In particular, after a change of variables, SDS resembles a high-variance version of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) with a differently-sampled noise term: SDS introduces noise i.i.d. randomly at each step, while DDIM infers it from the previous noise predictions. This excessive variance can lead to over-smoothing and unrealistic outputs. We show that a better noise approximation can be recovered by inverting DDIM in each SDS update step. This modification makes SDS's generative process for 2D images almost identical to DDIM. In 3D, it removes over-smoothing, preserves higher-frequency detail, and brings the generation quality closer to that of 2D samplers. Experimentally, our method achieves better or similar 3D generation quality compared to other state-of-the-art Score Distillation methods, all without training additional neural networks or multi-view supervision, and providing useful insights into relationship between 2D and 3D asset generation with diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongsheng Yu, Ziyun Zeng, Hang Hua, Jianlong Fu, Jiebo Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models equipped with language models demonstrate excellent controllability in image generation tasks, allowing image processing to adhere to human instructions. However, the lack of diverse instruction-following data hampers the development of models that effectively recognize and execute user-customized instructions, particularly in low-level tasks. Moreover, the stochastic nature of the diffusion process leads to deficiencies in image generation or editing tasks that require the detailed preservation of the generated images. To address these limitations, we propose PromptFix, a comprehensive framework that enables diffusion models to follow human instructions to perform a wide variety of image-processing tasks. First, we construct a large-scale instruction-following dataset that covers comprehensive image-processing tasks, including low-level tasks, image editing, and object creation. Next, we propose a high-frequency guidance sampling method to explicitly control the denoising process and preserve high-frequency details in unprocessed areas. Finally, we design an auxiliary prompting adapter, utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance text prompts and improve the model's task generalization. Experimental results show that PromptFix outperforms previous methods in various image-processing tasks. Our proposed model also achieves comparable inference efficiency with these baseline models and exhibits superior zero-shot capabilities in blind restoration and combination tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zebin You, Xinyu Zhang, Hanzhong Guo, Jingdong Wang, Chongxuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The ultimate goal of generative models is to perfectly capture the data distribution. For image generation, common metrics of visual quality (e.g., FID) and the perceived truthfulness of generated images seem to suggest that we are nearing this goal. However, through distribution classification tasks, we reveal that, from the perspective of neural network-based classifiers, even advanced diffusion models are still far from this goal. Specifically, classifiers are able to consistently and effortlessly distinguish real images from generated ones across various settings. Moreover, we uncover an intriguing discrepancy: classifiers can easily differentiate between diffusion models with comparable performance (e.g., U-ViT-H vs. DiT-XL), but struggle to distinguish between models within the same family but of different scales (e.g., EDM2-XS vs. EDM2-XXL). Our methodology carries several important implications. First, it naturally serves as a diagnostic tool for diffusion models by analyzing specific features of generated data. Second, it sheds light on the model autophagy disorder and offers insights into the use of generated data: augmenting real data with generated data is more effective than replacing it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Wang, Guangjing Yang, Wentao Chen, Huahui Yi, Xiaohu Wu, Zhouchen Lin, Qicheng Lao</p>
<p>Abstract: In response to the challenges posed by the extensive parameter updates required for full fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained models, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, exemplified by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), have emerged. LoRA simplifies the fine-tuning process but may still struggle with a certain level of redundancy in low-rank matrices and limited effectiveness from merely increasing their rank. To address these issues, a natural idea is to enhance the independence and diversity of the learning process for the low-rank matrices. Therefore, we propose Masked LoRA Experts (MLAE), an innovative approach that applies the concept of masking to visual PEFT. Our method incorporates a cellular decomposition strategy that transforms a low-rank matrix into independent rank-1 submatrices, or "experts", thus enhancing independence. Additionally, we introduce a binary mask matrix that selectively activates these experts during training to promote more diverse and anisotropic learning, based on expert-level dropout strategies. Our investigations reveal that this selective activation not only enhances performance but also fosters a more diverse acquisition of knowledge with a marked decrease in parameter similarity among MLAE, significantly boosting the quality of the model. Remarkably, MLAE achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an average accuracy score of 78.8% on the VTAB-1k benchmark and 90.9% on the FGVC benchmark, surpassing the previous SOTA result by an average of 0.8% on both benchmarks with approximately half parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gonca Yilmaz, Songyou Peng, Marc Pollefeys, Francis Engelmann, Hermann Blum</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced segmentation techniques by shifting from the traditional segmentation of a closed-set of predefined object classes to open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS), allowing users to segment novel classes and concepts unseen during training of the segmentation model. However, this flexibility comes with a trade-off: fully-supervised closed-set methods still outperform OVS methods on base classes, that is on classes on which they have been explicitly trained. This is due to the lack of pixel-aligned training masks for VLMs (which are trained on image-caption pairs), and the absence of domain-specific knowledge, such as autonomous driving. Therefore, we propose the task of open-vocabulary domain adaptation to infuse domain-specific knowledge into VLMs while preserving their open-vocabulary nature. By doing so, we achieve improved performance in base and novel classes. Existing VLM adaptation methods improve performance on base (training) queries, but fail to fully preserve the open-set capabilities of VLMs on novel queries. To address this shortcoming, we combine parameter-efficient prompt tuning with a triplet-loss-based training strategy that uses auxiliary negative queries. Notably, our approach is the only parameter-efficient method that consistently surpasses the original VLM on novel classes. Our adapted VLMs can seamlessly be integrated into existing OVS pipelines, e.g., improving OVSeg by +6.0% mIoU on ADE20K for open-vocabulary 2D segmentation, and OpenMask3D by +4.1% AP on ScanNet++ Offices for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without other changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Xu, Anqi Zhu, Jingyu Lin, Qiuhong Ke, Cunjian Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Human action recognition is crucial in computer vision systems. However, in real-world scenarios, human actions often fall outside the distribution of training data, requiring a model to both recognize in-distribution (ID) actions and reject out-of-distribution (OOD) ones. Despite its importance, there has been limited research on OOD detection in human actions. Existing works on OOD detection mainly focus on image data with RGB structure, and many methods are post-hoc in nature. While these methods are convenient and computationally efficient, they often lack sufficient accuracy, fail to consider the exposure of OOD samples, and ignore the application in skeleton structure data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end skeleton-based model called Skeleton-OOD, which is committed to improving the effectiveness of OOD tasks while ensuring the accuracy of ID recognition. Through extensive experiments conducted on NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120, and Kinetics-400 datasets, Skeleton-OOD demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of classic OOD detection techniques in the context of skeleton-based action recognition tasks, offering promising avenues for future research in this field.

In this work, we present Needle In A Multimodal Haystack (MM-NIAH), the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate the capability of existing MLLMs to comprehend long multimodal documents. Our benchmark includes three types of evaluation tasks: multimodal retrieval, counting, and reasoning. In each task, the model is required to answer the questions according to different key information scattered throughout the given multimodal document. Evaluating the leading MLLMs on MM-NIAH, we observe that existing models still have significant room for improvement on these tasks, especially on vision-centric evaluation.

<p>Abstract: The recent advancements in text-to-image generative models have been remarkable. Yet, the field suffers from a lack of evaluation metrics that accurately reflect the performance of these models, particularly lacking fine-grained metrics that can guide the optimization of the models. In this paper, we propose EvalAlign, a metric characterized by its accuracy, stability, and fine granularity. Our approach leverages the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) pre-trained on extensive data. We develop evaluation protocols that focus on two key dimensions: image faithfulness and text-image alignment. Each protocol comprises a set of detailed, fine-grained instructions linked to specific scoring options, enabling precise manual scoring of the generated images. We supervised fine-tune (SFT) the MLLM to align with human evaluative judgments, resulting in a robust evaluation model. Our evaluation across 24 text-to-image generation models demonstrate that EvalAlign not only provides superior metric stability but also aligns more closely with human preferences than existing metrics, confirming its effectiveness and utility in model assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guozhen Zhang, Chunxu Liu, Yutao Cui, Xiaotong Zhao, Kai Ma, Limin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Inter-frame modeling is pivotal in generating intermediate frames for video frame interpolation (VFI). Current approaches predominantly rely on convolution or attention-based models, which often either lack sufficient receptive fields or entail significant computational overheads. Recently, Selective State Space Models (S6) have emerged, tailored specifically for long sequence modeling, offering both linear complexity and data-dependent modeling capabilities. In this paper, we propose VFIMamba, a novel frame interpolation method for efficient and dynamic inter-frame modeling by harnessing the S6 model. Our approach introduces the Mixed-SSM Block (MSB), which initially rearranges tokens from adjacent frames in an interleaved fashion and subsequently applies multi-directional S6 modeling. This design facilitates the efficient transmission of information across frames while upholding linear complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel curriculum learning strategy that progressively cultivates proficiency in modeling inter-frame dynamics across varying motion magnitudes, fully unleashing the potential of the S6 model. Experimental findings showcase that our method attains state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, particularly excelling in high-resolution scenarios. In particular, on the X-TEST dataset, VFIMamba demonstrates a noteworthy improvement of 0.80 dB for 4K frames and 0.96 dB for 2K frames.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data quality stands at the forefront of deciding the effectiveness of video-language representation learning. However, video-text pairs in previous data typically do not align perfectly with each other, which might lead to video-language representations that do not accurately reflect cross-modal semantics. Moreover, previous data also possess an uneven distribution of concepts, thereby hampering the downstream performance across unpopular subjects. To address these problems, we propose MAMA, a new approach to learning video-language representations by utilizing a contrastive objective with a subtractive angular margin to regularize cross-modal representations in their effort to reach perfect similarity. Furthermore, to adapt to the non-uniform concept distribution, MAMA utilizes a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-parameterized weighting function that maps loss values to sample weights which enable dynamic adjustment of the model's focus throughout the training. With the training guided by a small amount of unbiased meta-data and augmented by video-text data generated by large vision-language model, MAMA improves video-language representations and achieve superior performances on commonly used video question answering and text-video retrieval datasets.

<p>Abstract: In an effort to improve the efficiency and scalability of single-image super-resolution (SISR) applications, we introduce AnySR, to rebuild existing arbitrary-scale SR methods into any-scale, any-resource implementation. As a contrast to off-the-shelf methods that solve SR tasks across various scales with the same computing costs, our AnySR innovates in: 1) building arbitrary-scale tasks as any-resource implementation, reducing resource requirements for smaller scales without additional parameters; 2) enhancing any-scale performance in a feature-interweaving fashion, inserting scale pairs into features at regular intervals and ensuring correct feature/scale processing. The efficacy of our AnySR is fully demonstrated by rebuilding most existing arbitrary-scale SISR methods and validating on five popular SISR test datasets. The results show that our AnySR implements SISR tasks in a computing-more-efficient fashion, and performs on par with existing arbitrary-scale SISR methods. For the first time, we realize SISR tasks as not only any-scale in literature, but also as any-resource. Code is available at https://github.com/CrispyFeSo4/AnySR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seonghyeon Moon (Tony),  Qingze (Tony),  Liu, Haein Kong, Muhammad Haris Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Segmentation refinement aims to enhance the initial coarse masks generated by segmentation algorithms. The refined masks are expected to capture more details and better contours of the target objects. Research on segmentation refinement has developed as a response to the need for high-quality image segmentations. However, to our knowledge, no method has been developed that can determine the success of segmentation refinement. Such a method could ensure the reliability of segmentation in applications where the outcome of the segmentation is important and fosters innovation in image processing technologies. To address this research gap, we propose Judging From Support-set (JFS), a method to judge the success of segmentation refinement leveraging an off-the-shelf few-shot segmentation (FSS) model. The traditional goal of the problem in FSS is to find a target object in a query image utilizing target information given by a support set. However, we propose a novel application of the FSS model in our evaluation pipeline for segmentation refinement methods. Given a coarse mask as input, segmentation refinement methods produce a refined mask; these two masks become new support masks for the FSS model. The existing support mask then serves as the test set for the FSS model to evaluate the quality of the refined segmentation by the segmentation refinement methods.We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed JFS framework by evaluating the SAM Enhanced Pseduo-Labels (SEPL) using SegGPT as the choice of FSS model on the PASCAL dataset. The results showed that JFS has the potential to determine whether the segmentation refinement process is successful.</p>

<p>Abstract: Absence of tamper-proof cattle identification technology was a significant problem preventing insurance companies from providing livestock insurance. This lack of technology had devastating financial consequences for marginal farmers as they did not have the opportunity to claim compensation for any unexpected events such as the accidental death of cattle in Bangladesh. Using machine learning and deep learning algorithms, we have solved the bottleneck of cattle identification by developing and introducing a muzzle-based cattle identification system. The uniqueness of cattle muzzles has been scientifically established, which resembles human fingerprints. This is the fundamental premise that prompted us to develop a cattle identification system that extracts the uniqueness of cattle muzzles. For this purpose, we collected 32,374 images from 826 cattle. Contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) with sharpening filters was applied in the preprocessing steps to remove noise from images. We used the YOLO algorithm for cattle muzzle detection in the image and the FaceNet architecture to learn unified embeddings from muzzle images using squared $L_2$ distances. Our system performs with an accuracy of $96.489\%$, $F_1$ score of $97.334\%$, and a true positive rate (tpr) of $87.993\%$ at a remarkably low false positive rate (fpr) of $0.098\%$. This reliable and efficient system for identifying cattle can significantly advance livestock insurance and precision farming.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Tong, Jinrui Wang, Wenshuang Yang, Songtao Wu, Wenqi Zhang, Chen Sun, Kuanhong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The utilization of AIoT technology has become a crucial trend in modern poultry management, offering the potential to optimize farming operations and reduce human workloads. This paper presents a real-time and compact edge-AI enabled detector designed to identify chickens and their healthy statuses using frames captured by a lightweight and intelligent camera equipped with an edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor. To ensure efficient deployment of the proposed compact detector within the memory-constrained edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor, we employ a FCOS-Lite detector leveraging MobileNet as the backbone. To mitigate the issue of reduced accuracy in compact edge-AI detectors without incurring additional inference costs, we propose a gradient weighting loss function as classification loss and introduce CIOU loss function as localization loss. Additionally, we propose a knowledge distillation scheme to transfer valuable information from a large teacher detector to the proposed FCOS-Lite detector, thereby enhancing its performance while preserving a compact model size. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed edge-AI enabled detector achieves commendable performance metrics, including a mean average precision (mAP) of 95.1$\%$ and an F1-score of 94.2$\%$, etc. Notably, the proposed detector can be efficiently deployed and operates at a speed exceeding 20 FPS on the edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor, achieved through int8 quantization. That meets practical demands for automated poultry health monitoring using lightweight intelligent cameras with low power consumption and minimal bandwidth costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinfan Hu, Jinjin Gu, Shiyao Yu, Fanghua Yu, Zheyuan Li, Zhiyuan You, Chaochao Lu, Chao Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have significantly improved the performance of low-level vision tasks but also increased the difficulty of interpretability. A deep understanding of deep models is beneficial for both network design and practical reliability. To take up this challenge, we introduce causality theory to interpret low-level vision models and propose a model-/task-agnostic method called Causal Effect Map (CEM). With CEM, we can visualize and quantify the input-output relationships on either positive or negative effects. After analyzing various low-level vision tasks with CEM, we have reached several interesting insights, such as: (1) Using more information of input images (e.g., larger receptive field) does NOT always yield positive outcomes. (2) Attempting to incorporate mechanisms with a global receptive field (e.g., channel attention) into image denoising may prove futile. (3) Integrating multiple tasks to train a general model could encourage the network to prioritize local information over global context. Based on the causal effect theory, the proposed diagnostic tool can refresh our common knowledge and bring a deeper understanding of low-level vision models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Wan, Yuhang He, Xiang Song, Yihong Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized customized text-to-image generation, allowing for efficient synthesis of photos from personal data with textual descriptions. However, these advancements bring forth risks including privacy breaches and unauthorized replication of artworks. Previous researches primarily center around using prompt-specific methods to generate adversarial examples to protect personal images, yet the effectiveness of existing methods is hindered by constrained adaptability to different prompts. In this paper, we introduce a Prompt-Agnostic Adversarial Perturbation (PAP) method for customized diffusion models. PAP first models the prompt distribution using a Laplace Approximation, and then produces prompt-agnostic perturbations by maximizing a disturbance expectation based on the modeled distribution. This approach effectively tackles the prompt-agnostic attacks, leading to improved defense stability. Extensive experiments in face privacy and artistic style protection, demonstrate the superior generalization of PAP in comparison to existing techniques.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanbo Ding, Shaobin Zhuang, Kunchang Li, Zhengrong Yue, Yu Qiao, Yali Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advancements in text-to-image generation, most existing methods struggle to create images with multiple objects and complex spatial relationships in the 3D world. To tackle this limitation, we introduce a generic AI system, namely MUSES, for 3D-controllable image generation from user queries. Specifically, our MUSES addresses this challenging task by developing a progressive workflow with three key components, including (1) Layout Manager for 2D-to-3D layout lifting, (2) Model Engineer for 3D object acquisition and calibration, (3) Image Artist for 3D-to-2D image rendering. By mimicking the collaboration of human professionals, this multi-modal agent pipeline facilitates the effective and automatic creation of images with 3D-controllable objects, through an explainable integration of top-down planning and bottom-up generation. Additionally, we find that existing benchmarks lack detailed descriptions of complex 3D spatial relationships of multiple objects. To fill this gap, we further construct a new benchmark of T2I-3DisBench (3D image scene), which describes diverse 3D image scenes with 50 detailed prompts. Extensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of MUSES on both T2I-CompBench and T2I-3DisBench, outperforming recent strong competitors such as DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion 3. These results demonstrate a significant step of MUSES forward in bridging natural language, 2D image generation, and 3D world.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengzhu Yang, Jiawei Du, Jia Guo, Weihang Zhang, Hanruo Liu, Huiqi Li, Ningli Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Subtle semantic differences in retinal image and text data present great challenges for pre-training visual-language models. Moreover, false negative samples, i.e., image-text pairs having the same semantics but incorrectly regarded as negatives, disrupt the visual-language pre-training process and affect the model's learning ability. This work aims to develop a retinal foundation model, called ViLReF, by pre-training on a paired dataset comprising 451,956 retinal images and corresponding diagnostic text reports. In our vision-language pre-training strategy, we leverage expert knowledge to facilitate the extraction of labels and propose a novel constraint, the Weighted Similarity Coupling Loss, to adjust the speed of pushing sample pairs further apart dynamically within the feature space. Furthermore, we employ a batch expansion module with dynamic memory queues, maintained by momentum encoders, to supply extra samples and compensate for the vacancies caused by eliminating false negatives. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple datasets for downstream classification and segmentation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the powerful zero-shot and transfer learning capabilities of ViLReF, verifying the effectiveness of our pre-training strategy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simone Foti, Stefanos Zafeiriou, Tolga Birdal</p>
<p>Abstract: Seams, distortions, wasted UV space, vertex-duplication, and varying resolution over the surface are the most prominent issues of the standard UV-based texturing of meshes. These issues are particularly acute when automatic UV-unwrapping techniques are used. For this reason, instead of generating textures in automatically generated UV-planes like most state-of-the-art methods, we propose to represent textures as coloured point-clouds whose colours are generated by a denoising diffusion probabilistic model constrained to operate on the surface of 3D objects. Our sampling and resolution agnostic generative model heavily relies on heat diffusion over the surface of the meshes for spatial communication between points. To enable processing of arbitrarily sampled point-cloud textures and ensure long-distance texture consistency we introduce a fast re-sampling of the mesh spectral properties used during the heat diffusion and introduce a novel heat-diffusion-based self-attention mechanism. Our code and pre-trained models are available at github.com/simofoti/UV3-TeD.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17422">Open-Vocabulary Action Localization with Iterative Visual Prompting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Naoki Wake, Atsushi Kanehira, Kazuhiro Sasabuchi, Jun Takamatsu, Katsushi Ikeuchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Video action localization aims to find the timings of specific actions from a long video. Although existing learning-based approaches have been successful, they require annotating videos, which comes with a considerable labor cost. This paper proposes a learning-free, open-vocabulary approach based on emerging off-the-shelf vision-language models (VLMs). The challenge stems from the fact that VLMs are neither designed to process long videos nor tailored for finding actions. We overcome these problems by extending an iterative visual prompting technique. Specifically, we sample video frames and create a concatenated image with frame index labels, making a VLM guess a frame that is considered to be closest to the start and end of the action. Iterating this process by narrowing a sampling time window results in finding the specific frames corresponding to the start and end of an action. We demonstrate that this technique yields reasonable performance, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art zero-shot action localization. These results illustrate a practical extension of VLMs for understanding videos. A sample code is available at https://microsoft.github.io/VLM-Video-Action-Localization/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicheng Wang, Che Liu, Rossella Arcucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in medical vision-language pre-training (MedVLP) have significantly enhanced zero-shot medical vision tasks such as image classification by leveraging large-scale medical image-text pair pre-training. However, the performance of these tasks can be heavily influenced by the variability in textual prompts describing the categories, necessitating robustness in MedVLP models to diverse prompt styles. Yet, this sensitivity remains underexplored. In this work, we are the first to systematically assess the sensitivity of three widely-used MedVLP methods to a variety of prompts across 15 different diseases. To achieve this, we designed six unique prompt styles to mirror real clinical scenarios, which were subsequently ranked by interpretability. Our findings indicate that all MedVLP models evaluated show unstable performance across different prompt styles, suggesting a lack of robustness. Additionally, the models' performance varied with increasing prompt interpretability, revealing difficulties in comprehending complex medical concepts. This study underscores the need for further development in MedVLP methodologies to enhance their robustness to diverse zero-shot prompts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Li, Nian Liu, Dingwen Zhang, Zhongyu Li, Salman Khan, Rao Anwer, Hisham Cholakkal, Junwei Han, Fahad Shahbaz Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Inter-image association modeling is crucial for co-salient object detection. Despite satisfactory performance, previous methods still have limitations on sufficient inter-image association modeling. Because most of them focus on image feature optimization under the guidance of heuristically calculated raw inter-image associations. They directly rely on raw associations which are not reliable in complex scenarios, and their image feature optimization approach is not explicit for inter-image association modeling. To alleviate these limitations, this paper proposes a deep association learning strategy that deploys deep networks on raw associations to explicitly transform them into deep association features. Specifically, we first create hyperassociations to collect dense pixel-pair-wise raw associations and then deploys deep aggregation networks on them. We design a progressive association generation module for this purpose with additional enhancement of the hyperassociation calculation. More importantly, we propose a correspondence-induced association condensation module that introduces a pretext task, i.e. semantic correspondence estimation, to condense the hyperassociations for computational burden reduction and noise elimination. We also design an object-aware cycle consistency loss for high-quality correspondence estimations. Experimental results in three benchmark datasets demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our proposed method with various training settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daosong Hu, Ruomeng Wang, Liang Zhao, Mingyue Cui, Song Ding, Kai Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The three-dimensional vascular model reconstructed from CT images is widely used in medical diagnosis. At different phases, the beating of the heart can cause deformation of vessels, resulting in different vascular imaging states and false positive diagnostic results. The 4D model can simulate a complete cardiac cycle. Due to the dose limitation of contrast agent injection in patients, it is valuable to synthesize a 4D coronary artery trees through finite phases imaging. In this paper, we propose a method for generating a 4D coronary artery trees, which maps the systole to the diastole through deformation field prediction, interpolates on the timeline, and the motion trajectory of points are obtained. Specifically, the centerline is used to represent vessels and to infer deformation fields using cube-based sorting and neural networks. Adjacent vessel points are aggregated and interpolated based on the deformation field of the centerline point to obtain displacement vectors of different phases. Finally, the proposed method is validated through experiments to achieve the registration of non-rigid vascular points and the generation of 4D coronary trees.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown strong zero-shot generalization across various tasks, especially when integrated with large language models (LLMs). However, their ability to comprehend rhetorical and persuasive visual media, such as advertisements, remains understudied. Ads often employ atypical imagery, using surprising object juxtapositions to convey shared properties. For example, Fig. 1 (e) shows a beer with a feather-like texture. This requires advanced reasoning to deduce that this atypical representation signifies the beer's lightness. We introduce three novel tasks, Multi-label Atypicality Classification, Atypicality Statement Retrieval, and Aypical Object Recognition, to benchmark VLMs' understanding of atypicality in persuasive images. We evaluate how well VLMs use atypicality to infer an ad's message and test their reasoning abilities by employing semantically challenging negatives. Finally, we pioneer atypicality-aware verbalization by extracting comprehensive image descriptions sensitive to atypical elements. Our findings reveal that: (1) VLMs lack advanced reasoning capabilities compared to LLMs; (2) simple, effective strategies can extract atypicality-aware information, leading to comprehensive image verbalization; (3) atypicality aids persuasive advertisement understanding. Code and data will be made available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinze Yu, Xin Peng, Zhengda Lu, Laurent Kneip, Yiqun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: A spike camera is a specialized high-speed visual sensor that offers advantages such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic range compared to conventional frame cameras.These features provide the camera with significant advantages in many computer vision tasks. However, the tasks of novel view synthesis based on spike cameras remain underdeveloped. Although there are existing methods for learning neural radiance fields from spike stream, they either lack robustness in extremely noisy, low-quality lighting conditions or suffer from high computational complexity due to the deep fully connected neural networks and ray marching rendering strategies used in neural radiance fields, making it difficult to recover fine texture details. In contrast, the latest advancements in 3DGS have achieved high-quality real-time rendering by optimizing the point cloud representation into Gaussian ellipsoids. Building on this, we introduce SpikeGS, the method to learn 3D Gaussian fields solely from spike stream. We designed a differentiable spike stream rendering framework based on 3DGS, incorporating noise embedding and spiking neurons. By leveraging the multi-view consistency of 3DGS and the tile-based multi-threaded parallel rendering mechanism, we achieved high-quality real-time rendering results. Additionally, we introduced a spike rendering loss function that generalizes under varying illumination conditions. Our method can reconstruct view synthesis results with fine texture details from a continuous spike stream captured by a moving spike camera, while demonstrating high robustness in extremely noisy low-light scenarios. Experimental results on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in terms of rendering quality and speed.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zheng, Yueqi Duan, Kangfu Zheng, Hongru Yan, Jiwen Lu, Jie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a One-Point-One NeRF (OPONeRF) framework for robust scene rendering. Existing NeRFs are designed based on a key assumption that the target scene remains unchanged between the training and test time. However, small but unpredictable perturbations such as object movements, light changes and data contaminations broadly exist in real-life 3D scenes, which lead to significantly defective or failed rendering results even for the recent state-of-the-art generalizable methods. To address this, we propose a divide-and-conquer framework in OPONeRF that adaptively responds to local scene variations via personalizing appropriate point-wise parameters, instead of fitting a single set of NeRF parameters that are inactive to test-time unseen changes. Moreover, to explicitly capture the local uncertainty, we decompose the point representation into deterministic mapping and probabilistic inference. In this way, OPONeRF learns the sharable invariance and unsupervisedly models the unexpected scene variations between the training and testing scenes. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we construct benchmarks from both realistic and synthetic data with diverse test-time perturbations including foreground motions, illumination variations and multi-modality noises, which are more challenging than conventional generalization and temporal reconstruction benchmarks. Experimental results show that our OPONeRF outperforms state-of-the-art NeRFs on various evaluation metrics through benchmark experiments and cross-scene evaluations. We further show the efficacy of the proposed method via experimenting on other existing generalization-based benchmarks and incorporating the idea of One-Point-One NeRF into other advanced baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deheng Zhang, Jingyu Wang, Shaofei Wang, Marko Mihajlovic, Sergey Prokudin, Hendrik P. A. Lensch, Siyu Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end relightable neural inverse rendering system that achieves high-quality reconstruction of geometry and material properties, thus enabling high-quality relighting. The cornerstone of our method is a two-stage approach for learning a better factorization of scene parameters. In the first stage, we develop a reflection-aware radiance field using a neural signed distance field (SDF) as the geometry representation and deploy an MLP (multilayer perceptron) to estimate indirect illumination. In the second stage, we introduce a novel information-sharing network structure to jointly learn the radiance field and the physically based factorization of the scene. For the physically based factorization, to reduce the noise caused by Monte Carlo sampling, we apply a split-sum approximation with a simplified Disney BRDF and cube mipmap as the environment light representation. In the relighting phase, to enhance the quality of indirect illumination, we propose a second split-sum algorithm to trace secondary rays under the split-sum rendering framework. Furthermore, there is no dataset or protocol available to quantitatively evaluate the inverse rendering performance for glossy objects. To assess the quality of material reconstruction and relighting, we have created a new dataset with ground truth BRDF parameters and relighting results. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in inverse rendering and relighting, with particularly strong results in the reconstruction of highly reflective objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyu Han, Qianqian Xu, Zhiyong Yang, Shilong Bao, Peisong Wen, Yangbangyan Jiang, Qingming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a well-known metric for evaluating instance-level long-tail learning problems. In the past two decades, many AUC optimization methods have been proposed to improve model performance under long-tail distributions. In this paper, we explore AUC optimization methods in the context of pixel-level long-tail semantic segmentation, a much more complicated scenario. This task introduces two major challenges for AUC optimization techniques. On one hand, AUC optimization in a pixel-level task involves complex coupling across loss terms, with structured inner-image and pairwise inter-image dependencies, complicating theoretical analysis. On the other hand, we find that mini-batch estimation of AUC loss in this case requires a larger batch size, resulting in an unaffordable space complexity. To address these issues, we develop a pixel-level AUC loss function and conduct a dependency-graph-based theoretical analysis of the algorithm's generalization ability. Additionally, we design a Tail-Classes Memory Bank (T-Memory Bank) to manage the significant memory demand.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuting Zhao, Chenkang Du, Kristin Qi, Xinrong Chen, Xinhan Di</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptation methods are developed to adapt depth foundation models to endoscopic depth estimation recently. However, such approaches typically under-perform training since they limit the parameter search to a low-rank subspace and alter the training dynamics. Therefore, we propose a full-parameter and parameter-efficient learning framework for endoscopic depth estimation. At the first stage, the subspace of attention, convolution and multi-layer perception are adapted simultaneously within different sub-spaces. At the second stage, a memory-efficient optimization is proposed for subspace composition and the performance is further improved in the united sub-space. Initial experiments on the SCARED dataset demonstrate that results at the first stage improves the performance from 10.2% to 4.1% for Sq Rel, Abs Rel, RMSE and RMSE log in the comparison with the state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Liu, Ziqing Zhang, Wenbo Li, Renjing Pei, Fenglong Song, Xiaohong Liu, Linghe Kong, Yulun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) serves as the golden standard for all models' performance in nearly all computer vision fields. However, it still suffers from poor out-of-distribution generalization ability and expensive training costs. To address these problems, we propose Dog-IQA, a standard-guided zero-shot mix-grained IQA method, which is training-free and utilizes the exceptional prior knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To obtain accurate IQA scores, namely scores consistent with humans, we design an MLLM-based inference pipeline that imitates human experts. In detail, Dog-IQA applies two techniques. First, Dog-IQA objectively scores with specific standards that utilize MLLM's behavior pattern and minimize the influence of subjective factors. Second, Dog-IQA comprehensively takes local semantic objects and the whole image as input and aggregates their scores, leveraging local and global information. Our proposed Dog-IQA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared with training-free methods, and competitive performance compared with training-based methods in cross-dataset scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingjing Ren, Xiaoyong Zhang, Lina Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerous studies have demonstrated the strong performance of Vision Transformer (ViT)-based methods across various computer vision tasks. However, ViT models often struggle to effectively capture high-frequency components in images, which are crucial for detecting small targets and preserving edge details, especially in complex scenarios. This limitation is particularly challenging in colon polyp segmentation, where polyps exhibit significant variability in structure, texture, and shape. High-frequency information, such as boundary details, is essential for achieving precise semantic segmentation in this context. To address these challenges, we propose HiFiSeg, a novel network for colon polyp segmentation that enhances high-frequency information processing through a global-local vision transformer framework. HiFiSeg leverages the pyramid vision transformer (PVT) as its encoder and introduces two key modules: the global-local interaction module (GLIM) and the selective aggregation module (SAM). GLIM employs a parallel structure to fuse global and local information at multiple scales, effectively capturing fine-grained features. SAM selectively integrates boundary details from low-level features with semantic information from high-level features, significantly improving the model's ability to accurately detect and segment polyps. Extensive experiments on five widely recognized benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HiFiSeg for polyp segmentation. Notably, the mDice scores on the challenging CVC-ColonDB and ETIS datasets reached 0.826 and 0.822, respectively, underscoring the superior performance of HiFiSeg in handling the specific complexities of this task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Fang, Zheng Lin, Senkang Hu, Hangcheng Cao, Yiqin Deng, Xianhao Chen, Yuguang Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, in-car monitoring has emerged as a promising technology for detecting early-stage abnormal status of the driver and providing timely alerts to prevent traffic accidents. Although training models with multimodal data enhances the reliability of abnormal status detection, the scarcity of labeled data and the imbalance of class distribution impede the extraction of critical abnormal state features, significantly deteriorating training performance. Furthermore, missing modalities due to environment and hardware limitations further exacerbate the challenge of abnormal status identification. More importantly, monitoring abnormal health conditions of passengers, particularly in elderly care, is of paramount importance but remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce our IC3M, an efficient camera-rotation-based multimodal framework for monitoring both driver and passengers in a car. Our IC3M comprises two key modules: an adaptive threshold pseudo-labeling strategy and a missing modality reconstruction. The former customizes pseudo-labeling thresholds for different classes based on the class distribution, generating class-balanced pseudo labels to guide model training effectively, while the latter leverages crossmodality relationships learned from limited labels to accurately recover missing modalities by distribution transferring from available modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IC3M outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in accuracy, precision, and recall while exhibiting superior robustness under limited labeled data and severe missing modality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiteng Li, Xianglong Yan, Tianao Zhang, Haotong Qin, Dong Xie, Jiang Tian, zhongchao shi, Linghe Kong, Yulun Zhang, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly pushed forward advancements in natural language processing, yet their high memory and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Binarization, as an effective compression technique, can shrink model weights to just 1 bit, significantly reducing the high demands on computation and memory. However, current binarization methods struggle to narrow the distribution gap between binarized and full-precision weights, while also overlooking the column deviation in LLM weight distribution. To tackle these issues, we propose ARB-LLM, a novel 1-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) technique tailored for LLMs. To narrow the distribution shift between binarized and full-precision weights, we first design an alternating refined binarization (ARB) algorithm to progressively update the binarization parameters, which significantly reduces the quantization error. Moreover, considering the pivot role of calibration data and the column deviation in LLM weights, we further extend ARB to ARB-X and ARB-RC. In addition, we refine the weight partition strategy with column-group bitmap (CGB), which further enhance performance. Equipping ARB-X and ARB-RC with CGB, we obtain ARB-LLM$_\text{X}$ and ARB-LLM$_\text{RC}$ respectively, which significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) binarization methods for LLMs. As a binary PTQ method, our ARB-LLM$_\text{RC}$ is the first to surpass FP16 models of the same size.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03558">Not All Diffusion Model Activations Have Been Evaluated as Discriminative Features</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Benyuan Meng, Qianqian Xu, Zitai Wang, Xiaochun Cao, Qingming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are initially designed for image generation. Recent research shows that the internal signals within their backbones, named activations, can also serve as dense features for various discriminative tasks such as semantic segmentation. Given numerous activations, selecting a small yet effective subset poses a fundamental problem. To this end, the early study of this field performs a large-scale quantitative comparison of the discriminative ability of the activations. However, we find that many potential activations have not been evaluated, such as the queries and keys used to compute attention scores. Moreover, recent advancements in diffusion architectures bring many new activations, such as those within embedded ViT modules. Both combined, activation selection remains unresolved but overlooked. To tackle this issue, this paper takes a further step with a much broader range of activations evaluated. Considering the significant increase in activations, a full-scale quantitative comparison is no longer operational. Instead, we seek to understand the properties of these activations, such that the activations that are clearly inferior can be filtered out in advance via simple qualitative evaluation. After careful analysis, we discover three properties universal among diffusion models, enabling this study to go beyond specific models. On top of this, we present effective feature selection solutions for several popular diffusion models. Finally, the experiments across multiple discriminative tasks validate the superiority of our method over the SOTA competitors.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03979">Improving Arabic Multi-Label Emotion Classification using Stacked Embeddings and Hybrid Loss Function</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nisar Ahmed, Muhammad Imran Zaman</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-label emotion classification, particularly for low-resource languages like Arabic, the challenges of class imbalance and label correlation hinder model performance, especially in accurately predicting minority emotions. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel approach that combines stacked embeddings, meta-learning, and a hybrid loss function to enhance multi-label emotion classification for the Arabic language. The study extracts contextual embeddings from three fine-tuned language models-ArabicBERT, MarBERT, and AraBERT-which are then stacked to form enriched embeddings. A meta-learner is trained on these stacked embeddings, and the resulting concatenated representations are provided as input to a Bi-LSTM model, followed by a fully connected neural network for multi-label classification. To further improve performance, a hybrid loss function is introduced, incorporating class weighting, label correlation matrix, and contrastive learning, effectively addressing class imbalances and improving the handling of label correlations. Extensive experiments validate the proposed model's performance across key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Jaccard Accuracy, and Hamming Loss. The class-wise performance analysis demonstrates the hybrid loss function's ability to significantly reduce disparities between majority and minority classes, resulting in a more balanced emotion classification. An ablation study highlights the contribution of each component, showing the superiority of the model compared to baseline approaches and other loss functions. This study not only advances multi-label emotion classification for Arabic but also presents a generalizable framework that can be adapted to other languages and domains, providing a significant step forward in addressing the challenges of low-resource emotion classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianze Li, Jiezhang Cao, Zichen Zou, Xiongfei Su, Xin Yuan, Yulun Zhang, Yong Guo, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving excellent performance for real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) with considerable computational costs. Current approaches are trying to derive one-step diffusion models from multi-step counterparts through knowledge distillation. However, these methods incur substantial training costs and may constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher's limitations. To tackle these issues, we propose DFOSD, a Distillation-Free One-Step Diffusion model. Specifically, we propose a noise-aware discriminator (NAD) to participate in adversarial training, further enhancing the authenticity of the generated content. Additionally, we improve the perceptual loss with edge-aware DISTS (EA-DISTS) to enhance the model's ability to generate fine details. Our experiments demonstrate that, compared with previous diffusion-based methods requiring dozens or even hundreds of steps, our DFOSD attains comparable or even superior results in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations. Our DFOSD also abtains higher performance and efficiency compared with other one-step diffusion methods. We will release code and models at https://github.com/JianzeLi-114/DFOSD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongpai Gao, Benjamin Planche, Meng Zheng, Anwesa Choudhuri, Terrence Chen, Ziyan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel view synthesis has advanced significantly with the development of neural radiance fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). However, achieving high quality without compromising real-time rendering remains challenging, particularly for physically-based ray tracing with view-dependent effects. Recently, N-dimensional Gaussians (N-DG) introduced a 6D spatial-angular representation to better incorporate view-dependent effects, but the Gaussian representation and control scheme are sub-optimal. In this paper, we revisit 6D Gaussians and introduce 6D Gaussian Splatting (6DGS), which enhances color and opacity representations and leverages the additional directional information in the 6D space for optimized Gaussian control. Our approach is fully compatible with the 3DGS framework and significantly improves real-time radiance field rendering by better modeling view-dependent effects and fine details. Experiments demonstrate that 6DGS significantly outperforms 3DGS and N-DG, achieving up to a 15.73 dB improvement in PSNR with a reduction of 66.5% Gaussian points compared to 3DGS.

<p>Abstract: High-quality video generation, encompassing text-to-video (T2V), image-to-video (I2V), and video-to-video (V2V) generation, holds considerable significance in content creation to benefit anyone express their inherent creativity in new ways and world simulation to modeling and understanding the world. Models like SORA have advanced generating videos with higher resolution, more natural motion, better vision-language alignment, and increased controllability, particularly for long video sequences. These improvements have been driven by the evolution of model architectures, shifting from UNet to more scalable and parameter-rich DiT models, along with large-scale data expansion and refined training strategies. However, despite the emergence of DiT-based closed-source and open-source models, a comprehensive investigation into their capabilities and limitations remains lacking. Furthermore, the rapid development has made it challenging for recent benchmarks to fully cover SORA-like models and recognize their significant advancements. Additionally, evaluation metrics often fail to align with human preferences.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06025">Sparse Repellency for Shielded Generation in Text-to-image Diffusion Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Kirchhof, James Thornton, Pierre Ablin, Louis B\'ethune, Eugene Ndiaye, Marco Cuturi</p>
<p>Abstract: The increased adoption of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has triggered concerns on their reliability. Such models are now closely scrutinized under the lens of various metrics, notably calibration, fairness, or compute efficiency. We focus in this work on two issues that arise when deploying these models: a lack of diversity when prompting images, and a tendency to recreate images from the training set. To solve both problems, we propose a method that coaxes the sampled trajectories of pretrained diffusion models to land on images that fall outside of a reference set. We achieve this by adding repellency terms to the diffusion SDE throughout the generation trajectory, which are triggered whenever the path is expected to land too closely to an image in the shielded reference set. Our method is sparse in the sense that these repellency terms are zero and inactive most of the time, and even more so towards the end of the generation trajectory. Our method, named SPELL for sparse repellency, can be used either with a static reference set that contains protected images, or dynamically, by updating the set at each timestep with the expected images concurrently generated within a batch. We show that adding SPELL to popular diffusion models improves their diversity while impacting their FID only marginally, and performs comparatively better than other recent training-free diversity methods. We also demonstrate how SPELL can ensure a shielded generation away from a very large set of protected images by considering all 1.2M images from ImageNet as the protected set.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose RelitLRM, a Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) for generating high-quality Gaussian splatting representations of 3D objects under novel illuminations from sparse (4-8) posed images captured under unknown static lighting. Unlike prior inverse rendering methods requiring dense captures and slow optimization, often causing artifacts like incorrect highlights or shadow baking, RelitLRM adopts a feed-forward transformer-based model with a novel combination of a geometry reconstructor and a relightable appearance generator based on diffusion. The model is trained end-to-end on synthetic multi-view renderings of objects under varying known illuminations. This architecture design enables to effectively decompose geometry and appearance, resolve the ambiguity between material and lighting, and capture the multi-modal distribution of shadows and specularity in the relit appearance. We show our sparse-view feed-forward RelitLRM offers competitive relighting results to state-of-the-art dense-view optimization-based baselines while being significantly faster.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijie Ma, Fei Zhu, Zhun Zhong, Wenzhuo Liu, Xu-Yao Zhang, Cheng-Lin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Constantly discovering novel concepts is crucial in evolving environments. This paper explores the underexplored task of Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD), which aims to incrementally discover new classes from unlabeled data while maintaining the ability to recognize previously learned classes. Although several settings are proposed to study the C-GCD task, they have limitations that do not reflect real-world scenarios. We thus study a more practical C-GCD setting, which includes more new classes to be discovered over a longer period, without storing samples of past classes. In C-GCD, the model is initially trained on labeled data of known classes, followed by multiple incremental stages where the model is fed with unlabeled data containing both old and new classes. The core challenge involves two conflicting objectives: discover new classes and prevent forgetting old ones. We delve into the conflicts and identify that models are susceptible to prediction bias and hardness bias. To address these issues, we introduce a debiased learning framework, namely Happy, characterized by Hardness-aware prototype sampling and soft entropy regularization. For the prediction bias, we first introduce clustering-guided initialization to provide robust features. In addition, we propose soft entropy regularization to assign appropriate probabilities to new classes, which can significantly enhance the clustering performance of new classes. For the harness bias, we present the hardness-aware prototype sampling, which can effectively reduce the forgetting issue for previously seen classes, especially for difficult classes. Experimental results demonstrate our method proficiently manages the conflicts of C-GCD and achieves remarkable performance across various datasets, e.g., 7.5% overall gains on ImageNet-100.

<p>Abstract: Large-scale multimodal models have shown excellent performance over a series of tasks powered by the large corpus of paired multimodal training data. Generally, they are always assumed to receive modality-complete inputs. However, this simple assumption may not always hold in the real world due to privacy constraints or collection difficulty, where models pretrained on modality-complete data easily demonstrate degraded performance on missing-modality cases. To handle this issue, we refer to prompt learning to adapt large pretrained multimodal models to handle missing-modality scenarios by regarding different missing cases as different types of input. Instead of only prepending independent prompts to the intermediate layers, we present to leverage the correlations between prompts and input features and excavate the relationships between different layers of prompts to carefully design the instructions. We also incorporate the complementary semantics of different modalities to guide the prompting design for each modality. Extensive experiments on three commonly-used datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the previous approaches upon different missing scenarios. Plentiful ablations are further given to show the generalizability and reliability of our method upon different modality-missing ratios and types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqi Liu, Boyu Diao, Libo Huang, Zijia An, Zhulin An, Yongjun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is designed to learn new tasks while preserving existing knowledge. Replaying samples from earlier tasks has proven to be an effective method to mitigate the forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. However, the current research on the training efficiency of rehearsal-based methods is insufficient, which limits the practical application of CL systems in resource-limited scenarios. The human visual system (HVS) exhibits varying sensitivities to different frequency components, enabling the efficient elimination of visually redundant information. Inspired by HVS, we propose a novel framework called Continual Learning in the Frequency Domain (CLFD). To our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize frequency domain features to enhance the performance and efficiency of CL training on edge devices. For the input features of the feature extractor, CLFD employs wavelet transform to map the original input image into the frequency domain, thereby effectively reducing the size of input feature maps. Regarding the output features of the feature extractor, CLFD selectively utilizes output features for distinct classes for classification, thereby balancing the reusability and interference of output features based on the frequency domain similarity of the classes across various tasks. Optimizing only the input and output features of the feature extractor allows for seamless integration of CLFD with various rehearsal-based methods. Extensive experiments conducted in both cloud and edge environments demonstrate that CLFD consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both precision and training efficiency. Specifically, CLFD can increase the accuracy of the SOTA CL method by up to 6.83% and reduce the training time by 2.6$\times$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benyuan Meng, Qianqian Xu, Zitai Wang, Zhiyong Yang, Xiaochun Cao, Qingming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful generative models, and this capability can also be applied to discrimination. The inner activations of a pre-trained diffusion model can serve as features for discriminative tasks, namely, diffusion feature. We discover that diffusion feature has been hindered by a hidden yet universal phenomenon that we call content shift. To be specific, there are content differences between features and the input image, such as the exact shape of a certain object. We locate the cause of content shift as one inherent characteristic of diffusion models, which suggests the broad existence of this phenomenon in diffusion feature. Further empirical study also indicates that its negative impact is not negligible even when content shift is not visually perceivable. Hence, we propose to suppress content shift to enhance the overall quality of diffusion features. Specifically, content shift is related to the information drift during the process of recovering an image from the noisy input, pointing out the possibility of turning off-the-shelf generation techniques into tools for content shift suppression. We further propose a practical guideline named GATE to efficiently evaluate the potential benefit of a technique and provide an implementation of our methodology. Despite the simplicity, the proposed approach has achieved superior results on various tasks and datasets, validating its potential as a generic booster for diffusion features.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in State Space Models, notably Mamba, have demonstrated superior performance over the dominant Transformer models, particularly in reducing the computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Yet, difficulties in adapting Mamba from language to vision tasks arise due to the distinct characteristics of visual data, such as the spatial locality and adjacency within images and large variations in information granularity across visual tokens. Existing vision Mamba approaches either flatten tokens into sequences in a raster scan fashion, which breaks the local adjacency of images, or manually partition tokens into windows, which limits their long-range modeling and generalization capabilities. To address these limitations, we present a new vision Mamba model, coined QuadMamba, that effectively captures local dependencies of varying granularities via quadtree-based image partition and scan. Concretely, our lightweight quadtree-based scan module learns to preserve the 2D locality of spatial regions within learned window quadrants. The module estimates the locality score of each token from their features, before adaptively partitioning tokens into window quadrants. An omnidirectional window shifting scheme is also introduced to capture more intact and informative features across different local regions. To make the discretized quadtree partition end-to-end trainable, we further devise a sequence masking strategy based on Gumbel-Softmax and its straight-through gradient estimator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in various vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Hetzel, Hannes Reichert, Konrad Doll, Bernhard Sick</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous systems, like vehicles or robots, require reliable, accurate, fast, resource-efficient, scalable, and low-latency trajectory predictions to get initial knowledge about future locations and movements of surrounding objects for safe human-machine interaction. Furthermore, they need to know the uncertainty of the predictions for risk assessment to provide safe path planning. This paper presents a lightweight method to address these requirements, combining Long Short-Term Memory and Mixture Density Networks. Our method predicts probability distributions, including confidence level estimations for positional uncertainty to support subsequent risk management applications and runs on a low-power embedded platform. We discuss essential requirements for human trajectory prediction in autonomous vehicle applications and demonstrate our method's performance using multiple traffic-related datasets. Furthermore, we explain reliability and sharpness metrics and show how important they are to guarantee the correctness and robustness of a model's predictions and uncertainty assessments. These essential evaluations have so far received little attention for no good reason. Our approach focuses entirely on real-world applicability. Verifying prediction uncertainties and a model's reliability are central to autonomous real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Wang, Donglin Yang, Ziqin Wang, Hohin Kwan, Jinyu Chen, Wenjun Wu, Hongsheng Li, Yue Liao, Si Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing agents capable of navigating to a target location based on language instructions and visual information, known as vision-language navigation (VLN), has attracted widespread interest. Most research has focused on ground-based agents, while UAV-based VLN remains relatively underexplored. Recent efforts in UAV vision-language navigation predominantly adopt ground-based VLN settings, relying on predefined discrete action spaces and neglecting the inherent disparities in agent movement dynamics and the complexity of navigation tasks between ground and aerial environments. To address these disparities and challenges, we propose solutions from three perspectives: platform, benchmark, and methodology. To enable realistic UAV trajectory simulation in VLN tasks, we propose the OpenUAV platform, which features diverse environments, realistic flight control, and extensive algorithmic support. We further construct a target-oriented VLN dataset consisting of approximately 12k trajectories on this platform, serving as the first dataset specifically designed for realistic UAV VLN tasks. To tackle the challenges posed by complex aerial environments, we propose an assistant-guided UAV object search benchmark called UAV-Need-Help, which provides varying levels of guidance information to help UAVs better accomplish realistic VLN tasks. We also propose a UAV navigation LLM that, given multi-view images, task descriptions, and assistant instructions, leverages the multimodal understanding capabilities of the MLLM to jointly process visual and textual information, and performs hierarchical trajectory generation. The evaluation results of our method significantly outperform the baseline models, while there remains a considerable gap between our results and those achieved by human operators, underscoring the challenge presented by the UAV-Need-Help task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Zhao, Hangjie Yuan, Yujie Wei, Shiwei Zhang, Yuchao Gu, Lingmin Ran, Xiang Wang, Zhangjie Wu, Junhao Zhang, Yingya Zhang, Mike Zheng Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generation models have showcased remarkable capabilities in generating fantastic content. However, most of them are trained on proprietary high-quality data, and some models withhold their parameters and only provide accessible application programming interfaces (APIs), limiting their benefits for downstream tasks. To explore the feasibility of training a text-to-image generation model comparable to advanced models using publicly available resources, we introduce EvolveDirector. This framework interacts with advanced models through their public APIs to obtain text-image data pairs to train a base model. Our experiments with extensive data indicate that the model trained on generated data of the advanced model can approximate its generation capability. However, it requires large-scale samples of 10 million or more. This incurs significant expenses in time, computational resources, and especially the costs associated with calling fee-based APIs. To address this problem, we leverage pre-trained large vision-language models (VLMs) to guide the evolution of the base model. VLM continuously evaluates the base model during training and dynamically updates and refines the training dataset by the discrimination, expansion, deletion, and mutation operations. Experimental results show that this paradigm significantly reduces the required data volume. Furthermore, when approaching multiple advanced models, EvolveDirector can select the best samples generated by them to learn powerful and balanced abilities. The final trained model Edgen is demonstrated to outperform these advanced models. The code and model weights are available at https://github.com/showlab/EvolveDirector.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Delong Liu, Shichao Li, Tianyi Shi, Zhu Meng, Guanyu Chen, Yadong Huang, Jin Dong, Zhicheng Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Among numerous studies for driver state detection, wearable physiological measurements offer a practical method for real-time monitoring. However, there are few driver physiological datasets in open-road scenarios, and the existing datasets suffer from issues such as poor signal quality, small sample sizes, and short data collection periods. Therefore, in this paper, a large-scale multimodal driving dataset, OpenDriver, for driver state detection is developed. The OpenDriver encompasses a total of 3,278 driving trips, with a signal collection duration spanning approximately 4,600 hours. Two modalities of driving signals are enrolled in OpenDriver: electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and six-axis motion data of the steering wheel from a motion measurement unit (IMU), which were recorded from 81 drivers and their vehicles. Furthermore, three challenging tasks are involved in our work, namely ECG signal quality assessment, individual biometric identification based on ECG signals, and physiological signal analysis in complex driving environments. To facilitate research in these tasks, corresponding benchmarks have also been introduced. First, a noisy augmentation strategy is applied to generate a larger-scale ECG signal dataset with realistic noise simulation for quality assessment. Second, an end-to-end contrastive learning framework is employed for individual biometric identification. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of drivers' HRV features under different driving conditions is conducted. Each benchmark provides evaluation metrics and reference results. The OpenDriver dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/bdne/OpenDriver.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunder Ali Khowaja, Kapal Dev, Syed Muhammad Anwar, Marius George Linguraru</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning in federated learning paradigm has been gaining a lot of interest both in industry and research due to the collaborative learning capability on unlabeled yet isolated data. However, self-supervised based federated learning strategies suffer from performance degradation due to label scarcity and diverse data distributions, i.e., data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose the SelfFed framework for Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Our proposed SelfFed framework works in two phases. The first phase is the pre-training paradigm that performs augmentive modeling using Swin Transformer based encoder in a decentralized manner. The first phase of SelfFed framework helps to overcome the data heterogeneity issue. The second phase is the fine-tuning paradigm that introduces contrastive network and a novel aggregation strategy that is trained on limited labeled data for a target task in a decentralized manner. This fine-tuning stage overcomes the label scarcity problem. We perform our experimental analysis on publicly available medical imaging datasets and show that our proposed SelfFed framework performs better when compared to existing baselines concerning non-independent and identically distributed (IID) data and label scarcity. Our method achieves a maximum improvement of 8.8% and 4.1% on Retina and COVID-FL datasets on non-IID dataset. Further, our proposed method outperforms existing baselines even when trained on a few (10%) labeled instances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pratibha Kumari, Joohi Chauhan, Afshin Bozorgpour, Boqiang Huang, Reza Azad, Dorit Merhof</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical imaging analysis has witnessed remarkable advancements even surpassing human-level performance in recent years, driven by the rapid development of advanced deep-learning algorithms. However, when the inference dataset slightly differs from what the model has seen during one-time training, the model performance is greatly compromised. The situation requires restarting the training process using both the old and the new data which is computationally costly, does not align with the human learning process, and imposes storage constraints and privacy concerns. Alternatively, continual learning has emerged as a crucial approach for developing unified and sustainable deep models to deal with new classes, tasks, and the drifting nature of data in non-stationary environments for various application areas. Continual learning techniques enable models to adapt and accumulate knowledge over time, which is essential for maintaining performance on evolving datasets and novel tasks. This systematic review paper provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in continual learning techniques applied to medical imaging analysis. We present an extensive survey of existing research, covering topics including catastrophic forgetting, data drifts, stability, and plasticity requirements. Further, an in-depth discussion of key components of a continual learning framework such as continual learning scenarios, techniques, evaluation schemes, and metrics is provided. Continual learning techniques encompass various categories, including rehearsal, regularization, architectural, and hybrid strategies.

<p>Abstract: It is challenging for models to understand complex, multimodal content such as television clips, and this is in part because video-language models often rely on single-modality reasoning and lack interpretability. To combat these issues we propose TV-TREES, the first multimodal entailment tree generator. TV-TREES serves as an approach to video understanding that promotes interpretable joint-modality reasoning by searching for trees of entailment relationships between simple text-video evidence and higher-level conclusions that prove question-answer pairs. We also introduce the task of multimodal entailment tree generation to evaluate reasoning quality. Our method's performance on the challenging TVQA benchmark demonstrates interpretable, state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on full clips, illustrating that multimodal entailment tree generation can be a best-of-both-worlds alternative to black-box systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zikang Liu, Kun Zhou, Wayne Xin Zhao, Dawei Gao, Yaliang Li, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual instruction tuning is the key to building large vision language models~(LVLMs), which can greatly improve the task generalization and solving capabilities by learning a mixture of instruction data from diverse visual tasks. Previous work mostly collects multiple existing visual instruction datasets via heuristic ways for training (even more than a million instructions), which may introduce data redundancy and enlarge the training cost. To investigate this issue, we conduct a series of empirical studies, which reveal a significant redundancy within the visual instruction datasets, and show that greatly reducing the amount of instructions from several tasks even do not affect the performance. Based on the findings, we propose a high-value data selection approach TIVE, to eliminate redundancy within the visual instruction data and reduce the training cost. In TIVE, we first estimate the instance influence score on its corresponding task, and the task difficulty score, based on the gradient-based influence functions. Then, we leverage the two kinds of scores to determine the task proportion within the selected visual instruction subset, and select high-value instances for each task, respectively. Experiments on various LVLMs show that our approach using only about 15% data can achieve comparable average performance to the full-data fine-tuned model across eight benchmarks, even surpassing it on four of the benchmarks. Our code and data will be publicly released.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating and training autonomous driving systems require diverse and scalable corner cases. However, most existing scene generation methods lack controllability, accuracy, and versatility, resulting in unsatisfactory generation results. Inspired by DragGAN in image generation, we propose DragTraffic, a generalized, interactive, and controllable traffic scene generation framework based on conditional diffusion. DragTraffic enables non-experts to generate a variety of realistic driving scenarios for different types of traffic agents through an adaptive mixture expert architecture. We employ a regression model to provide a general initial solution and a refinement process based on the conditional diffusion model to ensure diversity. User-customized context is introduced through cross-attention to ensure high controllability. Experiments on a real-world driving dataset show that DragTraffic outperforms existing methods in terms of authenticity, diversity, and freedom.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinho Kim, Marcel Dominik Nickel, Florian Knoll</p>
<p>Abstract: The purpose of this study was to accelerate MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) acquisitions using deep learning-based (DL) reconstruction at 3T and 0.55T. A total of 35 healthy volunteers underwent conventional two-fold accelerated MRCP scans at field strengths of 3T and 0.55T. We trained DL reconstructions using two different training strategies, supervised (SV) and self-supervised (SSV), with retrospectively six-fold undersampled data obtained at 3T. We then evaluated the DL reconstructions against standard techniques, parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS), focusing on peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) as metrics. We also tested DL reconstructions in a prospectively accelerated scenario to reflect real-world clinical applications and evaluated their adaptability to MRCP at 0.55T. Both DL reconstructions demonstrated a remarkable reduction in average acquisition time from 599/542 to 255/180 seconds for MRCP at 3T/0.55T. In both retrospective and prospective undersampling scenarios, PSNR and SSIM of DL reconstructions were higher than those of PI and CS. At the same time, DL reconstructions preserved the image quality of undersampled data, including sharpness and the visibility of hepatobiliary ducts. In addition, both DL approaches produced high-quality reconstructions at 0.55T. In summary, DL reconstructions trained for highly accelerated MRCP enabled a reduction in acquisition time by a factor of 2.4/3.0 at 3T/0.55T while maintaining the image quality of conventional acquisition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachel Hong, William Agnew, Tadayoshi Kohno, Jamie Morgenstern</p>
<p>Abstract: As training datasets become increasingly drawn from unstructured, uncontrolled environments such as the web, researchers and industry practitioners have increasingly relied upon data filtering techniques to "filter out the noise" of web-scraped data. While datasets have been widely shown to reflect the biases and values of their creators, in this paper we contribute to an emerging body of research that assesses the filters used to create these datasets. We show that image-text data filtering also has biases and is value-laden, encoding specific notions of what is counted as "high-quality" data. In our work, we audit a standard approach of image-text CLIP-filtering on the academic benchmark DataComp's CommonPool by analyzing discrepancies of filtering through various annotation techniques across multiple modalities of image, text, and website source. We find that data relating to several imputed demographic groups -- such as LGBTQ+ people, older women, and younger men -- are associated with higher rates of exclusion. Moreover, we demonstrate cases of exclusion amplification: not only are certain marginalized groups already underrepresented in the unfiltered data, but CLIP-filtering excludes data from these groups at higher rates. The data-filtering step in the machine learning pipeline can therefore exacerbate representation disparities already present in the data-gathering step, especially when existing filters are designed to optimize a specifically-chosen downstream performance metric like zero-shot image classification accuracy. Finally, we show that the NSFW filter fails to remove sexually-explicit content from CommonPool, and that CLIP-filtering includes several categories of copyrighted content at high rates. Our conclusions point to a need for fundamental changes in dataset creation and filtering practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenghuan Sun, Alexander Schubert, Gregory M. Goldgof, Zhiqing Sun, Thomas Hartvigsen, Atul J. Butte, Ahmed Alaa</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLM) can support clinicians by analyzing medical images and engaging in natural language interactions to assist in diagnostic and treatment tasks. However, VLMs often exhibit "hallucinogenic" behavior, generating textual outputs not grounded in contextual multimodal information. This challenge is particularly pronounced in the medical domain, where we do not only require VLM outputs to be accurate in single interactions but also to be consistent with clinical reasoning and diagnostic pathways throughout multi-turn conversations. For this purpose, we propose a new alignment algorithm that uses symbolic representations of clinical reasoning to ground VLMs in medical knowledge. These representations are utilized to (i) generate GPT-4-guided visual instruction tuning data at scale, simulating clinician-VLM conversations with demonstrations of clinical reasoning, and (ii) create an automatic reward function that evaluates the clinical validity of VLM generations throughout clinician-VLM interactions. Our algorithm eliminates the need for human involvement in training data generation or reward model construction, reducing costs compared to standard reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We apply our alignment algorithm to develop Dr-LLaVA, a conversational VLM finetuned for analyzing bone marrow pathology slides, demonstrating strong performance in multi-turn medical conversations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for integration into daily life, making it crucial for them to incorporate human values when making decisions in real-world situations. This paper introduces VIVA, a benchmark for VIsion-grounded decision-making driven by human VAlues. While most large VLMs focus on physical-level skills, our work is the first to examine their multimodal capabilities in leveraging human values to make decisions under a vision-depicted situation. VIVA contains 1,240 images depicting diverse real-world situations and the manually annotated decisions grounded in them. Given an image there, the model should select the most appropriate action to address the situation and provide the relevant human values and reason underlying the decision. Extensive experiments based on VIVA show the limitation of VLMs in using human values to make multimodal decisions. Further analyses indicate the potential benefits of exploiting action consequences and predicted human values.</p>

<p>Abstract: Particle-based representations of radiance fields such as 3D Gaussian Splatting have found great success for reconstructing and re-rendering of complex scenes. Most existing methods render particles via rasterization, projecting them to screen space tiles for processing in a sorted order. This work instead considers ray tracing the particles, building a bounding volume hierarchy and casting a ray for each pixel using high-performance GPU ray tracing hardware. To efficiently handle large numbers of semi-transparent particles, we describe a specialized rendering algorithm which encapsulates particles with bounding meshes to leverage fast ray-triangle intersections, and shades batches of intersections in depth-order. The benefits of ray tracing are well-known in computer graphics: processing incoherent rays for secondary lighting effects such as shadows and reflections, rendering from highly-distorted cameras common in robotics, stochastically sampling rays, and more. With our renderer, this flexibility comes at little cost compared to rasterization. Experiments demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our approach, as well as several applications in computer graphics and vision. We further propose related improvements to the basic Gaussian representation, including a simple use of generalized kernel functions which significantly reduces particle hit counts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sourav Raxit, Simant Bahadur Singh, Abdullah Al Redwan Newaz</p>
<p>Abstract: By harnessing fiducial markers as visual landmarks in the environment, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can rapidly build precise maps and navigate spaces safely and efficiently, unlocking their potential for fluent collaboration and coexistence with humans. Existing fiducial marker methods rely on handcrafted feature extraction, which sacrifices accuracy. On the other hand, deep learning pipelines for marker detection fail to meet real-time runtime constraints crucial for navigation applications. In this work, we propose YoloTag -a real-time fiducial marker-based localization system. YoloTag uses a lightweight YOLO v8 object detector to accurately detect fiducial markers in images while meeting the runtime constraints needed for navigation. The detected markers are then used by an efficient perspective-n-point algorithm to estimate UAV states. However, this localization system introduces noise, causing instability in trajectory tracking. To suppress noise, we design a higher-order Butterworth filter that effectively eliminates noise through frequency domain analysis. We evaluate our algorithm through real-robot experiments in an indoor environment, comparing the trajectory tracking performance of our method against other approaches in terms of several distance metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emotion recognition is relevant in various domains, ranging from healthcare to human-computer interaction. Physiological signals, being beyond voluntary control, offer reliable information for this purpose, unlike speech and facial expressions which can be controlled at will. They reflect genuine emotional responses, devoid of conscious manipulation, thereby enhancing the credibility of emotion recognition systems. Nonetheless, multimodal emotion recognition with deep learning models remains a relatively unexplored field. In this paper, we introduce a fully hypercomplex network with a hierarchical learning structure to fully capture correlations. Specifically, at the encoder level, the model learns intra-modal relations among the different channels of each input signal. Then, a hypercomplex fusion module learns inter-modal relations among the embeddings of the different modalities. The main novelty is in exploiting intra-modal relations by endowing the encoders with parameterized hypercomplex convolutions (PHCs) that thanks to hypercomplex algebra can capture inter-channel interactions within single modalities. Instead, the fusion module comprises parameterized hypercomplex multiplications (PHMs) that can model inter-modal correlations. The proposed architecture surpasses state-of-the-art models on the MAHNOB-HCI dataset for emotion recognition, specifically in classifying valence and arousal from electroencephalograms (EEGs) and peripheral physiological signals.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng Xu, Bowen Hai, Yushun Tang, Zhihai He</p>
<p>Abstract: Learned Image Compression (LIC) models have achieved superior rate-distortion performance than traditional codecs. Existing LIC models use CNN, Transformer, or Mixed CNN-Transformer as basic blocks. However, limited by the shifted window attention, Swin-Transformer-based LIC exhibits a restricted growth of receptive fields, affecting the ability to model large objects for image compression. To address this issue and improve the performance, we incorporate window partition into channel attention for the first time to obtain large receptive fields and capture more global information. Since channel attention hinders local information learning, it is important to extend existing attention mechanisms in Transformer codecs to the space-channel attention to establish multiple receptive fields, being able to capture global correlations with large receptive fields while maintaining detailed characterization of local correlations with small receptive fields. We also incorporate the discrete wavelet transform into our Spatial-Channel Hybrid (SCH) framework for efficient frequency-dependent down-sampling and further enlarging receptive fields. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performances, reducing BD-rate by 18.54%, 23.98%, 22.33%, and 24.71% on four standard datasets compared to VTM-23.1.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kin Wai Lau, Yasar Abbas Ur Rehman, Pedro Porto Buarque de Gusm\~ao, Lai-Man Po, Lan Ma, Yuyang Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving method for training machine learning models in a distributed manner on edge devices. However, on-device models face inherent computational power and memory limitations, potentially resulting in constrained gradient updates. As the model's size increases, the frequency of gradient updates on edge devices decreases, ultimately leading to suboptimal training outcomes during any particular FL round. This limits the feasibility of deploying advanced and large-scale models on edge devices, hindering the potential for performance enhancements. To address this issue, we propose FedRepOpt, a gradient re-parameterized optimizer for FL. The gradient re-parameterized method allows training a simple local model with a similar performance as a complex model by modifying the optimizer's gradients according to a set of model-specific hyperparameters obtained from the complex models. In this work, we focus on VGG-style and Ghost-style models in the FL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models using FedRepOpt obtain a significant boost in performance of 16.7% and 11.4% compared to the RepGhost-style and RepVGG-style networks, while also demonstrating a faster convergence time of 11.7% and 57.4% compared to their complex structure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhao Chen, Xingjun Ma, Difan Zou, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: As diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are being employed as mainstream models for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), the study of their memorization of training data has attracted growing attention. Existing works in this direction aim to establish an understanding of whether or to what extent DPMs learn via memorization. Such an understanding is crucial for identifying potential risks of data leakage and copyright infringement in diffusion models and, more importantly, for trustworthy application of GenAI. Existing works revealed that conditional DPMs are more prone to training data memorization than unconditional DPMs, and the motivated data extraction methods are mostly for conditional DPMs. However, these understandings are primarily empirical, and extracting training data from unconditional models has been found to be extremely challenging. In this work, we provide a theoretical understanding of memorization in both conditional and unconditional DPMs under the assumption of model convergence. Our theoretical analysis indicates that extracting data from unconditional models can also be effective by constructing a proper surrogate condition. Based on this result, we propose a novel data extraction method named \textbf{Surrogate condItional Data Extraction (SIDE)} that leverages a time-dependent classifier trained on the generated data as a surrogate condition to extract training data from unconditional DPMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our SIDE can extract training data in challenging scenarios where previous methods fail, and it is, on average, over 50\% more effective across different scales of the CelebA dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: While laparoscopic liver resection is less prone to complications and maintains patient outcomes compared to traditional open surgery, its complexity hinders widespread adoption due to challenges in representing the liver's internal structure. Laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasound offers efficient, cost-effective and radiation-free guidance. Our objective is to aid physicians in identifying internal liver structures using laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasound. We propose a patient-specific approach using preoperative 3D ultrasound liver volume to train a deep learning model for real-time identification of portal tree and branch structures. Our personalized AI model, validated on ex vivo swine livers, achieved superior precision (0.95) and recall (0.93) compared to surgeons, laying groundwork for precise vessel identification in ultrasound-based liver resection. Its adaptability and potential clinical impact promise to advance surgical interventions and improve patient care.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengcheng Chen, Wenhao Li, Nicole Gunderson, Jeremy Ruthberg, Randall Bly, Waleed M. Abuzeid, Zhenglong Sun, Eric J. Seibel</p>
<p>Abstract: The 3D reconstruction of the surgical field in minimally invasive endoscopic surgery has posed a formidable challenge when using conventional monocular endoscopes. Existing 3D reconstruction methodologies are frequently encumbered by suboptimal accuracy and limited generalization capabilities. In this study, we introduce an innovative pipeline using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for 3D reconstruction. Our approach utilizes a preliminary NeRF reconstruction that yields a coarse model, then creates a binocular scene within the reconstructed environment, which derives an initial depth map via stereo vision. This initial depth map serves as depth supervision for subsequent NeRF iterations, progressively refining the 3D reconstruction with enhanced accuracy. The binocular depth is iteratively recalculated, with the refinement process continuing until the depth map converges, and exhibits negligible variations. Through this recursive process, high-fidelity depth maps are generated from monocular endoscopic video of a realistic cranial phantom. By repeated measures of the final 3D reconstruction compared to X-ray computed tomography, all differences of relevant clinical distances result in sub-millimeter accuracy.</p>
