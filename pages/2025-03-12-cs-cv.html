<p><b>Authors:</b> Lixue Gong, Xiaoxia Hou, Fanshi Li, Liang Li, Xiaochen Lian, Fei Liu, Liyang Liu, Wei Liu, Wei Lu, Yichun Shi, Shiqi Sun, Yu Tian, Zhi Tian, Peng Wang, Xun Wang, Ye Wang, Guofeng Wu, Jie Wu, Xin Xia, Xuefeng Xiao, Linjie Yang, Zhonghua Zhai, Xinyu Zhang, Qi Zhang, Yuwei Zhang, Shijia Zhao, Jianchao Yang, Weilin Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid advancement of diffusion models has catalyzed remarkable progress in the field of image generation. However, prevalent models such as Flux, SD3.5 and Midjourney, still grapple with issues like model bias, limited text rendering capabilities, and insufficient understanding of Chinese cultural nuances. To address these limitations, we present Seedream 2.0, a native Chinese-English bilingual image generation foundation model that excels across diverse dimensions, which adeptly manages text prompt in both Chinese and English, supporting bilingual image generation and text rendering. We develop a powerful data system that facilitates knowledge integration, and a caption system that balances the accuracy and richness for image description. Particularly, Seedream is integrated with a self-developed bilingual large language model as a text encoder, allowing it to learn native knowledge directly from massive data. This enable it to generate high-fidelity images with accurate cultural nuances and aesthetic expressions described in either Chinese or English. Beside, Glyph-Aligned ByT5 is applied for flexible character-level text rendering, while a Scaled ROPE generalizes well to untrained resolutions. Multi-phase post-training optimizations, including SFT and RLHF iterations, further improve the overall capability. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that Seedream 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple aspects, including prompt-following, aesthetics, text rendering, and structural correctness. Furthermore, Seedream 2.0 has been optimized through multiple RLHF iterations to closely align its output with human preferences, as revealed by its outstanding ELO score. In addition, it can be readily adapted to an instruction-based image editing model, such as SeedEdit, with strong editing capability that balances instruction-following and image consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cameron Smith, Basile Van Hoorick, Vitor Guizilini, Yue Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion serves as a powerful cue for scene perception and understanding by separating independently moving surfaces and organizing the physical world into distinct entities. We introduce SIRE, a self-supervised method for motion discovery of objects and dynamic scene reconstruction from casual scenes by learning intrinsic rigidity embeddings from videos. Our method trains an image encoder to estimate scene rigidity and geometry, supervised by a simple 4D reconstruction loss: a least-squares solver uses the estimated geometry and rigidity to lift 2D point track trajectories into SE(3) tracks, which are simply re-projected back to 2D and compared against the original 2D trajectories for supervision. Crucially, our framework is fully end-to-end differentiable and can be optimized either on video datasets to learn generalizable image priors, or even on a single video to capture scene-specific structure - highlighting strong data efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our rigidity embeddings and geometry across multiple settings, including downstream object segmentation, SE(3) rigid motion estimation, and self-supervised depth estimation. Our findings suggest that SIRE can learn strong geometry and motion rigidity priors from video data, with minimal supervision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Adlerstein, Jo\~ao Carlos Virgolino Soares, Angelo Bratta, Claudio Semini</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud registration is a critical problem in computer vision and robotics, especially in the field of navigation. Current methods often fail when faced with high outlier rates or take a long time to converge to a suitable solution. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm for point cloud registration called SANDRO (Splitting strategy for point cloud Alignment using Non-convex anD Robust Optimization), which combines an Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) framework with a robust loss function with graduated non-convexity. This approach is further enhanced by a splitting strategy designed to handle high outlier rates and skewed distributions of outliers. SANDRO is capable of addressing important limitations of existing methods, as in challenging scenarios where the presence of high outlier rates and point cloud symmetries significantly hinder convergence. SANDRO achieves superior performance in terms of success rate when compared to the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating a 20% improvement from the current state of the art when tested on the Redwood real dataset and 60% improvement when tested on synthetic data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yehyun Suh, J. Ryan Martin, Daniel Moyer</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for estimating the orientation and the position of acetabular hip implants in total hip arthroplasty using full anterior-posterior hip fluoroscopy images. Our method accounts for distortions induced in the fluoroscope geometry, estimating acetabular component pose by creating a forward model of the perspective projection and implementing differentiable ellipse fitting for the similarity of our estimation from the ground truth. This approach enables precise estimation of the implant's rotation (anteversion, inclination) and the translation under the fluoroscope induced deformation. Experimental results from both numerically simulated and digitally reconstructed radiograph environments demonstrate high accuracy with minimal computational demands, offering enhanced precision and applicability in clinical and surgical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Badhan Kumar Das, Ajay Singh, Saahil Islam, Gengyan Zhao, Andreas Maier</p>
<p>Abstract: The Transformer architecture has opened a new paradigm in the domain of deep learning with its ability to model long-range dependencies and capture global context and has outpaced the traditional Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) in many aspects. However, applying Transformer models to 3D medical image datasets presents significant challenges due to their high training time, and memory requirements, which not only hinder scalability but also contribute to elevated CO$_2$ footprint. This has led to an exploration of alternative models that can maintain or even improve performance while being more efficient and environmentally sustainable. Recent advancements in Structured State Space Models (SSMs) effectively address some of the inherent limitations of Transformers, particularly their high memory and computational demands. Inspired by these advancements, we propose an efficient 3D segmentation model for medical imaging called SegResMamba, designed to reduce computation complexity, memory usage, training time, and environmental impact while maintaining high performance. Our model uses less than half the memory during training compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) architectures, achieving comparable performance with significantly reduced resource demands.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yehyun Suh, J. Ryan Martin, Daniel Moyer</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an approach for improving 2D/3D pelvis registration in optimization-based pose estimators using a learned initialization function. Current methods often fail to converge to the optimal solution when initialized naively. We find that even a coarse initializer greatly improves pose estimator accuracy, and improves overall computational efficiency. This approach proves to be effective also in challenging cases under more extreme pose variation. Experimental validation demonstrates that our method consistently achieves robust and accurate registration, enhancing the reliability of 2D/3D registration for clinical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antoine Legouhy, Ross Callaghan, Nolah Mazet, Vivien Julienne, Hojjat Azadbakht, Hui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents NimbleReg, a light-weight deep-learning (DL) framework for diffeomorphic image registration leveraging surface representation of multiple segmented anatomical regions. Deep learning has revolutionized image registration but most methods typically rely on cumbersome gridded representations, leading to hardware-intensive models. Reliable fine-grained segmentations, that are now accessible at low cost, are often used to guide the alignment. Light-weight methods representing segmentations in terms of boundary surfaces have been proposed, but they lack mechanism to support the fusion of multiple regional mappings into an overall diffeomorphic transformation. Building on these advances, we propose a DL registration method capable of aligning surfaces from multiple segmented regions to generate an overall diffeomorphic transformation for the whole ambient space. The proposed model is light-weight thanks to a PointNet backbone. Diffeomoprhic properties are guaranteed by taking advantage of the stationary velocity field parametrization of diffeomorphisms. We demonstrate that this approach achieves alignment comparable to state-of-the-art DL-based registration techniques that consume images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liwei Che, Tony Qingze Liu, Jing Jia, Weiyi Qin, Ruixiang Tang, Vladimir Pavlovic</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their remarkable potential, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still face challenges with object hallucination, a problem where their generated outputs mistakenly incorporate objects that do not actually exist. Although most works focus on addressing this issue within the language-model backbone, our work shifts the focus to the image input source, investigating how specific image tokens contribute to hallucinations. Our analysis reveals a striking finding: a small subset of image tokens with high attention scores are the primary drivers of object hallucination. By removing these hallucinatory image tokens (only 1.5% of all image tokens), the issue can be effectively mitigated. This finding holds consistently across different models and datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce EAZY, a novel, training-free method that automatically identifies and Eliminates hAllucinations by Zeroing out hallucinatorY image tokens. We utilize EAZY for unsupervised object hallucination detection, achieving 15% improvement compared to previous methods. Additionally, EAZY demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations while preserving model utility and seamlessly adapting to various LVLM architectures.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07799">Self-supervised Normality Learning and Divergence Vector-guided Model Merging for Zero-shot Congenital Heart Disease Detection in Fetal Ultrasound Videos</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pramit Saha, Divyanshu Mishra, Netzahualcoyotl Hernandez-Cruz, Olga Patey, Aris Papageorghiou, Yuki M. Asano, J. Alison Noble</p>
<p>Abstract: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is one of the leading causes of fetal mortality, yet the scarcity of labeled CHD data and strict privacy regulations surrounding fetal ultrasound (US) imaging present significant challenges for the development of deep learning-based models for CHD detection. Centralised collection of large real-world datasets for rare conditions, such as CHD, from large populations requires significant co-ordination and resource. In addition, data governance rules increasingly prevent data sharing between sites. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, a novel privacy-preserving, zero-shot CHD detection framework that formulates CHD detection as a normality modeling problem integrated with model merging. In our framework dubbed Sparse Tube Ultrasound Distillation (STUD), each hospital site first trains a sparse video tube-based self-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) model on normal fetal heart US clips with self-distillation loss. This enables site-specific models to independently learn the distribution of healthy cases. To aggregate knowledge across the decentralized models while maintaining privacy, we propose a Divergence Vector-Guided Model Merging approach, DivMerge, that combines site-specific models into a single VAD model without data exchange. Our approach preserves domain-agnostic rich spatio-temporal representations, ensuring generalization to unseen CHD cases. We evaluated our approach on real-world fetal US data collected from 5 hospital sites. Our merged model outperformed site-specific models by 23.77% and 30.13% in accuracy and F1-score respectively on external test sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elvis Kimara, Mozhgan Hadadi, Jackson Godbersen, Aditya Balu, Talukder Jubery, Yawei Li, Adarsh Krishnamurthy, Patrick S. Schnable, Baskar Ganapathysubramanian</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in three-dimensional (3D) agricultural research, particularly for maize, has been limited by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets. While 2D image datasets are abundant, they fail to capture essential structural details such as leaf architecture, plant volume, and spatial arrangements that 3D data provide. To address this limitation, we present AgriField3D (https://baskargroup.github.io/AgriField3D/), a curated dataset of 3D point clouds of field-grown maize plants from a diverse genetic panel, designed to be AI-ready for advancing agricultural research. Our dataset comprises over 1,000 high-quality point clouds collected using a Terrestrial Laser Scanner, complemented by procedural models that provide structured, parametric representations of maize plants. These procedural models, generated using Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) and optimized via a two-step process combining Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and differentiable programming, enable precise, scalable reconstructions of leaf surfaces and plant architectures. To enhance usability, we performed graph-based segmentation to isolate individual leaves and stalks, ensuring consistent labeling across all samples. We also conducted rigorous manual quality control on all datasets, correcting errors in segmentation, ensuring accurate leaf ordering, and validating metadata annotations. The dataset further includes metadata detailing plant morphology and quality, alongside multi-resolution subsampled versions (100k, 50k, 10k points) optimized for various computational needs. By integrating point cloud data of field grown plants with high-fidelity procedural models and ensuring meticulous manual validation, AgriField3D provides a comprehensive foundation for AI-driven phenotyping, plant structural analysis, and 3D applications in agricultural research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joey Wilson, Marcelino Almeida, Sachit Mahajan, Martin Labrie, Maani Ghaffari, Omid Ghasemalizadeh, Min Sun, Cheng-Hao Kuo, Arnab Sen</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for quantifying uncertainty and information gained within 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) through P-Optimality. While 3D-GS has proven to be a useful world model with high-quality rasterizations, it does not natively quantify uncertainty. Quantifying uncertainty in parameters of 3D-GS is necessary to understand the information gained from acquiring new images as in active perception, or identify redundant images which can be removed from memory due to resource constraints in online 3D-GS SLAM. We propose to quantify uncertainty and information gain in 3D-GS by reformulating the problem through the lens of optimal experimental design, which is a classical solution to measuring information gain. By restructuring information quantification of 3D-GS through optimal experimental design, we arrive at multiple solutions, of which T-Optimality and D-Optimality perform the best quantitatively and qualitatively as measured on two popular datasets. Additionally, we propose a block diagonal approximation of the 3D-GS uncertainty, which provides a measure of correlation for computing more accurate information gain, at the expense of a greater computation cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrei Chubarau, Yinan Wang, James J. Clark</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Neural Radiance and Gaze Fields (NeRGs) as a novel approach for representing visual attention patterns in 3D scenes. Our system renders a 2D view of a 3D scene with a pre-trained Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and visualizes the gaze field for arbitrary observer positions, which may be decoupled from the render camera perspective. We achieve this by augmenting a standard NeRF with an additional neural network that models the gaze probability distribution. The output of a NeRG is a rendered image of the scene viewed from the camera perspective and a pixel-wise salience map representing conditional probability that an observer fixates on a given surface within the 3D scene as visible in the rendered image. Much like how NeRFs perform novel view synthesis, NeRGs enable the reconstruction of gaze patterns from arbitrary perspectives within complex 3D scenes. To ensure consistent gaze reconstructions, we constrain gaze prediction on the 3D structure of the scene and model gaze occlusion due to intervening surfaces when the observer's viewpoint is decoupled from the rendering camera. For training, we leverage ground truth head pose data from skeleton tracking data or predictions from 2D salience models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NeRGs in a real-world convenience store setting, where head pose tracking data is available.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07829">Fixing the RANSAC Stopping Criterion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes Sch\"onberger, Viktor Larsson, Marc Pollefeys</p>
<p>Abstract: For several decades, RANSAC has been one of the most commonly used robust estimation algorithms for many problems in computer vision and related fields. The main contribution of this paper lies in addressing a long-standing error baked into virtually any system building upon the RANSAC algorithm. Since its inception in 1981 by Fischler and Bolles, many variants of RANSAC have been proposed on top of the same original idea relying on the fact that random sampling has a high likelihood of generating a good hypothesis from minimal subsets of measurements. An approximation to the sampling probability was originally derived by the paper in 1981 in support of adaptively stopping RANSAC and is, as such, used in the vast majority of today's RANSAC variants and implementations. The impact of this approximation has since not been questioned or thoroughly studied by any of the later works. As we theoretically derive and practically demonstrate in this paper, the approximation leads to severe undersampling and thus failure to find good models. The discrepancy is especially pronounced in challenging scenarios with few inliers and high model complexity. An implementation of computing the exact probability is surprisingly simple yet highly effective and has potentially drastic impact across a large range of computer vision systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Depanshu Sani, Saket Anand</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchy-aware representations ensure that the semantically closer classes are mapped closer in the feature space, thereby reducing the severity of mistakes while enabling consistent coarse-level class predictions. Towards this end, we propose a novel framework, Hierarchical Composition of Orthogonal Subspaces (Hier-COS), which learns to map deep feature embeddings into a vector space that is, by design, consistent with the structure of a given taxonomy tree. Our approach augments neural network backbones with a simple transformation module that maps learned discriminative features to subspaces defined using a fixed orthogonal frame. This construction naturally improves the severity of mistakes and promotes hierarchical consistency. Furthermore, we highlight the fundamental limitations of existing hierarchical evaluation metrics popularly used by the vision community and introduce a preference-based metric, Hierarchically Ordered Preference Score (HOPS), to overcome these limitations. We benchmark our method on multiple large and challenging datasets having deep label hierarchies (ranging from 3 - 12 levels) and compare with several baselines and SOTA. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Hier-COS achieves state-of-the-art hierarchical performance across all the datasets while simultaneously beating top-1 accuracy in all but one case. We also demonstrate the performance of a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone and show that learning a transformation module alone can map the learned features from a pre-trained ViT to Hier-COS and yield substantial performance benefits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Zhu, Yuxuan Jiang, Shuyuan Zhu, Fan Zhang, David Bull, Bing Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Blind video super-resolution (BVSR) is a low-level vision task which aims to generate high-resolution videos from low-resolution counterparts in unknown degradation scenarios. Existing approaches typically predict blur kernels that are spatially invariant in each video frame or even the entire video. These methods do not consider potential spatio-temporal varying degradations in videos, resulting in suboptimal BVSR performance. In this context, we propose a novel BVSR model based on Implicit Kernels, BVSR-IK, which constructs a multi-scale kernel dictionary parameterized by implicit neural representations. It also employs a newly designed recurrent Transformer to predict the coefficient weights for accurate filtering in both frame correction and feature alignment. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed BVSR-IK, when compared with four state-of-the-art BVSR models on three commonly used datasets, with BVSR-IK outperforming the second best approach, FMA-Net, by up to 0.59 dB in PSNR.

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Burgess, Xiaohan Wang, Yuhui Zhang, Anita Rau, Alejandro Lozano, Lisa Dunlap, Trevor Darrell, Serena Yeung-Levy</p>
<p>Abstract: How do two individuals differ when performing the same action? In this work, we introduce Video Action Differencing (VidDiff), the novel task of identifying subtle differences between videos of the same action, which has many applications, such as coaching and skill learning. To enable development on this new task, we first create VidDiffBench, a benchmark dataset containing 549 video pairs, with human annotations of 4,469 fine-grained action differences and 2,075 localization timestamps indicating where these differences occur. Our experiments demonstrate that VidDiffBench poses a significant challenge for state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs), such as GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. By analyzing failure cases of LMMs on VidDiffBench, we highlight two key challenges for this task: localizing relevant sub-actions over two videos and fine-grained frame comparison. To overcome these, we propose the VidDiff method, an agentic workflow that breaks the task into three stages: action difference proposal, keyframe localization, and frame differencing, each stage utilizing specialized foundation models. To encourage future research in this new task, we release the benchmark at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jmhb/VidDiffBench and code at http://jmhb0.github.io/viddiff.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Zhang, Yihao Luo, Yinzhe Wu, Choon Hwai Yap, Guang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate cardiac mesh reconstruction from volumetric data is essential for personalized cardiac modeling and clinical analysis. However, existing deformation-based approaches are prone to topological inconsistencies, particularly membrane penetration, which undermines the anatomical plausibility of the reconstructed mesh. To address this issue, we introduce Topology-Preserving Mesh Loss (TPM Loss), a novel loss function that explicitly enforces topological constraints during mesh deformation. By identifying topology-violating points, TPM Loss ensures spatially consistent reconstructions. Extensive experiments on CT and MRI datasets show that TPM Loss reduces topology violations by up to 93.1% while maintaining high segmentation accuracy (DSC: 89.1%-92.9%) and improving mesh fidelity (Chamfer Distance reduction up to 0.26 mm). These results demonstrate that TPM Loss effectively prevents membrane penetration and significantly improves cardiac mesh quality, enabling more accurate and anatomically consistent cardiac reconstructions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Nair, Bhanu Tokas, Hannah Kerner</p>
<p>Abstract: When we train models on biased ML datasets, they not only learn these biases but can inflate them at test time - a phenomenon called bias amplification. To measure bias amplification in ML datasets, many co-occurrence-based metrics have been proposed. Co-occurrence-based metrics are effective in measuring bias amplification in simple problems like image classification. However, these metrics are ineffective for complex problems like image captioning as they cannot capture the semantics of a caption. To measure bias amplification in captions, prior work introduced a predictability-based metric called Leakage in Captioning (LIC). While LIC captures the semantics and context of captions, it has limitations. LIC cannot identify the direction in which bias is amplified, poorly estimates dataset bias due to a weak vocabulary substitution strategy, and is highly sensitive to attacker models (a hyperparameter in predictability-based metrics). To overcome these issues, we propose Directional Predictability Amplification in Captioning (DPAC). DPAC measures directional bias amplification in captions, provides a better estimate of dataset bias using an improved substitution strategy, and is less sensitive to attacker models. Our experiments on the COCO captioning dataset show how DPAC is the most reliable metric to measure bias amplification in captions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuru Jia, Valerio Marsocci, Ziyang Gong, Xue Yang, Maarten Vergauwen, Andrea Nascetti</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized representation learning in Remote Sensing (RS), advancing Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) to leverage vast unlabeled satellite imagery for diverse downstream tasks. Currently, GFMs primarily focus on discriminative objectives, such as contrastive learning or masked image modeling, owing to their proven success in learning transferable representations. However, generative diffusion models--which demonstrate the potential to capture multi-grained semantics essential for RS tasks during image generation--remain underexplored for discriminative applications. This prompts the question: can generative diffusion models also excel and serve as GFMs with sufficient discriminative power? In this work, we answer this question with SatDiFuser, a framework that transforms a diffusion-based generative geospatial foundation model into a powerful pretraining tool for discriminative RS. By systematically analyzing multi-stage, noise-dependent diffusion features, we develop three fusion strategies to effectively leverage these diverse representations. Extensive experiments on remote sensing benchmarks show that SatDiFuser outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs, achieving gains of up to +5.7% mIoU in semantic segmentation and +7.9% F1-score in classification, demonstrating the capacity of diffusion-based generative foundation models to rival or exceed discriminative GFMs. Code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinghao Ye, Xianhan Zeng, Fu Li, Chunyuan Li, Haoqi Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Image captioning has long been a pivotal task in visual understanding, with recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) significantly enhancing the ability to generate detailed image captions. However, the evaluation of detailed image captioning remains underexplored due to outdated evaluation metrics and coarse annotations. In this paper, we introduce DeCapBench along with a novel metric, DCScore, specifically designed for detailed captioning tasks. DCScore evaluates hallucinations and fine-grained comprehensiveness by deconstructing responses into the smallest self-sufficient units, termed primitive information units, and assessing them individually. Our evaluation shows that DCScore aligns more closely with human judgment than other rule-based or model-based metrics. Concurrently, DeCapBench exhibits a high correlation with VLM arena results on descriptive tasks, surpassing existing benchmarks for vision-language models. Additionally, we present an automatic fine-grained feedback collection method, FeedQuill, for preference optimization based on our advanced metric, showing robust generalization capabilities across auto-generated preference data. Extensive experiments on multiple VLMs demonstrate that our method not only significantly reduces hallucinations but also enhances performance across various benchmarks, achieving superior detail captioning performance while surpassing GPT-4o.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dennis Rotondi, Fabio Scaparro, Hermann Blum, Kai O. Arras</p>
<p>Abstract: The concept of 3D scene graphs is increasingly recognized as a powerful semantic and hierarchical representation of the environment. Current approaches often address this at a coarse, object-level resolution. In contrast, our goal is to develop a representation that enables robots to directly interact with their environment by identifying both the location of functional interactive elements and how these can be used. To achieve this, we focus on detecting and storing objects at a finer resolution, focusing on affordance-relevant parts. The primary challenge lies in the scarcity of data that extends beyond instance-level detection and the inherent difficulty of capturing detailed object features using robotic sensors. We leverage currently available 3D resources to generate 2D data and train a detector, which is then used to augment the standard 3D scene graph generation pipeline. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves functional element segmentation comparable to state-of-the-art 3D models and that our augmentation enables task-driven affordance grounding with higher accuracy than the current solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Southeast Asia (SEA) is a region of extraordinary linguistic and cultural diversity, yet it remains significantly underrepresented in vision-language (VL) research. This often results in artificial intelligence (AI) models that fail to capture SEA cultural nuances. To fill this gap, we present SEA-VL, an open-source initiative dedicated to developing high-quality, culturally relevant data for SEA languages. By involving contributors from SEA countries, SEA-VL aims to ensure better cultural relevance and diversity, fostering greater inclusivity of underrepresented languages in VL research. Beyond crowdsourcing, our initiative goes one step further in the exploration of the automatic collection of culturally relevant images through crawling and image generation. First, we find that image crawling achieves approximately ~85% cultural relevance while being more cost- and time-efficient than crowdsourcing. Second, despite the substantial progress in generative vision models, synthetic images remain unreliable in accurately reflecting SEA cultures. The generated images often fail to reflect the nuanced traditions and cultural contexts of the region. Collectively, we gather 1.28M SEA culturally-relevant images, more than 50 times larger than other existing datasets. Through SEA-VL, we aim to bridge the representation gap in SEA, fostering the development of more inclusive AI systems that authentically represent diverse cultures across SEA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Lymph node (LN) assessment is an essential task in the routine radiology workflow, providing valuable insights for cancer staging, treatment planning and beyond. Identifying scatteredly-distributed and low-contrast LNs in 3D CT scans is highly challenging, even for experienced clinicians. Previous lesion and LN detection methods demonstrate effectiveness of 2.5D approaches (i.e, using 2D network with multi-slice inputs), leveraging pretrained 2D model weights and showing improved accuracy as compared to separate 2D or 3D detectors. However, slice-based 2.5D detectors do not explicitly model inter-slice consistency for LN as a 3D object, requiring heuristic post-merging steps to generate final 3D LN instances, which can involve tuning a set of parameters for each dataset. In this work, we formulate 3D LN detection as a tracking task and propose LN-Tracker, a novel LN tracking transformer, for joint end-to-end detection and 3D instance association. Built upon DETR-based detector, LN-Tracker decouples transformer decoder's query into the track and detection groups, where the track query autoregressively follows previously tracked LN instances along the z-axis of a CT scan. We design a new transformer decoder with masked attention module to align track query's content to the context of current slice, meanwhile preserving detection query's high accuracy in current slice. An inter-slice similarity loss is introduced to encourage cohesive LN association between slices. Extensive evaluation on four lymph node datasets shows LN-Tracker's superior performance, with at least 2.7% gain in average sensitivity when compared to other top 3D/2.5D detectors. Further validation on public lung nodule and prostate tumor detection tasks confirms the generalizability of LN-Tracker as it achieves top performance on both tasks. Datasets will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07939">STRMs: Spatial Temporal Reasoning Models for Vision-Based Localization Rivaling GPS Precision</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hin Wai Lui, Jeffrey L. Krichmar</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores vision-based localization through a biologically-inspired approach that mirrors how humans and animals link views or perspectives when navigating their world. We introduce two sequential generative models, VAE-RNN and VAE-Transformer, which transform first-person perspective (FPP) observations into global map perspective (GMP) representations and precise geographical coordinates. Unlike retrieval-based methods, our approach frames localization as a generative task, learning direct mappings between perspectives without relying on dense satellite image databases. We evaluate these models across two real-world environments: a university campus navigated by a Jackal robot and an urban downtown area navigated by a Tesla sedan. The VAE-Transformer achieves impressive precision, with median deviations of 2.29m (1.37% of environment size) and 4.45m (0.35% of environment size) respectively, outperforming both VAE-RNN and prior cross-view geo-localization approaches. Our comprehensive Localization Performance Characteristics (LPC) analysis demonstrates superior performance with the VAE-Transformer achieving an AUC of 0.777 compared to 0.295 for VIGOR 200 and 0.225 for TransGeo, establishing a new state-of-the-art in vision-based localization. In some scenarios, our vision-based system rivals commercial smartphone GPS accuracy (AUC of 0.797) while requiring 5x less GPU memory and delivering 3x faster inference than existing methods in cross-view geo-localization. These results demonstrate that models inspired by biological spatial navigation can effectively memorize complex, dynamic environments and provide precise localization with minimal computational resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minkyun Seo, Hyungtae Lim, Kanghee Lee, Luca Carlone, Jaesik Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning-based point cloud registration have improved generalization, yet most methods still require retraining or manual parameter tuning for each new environment. In this paper, we identify three key factors limiting generalization: (a) reliance on environment-specific voxel size and search radius, (b) poor out-of-domain robustness of learning-based keypoint detectors, and (c) raw coordinate usage, which exacerbates scale discrepancies. To address these issues, we present a zero-shot registration pipeline called BUFFER-X by (a) adaptively determining voxel size/search radii, (b) using farthest point sampling to bypass learned detectors, and (c) leveraging patch-wise scale normalization for consistent coordinate bounds. In particular, we present a multi-scale patch-based descriptor generation and a hierarchical inlier search across scales to improve robustness in diverse scenes. We also propose a novel generalizability benchmark using 11 datasets that cover various indoor/outdoor scenarios and sensor modalities, demonstrating that BUFFER-X achieves substantial generalization without prior information or manual parameter tuning for the test datasets.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a new method for anomaly detection in automated systems with time and compute sensitive requirements, such as autonomous driving, with unparalleled efficiency. As systems like autonomous driving become increasingly popular, ensuring their safety has become more important than ever. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to quickly and effectively detect various anomalies in the aforementioned systems, with the goal of making them safer and more effective. Many detection systems have been developed with great success under spatial contexts; however, there is still significant room for improvement when it comes to temporal context. While there is substantial work regarding this task, there is minimal work done regarding the efficiency of models and their ability to be applied to scenarios that require real-time inference, i.e., autonomous driving where anomalies need to be detected the moment they are within view. To address this gap, we propose STEAD (Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection), whose backbone is developed using (2+1)D Convolutions and Performer Linear Attention, which ensures computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. When tested on the UCF-Crime benchmark, our base model achieves an AUC of 91.34%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art, and our fast version achieves an AUC of 88.87%, while having 99.70% less parameters and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art as well.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis enhances conventional sentiment analysis, which traditionally relies solely on text, by incorporating information from different modalities such as images, text, and audio. This paper proposes a novel multimodal sentiment analysis architecture that integrates text and image data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of sentiments. For text feature extraction, we utilize BERT, a natural language processing model. For image feature extraction, we employ DINOv2, a vision-transformer-based model. The textual and visual latent features are integrated using proposed fusion techniques, namely the Basic Fusion Model, Self Attention Fusion Model, and Dual Attention Fusion Model. Experiments on three datasets, Memotion 7k dataset, MVSA single dataset, and MVSA multi dataset, demonstrate the viability and practicality of the proposed multimodal architecture.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-time rendering of dynamic scenes with view-dependent effects remains a fundamental challenge in computer graphics. While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have shown promising results separately handling dynamic scenes (4DGS) and view-dependent effects (6DGS), no existing method unifies these capabilities while maintaining real-time performance. We present 7D Gaussian Splatting (7DGS), a unified framework representing scene elements as seven-dimensional Gaussians spanning position (3D), time (1D), and viewing direction (3D). Our key contribution is an efficient conditional slicing mechanism that transforms 7D Gaussians into view- and time-conditioned 3D Gaussians, maintaining compatibility with existing 3D Gaussian Splatting pipelines while enabling joint optimization. Experiments demonstrate that 7DGS outperforms prior methods by up to 7.36 dB in PSNR while achieving real-time rendering (401 FPS) on challenging dynamic scenes with complex view-dependent effects.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Deng, Zhengyu Chen, Ziheng Xu, Chenglong Li, Jin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of traditional text-image person retrieval task is easily affected by lighting variations due to imaging limitations of visible spectrum sensors. In this work, we design a novel task called text-RGBT person retrieval that integrates complementary benefits from thermal and visible modalities for robust person retrieval in challenging environments. Aligning text and multi-modal visual representations is the key issue in text-RGBT person retrieval, but the heterogeneity between visible and thermal modalities may interfere with the alignment of visual and text modalities. To handle this problem, we propose a Multi-level Global-local cross-modal Alignment Network (MGANet), which sufficiently mines the relationships between modality-specific and modality-collaborative visual with the text, for text-RGBT person retrieval. To promote the research and development of this field, we create a high-quality text-RGBT person retrieval dataset, RGBT-PEDES. RGBT-PEDES contains 1,822 identities from different age groups and genders with 4,723 pairs of calibrated RGB and thermal images, and covers high-diverse scenes from both daytime and nighttime with a various of challenges such as occlusion, weak alignment and adverse lighting conditions. Additionally, we carefully annotate 7,987 fine-grained textual descriptions for all RGBT person image pairs. Extensive experiments on RGBT-PEDES demonstrate that our method outperforms existing text-image person retrieval methods. The code and dataset will be released upon the acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanyu Zhang, Dongming Wang, Jie Xu, Mengyuan Liu, Pengxiang Zhu, Wei Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: A prior map serves as a foundational reference for localization in context-aware applications such as augmented reality (AR). Providing valuable contextual information about the environment, the prior map is a vital tool for mitigating drift. In this paper, we propose a map-based visual-inertial localization algorithm (NeRF-VIO) with initialization using neural radiance fields (NeRF). Our algorithm utilizes a multilayer perceptron model and redefines the loss function as the geodesic distance on \(SE(3)\), ensuring the invariance of the initialization model under a frame change within \(\mathfrak{se}(3)\). The evaluation demonstrates that our model outperforms existing NeRF-based initialization solution in both accuracy and efficiency. By integrating a two-stage update mechanism within a multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) framework, the state of NeRF-VIO is constrained by both captured images from an onboard camera and rendered images from a pre-trained NeRF model. The proposed algorithm is validated using a real-world AR dataset, the results indicate that our two-stage update pipeline outperforms MSCKF across all data sequences.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the critical problem of representation similarity evolution during cross-domain transfer learning, with particular focus on understanding why pre-trained models maintain effectiveness when adapted to medical imaging tasks despite significant domain gaps. The study establishes a rigorous problem definition centered on quantifying and analyzing representation similarity trajectories throughout the fine-tuning process, while carefully delineating the scope to encompass both medical image analysis and broader cross-domain adaptation scenarios. Our empirical findings reveal three critical discoveries: the potential existence of high-performance models that preserve both task accuracy and representation similarity to their pre-trained origins; a robust linear correlation between layer-wise similarity metrics and representation quality indicators; and distinct adaptation patterns that differentiate supervised versus self-supervised pre-training paradigms. The proposed similarity space framework not only provides mechanistic insights into knowledge transfer dynamics but also raises fundamental questions about optimal utilization of pre-trained models. These results advance our understanding of neural network adaptation processes while offering practical implications for transfer learning strategies that extend beyond medical imaging applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Liu, Feng Qiu, Wei Zhang, Lincheng Li, Dadong Wang, Xin Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advent of deep learning, expression recognition has made significant advancements. However, due to the limited availability of annotated compound expression datasets and the subtle variations of compound expressions, Compound Emotion Recognition (CE) still holds considerable potential for exploration. To advance this task, the 7th Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) competition introduces the Compound Expression Challenge based on C-EXPR-DB, a limited dataset without labels. In this paper, we present a curriculum learning-based framework that initially trains the model on single-expression tasks and subsequently incorporates multi-expression data. This design ensures that our model first masters the fundamental features of basic expressions before being exposed to the complexities of compound emotions. Specifically, our designs can be summarized as follows: 1) Single-Expression Pre-training: The model is first trained on datasets containing single expressions to learn the foundational facial features associated with basic emotions. 2) Dynamic Compound Expression Generation: Given the scarcity of annotated compound expression datasets, we employ CutMix and Mixup techniques on the original single-expression images to create hybrid images exhibiting characteristics of multiple basic emotions. 3) Incremental Multi-Expression Integration: After performing well on single-expression tasks, the model is progressively exposed to multi-expression data, allowing the model to adapt to the complexity and variability of compound expressions.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07979">Achieving More with Less: Additive Prompt Tuning for Rehearsal-Free Class-Incremental Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Chen, Ping Wang, Zihan Zhou, Xu Zhang, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes progressively while preserving knowledge of previously learned ones. Recent advances in this field have shifted towards parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, with many approaches building upon the framework that maintains a pool of learnable prompts. Although effective, these methods introduce substantial computational overhead, primarily due to prompt pool querying and increased input sequence lengths from prompt concatenation. In this work, we present a novel prompt-based approach that addresses this limitation. Our method trains a single set of shared prompts across all tasks and, rather than concatenating prompts to the input, directly modifies the CLS token's attention computation by adding the prompts to it. This simple and lightweight design not only significantly reduces computational complexity-both in terms of inference costs and the number of trainable parameters-but also eliminates the need to optimize prompt lengths for different downstream tasks, offering a more efficient yet powerful solution for rehearsal-free class-incremental learning. Extensive experiments across a diverse range of CIL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential to establish a new prompt-based CIL paradigm. Furthermore, experiments on general recognition benchmarks beyond the CIL setting also show strong performance, positioning our method as a promising candidate for a general parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07982">DiffEGG: Diffusion-Driven Edge Generation as a Pixel-Annotation-Free Alternative for Instance Annotation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanghyun Jo, Ziseok Lee, Wooyeol Lee, Kyungsu Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving precise panoptic segmentation relies on pixel-wise instance annotations, but obtaining such datasets is costly. Unsupervised instance segmentation (UIS) eliminates annotation requirements but struggles with adjacent instance merging and single-instance fragmentation, largely due to the limitations of DINO-based backbones which lack strong instance separation cues. Weakly-supervised panoptic segmentation (WPS) reduces annotation costs using sparse labels (e.g., points, boxes), yet these annotations remain expensive and introduce human bias and boundary errors. To address these challenges, we propose DiffEGG (Diffusion-Driven EdGe Generation), a fully annotation-free method that extracts instance-aware features from pretrained diffusion models to generate precise instance edge maps. Unlike DINO-based UIS methods, diffusion models inherently capture fine-grained, instance-aware features, enabling more precise boundary delineation. For WPS, DiffEGG eliminates annotation costs and human bias by operating without any form of manual supervision, addressing the key limitations of prior best methods. Additionally, we introduce RIP, a post-processing technique that fuses DiffEGG's edge maps with segmentation masks in a task-agnostic manner. RIP allows DiffEGG to be seamlessly integrated into various segmentation frameworks. When applied to UIS, DiffEGG and RIP achieve an average $+4.4\text{ AP}$ improvement over prior best UIS methods. When combined with weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSS), DiffEGG enables WPS without instance annotations, outperforming prior best point-supervised WPS methods by $+1.7\text{ PQ}$. These results demonstrate that DiffEGG's edge maps serve as a cost-effective, annotation-free alternative to instance annotations, significantly improving segmentation without human intervention.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hangyang Kong, Wenbo Zhou, Xuxiang He, Xiaotong Tu, Xinghao Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Huge amount of data is the key of the success of deep learning, however, redundant information impairs the generalization ability of the model and increases the burden of calculation. Dataset Distillation (DD) compresses the original dataset into a smaller but representative subset for high-quality data and efficient training strategies. Existing works for DD generate synthetic images by treating each image as an independent entity, thereby overlooking the common features among data. This paper proposes a dataset distillation method based on Matching Training Trajectories with Low-rank Space Sampling(MTT-LSS), which uses low-rank approximations to capture multiple low-dimensional manifold subspaces of the original data. The synthetic data is represented by basis vectors and shared dimension mappers from these subspaces, reducing the cost of generating individual data points while effectively minimizing information redundancy. The proposed method is tested on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets, and outperforms the baseline methods by an average of 9.9%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Wu, Xibin Song, Senbo Wang, Weizhe Liu, Jiayu Yang, Ziang Cheng, Shenzhou Chen, Taizhang Shang, Weixuan Sun, Shan Luo, Pan Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D object reconstruction from single-view image is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications. Recent advancements in Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) have shown great promise in leveraging multi-view images generated by 2D diffusion models to extract 3D content. However, challenges remain as 2D diffusion models often struggle to produce dense images with strong multi-view consistency, and LRMs tend to amplify these inconsistencies during the 3D reconstruction process. Addressing these issues is critical for achieving high-quality and efficient 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we present CDI3D, a feed-forward framework designed for efficient, high-quality image-to-3D generation with view interpolation. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose to integrate 2D diffusion-based view interpolation into the LRM pipeline to enhance the quality and consistency of the generated mesh. Specifically, our approach introduces a Dense View Interpolation (DVI) module, which synthesizes interpolated images between main views generated by the 2D diffusion model, effectively densifying the input views with better multi-view consistency. We also design a tilt camera pose trajectory to capture views with different elevations and perspectives. Subsequently, we employ a tri-plane-based mesh reconstruction strategy to extract robust tokens from these interpolated and original views, enabling the generation of high-quality 3D meshes with superior texture and geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches across various benchmarks, producing 3D content with enhanced texture fidelity and geometric accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a transformative technology that leverages ubiquitous wireless signals to enable a variety of applications ranging from activity and gesture recognition to indoor localization and health monitoring. However, the inherent dependency of Wi-Fi signals on environmental conditions introduces significant generalization challenges,variations in surroundings, human positions, and orientations often lead to inconsistent signal features, impeding robust action recognition. In this survey, we review over 200 studies on Wi-Fi sensing generalization, categorizing them along the entire sensing pipeline: device deployment, signal processing, feature learning, and model deployment. We systematically analyze state-of-the-art techniques, which are employed to mitigate the adverse effects of environmental variability. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive overview of open-source datasets such as Widar3.0, XRF55, and XRFv2, highlighting their unique characteristics and applicability for multimodal fusion and cross-modal tasks. Finally, we discuss emerging research directions, such as multimodal approaches and the integration of large language models,to inspire future advancements in this rapidly evolving field. Our survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, offering insights into current methodologies, available datasets, and promising avenues for further investigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Yi Lu, Md Mehrab Tanjim, Ishita Dasgupta, Somdeb Sarkhel, Gang Wu, Saayan Mitra, Somali Chaterji</p>
<p>Abstract: We present SKALD, a multi-shot video assembly method that constructs coherent video sequences from candidate shots with minimal reliance on text. Central to our approach is the Learned Clip Assembly (LCA) score, a learning-based metric that measures temporal and semantic relationships between shots to quantify narrative coherence. We tackle the exponential complexity of combining multiple shots with an efficient beam-search algorithm guided by the LCA score. To train our model effectively with limited human annotations, we propose two tasks for the LCA encoder: Shot Coherence Learning, which uses contrastive learning to distinguish coherent and incoherent sequences, and Feature Regression, which converts these learned representations into a real-valued coherence score. We develop two variants: a base SKALD model that relies solely on visual coherence and SKALD-text, which integrates auxiliary text information when available. Experiments on the VSPD and our curated MSV3C datasets show that SKALD achieves an improvement of up to 48.6% in IoU and a 43% speedup over the state-of-the-art methods. A user study further validates our approach, with 45% of participants favoring SKALD-assembled videos, compared to 22% preferring text-based assembly methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jordan Vice, Naveed Akhtar, Richard Hartley, Ajmal Mian</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate bias trends in text-to-image generative models over time, focusing on the increasing availability of models through open platforms like Hugging Face. While these platforms democratize AI, they also facilitate the spread of inherently biased models, often shaped by task-specific fine-tuning. Ensuring ethical and transparent AI deployment requires robust evaluation frameworks and quantifiable bias metrics. To this end, we assess bias across three key dimensions: (i) distribution bias, (ii) generative hallucination, and (iii) generative miss-rate. Analyzing over 100 models, we reveal how bias patterns evolve over time and across generative tasks. Our findings indicate that artistic and style-transferred models exhibit significant bias, whereas foundation models, benefiting from broader training distributions, are becoming progressively less biased. By identifying these systemic trends, we contribute a large-scale evaluation corpus to inform bias research and mitigation strategies, fostering more responsible AI development.

<p>Abstract: Predicting pedestrian trajectories is essential for autonomous driving systems, as it significantly enhances safety and supports informed decision-making. Accurate predictions enable the prevention of collisions, anticipation of crossing intent, and improved overall system efficiency. In this study, we present SGNetPose+, an enhancement of the SGNet architecture designed to integrate skeleton information or body segment angles with bounding boxes to predict pedestrian trajectories from video data to avoid hazards in autonomous driving. Skeleton information was extracted using a pose estimation model, and joint angles were computed based on the extracted joint data.

Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the JAAD and PIE datasets using pose data with the bounding boxes, outperforming the SGNet model. Code is available on Github: SGNetPose+.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, partial differential equation (PDE) systems have been successfully applied to the binarization of text images, achieving promising results. Inspired by the DH model and incorporating a novel image modeling approach, this study proposes a new weakly coupled PDE system for degraded text image binarization. In this system, the first equation is designed to estimate the background component, incorporating both diffusion and fidelity terms. The second equation estimates the foreground component and includes diffusion, fidelity, and binarization source terms. The final binarization result is obtained by applying a hard projection to the estimated foreground component. Experimental results on 86 degraded text images demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits significant advantages in handling degraded text images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bozhi Luan, Wengang Zhou, Hao Feng, Zhe Wang, Xiaosong Li, Houqiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: As the computational needs of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) increase, visual token pruning has proven effective in improving inference speed and memory efficiency. Traditional pruning methods in LVLMs predominantly focus on attention scores to determine token relevance, overlooking critical aspects such as spatial position and token similarity. To this end, we introduce AdaptPrune, a novel plug-and-play training-free pruning method that builds on conventional attention-based pruning by integrating spatial distance and token similarity with an adaptive NMS approach. Our method is based on several observed phenomena in large models: the positional bias in the model's image attention and the redundancy of token information ignored by previous approaches. By integrating attention, spatial, and similarity information, our approach ensures a comprehensive evaluation of token importance and substantially refines the pruning decisions. Our method has been extensively tested across various LVLMs and benchmarks, confirming its robustness and adaptability. The results demonstrate that AdaptPrune consistently outperforms existing methods across various pruning ratios. Code is available at https://github.com/bzluan/AdaptPrune.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sudarshan Regmi</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability of the deep learning model to recognize when a sample falls outside its learned distribution is critical for safe and reliable deployment. Recent state-of-the-art out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods leverage activation shaping to improve the separation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD inputs. These approaches resort to sample-specific scaling but apply a static percentile threshold across all samples regardless of their nature, resulting in suboptimal ID-OOD separability. In this work, we propose \textbf{AdaSCALE}, an adaptive scaling procedure that dynamically adjusts the percentile threshold based on a sample's estimated OOD likelihood. This estimation leverages our key observation: OOD samples exhibit significantly more pronounced activation shifts at high-magnitude activations under minor perturbation compared to ID samples. AdaSCALE enables stronger scaling for likely ID samples and weaker scaling for likely OOD samples, yielding highly separable energy scores. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection performance, outperforming the latest rival OptFS by 14.94 in near-OOD and 21.67 in far-OOD datasets in average FPR@95 metric on the ImageNet-1k benchmark across eight diverse architectures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaozhi Zhang, Wenxiang Ding, Roy Y. He, Xiaoqun Zhang, Qiaoqiao Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: The reconstruction of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) images from noisy projection data is a significant but challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised learning approach, Non-negative Implicit Neural Representation Factorization (\texttt{NINRF}), based on low rank matrix factorization of unknown images and employing neural networks to represent both coefficients and bases. Mathematically, we demonstrate that if a sequence of dynamic PET images satisfies a generalized non-negative low-rank property, it can be decomposed into a set of non-negative continuous functions varying in the temporal-spatial domain. This bridges the well-established non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with continuous functions and we propose using implicit neural representations (INRs) to connect matrix with continuous functions. The neural network parameters are obtained by minimizing the KL divergence, with additional sparsity regularization on coefficients and bases. Extensive experiments on dynamic PET reconstruction with Poisson noise demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to other methods, while giving continuous representations for object's detailed geometric features and regional concentration variation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Low-level texture feature/knowledge is also of vital importance for characterizing the local structural pattern and global statistical properties, such as boundary, smoothness, regularity, and color contrast, which may not be well addressed by high-level deep features. In this paper, we aim to re-emphasize the low-level texture information in deep networks for semantic segmentation and related knowledge distillation tasks. To this end, we take full advantage of both structural and statistical texture knowledge and propose a novel Structural and Statistical Texture Knowledge Distillation (SSTKD) framework for semantic segmentation. Specifically, Contourlet Decomposition Module (CDM) is introduced to decompose the low-level features with iterative Laplacian pyramid and directional filter bank to mine the structural texture knowledge, and Texture Intensity Equalization Module (TIEM) is designed to extract and enhance the statistical texture knowledge with the corresponding Quantization Congruence Loss (QDL). Moreover, we propose the Co-occurrence TIEM (C-TIEM) and generic segmentation frameworks, namely STLNet++ and U-SSNet, to enable existing segmentation networks to harvest the structural and statistical texture information more effectively. Extensive experimental results on three segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and their state-of-the-art performance on seven popular benchmark datasets, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-Training (ProLIP) has been proposed to tackle the multiplicity issue of vision-language (VL) tasks. Despite their success in probabilistic representation learning at a scale, the ProLIP models cannot handle long context texts longer than 64 context length, which limits their ability to capture rich contextual information from longer text sequences. To address this issue, this paper proposes a fine-tuning strategy for ProLIP to accept longer texts, e.g., 256 text tokens. Experimental results on Urban-1k and the DataComp evaluation suite show that the proposed LongProLIP recipe can improve understanding of long contexts while minimizing the negative effect of fine-tuning. We also observe a trade-off between the long context understanding (measured by Urban-1k) and general zero-shot capability (measured by ImageNet or the average of 38 zero-shot evaluation datasets by DataComp).</p>

<p>Abstract: The widespread use of deep learning classifiers necessitates Open-set recognition (OSR), which enables the identification of input data not only from classes known during training but also from unknown classes that might be present in test data. Many existing OSR methods are computationally expensive due to the reliance on complex generative models or suffer from high training costs. We investigate OSR from a representation-learning perspective, specifically through spherical embeddings. We introduce SphOR, a computationally efficient representation learning method that models the feature space as a mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions. This approach enables the use of semantically ambiguous samples during training, to improve the detection of samples from unknown classes. We further explore the relationship between OSR performance and key representation learning properties which influence how well features are structured in high-dimensional space. Extensive experiments on multiple OSR benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, producing state-of-the-art results, with improvements up-to 6% that validate its performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nadarasar Bahavan, Sanjay Saha, Ken Chen, Sachith Seneviratne, Sanka Rasnayaka, Saman Halgamuge</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial forgery methods such as deepfakes can be misused for identity manipulation and spreading misinformation. They have evolved alongside advancements in generative AI, leading to new and more sophisticated forgery techniques that diverge from existing 'known' methods. Conventional deepfake detection methods use the closedset paradigm, thus limiting their applicability to detecting forgeries created using methods that are not part of the training dataset. In this paper, we propose a shift from the closed-set paradigm for deepfake detection. In the open-set paradigm, models are designed not only to identify images created by known facial forgery methods but also to identify and flag those produced by previously unknown methods as 'unknown' and not as unforged/real/unmanipulated. In this paper, we propose an open-set deepfake classification algorithm based on supervised contrastive learning. The open-set paradigm used in our model allows it to function as a more robust tool capable of handling emerging and unseen deepfake techniques, enhancing reliability and confidence, and complementing forensic analysis. In open-set paradigm, we identify three groups including the "unknown group that is neither considered known deepfake nor real. We investigate deepfake open-set classification across three scenarios, classifying deepfakes from unknown methods not as real, distinguishing real images from deepfakes, and classifying deepfakes from known methods, using the FaceForensics++ dataset as a benchmark. Our method achieves state of the art results in the first two tasks and competitive results in the third task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts can seriously affect clinical diagnostics, making it challenging to interpret images accurately. Existing methods for eliminating motion artifacts struggle to retain fine structural details and simultaneously lack the necessary vividness and sharpness. In this study, we present a novel dual-domain optimization (DDO) approach that integrates information from the pixel and frequency domains guiding the recovery of clean magnetic resonance images through implicit neural representations(INRs). Specifically, our approach leverages the low-frequency components in the k-space as a reference to capture accurate tissue textures, while high-frequency and pixel information contribute to recover details. Furthermore, we design complementary masks and dynamic loss weighting transitioning from global to local attention that effectively suppress artifacts while retaining useful details for reconstruction. Experimental results on the NYU fastMRI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in multiple evaluation metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyundong Jin, Eunwoo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning aims to learn knowledge of tasks observed in sequential time steps while mitigating the forgetting of previously learned knowledge. Existing methods were proposed under the assumption of learning a single modality (e.g., image) over time, which limits their applicability in scenarios involving multiple modalities. In this work, we propose a novel continual learning framework that accommodates multiple modalities (image, video, audio, depth, and text). We train a model to align various modalities with text, leveraging its rich semantic information. However, this increases the risk of forgetting previously learned knowledge, exacerbated by the differing input traits of each task. To alleviate the overwriting of the previous knowledge of modalities, we propose a method for aggregating knowledge within and across modalities. The aggregated knowledge is obtained by assimilating new information through self-regularization within each modality and associating knowledge between modalities by prioritizing contributions from relevant modalities. Furthermore, we propose a strategy that re-aligns the embeddings of modalities to resolve biased alignment between modalities. We evaluate the proposed method in a wide range of continual learning scenarios using multiple datasets with different modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ours outperforms existing methods in the scenarios, regardless of whether the identity of the modality is given.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peili Song, Dezhen Song, Yifan Yang, Enfan Lan, Jingtai Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-cost millimeter automotive radar has received more and more attention due to its ability to handle adverse weather and lighting conditions in autonomous driving. However, the lack of quality datasets hinders research and development. We report a new method that is able to simulate 4D millimeter wave radar signals including pitch, yaw, range, and Doppler velocity along with radar signal strength (RSS) using camera image, light detection and ranging (lidar) point cloud, and ego-velocity. The method is based on two new neural networks: 1) DIS-Net, which estimates the spatial distribution and number of radar signals, and 2) RSS-Net, which predicts the RSS of the signal based on appearance and geometric information. We have implemented and tested our method using open datasets from 3 different models of commercial automotive radar. The experimental results show that our method can successfully generate high-fidelity radar signals. Moreover, we have trained a popular object detection neural network with data augmented by our synthesized radar. The network outperforms the counterpart trained only on raw radar data, a promising result to facilitate future radar-based research and development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beibei Lin, Stephen Lin, Robby Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Nighttime image dehazing is particularly challenging when dense haze and intense glow severely degrade or completely obscure background information. Existing methods often encounter difficulties due to insufficient background priors and limited generative ability, both essential for handling such conditions. In this paper, we introduce BeyondHaze, a generative nighttime dehazing method that not only significantly reduces haze and glow effects but also infers background information in regions where it may be absent. Our approach is developed on two main ideas: gaining strong background priors by adapting image diffusion models to the nighttime dehazing problem, and enhancing generative ability for haze- and glow-obscured scene areas through guided training. Task-specific nighttime dehazing knowledge is distilled into an image diffusion model in a manner that preserves its capacity to generate clean images. The diffusion model is additionally trained on image pairs designed to improve its ability to generate background details and content that are missing in the input image due to haze effects. Since generative models are susceptible to hallucinations, we develop our framework to allow user control over the generative level, balancing visual realism and factual accuracy. Experiments on real-world images demonstrate that BeyondHaze effectively restores visibility in dense nighttime haze.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingjie Chen, Jiarui Zhang, Tao Wang, Yun Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing need for facial behavior analysis, semi-supervised AU intensity estimation using only keyframe annotations has emerged as a practical and effective solution to relieve the burden of annotation. However, the lack of annotations makes the spurious correlation problem caused by AU co-occurrences and subject variation much more prominent, leading to non-robust intensity estimation that is entangled among AUs and biased among subjects. We observe that trend information inherent in keyframe annotations could act as extra supervision and raising the awareness of AU-specific facial appearance changing trends during training is the key to learning invariant AU-specific features. To this end, we propose \textbf{T}rend-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{S}upervision (TAS), which pursues three kinds of trend awareness, including intra-trend ranking awareness, intra-trend speed awareness, and inter-trend subject awareness. TAS alleviates the spurious correlation problem by raising trend awareness during training to learn AU-specific features that represent the corresponding facial appearance changes, to achieve intensity estimation invariance. Experiments conducted on two commonly used AU benchmark datasets, BP4D and DISFA, show the effectiveness of each kind of awareness. And under trend-aware supervision, the performance can be improved without extra computational or storage costs during inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeongseok Son, Jia He, Seung-In Park, Ying Min, Yunhao Zhang, ByungIn Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Most previous 3D object detection methods that leverage the multi-modality of LiDAR and cameras utilize the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space for intermediate feature representation. However, this space uses a low x, y-resolution and sacrifices z-axis information to reduce the overall feature resolution, which may result in declined accuracy. To tackle the problem of using low-resolution features, this paper focuses on the sparse nature of LiDAR point cloud data. From our observation, the number of occupied cells in the 3D voxels constructed from a LiDAR data can be even fewer than the number of total cells in the BEV map, despite the voxels' significantly higher resolution. Based on this, we introduce a novel sparse voxel-based transformer network for 3D object detection, dubbed as SparseVoxFormer. Instead of performing BEV feature extraction, we directly leverage sparse voxel features as the input for a transformer-based detector. Moreover, with regard to the camera modality, we introduce an explicit modality fusion approach that involves projecting 3D voxel coordinates onto 2D images and collecting the corresponding image features. Thanks to these components, our approach can leverage geometrically richer multi-modal features while even reducing the computational cost. Beyond the proof-of-concept level, we further focus on facilitating better multi-modal fusion and flexible control over the number of sparse features. Finally, thorough experimental results demonstrate that utilizing a significantly smaller number of sparse features drastically reduces computational costs in a 3D object detector while enhancing both overall and long-range performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenfeng Hou, Qi Xun Yeo, Mengqi Guo, Yongxin Su, Yanyan Li, Gim Hee Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for its high-quality rendering capabilities, ultra-fast training, and inference speeds. However, when we apply 3DGS to surface reconstruction tasks, especially in environments with dynamic objects and distractors, the method suffers from floating artifacts and color errors due to inconsistency from different viewpoints. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-View Consistency Gaussian Splatting for the domain of Robust Surface Reconstruction (\textbf{MVGSR}), which takes advantage of lightweight Gaussian models and a {heuristics-guided distractor masking} strategy for robust surface reconstruction in non-static environments. Compared to existing methods that rely on MLPs for distractor segmentation strategies, our approach separates distractors from static scene elements by comparing multi-view feature consistency, allowing us to obtain precise distractor masks early in training. Furthermore, we introduce a pruning measure based on multi-view contributions to reset transmittance, effectively reducing floating artifacts. Finally, a multi-view consistency loss is applied to achieve high-quality performance in surface reconstruction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MVGSR achieves competitive geometric accuracy and rendering fidelity compared to the state-of-the-art surface reconstruction algorithms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinrui Li, Jianlong Wu, Xinchuan Huang, Chong Chen, Weili Guan, Xian-Sheng Hua, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Pioneering text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have ushered in a new era of real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), significantly enhancing the visual perception of reconstructed images. However, existing methods typically integrate uniform abstract textual semantics across all blocks, overlooking the distinct semantic requirements at different depths and the fine-grained, concrete semantics inherently present in the images themselves. Moreover, relying solely on a single type of guidance further disrupts the consistency of reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose MegaSR, a novel framework that mines customized block-wise semantics and expressive guidance for diffusion-based ISR. Compared to uniform textual semantics, MegaSR enables flexible adaptation to multi-granularity semantic awareness by dynamically incorporating image attributes at each block. Furthermore, we experimentally identify HED edge maps, depth maps, and segmentation maps as the most expressive guidance, and propose a multi-stage aggregation strategy to modulate them into the T2I models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MegaSR in terms of semantic richness and structural consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lizhen Xu, Xiuxiu Bai, Xiaojun Jia, Jianwu Fang, Shanmin Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Query-based methods with dense features have demonstrated remarkable success in 3D object detection tasks. However, the computational demands of these models, particularly with large image sizes and multiple transformer layers, pose significant challenges for efficient running on edge devices. Existing pruning and distillation methods either need retraining or are designed for ViT models, which are hard to migrate to 3D detectors. To address this issue, we propose a zero-shot runtime pruning method for transformer decoders in 3D object detection models. The method, termed tgGBC (trim keys gradually Guided By Classification scores), systematically trims keys in transformer modules based on their importance. We expand the classification score to multiply it with the attention map to get the importance score of each key and then prune certain keys after each transformer layer according to their importance scores. Our method achieves a 1.99x speedup in the transformer decoder of the latest ToC3D model, with only a minimal performance loss of less than 1%. Interestingly, for certain models, our method even enhances their performance. Moreover, we deploy 3D detectors with tgGBC on an edge device, further validating the effectiveness of our method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianhui Wang, Zhifei Yang, Yangfan He, Huixiong Zhang, Yuxuan Chen, Jingwei Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate material retrieval is critical for creating realistic 3D assets. Existing methods rely on datasets that capture shape-invariant and lighting-varied representations of materials, which are scarce and face challenges due to limited diversity and inadequate real-world generalization. Most current approaches adopt traditional image search techniques. They fall short in capturing the unique properties of material spaces, leading to suboptimal performance in retrieval tasks. Addressing these challenges, we introduce MaRI, a framework designed to bridge the feature space gap between synthetic and real-world materials. MaRI constructs a shared embedding space that harmonizes visual and material attributes through a contrastive learning strategy by jointly training an image and a material encoder, bringing similar materials and images closer while separating dissimilar pairs within the feature space. To support this, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising high-quality synthetic materials rendered with controlled shape variations and diverse lighting conditions, along with real-world materials processed and standardized using material transfer techniques. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance, accuracy, and generalization capabilities of MaRI across diverse and complex material retrieval tasks, outperforming existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruipeng Wang, Junfeng Fang, Jiaqi Li, Hao Chen, Jie Shi, Kun Wang, Xiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating realistic images, but they raise societal and ethical concerns, such as the creation of unsafe content. While concept editing is proposed to address these issues, they often struggle to balance the removal of unsafe concept with maintaining the model's general genera-tive capabilities. In this work, we propose ACE, a new editing method that enhances concept editing in diffusion models. ACE introduces a novel cross null-space projection approach to precisely erase unsafe concept while maintaining the model's ability to generate high-quality, semantically consistent images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACE significantly outperforms the advancing baselines,improving semantic consistency by 24.56% and image generation quality by 34.82% on average with only 1% of the time cost. These results highlight the practical utility of concept editing by mitigating its potential risks, paving the way for broader applications in the field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junzhe Li, Xuerui Qiu, Linrui Xu, Liya Guo, Delin Qu, Tingting Long, Chun Fan, Ming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in foundational computer vision research, demonstrating significant potential in both image understanding and generation. However, existing research in the face domain primarily focuses on $\textbf{coarse}$ facial attribute understanding, with limited capacity to handle $\textbf{fine-grained}$ facial attributes and without addressing generation capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace, the first UMM tailored specifically for fine-grained face understanding and generation. In general, we train Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace on a self-constructed, specialized dataset utilizing two mutually beneficial diffusion techniques and a two-level mixture-of-experts architecture. Specifically, we first build a large-scale facial dataset, Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace-130K, which contains 130K image-text pairs with one million question-answering pairs that span a wide range of facial attributes. Second, we establish a theoretical connection between discrete diffusion score matching and masked generative models, optimizing both evidence lower bounds simultaneously, which significantly improves the model's ability to synthesize facial details. Finally, we introduce both token-level and sequence-level mixture-of-experts, enabling efficient fine-grained representation learning for both understanding and generation tasks. Extensive experiments on Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace-130K demonstrate that Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace outperforms existing UMMs and generative models, achieving superior performance across both understanding and generation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce AG-VPReID, a challenging large-scale benchmark dataset for aerial-ground video-based person re-identification (ReID), comprising 6,632 identities, 32,321 tracklets, and 9.6 million frames captured from drones (15-120m altitude), CCTV, and wearable cameras. This dataset presents a real-world benchmark to investigate the robustness of Person ReID approaches against the unique challenges of cross-platform aerial-ground settings. To address these challenges, we propose AG-VPReID-Net, an end-to-end framework combining three complementary streams: (1) an Adapted Temporal-Spatial Stream addressing motion pattern inconsistencies and temporal feature learning, (2) a Normalized Appearance Stream using physics-informed techniques to tackle resolution and appearance changes, and (3) a Multi-Scale Attention Stream handling scale variations across drone altitudes. Our approach integrates complementary visual-semantic information from all streams to generate robust, viewpoint-invariant person representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AG-VPReID-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both our new dataset and other existing video-based ReID benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability. The relatively lower performance of all state-of-the-art approaches, including our proposed approach, on our new dataset highlights its challenging nature.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taehyeon Eum, Jieun Choi, Tae-Kyun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based methods have achieved significant successes in T2I generation, providing realistic images from text prompts. Despite their capabilities, these models face persistent challenges in generating realistic human hands, often producing images with incorrect finger counts and structurally deformed hands. MGHanD addresses this challenge by applying multi-modal guidance during the inference process. For visual guidance, we employ a discriminator trained on a dataset comprising paired real and generated images with captions, derived from various hand-in-the-wild datasets. We also employ textual guidance with LoRA adapter, which learns the direction from `hands' towards more detailed prompts such as `natural hands', and `anatomically correct fingers' at the latent level. A cumulative hand mask which is gradually enlarged in the assigned time step is applied to the added guidance, allowing the hand to be refined while maintaining the rich generative capabilities of the pre-trained model. In the experiments, our method achieves superior hand generation qualities, without any specific conditions or priors. We carry out both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, along with user studies, to showcase the benefits of our approach in producing high-quality hand images.</p>

<p>Abstract: We tackle the challenge of concurrent reconstruction at the part level with the RGB appearance and estimation of motion parameters for building digital twins of articulated objects using the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) method. With two distinct sets of multi-view imagery, each depicting an object in separate static articulation configurations, we reconstruct the articulated object in 3D Gaussian representations with both appearance and geometry information at the same time. Our approach decoupled multiple highly interdependent parameters through a multi-step optimization process, thereby achieving a stable optimization procedure and high-quality outcomes. We introduce ArticulatedGS, a self-supervised, comprehensive framework that autonomously learns to model shapes and appearances at the part level and synchronizes the optimization of motion parameters, all without reliance on 3D supervision, motion cues, or semantic labels. Our experimental results demonstrate that, among comparable methodologies, our approach has achieved optimal outcomes in terms of part segmentation accuracy, motion estimation accuracy, and visual quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeongsol Kim, Bryan Sangwoo Kim, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Flow matching is a recent state-of-the-art framework for generative modeling based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). While closely related to diffusion models, it provides a more general perspective on generative modeling. Although inverse problem solving has been extensively explored using diffusion models, it has not been rigorously examined within the broader context of flow models. Therefore, here we extend the diffusion inverse solvers (DIS) - which perform posterior sampling by combining a denoising diffusion prior with an likelihood gradient - into the flow framework. Specifically, by driving the flow-version of Tweedie's formula, we decompose the flow ODE into two components: one for clean image estimation and the other for noise estimation. By integrating the likelihood gradient and stochastic noise into each component, respectively, we demonstrate that posterior sampling for inverse problem solving can be effectively achieved using flows. Our proposed solver, Flow-Driven Posterior Sampling (FlowDPS), can also be seamlessly integrated into a latent flow model with a transformer architecture. Across four linear inverse problems, we confirm that FlowDPS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, all without requiring additional training.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present HOTFormerLoc, a novel and versatile Hierarchical Octree-based Transformer, for large-scale 3D place recognition in both ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial scenarios across urban and forest environments. We propose an octree-based multi-scale attention mechanism that captures spatial and semantic features across granularities. To address the variable density of point distributions from spinning lidar, we present cylindrical octree attention windows to reflect the underlying distribution during attention. We introduce relay tokens to enable efficient global-local interactions and multi-scale representation learning at reduced computational cost. Our pyramid attentional pooling then synthesises a robust global descriptor for end-to-end place recognition in challenging environments. In addition, we introduce CS-Wild-Places, a novel 3D cross-source dataset featuring point cloud data from aerial and ground lidar scans captured in dense forests. Point clouds in CS-Wild-Places contain representational gaps and distinctive attributes such as varying point densities and noise patterns, making it a challenging benchmark for cross-view localisation in the wild. HOTFormerLoc achieves a top-1 average recall improvement of 5.5% - 11.5% on the CS-Wild-Places benchmark. Furthermore, it consistently outperforms SOTA 3D place recognition methods, with an average performance gain of 5.8% on well-established urban and forest datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Rydell, Georg B\"okman, Fredrik Kahl, Kathl\'en Kohn</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a new framework for reducing the computational complexity of geometric vision problems through targeted reweighting of the cost functions used to minimize reprojection errors. Triangulation - the task of estimating a 3D point from noisy 2D projections across multiple images - is a fundamental problem in multiview geometry and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines. We apply our framework to the two-view case and demonstrate that optimal triangulation, which requires solving a univariate polynomial of degree six, can be simplified through cost function reweighting reducing the polynomial degree to two. This reweighting yields a closed-form solution while preserving strong geometric accuracy. We derive optimal weighting strategies, establish theoretical bounds on the approximation error, and provide experimental results on real data demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to standard methods. Although this work focuses on two-view triangulation, the framework generalizes to other geometric vision problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) and visionlanguage models (VLMs) have achieved significant success, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in understanding various images and videos, particularly in classification and detection tasks. However, due to the substantial differences between remote sensing images and conventional optical images, these models face considerable challenges in comprehension, especially in detection tasks. Directly prompting VLMs with detection instructions often fails to yield satisfactory results. To address this issue, this letter explores the application of VLMs for object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we utilize publicly available remote sensing object detection datasets, including SSDD, HRSID, and NWPU-VHR-10, to convert traditional annotation information into natural language, thereby constructing an instruction-tuning (SFT) dataset for VLM training. We then evaluate the detection performance of different fine-tuning strategies for VLMs and obtain optimized model weights for object detection in remote sensing images. Finally, we assess the model's prior knowledge capabilities through natural language queries.Experimental results demonstrate that, without modifying the model architecture, remote sensing object detection can be effectively achieved using natural language alone. Additionally, the model exhibits the ability to perform certain vision question answering (VQA) tasks. Our dataset and relevant code will be released soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Object Tracking (OV-MOT) aims to enable approaches to track objects without being limited to a predefined set of categories. Current OV-MOT methods typically rely primarily on instance-level detection and association, often overlooking trajectory information that is unique and essential for object tracking tasks. Utilizing trajectory information can enhance association stability and classification accuracy, especially in cases of occlusion and category ambiguity, thereby improving adaptability to novel classes. Thus motivated, in this paper we propose \textbf{TRACT}, an open-vocabulary tracker that leverages trajectory information to improve both object association and classification in OV-MOT. Specifically, we introduce a \textit{Trajectory Consistency Reinforcement} (\textbf{TCR}) strategy, that benefits tracking performance by improving target identity and category consistency. In addition, we present \textbf{TraCLIP}, a plug-and-play trajectory classification module. It integrates \textit{Trajectory Feature Aggregation} (\textbf{TFA}) and \textit{Trajectory Semantic Enrichment} (\textbf{TSE}) strategies to fully leverage trajectory information from visual and language perspectives for enhancing the classification results. Extensive experiments on OV-TAO show that our TRACT significantly improves tracking performance, highlighting trajectory information as a valuable asset for OV-MOT. Code will be released.</p>

Additionally, FilmComposer is the first to focus on the three core elements of music production for film-audio quality, musicality, and musical development-and introduces various controls, such as rhythm, semantics, and visuals, to enhance these key aspects. Specifically, FilmComposer consists of the visual processing module, rhythm-controllable MusicGen, and multi-agent assessment, arrangement and mix. In addition, our framework can seamlessly integrate into the actual music production pipeline and allows user intervention in every step, providing strong interactivity and a high degree of creative freedom. Furthermore, we propose MusicPro-7k which includes 7,418 film clips, music, description, rhythm spots and main melody, considering the lack of a professional and high-quality film music dataset. Finally, both the standard metrics and the new specialized metrics we propose demonstrate that the music generated by our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality, consistency with video, diversity, musicality, and musical development.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanbyul Lee, Juneho Yi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, images that distort or fabricate facts using generative models have become a social concern. To cope with continuous evolution of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, model attribution (MA) is necessary beyond just detection of synthetic images. However, current deep learning-based MA methods must be trained from scratch with new data to recognize unseen models, which is time-consuming and data-intensive. This work proposes a new strategy to deal with persistently emerging generative models. We adapt few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) mechanisms for MA problem to uncover novel generative AI models. Unlike existing FSCIL approaches that focus on object classification using high-level information, MA requires analyzing low-level details like color and texture in synthetic images. Thus, we utilize a learnable representation from different levels of CLIP-ViT features. To learn an effective representation, we propose Adaptive Integration Module (AIM) to calculate a weighted sum of CLIP-ViT block features for each image, enhancing the ability to identify generative models. Extensive experiments show our method effectively extends from prior generative models to recent ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengzhi Ma, Kunqian Li, Shuaixin Liu, Han Mei</p>
<p>Abstract: Indiscernible marine object counting encounters numerous challenges, including limited visibility in underwater scenes, mutual occlusion and overlap among objects, and the dynamic similarity in appearance, color, and texture between the background and foreground. These factors significantly complicate the counting process. To address the scarcity of video-based indiscernible object counting datasets, we have developed a novel dataset comprising 50 videos, from which approximately 800 frames have been extracted and annotated with around 40,800 point-wise object labels. This dataset accurately represents real underwater environments where indiscernible marine objects are intricately integrated with their surroundings, thereby comprehensively illustrating the aforementioned challenges in object counting. To address these challenges, we propose a depth-assisted network with adaptive motion-differentiated feature encoding. The network consists of a backbone encoding module and three branches: a depth-assisting branch, a density estimation branch, and a motion weight generation branch. Depth-aware features extracted by the depth-assisting branch are enhanced via a depth-enhanced encoder to improve object representation. Meanwhile, weights from the motion weight generation branch refine multi-scale perception features in the adaptive flow estimation module. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the proposed dataset but also yields competitive results on three additional video-based crowd counting datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Wang, Ao Ma, Ke Cao, Jun Zheng, Zhanjie Zhang, Jiasong Feng, Shanyuan Liu, Yuhang Ma, Bo Cheng, Dawei Leng, Yuhui Yin, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent rapid advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generation, such as SoRA and Kling, have shown great potential for building world simulators. However, current T2V models struggle to grasp abstract physical principles and generate videos that adhere to physical laws. This challenge arises primarily from a lack of clear guidance on physical information due to a significant gap between abstract physical principles and generation models. To this end, we introduce the World Simulator Assistant (WISA), an effective framework for decomposing and incorporating physical principles into T2V models. Specifically, WISA decomposes physical principles into textual physical descriptions, qualitative physical categories, and quantitative physical properties. To effectively embed these physical attributes into the generation process, WISA incorporates several key designs, including Mixture-of-Physical-Experts Attention (MoPA) and a Physical Classifier, enhancing the model's physics awareness. Furthermore, most existing datasets feature videos where physical phenomena are either weakly represented or entangled with multiple co-occurring processes, limiting their suitability as dedicated resources for learning explicit physical principles. We propose a novel video dataset, WISA-32K, collected based on qualitative physical categories. It consists of 32,000 videos, representing 17 physical laws across three domains of physics: dynamics, thermodynamics, and optics. Experimental results demonstrate that WISA can effectively enhance the compatibility of T2V models with real-world physical laws, achieving a considerable improvement on the VideoPhy benchmark. The visual exhibitions of WISA and WISA-32K are available in the https://360cvgroup.github.io/WISA/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tian Jin, Enjun Du, Changwei Wang, Wenhao Xu, Ding Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) aims to reduce the scales of pre-trained models for multiple downstream tasks. However, as the models keep scaling up, the memory footprint of existing PETL methods is not significantly reduced compared to the reduction of learnable parameters. This limitation hinders the practical deployment of PETL methods on memory-constrained devices. To this end, we proposed a new PETL framework, called Structure to Activation (S2A), to reduce the memory footprint of activation during fine-tuning. Specifically, our framework consists of: 1)Activation modules design(i.e. bias, prompt and side modules) in the parametric model structure, which results in a significant reduction of adjustable parameters and activation memory 2) 4-bit quantisation of activations based on their derivatives for non-parametric structures (e.g., nonlinear functions), which maintains accuracy while significantly reducing memory usage. Our S2A method consequently offers a lightweight solution in terms of both parameter and memory footprint. We evaluate S2A with different backbones and conduct extensive experiments on various datasets to evaluate the effectiveness. The results show that our method not only outperforms existing PETL techniques, achieving a fourfold reduction in GPU memory footprint on average, but also shows competitive performance in accuracy with lower tunable parameters. These also demonstrate that our method is highly suitable for practical transfer learning on hardware-constrained devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufan Chen, Ching Ting Leung, Jianwei Sun, Yong Huang, Linyan Li, Hao Chen, Hanyu Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant promise in advancing organic chemistry research; however, its effectiveness depends on the availability of high-quality chemical reaction data. Currently, most published chemical reactions are not available in machine-readable form, limiting the broader application of AI in this field. The extraction of published chemical reactions into structured databases still relies heavily on manual curation, and robust automatic parsing of chemical reaction images into machine-readable data remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Reaction Image Multimodal large language model (RxnIM), the first multimodal large language model specifically designed to parse chemical reaction images into machine-readable reaction data. RxnIM not only extracts key chemical components from reaction images but also interprets the textual content that describes reaction conditions. Together with specially designed large-scale dataset generation method to support model training, our approach achieves excellent performance, with an average F1 score of 88% on various benchmarks, surpassing literature methods by 5%. This represents a crucial step toward the automatic construction of large databases of machine-readable reaction data parsed from images in the chemistry literature, providing essential data resources for AI research in chemistry. The source code, model checkpoints, and datasets developed in this work are released under permissive licenses.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanjie Zhang, Ao Ma, Ke Cao, Jing Wang, Shanyuan Liu, Yuhang Ma, Bo Cheng, Dawei Leng, Yuhui Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultra-high quality artistic style transfer refers to repainting an ultra-high quality content image using the style information learned from the style image. Existing artistic style transfer methods can be categorized into style reconstruction-based and content-style disentanglement-based style transfer approaches. Although these methods can generate some artistic stylized images, they still exhibit obvious artifacts and disharmonious patterns, which hinder their ability to produce ultra-high quality artistic stylized images. To address these issues, we propose a novel artistic image style transfer method, U-StyDiT, which is built on transformer-based diffusion (DiT) and learns content-style disentanglement, generating ultra-high quality artistic stylized images. Specifically, we first design a Multi-view Style Modulator (MSM) to learn style information from a style image from local and global perspectives, conditioning U-StyDiT to generate stylized images with the learned style information. Then, we introduce a StyDiT Block to learn content and style conditions simultaneously from a style image. Additionally, we propose an ultra-high quality artistic image dataset, Aes4M, comprising 10 categories, each containing 400,000 style images. This dataset effectively solves the problem that the existing style transfer methods cannot produce high-quality artistic stylized images due to the size of the dataset and the quality of the images in the dataset. Finally, the extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments validate that our U-StyDiT can create higher quality stylized images compared to state-of-the-art artistic style transfer methods. To our knowledge, our proposed method is the first to address the generation of ultra-high quality stylized images using transformer-based diffusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhang Liu, Yu-Wing Tai, Chi-Keung Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce AvatarForge, a framework for generating animatable 3D human avatars from text or image inputs using AI-driven procedural generation. While diffusion-based methods have made strides in general 3D object generation, they struggle with high-quality, customizable human avatars due to the complexity and diversity of human body shapes, poses, exacerbated by the scarcity of high-quality data. Additionally, animating these avatars remains a significant challenge for existing methods. AvatarForge overcomes these limitations by combining LLM-based commonsense reasoning with off-the-shelf 3D human generators, enabling fine-grained control over body and facial details. Unlike diffusion models which often rely on pre-trained datasets lacking precise control over individual human features, AvatarForge offers a more flexible approach, bringing humans into the iterative design and modeling loop, with its auto-verification system allowing for continuous refinement of the generated avatars, and thus promoting high accuracy and customization. Our evaluations show that AvatarForge outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both text- and image-to-avatar generation, making it a versatile tool for artistic creation and animation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08168">TSCnet: A Text-driven Semantic-level Controllable Framework for Customized Low-Light Image Enhancement</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Miao Zhang, Jun Yin, Pengyu Zeng, Yiqing Shen, Shuai Lu, Xueqian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based image enhancement methods show significant advantages in reducing noise and improving visibility in low-light conditions. These methods are typically based on one-to-one mapping, where the model learns a direct transformation from low light to specific enhanced images. Therefore, these methods are inflexible as they do not allow highly personalized mapping, even though an individual's lighting preferences are inherently personalized. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new light enhancement task and a new framework that provides customized lighting control through prompt-driven, semantic-level, and quantitative brightness adjustments. The framework begins by leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand natural language prompts, enabling it to identify target objects for brightness adjustments. To localize these target objects, the Retinex-based Reasoning Segment (RRS) module generates precise target localization masks using reflection images. Subsequently, the Text-based Brightness Controllable (TBC) module adjusts brightness levels based on the generated illumination map. Finally, an Adaptive Contextual Compensation (ACC) module integrates multi-modal inputs and controls a conditional diffusion model to adjust the lighting, ensuring seamless and precise enhancements accurately. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate our framework's superior performance at increasing visibility, maintaining natural color balance, and amplifying fine details without creating artifacts. Furthermore, its robust generalization capabilities enable complex semantic-level lighting adjustments in diverse open-world environments through natural language interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyue Li, Daisuke Deguchi, Hiroshi Murase</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to estimate the location of the given query image within a database of geo-tagged images. To identify the exact location in an image, detecting landmarks is crucial. However, in some scenarios, such as urban environments, there are numerous landmarks, such as various modern buildings, and the landmarks in different cities often exhibit high visual similarity. Therefore, it is essential not only to leverage the landmarks but also to consider the contextual information surrounding them, such as whether there are trees, roads, or other features around the landmarks. We propose the Contextual Query VPR (CQVPR), which integrates contextual information with detailed pixel-level visual features. By leveraging a set of learnable contextual queries, our method automatically learns the high-level contexts with respect to landmarks and their surrounding areas. Heatmaps depicting regions that each query attends to serve as context-aware features, offering cues that could enhance the understanding of each scene. We further propose a query matching loss to supervise the extraction process of contextual queries. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Tian, Kaiyuan Ji, Rongzhao Zhang, Yankai Jiang, Chunyi Li, Xiaosong Wang, Guangtao Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image re-identification (MedReID) is under-explored so far, despite its critical applications in personalized healthcare and privacy protection. In this paper, we introduce a thorough benchmark and a unified model for this problem. First, to handle various medical modalities, we propose a novel Continuous Modality-based Parameter Adapter (ComPA). ComPA condenses medical content into a continuous modality representation and dynamically adjusts the modality-agnostic model with modality-specific parameters at runtime. This allows a single model to adaptively learn and process diverse modality data. Furthermore, we integrate medical priors into our model by aligning it with a bag of pre-trained medical foundation models, in terms of the differential features. Compared to single-image feature, modeling the inter-image difference better fits the re-identification problem, which involves discriminating multiple images. We evaluate the proposed model against 25 foundation models and 8 large multi-modal language models across 11 image datasets, demonstrating consistently superior performance. Additionally, we deploy the proposed MedReID technique to two real-world applications, i.e., history-augmented personalized diagnosis and medical privacy protection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minyue Dai, Jingbo Wang, Ke Fan, Bin Ji, Haoyu Zhao, Junting Dong, Bo Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Styled motion in-betweening is crucial for computer animation and gaming. However, existing methods typically encode motion styles by modeling whole-body motions, often overlooking the representation of individual body parts. This limitation reduces the flexibility of infilled motion, particularly in adjusting the motion styles of specific limbs independently. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel framework that models motion styles at the body-part level, enhancing both the diversity and controllability of infilled motions. Our approach enables more nuanced and expressive animations by allowing precise modifications to individual limb motions while maintaining overall motion coherence. Leveraging phase-related insights, our framework employs periodic autoencoders to automatically extract the phase of each body part, capturing distinctive local style features. Additionally, we effectively decouple the motion source from synthesis control by integrating motion manifold learning and conditional generation techniques from both image and motion domains. This allows the motion source to generate high-quality motions across various styles, with extracted motion and style features readily available for controlled synthesis in subsequent tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior speed, robust generalization, and effective generation of extended motion sequences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanhan Wang, Huimin Deng, Lianli Gao, Jingkuan Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-centric visual perception (HVP) has recently achieved remarkable progress due to advancements in large-scale self-supervised pretraining (SSP). However, existing HVP models face limitations in adapting to real-world applications, which require general visual patterns for downstream tasks while maintaining computationally sustainable costs to ensure compatibility with edge devices. These limitations primarily arise from two issues: 1) the pretraining objectives focus solely on specific visual patterns, limiting the generalizability of the learned patterns for diverse downstream tasks; and 2) HVP models often exhibit excessively large model sizes, making them incompatible with real-world applications. To address these limitations, we introduce Scale-Aware Image Pretraining (SAIP), a novel SSP framework enabling lightweight vision models to acquire general patterns for HVP. Specifically, SAIP incorporates three learning objectives based on the principle of cross-scale consistency: 1) Cross-scale Matching (CSM) which contrastively learns image-level invariant patterns from multi-scale single-person images; 2) Cross-scale Reconstruction (CSR) which learns pixel-level consistent visual structures from multi-scale masked single-person images; and 3) Cross-scale Search (CSS) which learns to capture diverse patterns from multi-scale multi-person images. Three objectives complement one another, enabling lightweight models to learn multi-scale generalizable patterns essential for HVP downstream tasks.Extensive experiments conducted across 12 HVP datasets demonstrate that SAIP exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities across 9 human-centric vision tasks. Moreover, it achieves significant performance improvements over existing methods, with gains of 3%-13% in single-person discrimination tasks, 1%-11% in dense prediction tasks, and 1%-6% in multi-person visual understanding tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The primary challenge in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) mainly stems from the presence of multi-orientational and long-term motions. However, current research overlooks these crucial aspects, significantly impacting accuracy. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel CSLR framework: Orientation-aware Long-term Motion Decoupling (OLMD), which efficiently aggregates long-term motions and decouples multi-orientational signals into easily interpretable components. Specifically, our innovative Long-term Motion Aggregation (LMA) module filters out static redundancy while adaptively capturing abundant features of long-term motions. We further enhance orientation awareness by decoupling complex movements into horizontal and vertical components, allowing for motion purification in both orientations. Additionally, two coupling mechanisms are proposed: stage and cross-stage coupling, which together enrich multi-scale features and improve the generalization capabilities of the model. Experimentally, OLMD shows SOTA performance on three large-scale datasets: PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, and CSL-Daily. Notably, we improved the word error rate (WER) on PHOENIX14 by an absolute 1.6% compared to the previous SOTA</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beitao Chen, Xinyu Lyu, Lianli Gao, Jingkuan Song, Heng Tao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their success, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to hallucinations. While existing studies attribute the cause of hallucinations to insufficient visual attention to image tokens, our findings indicate that hallucinations also arise from interference from instruction tokens during decoding. Intuitively, certain instruction tokens continuously distort LVLMs' visual perception during decoding, hijacking their visual attention toward less discriminative visual regions. This distortion prevents them integrating broader contextual information from images, ultimately leading to hallucinations. We term this phenomenon 'Attention Hijacking', where disruptive instruction tokens act as 'Attention Hijackers'. To address this, we propose a novel, training-free strategy namely Attention HIjackers Detection and Disentanglement (AID), designed to isolate the influence of Hijackers, enabling LVLMs to rely on their context-aware intrinsic attention map. Specifically, AID consists of three components: First, Attention Hijackers Detection identifies Attention Hijackers by calculating instruction-driven visual salience. Next, Attention Disentanglement mechanism is proposed to mask the visual attention of these identified Hijackers, and thereby mitigate their disruptive influence on subsequent tokens. Finally, Re-Disentanglement recalculates the balance between instruction-driven and image-driven visual salience to avoid over-masking effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AID significantly reduces hallucination across various LVLMs on several benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has reshaped the field of photorealistic 3D reconstruction, achieving impressive rendering quality and speed. However, when applied to large-scale street scenes, existing methods suffer from rapidly escalating per-viewpoint reconstruction costs as scene size increases, leading to significant computational overhead. After revisiting the conventional pipeline, we identify three key factors accounting for this issue: unnecessary local-to-global transformations, excessive 3D-to-2D projections, and inefficient rendering of distant content. To address these challenges, we propose S3R-GS, a 3DGS framework that Streamlines the pipeline for large-scale Street Scene Reconstruction, effectively mitigating these limitations. Moreover, most existing street 3DGS methods rely on ground-truth 3D bounding boxes to separate dynamic and static components, but 3D bounding boxes are difficult to obtain, limiting real-world applicability. To address this, we propose an alternative solution with 2D boxes, which are easier to annotate or can be predicted by off-the-shelf vision foundation models. Such designs together make S3R-GS readily adapt to large, in-the-wild scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S3R-GS enhances rendering quality and significantly accelerates reconstruction. Remarkably, when applied to videos from the challenging Argoverse2 dataset, it achieves state-of-the-art PSNR and SSIM, reducing reconstruction time to below 50%--and even 20%--of competing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiqiang Xiong, Ying Feng, Qi Zhang, Jianbo Jiao, Yang Zhao, Zhihao Liang, Huachen Gao, Ronggang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D human reconstruction from a single image is a challenging problem and has been exclusively studied in the literature. Recently, some methods have resorted to diffusion models for guidance, optimizing a 3D representation via Score Distillation Sampling(SDS) or generating one back-view image for facilitating reconstruction. However, these methods tend to produce unsatisfactory artifacts (\textit{e.g.} flattened human structure or over-smoothing results caused by inconsistent priors from multiple views) and struggle with real-world generalization in the wild. In this work, we present \emph{MVD-HuGaS}, enabling free-view 3D human rendering from a single image via a multi-view human diffusion model. We first generate multi-view images from the single reference image with an enhanced multi-view diffusion model, which is well fine-tuned on high-quality 3D human datasets to incorporate 3D geometry priors and human structure priors. To infer accurate camera poses from the sparse generated multi-view images for reconstruction, an alignment module is introduced to facilitate joint optimization of 3D Gaussians and camera poses. Furthermore, we propose a depth-based Facial Distortion Mitigation module to refine the generated facial regions, thereby improving the overall fidelity of the reconstruction.Finally, leveraging the refined multi-view images, along with their accurate camera poses, MVD-HuGaS optimizes the 3D Gaussians of the target human for high-fidelity free-view renderings. Extensive experiments on Thuman2.0 and 2K2K datasets show that the proposed MVD-HuGaS achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-view 3D human rendering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiqiang Xiong, Rui Peng, Zhe Zhang, Tianxing Feng, Jianbo Jiao, Feng Gao, Ronggang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods have achieved promising progress recently. However, previous methods primarily depend on the photometric consistency assumption, which may suffer from two limitations: indistinguishable regions and view-dependent effects, e.g., low-textured areas and reflections. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a new dual-level contrastive learning approach, named CL-MVSNet. Specifically, our model integrates two contrastive branches into an unsupervised MVS framework to construct additional supervisory signals. On the one hand, we present an image-level contrastive branch to guide the model to acquire more context awareness, thus leading to more complete depth estimation in indistinguishable regions. On the other hand, we exploit a scene-level contrastive branch to boost the representation ability, improving robustness to view-dependent effects. Moreover, to recover more accurate 3D geometry, we introduce an L0.5 photometric consistency loss, which encourages the model to focus more on accurate points while mitigating the gradient penalty of undesirable ones. Extensive experiments on DTU and Tanks&Temples benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among all end-to-end unsupervised MVS frameworks and outperforms its supervised counterpart by a considerable margin without fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present EgoBlind, the first egocentric VideoQA dataset collected from blind individuals to evaluate the assistive capabilities of contemporary multimodal large language models (MLLMs). EgoBlind comprises 1,210 videos that record the daily lives of real blind users from a first-person perspective. It also features 4,927 questions directly posed or generated and verified by blind individuals to reflect their needs for visual assistance under various scenarios. We provide each question with an average of 3 reference answers to alleviate subjective evaluation. Using EgoBlind, we comprehensively evaluate 15 leading MLLMs and find that all models struggle, with the best performers achieving accuracy around 56\%, far behind human performance of 87.4\%. To guide future advancements, we identify and summarize major limitations of existing MLLMs in egocentric visual assistance for the blind and provide heuristic suggestions for improvement. With these efforts, we hope EgoBlind can serve as a valuable foundation for developing more effective AI assistants to enhance the independence of the blind individuals' lives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongbin Zhang, Yunfei Liu, Lijian Lin, Ye Zhu, Kangjie Chen, Minghan Qin, Yu Li, Haoqian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing animatable and high-quality 3D head avatars from monocular videos, especially with realistic relighting, is a valuable task. However, the limited information from single-view input, combined with the complex head poses and facial movements, makes this challenging. Previous methods achieve real-time performance by combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with a parametric head model, but the resulting head quality suffers from inaccurate face tracking and limited expressiveness of the deformation model. These methods also fail to produce realistic effects under novel lighting conditions. To address these issues, we propose HRAvatar, a 3DGS-based method that reconstructs high-fidelity, relightable 3D head avatars. HRAvatar reduces tracking errors through end-to-end optimization and better captures individual facial deformations using learnable blendshapes and learnable linear blend skinning. Additionally, it decomposes head appearance into several physical properties and incorporates physically-based shading to account for environmental lighting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HRAvatar not only reconstructs superior-quality heads but also achieves realistic visual effects under varying lighting conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ao Li, Zongfang Liu, Xinhua Li, Jinghui Zhang, Pengwei Wang, Hu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to leveraging human language for enhancing downstream tasks. However, VLMs such as CLIP face significant limitation: its performance is highly sensitive to prompt template design. Although prompt learning methods can address the sensitivity issue by replacing natural language prompts with learnable ones, they are incomprehensible to humans. Ensuring consistent performance across various prompt templates enables models to adapt seamlessly to diverse phrasings, enhancing their ability to handle downstream tasks without requiring extensive prompt engineering. In this work, we introduce the RobustPrompt Benchmark, a systematic benchmark to evaluate robustness to different prompt templates for VLMs. It includes a dataset with hundreds of carefully designed prompt templates, divided into six types, covering a wide variety of commonly used templates. Beside the benchmark, we propose Modeling Variants of Prompts (MVP), a simple yet effective method that mitigates sensitivity by modeling variants of prompt structures. The innovation of MVP lies in decoupling prompts into templates and class names, and using Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to model the distribution of diverse prompt structures. Experiments across 11 datasets demonstrate that MVP can greatly enhance model robustness to variations in input prompts without a drop in performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saad Sohail, Muhammad Usama, Usman Ghous, Manuel Mazzara, Salvatore Distefano, Muhammad Ahmad</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral-spatial information across hundreds of contiguous bands, enabling precise material discrimination in applications such as environmental monitoring, agriculture, and urban analysis. However, the high dimensionality and spectral variability of HSI data pose significant challenges for feature extraction and classification. This paper presents EnergyFormer, a transformer-based framework designed to address these challenges through three key innovations: (1) Multi-Head Energy Attention (MHEA), which optimizes an energy function to selectively enhance critical spectral-spatial features, improving feature discrimination; (2) Fourier Position Embedding (FoPE), which adaptively encodes spectral and spatial dependencies to reinforce long-range interactions; and (3) Enhanced Convolutional Block Attention Module (ECBAM), which selectively amplifies informative wavelength bands and spatial structures, enhancing representation learning. Extensive experiments on the WHU-Hi-HanChuan, Salinas, and Pavia University datasets demonstrate that EnergyFormer achieves exceptional overall accuracies of 99.28\%, 98.63\%, and 98.72\%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art CNN, transformer, and Mamba-based models.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08250">Aligning Text to Image in Diffusion Models is Easier Than You Think</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaa-Yeon Lee, Byunghee Cha, Jeongsol Kim, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent advancements in generative modeling have significantly improved text-image alignment, some residual misalignment between text and image representations still remains. Although many approaches have attempted to address this issue by fine-tuning models using various reward models, etc., we revisit the challenge from the perspective of representation alignment-an approach that has gained popularity with the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA). We first argue that conventional text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, typically trained on paired image and text data (i.e., positive pairs) by minimizing score matching or flow matching losses, is suboptimal from the standpoint of representation alignment. Instead, a better alignment can be achieved through contrastive learning that leverages both positive and negative pairs. To achieve this efficiently even with pretrained models, we introduce a lightweight contrastive fine tuning strategy called SoftREPA that uses soft text tokens. This approach improves alignment with minimal computational overhead by adding fewer than 1M trainable parameters to the pretrained model. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method explicitly increases the mutual information between text and image representations, leading to enhanced semantic consistency. Experimental results across text-to-image generation and text-guided image editing tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the semantic consistency of T2I generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hesen Chen, Junyan Wang, Zhiyu Tan, Hao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern diffusion models encounter a fundamental trade-off between training efficiency and generation quality. While existing representation alignment methods, such as REPA, accelerate convergence through patch-wise alignment, they often fail to capture structural relationships within visual representations and ensure global distribution consistency between pretrained encoders and denoising networks. To address these limitations, we introduce SARA, a hierarchical alignment framework that enforces multi-level representation constraints: (1) patch-wise alignment to preserve local semantic details, (2) autocorrelation matrix alignment to maintain structural consistency within representations, and (3) adversarial distribution alignment to mitigate global representation discrepancies. Unlike previous approaches, SARA explicitly models both intra-representation correlations via self-similarity matrices and inter-distribution coherence via adversarial alignment, enabling comprehensive alignment across local and global scales. Experiments on ImageNet-256 show that SARA achieves an FID of 1.36 while converging twice as fast as REPA, surpassing recent state-of-the-art image generation methods. This work establishes a systematic paradigm for optimizing diffusion training through hierarchical representation alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junying Wang, Hongyuan Zhang, Yuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent Customized Portrait Generation (CPG) methods, taking a facial image and a textual prompt as inputs, have attracted substantial attention. Although these methods generate high-fidelity portraits, they fail to prevent the generated portraits from being tracked and misused by malicious face recognition systems. To address this, this paper proposes a Customized Portrait Generation framework with facial Adversarial attacks (Adv-CPG). Specifically, to achieve facial privacy protection, we devise a lightweight local ID encryptor and an encryption enhancer. They implement progressive double-layer encryption protection by directly injecting the target identity and adding additional identity guidance, respectively. Furthermore, to accomplish fine-grained and personalized portrait generation, we develop a multi-modal image customizer capable of generating controlled fine-grained facial features. To the best of our knowledge, Adv-CPG is the first study that introduces facial adversarial attacks into CPG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Adv-CPG, e.g., the average attack success rate of the proposed Adv-CPG is 28.1% and 2.86% higher compared to the SOTA noise-based attack methods and unconstrained attack methods, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengjun Yu, Wei Zhai, Yuhang Yang, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: Human reaction generation represents a significant research domain for interactive AI, as humans constantly interact with their surroundings. Previous works focus mainly on synthesizing the reactive motion given a human motion sequence. This paradigm limits interaction categories to human-human interactions and ignores emotions that may influence reaction generation. In this work, we propose to generate 3D human reactions from RGB videos, which involves a wider range of interaction categories and naturally provides information about expressions that may reflect the subject's emotions. To cope with this task, we present HERO, a simple yet powerful framework for Human rEaction geneRation from videOs. HERO considers both global and frame-level local representations of the video to extract the interaction intention, and then uses the extracted interaction intention to guide the synthesis of the reaction. Besides, local visual representations are continuously injected into the model to maximize the exploitation of the dynamic properties inherent in videos. Furthermore, the ViMo dataset containing paired Video-Motion data is collected to support the task. In addition to human-human interactions, these video-motion pairs also cover animal-human interactions and scene-human interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our methodology. The code and dataset will be publicly available at https://jackyu6.github.io/HERO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Yin, Yangfan He, Miao Zhang, Pengyu Zeng, Tianyi Wang, Shuai Lu, Xueqian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning and improving large language models through human preference feedback has become a mainstream approach, but it has rarely been applied to the field of low-light image enhancement. Existing low-light enhancement evaluations typically rely on objective metrics (such as FID, PSNR, etc.), which often result in models that perform well objectively but lack aesthetic quality. Moreover, most low-light enhancement models are primarily designed for global brightening, lacking detailed refinement. Therefore, the generated images often require additional local adjustments, leading to research gaps in practical applications. To bridge this gap, we propose the following innovations: 1) We collect human aesthetic evaluation text pairs and aesthetic scores from multiple low-light image datasets (e.g., LOL, LOL2, LOM, DCIM, MEF, etc.) to train a low-light image aesthetic evaluation model, supplemented by an optimization algorithm designed to fine-tune the diffusion model. 2) We propose a prompt-driven brightness adjustment module capable of performing fine-grained brightness and aesthetic adjustments for specific instances or regions. 3) We evaluate our method alongside existing state-of-the-art algorithms on mainstream benchmarks. Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms traditional methods in terms of visual quality but also provides greater flexibility and controllability, paving the way for improved aesthetic quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fine-grained control of text-to-image diffusion transformer models (DiT) remains a critical challenge for practical deployment. While recent advances such as OminiControl and others have enabled a controllable generation of diverse control signals, these methods face significant computational inefficiency when handling long conditional inputs. We present OminiControl2, an efficient framework that achieves efficient image-conditional image generation. OminiControl2 introduces two key innovations: (1) a dynamic compression strategy that streamlines conditional inputs by preserving only the most semantically relevant tokens during generation, and (2) a conditional feature reuse mechanism that computes condition token features only once and reuses them across denoising steps. These architectural improvements preserve the original framework's parameter efficiency and multi-modal versatility while dramatically reducing computational costs. Our experiments demonstrate that OminiControl2 reduces conditional processing overhead by over 90% compared to its predecessor, achieving an overall 5.9$\times$ speedup in multi-conditional generation scenarios. This efficiency enables the practical implementation of complex, multi-modal control for high-quality image synthesis with DiT models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sachin Verma, Frank Lindseth, Gabriel Kiss</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential for analyzing highdefinition remote sensing images (HRSIs) because it allows the precise classification of objects and regions at the pixel level. However, remote sensing data present challenges owing to geographical location, weather, and environmental variations, making it difficult for semantic segmentation models to generalize across diverse scenarios. Existing methods are often limited to specific data domains and require expert annotators and specialized equipment for semantic labeling. In this study, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation technique for remote sensing semantic segmentation by utilizing geographical coordinates that are readily accessible in remote sensing setups as metadata in a dataset. To bridge the domain gap, we propose a novel approach that considers the combination of an image\'s location encoding trait and the spherical nature of Earth\'s surface. Our proposed SegDesicNet module regresses the GRID positional encoding of the geo coordinates projected over the unit sphere to obtain the domain loss. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SegDesicNet outperforms state of the art domain adaptation methods in remote sensing image segmentation, achieving an improvement of approximately ~6% in the mean intersection over union (MIoU) with a ~ 27\% drop in parameter count on benchmarked subsets of the publicly available FLAIR #1 dataset. We also benchmarked our method performance on the custom split of the ISPRS Potsdam dataset. Our algorithm seeks to reduce the modeling disparity between artificial neural networks and human comprehension of the physical world, making the technology more human centric and scalable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Liu, Feiyu Tan, Qi Xie, Qian Zhao, Deyu Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Burst image processing (BIP), which captures and integrates multiple frames into a single high-quality image, is widely used in consumer cameras. As a typical BIP task, Burst Image Super-Resolution (BISR) has achieved notable progress through deep learning in recent years. Existing BISR methods typically involve three key stages: alignment, upsampling, and fusion, often in varying orders and implementations. Among these stages, alignment is particularly critical for ensuring accurate feature matching and further reconstruction. However, existing methods often rely on techniques such as deformable convolutions and optical flow to realize alignment, which either focus only on local transformations or lack theoretical grounding, thereby limiting their performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework for BISR, featuring an equivariant convolution-based alignment, ensuring consistent transformations between the image and feature domains. This enables the alignment transformation to be learned via explicit supervision in the image domain and easily applied in the feature domain in a theoretically sound way, effectively improving alignment accuracy. Additionally, we design an effective reconstruction module with advanced deep architectures for upsampling and fusion to obtain the final BISR result. Extensive experiments on BISR benchmarks show the superior performance of our approach in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivica Obadic, Dmitry Kangin, Dario Oliveira, Plamen P Angelov, Xiao Xiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models based on graph neural networks have emerged as a popular approach for solving computer vision problems. They encode the image into a graph structure and can be beneficial for efficiently capturing the long-range dependencies typically present in remote sensing imagery. However, an important drawback of these methods is their black-box nature which may hamper their wider usage in critical applications. In this work, we tackle the self-interpretability of the graph-based vision models by proposing our Interpretable Window Vision GNN (i-WiViG) approach, which provides explanations by automatically identifying the relevant subgraphs for the model prediction. This is achieved with window-based image graph processing that constrains the node receptive field to a local image region and by using a self-interpretable graph bottleneck that ranks the importance of the long-range relations between the image regions. We evaluate our approach to remote sensing classification and regression tasks, showing it achieves competitive performance while providing inherent and faithful explanations through the identified relations. Further, the quantitative evaluation reveals that our model reduces the infidelity of post-hoc explanations compared to other Vision GNN models, without sacrificing explanation sparsity.</p>

We propose 1LoRA (Summation Low-Rank Adaptation), a compute, parameter and memory efficient fine-tuning method which uses the feature sum as fixed compression and a single trainable vector as decompression. Differently from state-of-the-art PEFT methods like LoRA, VeRA, and the recent MoRA, 1LoRA uses fewer parameters per layer, reducing the memory footprint and the computational cost. We extensively evaluate our method against state-of-the-art PEFT methods on multiple fine-tuning tasks, and show that our method not only outperforms them, but is also more parameter, memory and computationally efficient. Moreover, thanks to its memory efficiency, 1LoRA allows to fine-tune more evenly across layers, instead of focusing on specific ones (e.g. attention layers), improving performance further.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumya Shamarao Jahagirdar, Jayasree Saha, C V Jawahar</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning multimodal video understanding typically relies on datasets comprising video clips paired with manually annotated captions. However, this becomes even more challenging when dealing with long-form videos, lasting from minutes to hours, in educational and news domains due to the need for more annotators with subject expertise. Hence, there arises a need for automated solutions. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to capture concise and informative content that allows the comprehension of entire videos by leveraging Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies. ASR provides textual content from audio, while OCR extracts textual content from specific frames. This paper introduces a dataset comprising long-form lectures and news videos. We present baseline approaches to understand their limitations on this dataset and advocate for exploring prompt engineering techniques to comprehend long-form multimodal video datasets comprehensively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runwei Guan, Jianan Liu, Ningwei Ouyang, Daizong Liu, Xiaolou Sun, Lianqing Zheng, Ming Xu, Yutao Yue, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied outdoor scene understanding forms the foundation for autonomous agents to perceive, analyze, and react to dynamic driving environments. However, existing 3D understanding is predominantly based on 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs), collecting and processing limited scene-aware contexts. Instead, compared to the 2D planar visual information, point cloud sensors like LiDAR offer rich depth information and fine-grained 3D representations of objects. Meanwhile, the emerging 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar is capable of detecting the motion trend, velocity, and reflection intensity of each object. Therefore, the integration of these two modalities provides more flexible querying conditions for natural language, enabling more accurate 3D visual grounding. To this end, in this paper, we exploratively propose a novel method called TPCNet, the first outdoor 3D visual grounding model upon the paradigm of prompt-guided point cloud sensor combination, including both LiDAR and radar contexts. To adaptively balance the features of these two sensors required by the prompt, we have designed a multi-fusion paradigm called Two-Stage Heterogeneous Modal Adaptive Fusion. Specifically, this paradigm initially employs Bidirectional Agent Cross-Attention (BACA), which feeds dual-sensor features, characterized by global receptive fields, to the text features for querying. Additionally, we have designed a Dynamic Gated Graph Fusion (DGGF) module to locate the regions of interest identified by the queries. To further enhance accuracy, we innovatively devise an C3D-RECHead, based on the nearest object edge. Our experiments have demonstrated that our TPCNet, along with its individual modules, achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both the Talk2Radar and Talk2Car datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Huang, Binzhong He, Yanhan Chen, Zhili Liu, Xinyue Wang, Binxuan Li, Qiegen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced PET image re-construction, achieving remarkable improvements in image quality through direct training on sinogram or image data. Traditional methods often utilize masks for inpainting tasks, but their incorporation into PET reconstruction frameworks introduces transformative potential. In this study, we pro-pose an advanced PET reconstruction framework called Diffusion tRansformer mEets rAndom Masks (DREAM). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate mask mechanisms into both the sinogram domain and the latent space, pioneering their role in PET reconstruction and demonstrating their ability to enhance reconstruction fidelity and efficiency. The framework employs a high-dimensional stacking approach, transforming masked data from two to three dimensions to expand the solution space and enable the model to capture richer spatial rela-tionships. Additionally, a mask-driven latent space is de-signed to accelerate the diffusion process by leveraging sinogram-driven and mask-driven compact priors, which reduce computational complexity while preserving essen-tial data characteristics. A hierarchical masking strategy is also introduced, guiding the model from focusing on fi-ne-grained local details in the early stages to capturing broader global patterns over time. This progressive ap-proach ensures a balance between detailed feature preservation and comprehensive context understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that DREAM not only improves the overall quality of reconstructed PET images but also preserves critical clinical details, highlighting its potential to advance PET imaging technology. By inte-grating compact priors and hierarchical masking, DREAM offers a promising and efficient avenue for future research and application in PET imaging.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongjun Tu, Peng Ye, Dongzhan Zhou, Lei Bai, Gang Yu, Tao Chen, Wanli Ouyang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) stand out in various tasks but still struggle with hallucinations. While recent training-free mitigation methods mostly introduce additional inference overhead via retrospection strategy and contrastive decoding, we propose attention reallocation (AttnReal) to mitigate hallucinations with nearly zero extra cost. Our approach is motivated by the key observations that, MLLM's unreasonable attention distribution causes features to be dominated by historical output tokens, which further contributes to hallucinated responses because of the distribution gap between different token types. Based on the observations, AttnReal recycles excessive attention from output tokens and reallocates it to visual tokens, which reduces MLLM's reliance on language priors and ensures the decoding process depends more on the visual inputs. More interestingly, we find that, by controlling the intensity of AttnReal, we can achieve a wide-range trade-off between the response faithfulness and overall performance. Comprehensive results from different benchmarks validate the effectiveness of AttnReal across six open-source MLLMs and three decoding strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Environment understanding in egocentric videos is an important step for applications like robotics, augmented reality and assistive technologies. These videos are characterized by dynamic interactions and a strong dependence on the wearer engagement with the environment. Traditional approaches often focus on isolated clips or fail to integrate rich semantic and geometric information, limiting scene comprehension. We introduce Dynamic Image-Video Feature Fields (DIV FF), a framework that decomposes the egocentric scene into persistent, dynamic, and actor based components while integrating both image and video language features. Our model enables detailed segmentation, captures affordances, understands the surroundings and maintains consistent understanding over time. DIV-FF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in dynamically evolving scenarios, demonstrating its potential to advance long term, spatio temporal scene understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chanyoung Kim, Dayun Ju, Jinyeong Kim, Woojung Han, Roberto Alcover-Couso, Seong Jae Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: As recent text-conditioned diffusion models have enabled the generation of high-quality images, concerns over their potential misuse have also grown. This issue is critical in the medical domain, where text-conditioned generated medical images could enable insurance fraud or falsified records, highlighting the urgent need for reliable safeguards against unethical use. While watermarking techniques have emerged as a promising solution in general image domains, their direct application to medical imaging presents significant challenges. A key challenge is preserving fine-grained disease manifestations, as even minor distortions from a watermark may lead to clinical misinterpretation, which compromises diagnostic integrity. To overcome this gap, we present MedSign, a deep learning-based watermarking framework specifically designed for text-to-medical image synthesis, which preserves pathologically significant regions by adaptively adjusting watermark strength. Specifically, we generate a pathology localization map using cross-attention between medical text tokens and the diffusion denoising network, aggregating token-wise attention across layers, heads, and time steps. Leveraging this map, we optimize the LDM decoder to incorporate watermarking during image synthesis, ensuring cohesive integration while minimizing interference in diagnostically critical regions. Experimental results show that our MedSign preserves diagnostic integrity while ensuring watermark robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image quality and detection accuracy on MIMIC-CXR and OIA-ODIR datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Plant disease detection is a critical task in agriculture, directly impacting crop yield, food security, and sustainable farming practices. This study proposes FourCropNet, a novel deep learning model designed to detect diseases in multiple crops, including CottonLeaf, Grape, Soybean, and Corn. The model leverages an advanced architecture comprising residual blocks for efficient feature extraction, attention mechanisms to enhance focus on disease-relevant regions, and lightweight layers for computational efficiency. These components collectively enable FourCropNet to achieve superior performance across varying datasets and class complexities, from single-crop datasets to combined datasets with 15 classes. The proposed model was evaluated on diverse datasets, demonstrating high accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1 scores. Notably, FourCropNet achieved the highest accuracy of 99.7% for Grape, 99.5% for Corn, and 95.3% for the combined dataset. Its scalability and ability to generalize across datasets underscore its robustness. Comparative analysis shows that FourCropNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models such as MobileNet, VGG16, and EfficientNet across various metrics. FourCropNet's innovative design and consistent performance make it a reliable solution for real-time disease detection in agriculture. This model has the potential to assist farmers in timely disease diagnosis, reducing economic losses and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqi Zhang, Hao Zhu, Jingyi Zhao, Qi Zhang, Xun Cao, Zhan Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D classification with point cloud input is a fundamental problem in 3D vision. However, due to the discrete nature and the insufficient material description of point cloud representations, there are ambiguities in distinguishing wire-like and flat surfaces, as well as transparent or reflective objects. To address these issues, we propose Gaussian Splatting (GS) point cloud-based 3D classification. We find that the scale and rotation coefficients in the GS point cloud help characterize surface types. Specifically, wire-like surfaces consist of multiple slender Gaussian ellipsoids, while flat surfaces are composed of a few flat Gaussian ellipsoids. Additionally, the opacity in the GS point cloud represents the transparency characteristics of objects. As a result, ambiguities in point cloud-based 3D classification can be mitigated utilizing GS point cloud as input. To verify the effectiveness of GS point cloud input, we construct the first real-world GS point cloud dataset in the community, which includes 20 categories with 200 objects in each category. Experiments not only validate the superiority of GS point cloud input, especially in distinguishing ambiguous objects, but also demonstrate the generalization ability across different classification methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Qiu, Xiang Li, Jason Kuen, Hao Chen, Xiaohao Xu, Jiuxiang Gu, Yinyi Luo, Bhiksha Raj, Zhe Lin, Marios Savvides</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent image generation schemes typically capture image distribution in a pre-constructed latent space relying on a frozen image tokenizer. Though the performance of tokenizer plays an essential role to the successful generation, its current evaluation metrics (e.g. rFID) fail to precisely assess the tokenizer and correlate its performance to the generation quality (e.g. gFID). In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the reason for the discrepancy of reconstruction and generation qualities in a discrete latent space, and, from which, we propose a novel plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme to facilitate latent space construction. Specifically, a latent perturbation approach is proposed to simulate sampling noises, i.e., the unexpected tokens sampled, from the generative process. With the latent perturbation, we further propose (1) a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, i.e., pFID, which successfully correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality and (2) a plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the robustness of tokenizer thus boosting the generation quality and convergence speed. Extensive benchmarking are conducted with 11 advanced discrete image tokenizers with 2 autoregressive generation models to validate our approach. The tokenizer trained with our proposed latent perturbation achieve a notable 1.60 gFID with classifier-free guidance (CFG) and 3.45 gFID without CFG with a $\sim$400M generator.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaiyu Chen, Yuqing Wang, Liangliang Nan, Xiao Xiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing polygonal surface reconstruction methods heavily depend on input completeness and struggle with incomplete point clouds. We argue that while current point cloud completion techniques may recover missing points, they are not optimized for polygonal surface reconstruction, where the parametric representation of underlying surfaces remains overlooked. To address this gap, we introduce parametric completion, a novel paradigm for point cloud completion, which recovers parametric primitives instead of individual points to convey high-level geometric structures. Our presented approach, PaCo, enables high-quality polygonal surface reconstruction by leveraging plane proxies that encapsulate both plane parameters and inlier points, proving particularly effective in challenging scenarios with highly incomplete data. Comprehensive evaluations of our approach on the ABC dataset establish its effectiveness with superior performance and set a new standard for polygonal surface reconstruction from incomplete data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runling Long, Yunlong Wang, Jia Wan, Xiang Deng, Xinting Zhu, Weili Guan, Antoni B. Chan, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Occlusion is one of the fundamental challenges in crowd counting. In the community, various data-driven approaches have been developed to address this issue, yet their effectiveness is limited. This is mainly because most existing crowd counting datasets on which the methods are trained are based on passive cameras, restricting their ability to fully sense the environment. Recently, embodied navigation methods have shown significant potential in precise object detection in interactive scenes. These methods incorporate active camera settings, holding promise in addressing the fundamental issues in crowd counting. However, most existing methods are designed for indoor navigation, showing unknown performance in analyzing complex object distribution in large scale scenes, such as crowds. Besides, most existing embodied navigation datasets are indoor scenes with limited scale and object quantity, preventing them from being introduced into dense crowd analysis. Based on this, a novel task, Embodied Crowd Counting (ECC), is proposed. We first build up an interactive simulator, Embodied Crowd Counting Dataset (ECCD), which enables large scale scenes and large object quantity. A prior probability distribution that approximates realistic crowd distribution is introduced to generate crowds. Then, a zero-shot navigation method (ZECC) is proposed. This method contains a MLLM driven coarse-to-fine navigation mechanism, enabling active Z-axis exploration, and a normal-line-based crowd distribution analysis method for fine counting. Experimental results against baselines show that the proposed method achieves the best trade-off between counting accuracy and navigation cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoquan Jiang, Yunfan Yang, Rui Hu, Jitao Sang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt tuning of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP, has demonstrated the ability to rapidly adapt to various downstream tasks. However, recent studies indicate that tuned VLMs may suffer from the problem of spurious correlations, where the model relies on spurious features (e.g. background and gender) in the data. This may lead to the model having worse robustness in out-of-distribution data. Standard methods for eliminating spurious correlation typically require us to know the spurious attribute labels of each sample, which is hard in the real world. In this work, we explore improving the group robustness of prompt tuning in VLMs without relying on manual annotation of spurious features. We notice the zero - shot image recognition ability of VLMs and use this ability to identify spurious features, thus avoiding the cost of manual annotation. By leveraging pseudo-spurious attribute annotations, we further propose a method to automatically adjust the training weights of different groups. Extensive experiments show that our approach efficiently improves the worst-group accuracy on CelebA, Waterbirds, and MetaShift datasets, achieving the best robustness gap between the worst-group accuracy and the overall accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate and efficient 3D segmentation is essential for both clinical and research applications. While foundation models like SAM have revolutionized interactive segmentation, their 2D design and domain shift limitations make them ill-suited for 3D medical images. Current adaptations address some of these challenges but remain limited, either lacking volumetric awareness, offering restricted interactivity, or supporting only a small set of structures and modalities. Usability also remains a challenge, as current tools are rarely integrated into established imaging platforms and often rely on cumbersome web-based interfaces with restricted functionality. We introduce nnInteractive, the first comprehensive 3D interactive open-set segmentation method. It supports diverse prompts-including points, scribbles, boxes, and a novel lasso prompt-while leveraging intuitive 2D interactions to generate full 3D segmentations. Trained on 120+ diverse volumetric 3D datasets (CT, MRI, PET, 3D Microscopy, etc.), nnInteractive sets a new state-of-the-art in accuracy, adaptability, and usability. Crucially, it is the first method integrated into widely used image viewers (e.g., Napari, MITK), ensuring broad accessibility for real-world clinical and research applications. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates that nnInteractive far surpasses existing methods, setting a new standard for AI-driven interactive 3D segmentation. nnInteractive is publicly available: https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/napari-nninteractive (Napari plugin), https://www.mitk.org/MITK-nnInteractive (MITK integration), https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnInteractive (Python backend).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingsong Xie, Zhao Zhang, Zhe Huang, Yanhao Zhang, Haonan Lu, Zhenyu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image tokenization has significantly advanced visual generation and multimodal modeling, particularly when paired with autoregressive models. However, current methods face challenges in balancing efficiency and fidelity: high-resolution image reconstruction either requires an excessive number of tokens or compromises critical details through token reduction. To resolve this, we propose Latent Consistency Tokenizer (Layton) that bridges discrete visual tokens with the compact latent space of pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling efficient representation of 1024x1024 images using only 256 tokens-a 16 times compression over VQGAN. Layton integrates a transformer encoder, a quantized codebook, and a latent consistency decoder. Direct application of LDM as the decoder results in color and brightness discrepancies. Thus, we convert it to latent consistency decoder, reducing multi-step sampling to 1-2 steps for direct pixel-level supervision. Experiments demonstrate Layton's superiority in high-fidelity reconstruction, with 10.8 reconstruction Frechet Inception Distance on MSCOCO-2017 5K benchmark for 1024x1024 image reconstruction. We also extend Layton to a text-to-image generation model, LaytonGen, working in autoregression. It achieves 0.73 score on GenEval benchmark, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods. The code and model will be released.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the first large reconstruction model, Twinner, capable of recovering a scene's illumination as well as an object's geometry and material properties from only a few posed images. Twinner is based on the Large Reconstruction Model and innovates in three key ways: 1) We introduce a memory-efficient voxel-grid transformer whose memory scales only quadratically with the size of the voxel grid. 2) To deal with scarcity of high-quality ground-truth PBR-shaded models, we introduce a large fully-synthetic dataset of procedurally-generated PBR-textured objects lit with varied illumination. 3) To narrow the synthetic-to-real gap, we finetune the model on real life datasets by means of a differentiable physically-based shading model, eschewing the need for ground-truth illumination or material properties which are challenging to obtain in real life. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model on the real life StanfordORB benchmark where, given few input views, we achieve reconstruction quality significantly superior to existing feedforward reconstruction networks, and comparable to significantly slower per-scene optimization methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Susu Sun, Dominique van Midden, Geert Litjens, Christian F. Baumgartner</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have succeeded remarkably in histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis. However, most MIL models only offer attention-based explanations that do not faithfully capture the model's decision mechanism and do not allow human-model interaction. To address these limitations, we introduce ProtoMIL, an inherently interpretable MIL model for WSI analysis that offers user-friendly explanations and supports human intervention. Our approach employs a sparse autoencoder to discover human-interpretable concepts from the image feature space, which are then used to train ProtoMIL. The model represents predictions as linear combinations of concepts, making the decision process transparent. Furthermore, ProtoMIL allows users to perform model interventions by altering the input concepts. Experiments on two widely used pathology datasets demonstrate that ProtoMIL achieves a classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art MIL models while offering intuitively understandable explanations. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can eliminate reliance on diagnostically irrelevant information via human intervention, guiding the model toward being right for the right reason.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyao Fang, Pengyuan Lyu, Jingjing Wu, Chengquan Zhang, Jun Yu, Guangming Lu, Wenjie Pei</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene text editing aims to modify text content within scene images while maintaining style consistency. Traditional methods achieve this by explicitly disentangling style and content from the source image and then fusing the style with the target content, while ensuring content consistency using a pre-trained recognition model. Despite notable progress, these methods suffer from complex pipelines, leading to suboptimal performance in complex scenarios. In this work, we introduce Recognition-Synergistic Scene Text Editing (RS-STE), a novel approach that fully exploits the intrinsic synergy of text recognition for editing. Our model seamlessly integrates text recognition with text editing within a unified framework, and leverages the recognition model's ability to implicitly disentangle style and content while ensuring content consistency. Specifically, our approach employs a multi-modal parallel decoder based on transformer architecture, which predicts both text content and stylized images in parallel. Additionally, our cyclic self-supervised fine-tuning strategy enables effective training on unpaired real-world data without ground truth, enhancing style and content consistency through a twice-cyclic generation process.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanjie Zhang, Quanwei Zhang, Guangyuan Li, Junsheng Luan, Mengyuan Yang, Yun Wang, Lei Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Artistic style transfer aims to transfer the learned style onto an arbitrary content image. However, most existing style transfer methods can only render consistent artistic stylized images, making it difficult for users to get enough stylized images to enjoy. To solve this issue, we propose a novel artistic style transfer framework called DyArtbank, which can generate diverse and highly realistic artistic stylized images. Specifically, we introduce a Dynamic Style Prompt ArtBank (DSPA), a set of learnable parameters. It can learn and store the style information from the collection of artworks, dynamically guiding pre-trained stable diffusion to generate diverse and highly realistic artistic stylized images. DSPA can also generate random artistic image samples with the learned style information, providing a new idea for data augmentation. Besides, a Key Content Feature Prompt (KCFP) module is proposed to provide sufficient content prompts for pre-trained stable diffusion to preserve the detailed structure of the input content image. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. Code is available: https://github.com/Jamie-Cheung/DyArtbank</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yansong Guo, Jie Hu, Yansong Qu, Liujuan Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in interactive 3D segmentation from 2D images have demonstrated impressive performance. However, current models typically require extensive scene-specific training to accurately reconstruct and segment objects, which limits their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we introduce WildSeg3D, an efficient approach that enables the segmentation of arbitrary 3D objects across diverse environments using a feed-forward mechanism. A key challenge of this feed-forward approach lies in the accumulation of 3D alignment errors across multiple 2D views, which can lead to inaccurate 3D segmentation results. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Global Aligning (DGA), a technique that improves the accuracy of global multi-view alignment by focusing on difficult-to-match 3D points across images, using a dynamic adjustment function. Additionally, for real-time interactive segmentation, we introduce Multi-view Group Mapping (MGM), a method that utilizes an object mask cache to integrate multi-view segmentations and respond rapidly to user prompts. WildSeg3D demonstrates robust generalization across arbitrary scenes, thereby eliminating the need for scene-specific training. Specifically, WildSeg3D not only attains the accuracy of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods but also achieves a $40\times$ speedup compared to existing SOTA models. Our code will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Chaddad, Yan Hu, Yihang Wu, Binbin Wen, Reem Kateb</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective. This paper presents an overview of generalizable and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in deep learning (DL) for medical imaging, aimed at addressing the urgent need for transparency and explainability in clinical applications.
  Methodology. We propose to use four CNNs in three medical datasets (brain tumor, skin cancer, and chest x-ray) for medical image classification tasks. In addition, we perform paired t-tests to show the significance of the differences observed between different methods. Furthermore, we propose to combine ResNet50 with five common XAI techniques to obtain explainable results for model prediction, aiming at improving model transparency. We also involve a quantitative metric (confidence increase) to evaluate the usefulness of XAI techniques.
  Key findings. The experimental results indicate that ResNet50 can achieve feasible accuracy and F1 score in all datasets (e.g., 86.31\% accuracy in skin cancer). Furthermore, the findings show that while certain XAI methods, such as XgradCAM, effectively highlight relevant abnormal regions in medical images, others, like EigenGradCAM, may perform less effectively in specific scenarios. In addition, XgradCAM indicates higher confidence increase (e.g., 0.12 in glioma tumor) compared to GradCAM++ (0.09) and LayerCAM (0.08).
  Implications. Based on the experimental results and recent advancements, we outline future research directions to enhance the robustness and generalizability of DL models in the field of biomedical imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiming Xia, Wenkai Lin, Haoen Xiang, Xun Huang, Siheng Chen, Zhen Dong, Cheng Wang, Chenglu Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised 3D object detection serves as an important solution for offline 3D object annotation. However, due to the data sparsity and limited views, the clustering-based label fitting in unsupervised object detection often generates low-quality pseudo-labels. Multi-agent collaborative dataset, which involves the sharing of complementary observations among agents, holds the potential to break through this bottleneck. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised method that learns to Detect Objects from Multi-Agent LiDAR scans, termed DOtA, without using labels from external. DOtA first uses the internally shared ego-pose and ego-shape of collaborative agents to initialize the detector, leveraging the generalization performance of neural networks to infer preliminary labels. Subsequently,DOtA uses the complementary observations between agents to perform multi-scale encoding on preliminary labels, then decodes high-quality and low-quality labels. These labels are further used as prompts to guide a correct feature learning process, thereby enhancing the performance of the unsupervised object detection task. Extensive experiments on the V2V4Real and OPV2V datasets show that our DOtA outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised 3D object detection methods. Additionally, we also validate the effectiveness of the DOtA labels under various collaborative perception frameworks.The code is available at https://github.com/xmuqimingxia/DOtA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runjian Chen, Wenqi Shao, Bo Zhang, Shaoshuai Shi, Li Jiang, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep-learning-based autonomous driving (AD) perception introduces a promising picture for safe and environment-friendly transportation. However, the over-reliance on real labeled data in LiDAR perception limits the scale of on-road attempts. 3D real world data is notoriously time-and-energy-consuming to annotate and lacks corner cases like rare traffic participants. On the contrary, in simulators like CARLA, generating labeled LiDAR point clouds with corner cases is a piece of cake. However, introducing synthetic point clouds to improve real perception is non-trivial. This stems from two challenges: 1) sample efficiency of simulation datasets 2) simulation-to-real gaps. To overcome both challenges, we propose a plug-and-play method called JiSAM , shorthand for Jittering augmentation, domain-aware backbone and memory-based Sectorized AlignMent. In extensive experiments conducted on the famous AD dataset NuScenes, we demonstrate that, with SOTA 3D object detector, JiSAM is able to utilize the simulation data and only labels on 2.5% available real data to achieve comparable performance to models trained on all real data. Additionally, JiSAM achieves more than 15 mAPs on the objects not labeled in the real training set. We will release models and codes.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08429">Using Powerful Prior Knowledge of Diffusion Model in Deep Unfolding Networks for Image Compressive Sensing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Liao, Yan Shen, Dan Li, Zhongli Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Deep Unfolding Networks (DUNs) have achieved impressive reconstruction quality in the field of image Compressive Sensing (CS) by unfolding iterative optimization algorithms into neural networks. The reconstruction quality of DUNs depends on the learned prior knowledge, so introducing stronger prior knowledge can further improve reconstruction quality. On the other hand, pre-trained diffusion models contain powerful prior knowledge and have a solid theoretical foundation and strong scalability, but it requires a large number of iterative steps to achieve reconstruction. In this paper, we propose to use the powerful prior knowledge of pre-trained diffusion model in DUNs to achieve high-quality reconstruction with less steps for image CS. Specifically, we first design an iterative optimization algorithm named Diffusion Message Passing (DMP), which embeds a pre-trained diffusion model into each iteration process of DMP. Then, we deeply unfold the DMP algorithm into a neural network named DMP-DUN. The proposed DMP-DUN can use lightweight neural networks to achieve mapping from measurement data to the intermediate steps of the reverse diffusion process and directly approximate the divergence of the diffusion model, thereby further improving reconstruction efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our proposed DMP-DUN achieves state-of-the-art performance and requires at least only 2 steps to reconstruct the image.

<p>Abstract: The recent surge in the vehicle market has led to an alarming increase in road accidents. This underscores the critical importance of enhancing road safety measures, particularly for vulnerable road users like motorcyclists. Hence, we introduce the rider intention prediction (RIP) competition that aims to address challenges in rider safety by proactively predicting maneuvers before they occur, thereby strengthening rider safety. This capability enables the riders to react to the potential incorrect maneuvers flagged by advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). We collect a new dataset, namely, rider action anticipation dataset (RAAD) for the competition consisting of two tasks: single-view RIP and multi-view RIP. The dataset incorporates a spectrum of traffic conditions and challenging navigational maneuvers on roads with varying lighting conditions. For the competition, we received seventy-five registrations and five team submissions for inference of which we compared the methods of the top three performing teams on both the RIP tasks: one state-space model (Mamba2) and two learning-based approaches (SVM and CNN-LSTM). The results indicate that the state-space model outperformed the other methods across the entire dataset, providing a balanced performance across maneuver classes. The SVM-based RIP method showed the second-best performance when using random sampling and SMOTE. However, the CNN-LSTM method underperformed, primarily due to class imbalance issues, particularly struggling with minority classes. This paper details the proposed RAAD dataset and provides a summary of the submissions for the RIP 2024 competition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Becker, Chris Wendler, Peter Baylies, Robert West, Christian Wressnegger</p>
<p>Abstract: Instead of performing text-conditioned denoising in the image domain, latent diffusion models (LDMs) operate in latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE), enabling more efficient processing at reduced computational costs. However, while the diffusion process has moved to the latent space, the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) models, as used in many image processing tasks, still operate in pixel space. Doing so requires costly VAE-decoding of latent images before they can be processed. In this paper, we introduce Latent-CLIP, a CLIP model that operates directly in the latent space. We train Latent-CLIP on 2.7B pairs of latent images and descriptive texts, and show that it matches zero-shot classification performance of similarly sized CLIP models on both the ImageNet benchmark and a LDM-generated version of it, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing both real and generated content. Furthermore, we construct Latent-CLIP rewards for reward-based noise optimization (ReNO) and show that they match the performance of their CLIP counterparts on GenEval and T2I-CompBench while cutting the cost of the total pipeline by 21%. Finally, we use Latent-CLIP to guide generation away from harmful content, achieving strong performance on the inappropriate image prompts (I2P) benchmark and a custom evaluation, without ever requiring the costly step of decoding intermediate images.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data visualization of aggregation queries is one of the most common ways of doing data exploration and data science as it can help identify correlations and patterns in the data. We propose DIVAN, a system that automatically normalizes the one-dimensional axes by frequency to generate large numbers of two-dimensional visualizations. DIVAN normalizes the input data via binning to allocate more pixels to data values that appear more frequently in the dataset. DIVAN can utilize either CPUs or Processing-in-Memory (PIM) architectures to quickly calculate aggregates to support the visualizations. On real world datasets, we show that DIVAN generates visualizations that highlight patterns and correlations, some expected and some unexpected. By using PIM, we can calculate aggregates 45%-64% faster than modern CPUs on large datasets. For use cases with 100 million rows and 32 columns, our system is able to compute 4,960 aggregates (each of size 128x128x128) in about a minute.</p>

<p>Abstract: Comprehensive and consistent dynamic scene understanding from camera input is essential for advanced autonomous systems. Traditional camera-based perception tasks like 3D object tracking and semantic occupancy prediction lack either spatial comprehensiveness or temporal consistency.

Furthermore, we propose TrackOcc, a cutting-edge approach that processes image inputs in a streaming, end-to-end manner with 4D panoptic queries to address the proposed task. Leveraging the localization-aware loss, TrackOcc enhances the accuracy of 4D panoptic occupancy tracking without bells and whistles.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han-Wei Kung, Tuomas Varanka, Terence Sim, Nicu Sebe</p>
<p>Abstract: Privacy concerns around ever increasing number of cameras are increasing in today's digital age. Although existing anonymization methods are able to obscure identity information, they often struggle to preserve the utility of the images. In this work, we introduce a training-free method for face anonymization that preserves key non-identity-related attributes. Our approach utilizes a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model without requiring optimization or training. It begins by inverting the input image to recover its initial noise. The noise is then denoised through an identity-conditioned diffusion process, where modified identity embeddings ensure the anonymized face is distinct from the original identity. Our approach also supports localized anonymization, giving users control over which facial regions are anonymized or kept intact. Comprehensive evaluations against state-of-the-art methods show our approach excels in anonymization, attribute preservation, and image quality. Its flexibility, robustness, and practicality make it well-suited for real-world applications. Code and data can be found at https://github.com/hanweikung/nullface .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pouya Shaeri, Saud AlKhaled, Ariane Middel</p>
<p>Abstract: Outdoor thermal comfort is a critical determinant of urban livability, particularly in hot desert climates where extreme heat poses challenges to public health, energy consumption, and urban planning. Mean Radiant Temperature ($T_{mrt}$) is a key parameter for evaluating outdoor thermal comfort, especially in urban environments where radiation dynamics significantly impact human thermal exposure. Traditional methods of estimating $T_{mrt}$ rely on field measurements and computational simulations, both of which are resource intensive. This study introduces a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach that integrates shortwave and longwave radiation modeling with deep learning techniques. By leveraging a multimodal dataset that includes meteorological data, built environment characteristics, and fisheye image-derived shading information, our model enhances predictive accuracy while maintaining physical consistency. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PINN framework outperforms conventional deep learning models, with the best-performing configurations achieving an RMSE of 3.50 and an $R^2$ of 0.88. This approach highlights the potential of physics-informed machine learning in bridging the gap between computational modeling and real-world applications, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for urban thermal comfort assessments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current 3D stylization techniques primarily focus on static scenes, while our world is inherently dynamic, filled with moving objects and changing environments. Existing style transfer methods primarily target appearance -- such as color and texture transformation -- but often neglect the geometric characteristics of the style image, which are crucial for achieving a complete and coherent stylization effect. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose GAS-NeRF, a novel approach for joint appearance and geometry stylization in dynamic Radiance Fields. Our method leverages depth maps to extract and transfer geometric details into the radiance field, followed by appearance transfer. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the stylization quality while maintaining temporal coherence in dynamic scenes.</p>

<p>Abstract: The generalization performance of AI-generated image detection remains a critical challenge. Although most existing methods perform well in detecting images from generative models included in the training set, their accuracy drops significantly when faced with images from unseen generators. To address this limitation, we propose a novel detection method based on the fractal self-similarity of the spectrum, a common feature among images generated by different models. Specifically, we demonstrate that AI-generated images exhibit fractal-like spectral growth through periodic extension and low-pass filtering. This observation motivates us to exploit the similarity among different fractal branches of the spectrum. Instead of directly analyzing the spectrum, our method mitigates the impact of varying spectral characteristics across different generators, improving detection performance for images from unseen models. Experiments on a public benchmark demonstrated the generalized detection performance across both GANs and diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengyi Zhang, Huitong Yang, Zheng Zhang, Zi Huang, Yadan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised 3D occupancy prediction offers a promising solution for understanding complex driving scenes without requiring costly 3D annotations. However, training dense voxel decoders to capture fine-grained geometry and semantics can demand hundreds of GPU hours, and such models often fail to adapt to varying voxel resolutions or new classes without extensive retraining. To overcome these limitations, we propose a practical and flexible test-time occupancy prediction framework termed TT-GaussOcc. Our approach incrementally optimizes time-aware 3D Gaussians instantiated from raw sensor streams at runtime, enabling voxelization at arbitrary user-specified resolution. Specifically, TT-GaussOcc operates in a "lift-move-voxel" symphony: we first "lift" surrounding-view semantics obtained from 2D vision foundation models (VLMs) to instantiate Gaussians at non-empty 3D space; Next, we "move" dynamic Gaussians from previous frames along estimated Gaussian scene flow to complete appearance and eliminate trailing artifacts of fast-moving objects, while accumulating static Gaussians to enforce temporal consistency; Finally, we mitigate inherent noises in semantic predictions and scene flow vectors by periodically smoothing neighboring Gaussians during optimization, using proposed trilateral RBF kernels that jointly consider color, semantic, and spatial affinities. The historical static and current dynamic Gaussians are then combined and voxelized to generate occupancy prediction. Extensive experiments on Occ3D and nuCraft with varying voxel resolutions demonstrate that TT-GaussOcc surpasses self-supervised baselines by 46% on mIoU without any offline training, and supports finer voxel resolutions at 2.6 FPS inference speed.</p>

<p>Abstract: It has been a longstanding goal within image captioning to move beyond a dependence on object detection. We investigate using superpixels coupled with Vision Language Models (VLMs) to bridge the gap between detector-based captioning architectures and those that solely pretrain on large datasets. Our novel superpixel approach ensures that the model receives object-like features whilst the use of VLMs provides our model with open set object understanding. Furthermore, we extend our architecture to make use of multi-resolution inputs, allowing our model to view images in different levels of detail, and use an attention mechanism to determine which parts are most relevant to the caption. We demonstrate our model's performance with multiple VLMs and through a range of ablations detailing the impact of different architectural choices. Our full model achieves a competitive CIDEr score of $136.9$ on the COCO Karpathy split.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Wu, Sijun Dong, Xiaoliang Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Change detection is a crucial and widely applied task in remote sensing, aimed at identifying and analyzing changes occurring in the same geographical area over time. Due to variability in acquisition conditions, bi-temporal remote sensing images often exhibit significant differences in image style. Even with the powerful generalization capabilities of DNNs, these unpredictable style variations between bi-temporal images inevitably affect model's ability to accurately detect changed areas. To address issue above, we propose the Content Focuser Network (CFNet), which takes content-aware strategy as a key insight. CFNet employs EfficientNet-B5 as the backbone for feature extraction. To enhance the model's focus on the content features of images while mitigating the misleading effects of style features, we develop a constraint strategy that prioritizes the content features of bi-temporal images, termed Content-Aware. Furthermore, to enable the model to flexibly focus on changed and unchanged areas according to the requirements of different stages, we design a reweighting module based on the cosine distance between bi-temporal image features, termed Focuser. CFNet achieve outstanding performance across three well-known change detection datasets: CLCD (F1: 81.41%, IoU: 68.65%), LEVIR-CD (F1: 92.18%, IoU: 85.49%), and SYSU-CD (F1: 82.89%, IoU: 70.78%).

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08507">Referring to Any Person</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qing Jiang, Lin Wu, Zhaoyang Zeng, Tianhe Ren, Yuda Xiong, Yihao Chen, Qin Liu, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans are undoubtedly the most important participants in computer vision, and the ability to detect any individual given a natural language description, a task we define as referring to any person, holds substantial practical value. However, we find that existing models generally fail to achieve real-world usability, and current benchmarks are limited by their focus on one-to-one referring, that hinder progress in this area. In this work, we revisit this task from three critical perspectives: task definition, dataset design, and model architecture. We first identify five aspects of referable entities and three distinctive characteristics of this task. Next, we introduce HumanRef, a novel dataset designed to tackle these challenges and better reflect real-world applications. From a model design perspective, we integrate a multimodal large language model with an object detection framework, constructing a robust referring model named RexSeek. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art models, which perform well on commonly used benchmarks like RefCOCO/+/g, struggle with HumanRef due to their inability to detect multiple individuals. In contrast, RexSeek not only excels in human referring but also generalizes effectively to common object referring, making it broadly applicable across various perception tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Da-Wei Zhou, Kai-Wen Li, Jingyi Ning, Han-Jia Ye, Lijun Zhang, De-Chuan Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables learning systems to continuously adapt to evolving data streams. With the advancement of pre-training, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) offers a promising starting point for CIL. However, CLIP makes decisions by matching visual embeddings to class names, overlooking the rich contextual information conveyed through language. For instance, the concept of ``cat'' can be decomposed into features like tail, fur, and face for recognition. Besides, since the model is continually updated, these detailed features are overwritten in CIL, requiring external knowledge for compensation. In this paper, we introduce ExterNal knowledGe INjEction (ENGINE) for CLIP-based CIL. To enhance knowledge transfer from outside the dataset, we propose a dual-branch injection tuning framework that encodes informative knowledge from both visual and textual modalities. The visual branch is enhanced with data augmentation to enrich the visual features, while the textual branch leverages GPT-4 to rewrite discriminative descriptors. In addition to this on-the-fly knowledge injection, we also implement post-tuning knowledge by re-ranking the prediction results during inference. With the injected knowledge, the model can better capture informative features for downstream tasks as data evolves. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ENGINE.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihang Chen, Mengyao Li, Qianyi Wu, Weiyao Lin, Mehrtash Harandi, Jianfei Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves impressive rendering fidelity and speed for novel view synthesis. However, its substantial data size poses a significant challenge for practical applications. While many compression techniques have been proposed, they fail to efficiently utilize existing bitstreams in on-demand applications due to their lack of progressivity, leading to a waste of resource. To address this issue, we propose PCGS (Progressive Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting), which adaptively controls both the quantity and quality of Gaussians (or anchors) to enable effective progressivity for on-demand applications. Specifically, for quantity, we introduce a progressive masking strategy that incrementally incorporates new anchors while refining existing ones to enhance fidelity. For quality, we propose a progressive quantization approach that gradually reduces quantization step sizes to achieve finer modeling of Gaussian attributes. Furthermore, to compact the incremental bitstreams, we leverage existing quantization results to refine probability prediction, improving entropy coding efficiency across progressive levels. Overall, PCGS achieves progressivity while maintaining compression performance comparable to SoTA non-progressive methods. Code available at: github.com/YihangChen-ee/PCGS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoyuan Li, Jiahao Lu, Jiacheng Deng, Hanzhi Chang, Lifan Wu, Yanzhe Liang, Tianzhu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The open vocabulary capability of 3D models is increasingly valued, as traditional methods with models trained with fixed categories fail to recognize unseen objects in complex dynamic 3D scenes. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach, SAS, to integrate the open vocabulary capability of multiple 2D models and migrate it to 3D domain. Specifically, we first propose Model Alignment via Text to map different 2D models into the same embedding space using text as a bridge. Then, we propose Annotation-Free Model Capability Construction to explicitly quantify the 2D model's capability of recognizing different categories using diffusion models. Following this, point cloud features from different 2D models are fused with the guide of constructed model capabilities. Finally, the integrated 2D open vocabulary capability is transferred to 3D domain through feature distillation. SAS outperforms previous methods by a large margin across multiple datasets, including ScanNet v2, Matterport3D, and nuScenes, while its generalizability is further validated on downstream tasks, e.g., gaussian segmentation and instance segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Vallmanya Poch, Yorick Estievenart, Elnura Zhalieva, Sukanya Patra, Mohammad Yaqub, Souhaib Ben Taieb</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate dose calculations in proton therapy rely on high-quality CT images. While planning CTs (pCTs) serve as a reference for dosimetric planning, Cone Beam CT (CBCT) is used throughout Adaptive Radiotherapy (ART) to generate sCTs for improved dose calculations. Despite its lower cost and reduced radiation exposure advantages, CBCT suffers from severe artefacts and poor image quality, making it unsuitable for precise dosimetry. Deep learning-based CBCT-to-CT translation has emerged as a promising approach. Still, existing methods often introduce anatomical inconsistencies and lack reliable uncertainty estimates, limiting their clinical adoption. To bridge this gap, we propose STF-RUE, a novel framework integrating two key components. First, STF, a segmentation-guided CBCT-to-CT translation method that enhances anatomical consistency by leveraging segmentation priors extracted from pCTs. Second, RUE, a conformal prediction method that augments predicted CTs with pixel-wise conformal prediction intervals, providing clinicians with robust reliability indicator. Comprehensive experiments using UNet++ and Fast-DDPM on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that STF-RUE significantly improves translation accuracy, as measured by a novel soft-tissue-focused metric designed for precise dose computation. Additionally, STF-RUE provides better-calibrated uncertainty sets for synthetic CT, reinforcing trust in synthetic CTs. By addressing both anatomical fidelity and uncertainty quantification, STF-RUE marks a crucial step toward safer and more effective adaptive proton therapy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianfu Zhang, yujie Gao, Jiahui Zhan, Wentao Wang, Yiyi Zhang, Haohua Zhao, Liqing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel high-fidelity 3D head reconstruction method from a single portrait image, regardless of perspective, expression, or accessories. Despite significant efforts in adapting 2D generative models for novel view synthesis and 3D optimization, most methods struggle to produce high-quality 3D portraits. The lack of crucial information, such as identity, expression, hair, and accessories, limits these approaches in generating realistic 3D head models. To address these challenges, we construct a new high-quality dataset containing 227 sequences of digital human portraits captured from 96 different perspectives, totalling 21,792 frames, featuring diverse expressions and accessories. To further improve performance, we integrate identity and expression information into the multi-view diffusion process to enhance facial consistency across views. Specifically, we apply identity- and expression-aware guidance and supervision to extract accurate facial representations, which guide the model and enforce objective functions to ensure high identity and expression consistency during generation. Finally, we generate an orbital video around the portrait consisting of 96 multi-view frames, which can be used for 3D portrait model reconstruction. Our method demonstrates robust performance across challenging scenarios, including side-face angles and complex accessories</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Wei, Yijun Yang, Junliang Xing, Yuanchun Shi, Zongqing Lu, Deheng Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable outcome rewards (RLVR) has effectively scaled up chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet, its efficacy in training vision-language model (VLM) agents for goal-directed action reasoning in visual environments is less established. This work investigates this problem through extensive experiments on complex card games, such as 24 points, and embodied tasks from ALFWorld. We find that when rewards are based solely on action outcomes, RL fails to incentivize CoT reasoning in VLMs, instead leading to a phenomenon we termed thought collapse, characterized by a rapid loss of diversity in the agent's thoughts, state-irrelevant and incomplete reasoning, and subsequent invalid actions, resulting in negative rewards. To counteract thought collapse, we highlight the necessity of process guidance and propose an automated corrector that evaluates and refines the agent's reasoning at each RL step. This simple and scalable GTR (Guided Thought Reinforcement) framework trains reasoning and action simultaneously without the need for dense, per-step human labeling. Our experiments demonstrate that GTR significantly enhances the performance and generalization of the LLaVA-7b model across various visual environments, achieving 3-5 times higher task success rates compared to SoTA models with notably smaller model sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Wong, Necati Cihan Camgoz, Richard Bowden</p>
<p>Abstract: Sign language representation learning presents unique challenges due to the complex spatio-temporal nature of signs and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Existing methods often rely either on models pre-trained on general visual tasks, that lack sign-specific features, or use complex multimodal and multi-branch architectures. To bridge this gap, we introduce a scalable, self-supervised framework for sign representation learning. We leverage important inductive (sign) priors during the training of our RGB model. To do this, we leverage simple but important cues based on skeletons while pretraining a masked autoencoder. These sign specific priors alongside feature regularization and an adversarial style agnostic loss provide a powerful backbone. Notably, our model does not require skeletal keypoints during inference, avoiding the limitations of keypoint-based models during downstream tasks. When finetuned, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for sign recognition on the WLASL, ASL-Citizen and NMFs-CSL datasets, using a simpler architecture and with only a single-modality. Beyond recognition, our frozen model excels in sign dictionary retrieval and sign translation, surpassing standard MAE pretraining and skeletal-based representations in retrieval. It also reduces computational costs for training existing sign translation models while maintaining strong performance on Phoenix2014T, CSL-Daily and How2Sign.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08531">Visual Attention Graph</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai-Fu Yang, Yong-Jie Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual attention plays a critical role when our visual system executes active visual tasks by interacting with the physical scene. However, how to encode the visual object relationship in the psychological world of our brain deserves to be explored. In the field of computer vision, predicting visual fixations or scanpaths is a usual way to explore the visual attention and behaviors of human observers when viewing a scene. Most existing methods encode visual attention using individual fixations or scanpaths based on the raw gaze shift data collected from human observers. This may not capture the common attention pattern well, because without considering the semantic information of the viewed scene, raw gaze shift data alone contain high inter- and intra-observer variability. To address this issue, we propose a new attention representation, called Attention Graph, to simultaneously code the visual saliency and scanpath in a graph-based representation and better reveal the common attention behavior of human observers. In the attention graph, the semantic-based scanpath is defined by the path on the graph, while saliency of objects can be obtained by computing fixation density on each node. Systemic experiments demonstrate that the proposed attention graph combined with our new evaluation metrics provides a better benchmark for evaluating attention prediction methods. Meanwhile, extra experiments demonstrate the promising potentials of the proposed attention graph in assessing human cognitive states, such as autism spectrum disorder screening and age classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingshi Li, Dusan Grujicic, Ben Somers, Stien Heremans, Steven De Saeger, Matthew B. Blaschko</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing imagery from systems such as Sentinel provides full coverage of the Earth's surface at around 10-meter resolution. The remote sensing community has transitioned to extensive use of deep learning models due to their high performance on benchmarks such as the UCMerced and ISPRS Vaihingen datasets. Convolutional models such as UNet and ResNet variations are commonly employed for remote sensing but typically only accept three channels, as they were developed for RGB imagery, while satellite systems provide more than ten. Recently, several transformer architectures have been proposed for remote sensing, but they have not been extensively benchmarked and are typically used on small datasets such as Salinas Valley. Meanwhile, it is becoming feasible to obtain dense spatial land-use labels for entire first-level administrative divisions of some countries. Scaling law observations suggest that substantially larger multi-spectral transformer models could provide a significant leap in remote sensing performance in these settings.
  In this work, we propose ChromaFormer, a family of multi-spectral transformer models, which we evaluate across orders of magnitude differences in model parameters to assess their performance and scaling effectiveness on a densely labeled imagery dataset of Flanders, Belgium, covering more than 13,500 km^2 and containing 15 classes. We propose a novel multi-spectral attention strategy and demonstrate its effectiveness through ablations. Furthermore, we show that models many orders of magnitude larger than conventional architectures, such as UNet, lead to substantial accuracy improvements: a UNet++ model with 23M parameters achieves less than 65% accuracy, while a multi-spectral transformer with 655M parameters achieves over 95% accuracy on the Biological Valuation Map of Flanders.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have made impressive strides in image captioning, VQA, and video comprehension, yet they still struggle with the intricate temporal and spatial cues found in comics. To address this gap, we introduce ComicsPAP, a large-scale benchmark designed for comic strip understanding. Comprising over 100k samples and organized into 5 subtasks under a Pick-a-Panel framework, ComicsPAP demands models to identify the missing panel in a sequence. Our evaluations, conducted under both multi-image and single-image protocols, reveal that current state-of-the-art LMMs perform near chance on these tasks, underscoring significant limitations in capturing sequential and contextual dependencies. To close the gap, we adapted LMMs for comic strip understanding, obtaining better results on ComicsPAP than 10x bigger models, demonstrating that ComicsPAP offers a robust resource to drive future research in multimodal comic comprehension.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08575">Modular Customization of Diffusion Models via Blockwise-Parameterized Low-Rank Adaptation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingkang Zhu, Xi Chen, Zhongdao Wang, Bei Yu, Hengshuang Zhao, Jiaya Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent diffusion model customization has shown impressive results in incorporating subject or style concepts with a handful of images. However, the modular composition of multiple concepts into a customized model, aimed to efficiently merge decentralized-trained concepts without influencing their identities, remains unresolved. Modular customization is essential for applications like concept stylization and multi-concept customization using concepts trained by different users. Existing post-training methods are only confined to a fixed set of concepts, and any different combinations require a new round of retraining. In contrast, instant merging methods often cause identity loss and interference of individual merged concepts and are usually limited to a small number of concepts. To address these issues, we propose BlockLoRA, an instant merging method designed to efficiently combine multiple concepts while accurately preserving individual concepts' identity. With a careful analysis of the underlying reason for interference, we develop the Randomized Output Erasure technique to minimize the interference of different customized models. Additionally, Blockwise LoRA Parameterization is proposed to reduce the identity loss during instant model merging. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BlockLoRA, which can instantly merge 15 concepts of people, subjects, scenes, and styles with high fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xichen Tan, Yunfan Ye, Yuanjing Luo, Qian Wan, Fang Liu, Zhiping Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capable of video understanding are advancing rapidly. To effectively assess their video comprehension capabilities, long video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and MLVU, are proposed. However, these benchmarks directly use uniform frame sampling for testing, which results in significant information loss and affects the accuracy of the evaluations in reflecting the true abilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose RAG-Adapter, a plug-and-play framework that reduces information loss during testing by sampling frames most relevant to the given question. Additionally, we introduce a Grouped-supervised Contrastive Learning (GCL) method to further enhance sampling effectiveness of RAG-Adapter through fine-tuning on our constructed MMAT dataset. Finally, we test numerous baseline MLLMs on various video understanding benchmarks, finding that RAG-Adapter sampling consistently outperforms uniform sampling (e.g., Accuracy of GPT-4o increases by 9.3 percent on Video-MME), providing a more accurate testing method for long video benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justus Karlsson, Yonghao Xu, Amanda Berg, Leif Haglund</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple studies have performed next-day fire prediction using satellite imagery. Two main satellites are used to detect wildfires: MODIS and VIIRS. Both satellites provide fire mask products, called MOD14 and VNP14, respectively. Studies have used one or the other, but there has been no comparison between them to determine which might be more suitable for next-day fire prediction. In this paper, we first evaluate how well VIIRS and MODIS data can be used to forecast wildfire spread one day ahead. We find that the model using VIIRS as input and VNP14 as target achieves the best results. Interestingly, the model using MODIS as input and VNP14 as target performs significantly better than using VNP14 as input and MOD14 as target. Next, we discuss why MOD14 might be harder to use for predicting next-day fires. We find that the MOD14 fire mask is highly stochastic and does not correlate with reasonable fire spread patterns. This is detrimental for machine learning tasks, as the model learns irrational patterns. Therefore, we conclude that MOD14 is unsuitable for next-day fire prediction and that VNP14 is a much better option. However, using MODIS input and VNP14 as target, we achieve a significant improvement in predictability. This indicates that an improved fire detection model is possible for MODIS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangping Wen, Jinyu Wen, Emei Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Bag-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches have emerged as the mainstream methodology for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. However, most existing methods adopt a segmented training strategy, which first extracts features using a pre-trained feature extractor and then aggregates these features through MIL. This segmented training approach leads to insufficient collaborative optimization between the feature extraction network and the MIL network, preventing end-to-end joint optimization and thereby limiting the overall performance of the model. Additionally, conventional methods typically extract features from all patches of fixed size, ignoring the multi-scale observation characteristics of pathologists. This not only results in significant computational resource waste when tumor regions represent a minimal proportion (as in the Camelyon16 dataset) but may also lead the model to suboptimal solutions.
  To address these limitations, this paper proposes an end-to-end multi-scale WSI classification framework that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with multiple instance learning. Specifically, our approach includes: (1) a semantic feature filtering module to reduce interference from non-lesion areas; (2) a multi-scale feature extraction module to capture pathological information at different levels; and (3) a multi-scale fusion MIL module for global modeling and feature integration. Through an end-to-end training strategy, we simultaneously optimize both the feature extractor and MIL network, ensuring maximum compatibility between them.
  Experiments were conducted on three cross-center datasets (DigestPath2019, BCNB, and UBC-OCEAN). Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy (ACC) and AUC metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shehreen Azad, Vibhav Vineet, Yogesh Singh Rawat</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), current approaches struggle in medium-to-long video understanding due to frame and context length limitations. As a result, these models often depend on frame sampling, which risks missing key information over time and lacks task-specific relevance. To address these challenges, we introduce HierarQ, a task-aware hierarchical Q-Former based framework that sequentially processes frames to bypass the need for frame sampling, while avoiding LLM's context length limitations. We introduce a lightweight two-stream language-guided feature modulator to incorporate task awareness in video understanding, with the entity stream capturing frame-level object information within a short context and the scene stream identifying their broader interactions over longer period of time. Each stream is supported by dedicated memory banks which enables our proposed Hierachical Querying transformer (HierarQ) to effectively capture short and long-term context. Extensive evaluations on 10 video benchmarks across video understanding, question answering, and captioning tasks demonstrate HierarQ's state-of-the-art performance across most datasets, proving its robustness and efficiency for comprehensive video analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: The variability and biases in the real-world performance benchmarking of deep learning models for medical imaging compromise their trustworthiness for real-world deployment. The common approach of holding out a single fixed test set fails to quantify the variance in the estimation of test performance metrics. This study introduces NACHOS (Nested and Automated Cross-validation and Hyperparameter Optimization using Supercomputing) to reduce and quantify the variance of test performance metrics of deep learning models. NACHOS integrates Nested Cross-Validation (NCV) and Automated Hyperparameter Optimization (AHPO) within a parallelized high-performance computing (HPC) framework. NACHOS was demonstrated on a chest X-ray repository and an Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) dataset under multiple data partitioning schemes. Beyond performance estimation, DACHOS (Deployment with Automated Cross-validation and Hyperparameter Optimization using Supercomputing) is introduced to leverage AHPO and cross-validation to build the final model on the full dataset, improving expected deployment performance. The findings underscore the importance of NCV in quantifying and reducing estimation variance, AHPO in optimizing hyperparameters consistently across test folds, and HPC in ensuring computational feasibility. By integrating these methodologies, NACHOS and DACHOS provide a scalable, reproducible, and trustworthy framework for DL model evaluation and deployment in medical imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqiao Meng, Qichao Wang, Zhipeng Zhou, Irwin King, Peilin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a pioneering autoregressive generative model for 3D point cloud generation. Inspired by visual autoregressive modeling (VAR), we conceptualize point cloud generation as an autoregressive up-sampling process. This leads to our novel model, PointARU, which progressively refines 3D point clouds from coarse to fine scales. PointARU follows a two-stage training paradigm: first, it learns multi-scale discrete representations of point clouds, and then it trains an autoregressive transformer for next-scale prediction. To address the inherent unordered and irregular structure of point clouds, we incorporate specialized point-based up-sampling network modules in both stages and integrate 3D absolute positional encoding based on the decoded point cloud at each scale during the second stage. Our model surpasses state-of-the-art (SoTA) diffusion-based approaches in both generation quality and parameter efficiency across diverse experimental settings, marking a new milestone for autoregressive methods in 3D point cloud generation. Furthermore, PointARU demonstrates exceptional performance in completing partial 3D shapes and up-sampling sparse point clouds, outperforming existing generative models in these tasks.</p>

To mitigate radiation exposure, recent research focuses on generating novel views from sparse inputs and reconstructing Computed Tomography (CT) volumes, borrowing representations from the 3D reconstruction area. However, these representations originally target visible light imaging that emphasizes reflection and scattering effects, while neglecting penetration and attenuation properties of X-ray imaging. In this paper, we introduce X-Field, the first 3D representation specifically designed for X-ray imaging, rooted in the energy absorption rates across different materials. To accurately model diverse materials within internal structures, we employ 3D ellipsoids with distinct attenuation coefficients. To estimate each material's energy absorption of X-rays, we devise an efficient path partitioning algorithm accounting for complex ellipsoid intersections. We further propose hybrid progressive initialization to refine the geometric accuracy of X-Filed and incorporate material-based optimization to enhance model fitting along material boundaries. Experiments show that X-Field achieves superior visual fidelity on both real-world human organ and synthetic object datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in X-ray Novel View Synthesis and CT Reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Du\v{s}an Mali\'c, Christian Fruhwirth-Reisinger, Samuel Schulter, Horst Possegger</p>
<p>Abstract: While surface normals are widely used to analyse 3D scene geometry, surface normal estimation from LiDAR point clouds remains severely underexplored. This is caused by the lack of large-scale annotated datasets on the one hand, and lack of methods that can robustly handle the sparse and often noisy LiDAR data in a reasonable time on the other hand. We address these limitations using a traffic simulation engine and present LiSu, the first large-scale, synthetic LiDAR point cloud dataset with ground truth surface normal annotations, eliminating the need for tedious manual labeling. Additionally, we propose a novel method that exploits the spatiotemporal characteristics of autonomous driving data to enhance surface normal estimation accuracy. By incorporating two regularization terms, we enforce spatial consistency among neighboring points and temporal smoothness across consecutive LiDAR frames. These regularizers are particularly effective in self-training settings, where they mitigate the impact of noisy pseudo-labels, enabling robust real-world deployment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on LiSu, achieving state-of-the-art performance in LiDAR surface normal estimation. Moreover, we showcase its full potential in addressing the challenging task of synthetic-to-real domain adaptation, leading to improved neural surface reconstruction on real-world data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08605">Tuning-Free Multi-Event Long Video Generation via Synchronized Coupled Sampling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Subin Kim, Seoung Wug Oh, Jui-Hsien Wang, Joon-Young Lee, Jinwoo Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent advancements in text-to-video diffusion models enable high-quality short video generation from a single prompt, generating real-world long videos in a single pass remains challenging due to limited data and high computational costs. To address this, several works propose tuning-free approaches, i.e., extending existing models for long video generation, specifically using multiple prompts to allow for dynamic and controlled content changes. However, these methods primarily focus on ensuring smooth transitions between adjacent frames, often leading to content drift and a gradual loss of semantic coherence over longer sequences. To tackle such an issue, we propose Synchronized Coupled Sampling (SynCoS), a novel inference framework that synchronizes denoising paths across the entire video, ensuring long-range consistency across both adjacent and distant frames. Our approach combines two complementary sampling strategies: reverse and optimization-based sampling, which ensure seamless local transitions and enforce global coherence, respectively. However, directly alternating between these samplings misaligns denoising trajectories, disrupting prompt guidance and introducing unintended content changes as they operate independently. To resolve this, SynCoS synchronizes them through a grounded timestep and a fixed baseline noise, ensuring fully coupled sampling with aligned denoising paths. Extensive experiments show that SynCoS significantly improves multi-event long video generation, achieving smoother transitions and superior long-range coherence, outperforming previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generation have primarily relied on extensive datasets and parameter-heavy architectures. These requirements severely limit accessibility for researchers and practitioners who lack substantial computational resources. In this paper, we introduce \model, an efficient training paradigm for image generation models that uses knowledge distillation (KD) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Drawing inspiration from the success of data KD techniques widely adopted in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), LightGen distills knowledge from state-of-the-art (SOTA) text-to-image models into a compact Masked Autoregressive (MAR) architecture with only $0.7B$ parameters. Using a compact synthetic dataset of just $2M$ high-quality images generated from varied captions, we demonstrate that data diversity significantly outweighs data volume in determining model performance. This strategy dramatically reduces computational demands and reduces pre-training time from potentially thousands of GPU-days to merely 88 GPU-days. Furthermore, to address the inherent shortcomings of synthetic data, particularly poor high-frequency details and spatial inaccuracies, we integrate the DPO technique that refines image fidelity and positional accuracy. Comprehensive experiments confirm that LightGen achieves image generation quality comparable to SOTA models while significantly reducing computational resources and expanding accessibility for resource-constrained environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muzhi Zhu, Yuzhuo Tian, Hao Chen, Chunluan Zhou, Qingpei Guo, Yang Liu, Ming Yang, Chunhua Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: While MLLMs have demonstrated adequate image understanding capabilities, they still struggle with pixel-level comprehension, limiting their practical applications. Current evaluation tasks like VQA and visual grounding remain too coarse to assess fine-grained pixel comprehension accurately. Though segmentation is foundational for pixel-level understanding, existing methods often require MLLMs to generate implicit tokens, decoded through external pixel decoders. This approach disrupts the MLLM's text output space, potentially compromising language capabilities and reducing flexibility and extensibility, while failing to reflect the model's intrinsic pixel-level understanding.
  Thus, we introduce the Human-Like Mask Annotation Task (HLMAT), a new paradigm where MLLMs mimic human annotators using interactive segmentation tools. Modeling segmentation as a multi-step Markov Decision Process, HLMAT enables MLLMs to iteratively generate text-based click points, achieving high-quality masks without architectural changes or implicit tokens. Through this setup, we develop SegAgent, a model fine-tuned on human-like annotation trajectories, which achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and supports additional tasks like mask refinement and annotation filtering.
  HLMAT provides a protocol for assessing fine-grained pixel understanding in MLLMs and introduces a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making task that facilitates exploration of MLLMs' visual reasoning abilities. Our adaptations of policy improvement method StaR and PRM-guided tree search further enhance model robustness in complex segmentation tasks, laying a foundation for future advancements in fine-grained visual perception and multi-step decision-making for MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Du\v{s}an Mali\'c, Christian Fruhwirth-Reisinger, Samuel Schulter, Horst Possegger</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D detectors need large datasets for training, yet they struggle to generalize to novel domains. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to mitigate this by training detectors that are invariant to such domain shifts. Current DG approaches exclusively rely on global geometric features (point cloud Cartesian coordinates) as input features. Over-reliance on these global geometric features can, however, cause 3D detectors to prioritize object location and absolute position, resulting in poor cross-domain performance. To mitigate this, we propose to exploit explicit local point cloud structure for DG, in particular by encoding point cloud neighborhoods with Gaussian blobs, GBlobs. Our proposed formulation is highly efficient and requires no additional parameters. Without any bells and whistles, simply by integrating GBlobs in existing detectors, we beat the current state-of-the-art in challenging single-source DG benchmarks by over 21 mAP (Waymo->KITTI), 13 mAP (KITTI->Waymo), and 12 mAP (nuScenes->KITTI), without sacrificing in-domain performance. Additionally, GBlobs demonstrate exceptional performance in multi-source DG, surpassing the current state-of-the-art by 17, 12, and 5 mAP on Waymo, KITTI, and ONCE, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenchen Wan, Yanwu xu, Dongting Hu, Weilun Cheng, Tianxi Chen, Zhaoqing Wang, Feng Liu, Tongliang Liu, Mingming Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Virtual Try-On (VITON) have significantly improved image realism and garment detail preservation, driven by powerful text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. However, existing methods often rely on user-provided masks, introducing complexity and performance degradation due to imperfect inputs, as shown in Fig.1(a). To address this, we propose a Mask-Free VITON (MF-VITON) framework that achieves realistic VITON using only a single person image and a target garment, eliminating the requirement for auxiliary masks. Our approach introduces a novel two-stage pipeline: (1) We leverage existing Mask-based VITON models to synthesize a high-quality dataset. This dataset contains diverse, realistic pairs of person images and corresponding garments, augmented with varied backgrounds to mimic real-world scenarios. (2) The pre-trained Mask-based model is fine-tuned on the generated dataset, enabling garment transfer without mask dependencies. This stage simplifies the input requirements while preserving garment texture and shape fidelity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance regarding garment transfer accuracy and visual realism. Notably, the proposed Mask-Free model significantly outperforms existing Mask-based approaches, setting a new benchmark and demonstrating a substantial lead over previous approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Wang, Fangzhou Hong, Shuai Yang, Liming Jiang, Wayne Wu, Chen Change Loy</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiview diffusion models have shown considerable success in image-to-3D generation for general objects. However, when applied to human data, existing methods have yet to deliver promising results, largely due to the challenges of scaling multiview attention to higher resolutions. In this paper, we explore human multiview diffusion models at the megapixel level and introduce a solution called mesh attention to enable training at 1024x1024 resolution. Using a clothed human mesh as a central coarse geometric representation, the proposed mesh attention leverages rasterization and projection to establish direct cross-view coordinate correspondences. This approach significantly reduces the complexity of multiview attention while maintaining cross-view consistency. Building on this foundation, we devise a mesh attention block and combine it with keypoint conditioning to create our human-specific multiview diffusion model, MEAT. In addition, we present valuable insights into applying multiview human motion videos for diffusion training, addressing the longstanding issue of data scarcity. Extensive experiments show that MEAT effectively generates dense, consistent multiview human images at the megapixel level, outperforming existing multiview diffusion methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yitian Zhang, Long Mai, Aniruddha Mahapatra, David Bourgin, Yicong Hong, Jonah Casebeer, Feng Liu, Yun Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel perspective on learning video embedders for generative modeling: rather than requiring an exact reproduction of an input video, an effective embedder should focus on synthesizing visually plausible reconstructions. This relaxed criterion enables substantial improvements in compression ratios without compromising the quality of downstream generative models. Specifically, we propose replacing the conventional encoder-decoder video embedder with an encoder-generator framework that employs a diffusion transformer (DiT) to synthesize missing details from a compact latent space. Therein, we develop a dedicated latent conditioning module to condition the DiT decoder on the encoded video latent embedding. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach enables superior encoding-decoding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the compression ratio increases. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we report results from our video embedders achieving a temporal compression ratio of up to 32x (8x higher than leading video embedders) and validate the robustness of this ultra-compact latent space for text-to-video generation, providing a significant efficiency boost in latent diffusion model training and inference.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08668">SSVQ: Unleashing the Potential of Vector Quantization with Sign-Splitting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuaiting Li, Juncan Deng, Chenxuan Wang, Kedong Xu, Rongtao Deng, Hong Gu, Haibin Shen, Kejie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) has emerged as a prominent weight compression technique, showcasing substantially lower quantization errors than uniform quantization across diverse models, particularly in extreme compression scenarios. However, its efficacy during fine-tuning is limited by the constraint of the compression format, where weight vectors assigned to the same codeword are restricted to updates in the same direction. Consequently, many quantized weights are compelled to move in directions contrary to their local gradient information. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a novel VQ paradigm, Sign-Splitting VQ (SSVQ), which decouples the sign bit of weights from the codebook. Our approach involves extracting the sign bits of uncompressed weights and performing clustering and compression on all-positive weights. We then introduce latent variables for the sign bit and jointly optimize both the signs and the codebook. Additionally, we implement a progressive freezing strategy for the learnable sign to ensure training stability. Extensive experiments on various modern models and tasks demonstrate that SSVQ achieves a significantly superior compression-accuracy trade-off compared to conventional VQ. Furthermore, we validate our algorithm on a hardware accelerator, showing that SSVQ achieves a 3$\times$ speedup over the 8-bit compressed model by reducing memory access.</p>

<p>Abstract: Keypoint detection and local feature description are fundamental tasks in robotic perception, critical for applications such as SLAM, robot localization, feature matching, pose estimation, and 3D mapping. While existing methods predominantly operate on RGB images, we propose a novel network that directly processes raw images, bypassing the need for the Image Signal Processor (ISP). This approach significantly reduces hardware requirements and memory consumption, which is crucial for robotic vision systems. Our method introduces two custom-designed convolutional kernels capable of performing convolutions directly on raw images, preserving inter-channel information without converting to RGB. Experimental results show that our network outperforms existing algorithms on raw images, achieving higher accuracy and stability under large rotations and scale variations. This work represents the first attempt to develop a keypoint detection and feature description network specifically for raw images, offering a more efficient solution for resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Depth-guided multimodal fusion combines depth information from visible and infrared images, significantly enhancing the performance of 3D reconstruction and robotics applications. Existing thermal-visible image fusion mainly focuses on detection tasks, ignoring other critical information such as depth. By addressing the limitations of single modalities in low-light and complex environments, the depth information from fused images not only generates more accurate point cloud data, improving the completeness and precision of 3D reconstruction, but also provides comprehensive scene understanding for robot navigation, localization, and environmental perception. This supports precise recognition and efficient operations in applications such as autonomous driving and rescue missions. We introduce a text-guided and depth-driven infrared and visible image fusion network. The model consists of an image fusion branch for extracting multi-channel complementary information through a diffusion model, equipped with a text-guided module, and two auxiliary depth estimation branches. The fusion branch uses CLIP to extract semantic information and parameters from depth-enriched image descriptions to guide the diffusion model in extracting multi-channel features and generating fused images. These fused images are then input into the depth estimation branches to calculate depth-driven loss, optimizing the image fusion network. This framework aims to integrate vision-language and depth to directly generate color-fused images from multimodal inputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative autonomous driving holds great promise for improving safety by addressing the perception and prediction uncertainties inherent in single-agent systems. However, traditional cooperative methods are constrained by rigid collaboration protocols and limited generalization to unseen interactive scenarios. While LLM-based approaches offer generalized reasoning capabilities, their challenges in spatial planning and unstable inference latency hinder their direct application in cooperative driving. To address these limitations, we propose CoLMDriver, the first full-pipeline LLM-based cooperative driving system, enabling effective language-based negotiation and real-time driving control. CoLMDriver features a parallel driving pipeline with two key components: (i) an LLM-based negotiation module under an actor-critic paradigm, which continuously refines cooperation policies through feedback from previous decisions of all vehicles; and (ii) an intention-guided waypoint generator, which translates negotiation outcomes into executable waypoints. Additionally, we introduce InterDrive, a CARLA-based simulation benchmark comprising 10 challenging interactive driving scenarios for evaluating V2V cooperation. Experimental results demonstrate that CoLMDriver significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an 11% higher success rate across diverse highly interactive V2V driving scenarios.

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel visual tokenization framework that embeds a provable PCA-like structure into the latent token space. While existing visual tokenizers primarily optimize for reconstruction fidelity, they often neglect the structural properties of the latent space -- a critical factor for both interpretability and downstream tasks. Our method generates a 1D causal token sequence for images, where each successive token contributes non-overlapping information with mathematically guaranteed decreasing explained variance, analogous to principal component analysis. This structural constraint ensures the tokenizer extracts the most salient visual features first, with each subsequent token adding diminishing yet complementary information. Additionally, we identified and resolved a semantic-spectrum coupling effect that causes the unwanted entanglement of high-level semantic content and low-level spectral details in the tokens by leveraging a diffusion decoder. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and enables better interpretability to align with the human vision system. Moreover, auto-regressive models trained on our token sequences achieve performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while requiring fewer tokens for training and inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in unified multimodal understanding and visual generation (or multimodal generation) models have been hindered by their quadratic computational complexity and dependence on large-scale training data. We present OmniMamba, the first linear-architecture-based multimodal generation model that generates both text and images through a unified next-token prediction paradigm. The model fully leverages Mamba-2's high computational and memory efficiency, extending its capabilities from text generation to multimodal generation. To address the data inefficiency of existing unified models, we propose two key innovations: (1) decoupled vocabularies to guide modality-specific generation, and (2) task-specific LoRA for parameter-efficient adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce a decoupled two-stage training strategy to mitigate data imbalance between two tasks. Equipped with these techniques, OmniMamba achieves competitive performance with JanusFlow while surpassing Show-o across benchmarks, despite being trained on merely 2M image-text pairs, which is 1,000 times fewer than Show-o. Notably, OmniMamba stands out with outstanding inference efficiency, achieving up to a 119.2 times speedup and 63% GPU memory reduction for long-sequence generation compared to Transformer-based counterparts.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in long video understanding typically mitigate visual redundancy through visual token pruning based on attention distribution. However, while existing methods employ post-hoc low-response token pruning in decoder layers, they overlook the input-level semantic correlation between visual tokens and instructions (query). In this paper, we propose QuoTA, an ante-hoc training-free modular that extends existing large video-language models (LVLMs) for visual token assignment based on query-oriented frame-level importance assessment. The query-oriented token selection is crucial as it aligns visual processing with task-specific requirements, optimizing token budget utilization while preserving semantically relevant content. Specifically, (i) QuoTA strategically allocates frame-level importance scores based on query relevance, enabling one-time visual token assignment before cross-modal interactions in decoder layers, (ii) we decouple the query through Chain-of-Thoughts reasoning to facilitate more precise LVLM-based frame importance scoring, and (iii) QuoTA offers a plug-and-play functionality that extends to existing LVLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that implementing QuoTA with LLaVA-Video-7B yields an average performance improvement of 3.2% across six benchmarks (including Video-MME and MLVU) while operating within an identical visual token budget as the baseline.

<p>Abstract: Many machine learning techniques rely on minimizing the covariance between output feature dimensions to extract minimally redundant representations from data. However, these methods do not eliminate all dependencies/redundancies, as linearly uncorrelated variables can still exhibit nonlinear relationships. This work provides a differentiable and scalable algorithm for dependence minimization that goes beyond linear pairwise decorrelation. Our method employs an adversarial game where small networks identify dependencies among feature dimensions, while the encoder exploits this information to reduce dependencies. We provide empirical evidence of the algorithm's convergence and demonstrate its utility in three applications: extending PCA to nonlinear decorrelation, improving the generalization of image classification methods, and preventing dimensional collapse in self-supervised representation learning.</p>

Moreover, vision-language models exhibit unfaithful generalization performance and lack robustness on challenging downstream tasks such as VideoQG. In this work, we propose a novel VideoQG framework named Cross-modal Causal Relation Alignment (CRA), to eliminate spurious correlations and improve the causal consistency between question-answering and video temporal grounding. Our CRA involves three essential components: i) Gaussian Smoothing Grounding (GSG) module for estimating the time interval via cross-modal attention, which is de-noised by an adaptive Gaussian filter, ii) Cross-Modal Alignment (CMA) enhances the performance of weakly supervised VideoQG by leveraging bidirectional contrastive learning between estimated video segments and QA features, iii) Explicit Causal Intervention (ECI) module for multimodal deconfounding, which involves front-door intervention for vision and back-door intervention for language. Extensive experiments on two VideoQG datasets demonstrate the superiority of our CRA in discovering visually grounded content and achieving robust question reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanvir Rahman</p>
<p>Abstract: Parks play a crucial role in enhancing the quality of life by providing recreational spaces and environmental benefits. Understanding the patterns of park usage, including the number of visitors and their activities, is essential for effective security measures, infrastructure maintenance, and resource allocation. Traditional methods rely on single-entry sensors that count total visits but fail to distinguish unique users, limiting their effectiveness due to manpower and cost constraints.With advancements in affordable video surveillance and networked processing, more comprehensive park usage analysis is now feasible. This study proposes a multi-agent system leveraging low-cost cameras in a distributed network to track and analyze unique users. As a case study, we deployed this system at the Jack A. Markell (JAM) Trail in Wilmington, Delaware, and Hall Trail in Newark, Delaware. The system captures video data, autonomously processes it using existing algorithms, and extracts user attributes such as speed, direction, activity type, clothing color, and gender. These attributes are shared across cameras to construct movement trails and accurately count unique visitors. Our approach was validated through comparison with manual human counts and simulated scenarios under various conditions. The results demonstrate a 72% success rate in identifying unique users, setting a benchmark in automated park activity monitoring. Despite challenges such as camera placement and environmental factors, our findings suggest that this system offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for real-time park usage analysis and visitor behavior tracking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaosong Jia, Junqi You, Zhiyuan Zhang, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a trend in the field of autonomous driving, promising a data-driven, scalable approach to system design. However, existing E2E-AD methods usually adopt the sequential paradigm of perception-prediction-planning, which leads to cumulative errors and training instability. The manual ordering of tasks also limits the system`s ability to leverage synergies between tasks (for example, planning-aware perception and game-theoretic interactive prediction and planning). Moreover, the dense BEV representation adopted by existing methods brings computational challenges for long-range perception and long-term temporal fusion. To address these challenges, we present DriveTransformer, a simplified E2E-AD framework for the ease of scaling up, characterized by three key features: Task Parallelism (All agent, map, and planning queries direct interact with each other at each block), Sparse Representation (Task queries direct interact with raw sensor features), and Streaming Processing (Task queries are stored and passed as history information). As a result, the new framework is composed of three unified operations: task self-attention, sensor cross-attention, temporal cross-attention, which significantly reduces the complexity of system and leads to better training stability. DriveTransformer achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulated closed-loop benchmark Bench2Drive and real world open-loop benchmark nuScenes with high FPS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Dai, Peilin Chen, Malinda Lu, Daniel Li, Haowen Wei, Hejie Cui, Paul Pu Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in clinical AI have enabled remarkable progress across many clinical domains. However, existing benchmarks and models are primarily limited to a small set of modalities and tasks, which hinders the development of large-scale multimodal methods that can make holistic assessments of patient health and well-being. To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale Integrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark unifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph modalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves models' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder performance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with task-appropriate fusion strategies. Our findings provide a foundation for new architecture designs and pretraining strategies to advance clinical AI research. Code is released at https://github.com/DDVD233/climb.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, their slow generation speed remains a critical challenge. Existing acceleration methods, while aiming to reduce steps, often compromise sample quality, controllability, or introduce training complexities. Therefore, we propose RayFlow, a novel diffusion framework that addresses these limitations. Unlike previous methods, RayFlow guides each sample along a unique path towards an instance-specific target distribution. This method minimizes sampling steps while preserving generation diversity and stability. Furthermore, we introduce Time Sampler, an importance sampling technique to enhance training efficiency by focusing on crucial timesteps. Extensive experiments demonstrate RayFlow's superiority in generating high-quality images with improved speed, control, and training efficiency compared to existing acceleration techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cansu Korkmaz, Nancy Mehta, Radu Timofte</p>
<p>Abstract: Recovering high-frequency details and textures from low-resolution images remains a fundamental challenge in super-resolution (SR), especially when real-world degradations are complex and unknown. While GAN-based methods enhance realism, they suffer from training instability and introduce unnatural artifacts. Diffusion models, though promising, demand excessive computational resources, often requiring multiple GPU days, even for single-step variants. Rather than naively fine-tuning entire models or adopting unstable generative approaches, we introduce AdaptSR, a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) framework that efficiently repurposes bicubic-trained SR models for real-world tasks. AdaptSR leverages architecture-specific insights and selective layer updates to optimize real SR adaptation. By updating only lightweight LoRA layers while keeping the pretrained backbone intact, it captures domain-specific adjustments without adding inference cost, as the adapted layers merge seamlessly post-training. This efficient adaptation not only reduces memory and compute requirements but also makes real-world SR feasible on lightweight hardware. Our experiments demonstrate that AdaptSR outperforms GAN and diffusion-based SR methods by up to 4 dB in PSNR and 2% in perceptual scores on real SR benchmarks. More impressively, it matches or exceeds full model fine-tuning while training 92% fewer parameters, enabling rapid adaptation to real SR tasks within minutes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prarthana Bhattacharyya, Joshua Mitton, Ryan Page, Owen Morgan, Oliver Powell, Benjamin Menzies, Gabriel Homewood, Kemi Jacobs, Paolo Baesso, Taru Muhonen, Richard Vigars, Louis Berridge</p>
<p>Abstract: We present an advance in wearable technology: a mobile-optimized, real-time, ultra-low-power event camera system that enables natural hand gesture control for smart glasses, dramatically improving user experience. While hand gesture recognition in computer vision has advanced significantly, critical challenges remain in creating systems that are intuitive, adaptable across diverse users and environments, and energy-efficient enough for practical wearable applications. Our approach tackles these challenges through carefully selected microgestures: lateral thumb swipes across the index finger (in both directions) and a double pinch between thumb and index fingertips. These human-centered interactions leverage natural hand movements, ensuring intuitive usability without requiring users to learn complex command sequences. To overcome variability in users and environments, we developed a novel simulation methodology that enables comprehensive domain sampling without extensive real-world data collection. Our power-optimised architecture maintains exceptional performance, achieving F1 scores above 80\% on benchmark datasets featuring diverse users and environments. The resulting models operate at just 6-8 mW when exploiting the Qualcomm Snapdragon Hexagon DSP, with our 2-channel implementation exceeding 70\% F1 accuracy and our 6-channel model surpassing 80\% F1 accuracy across all gesture classes in user studies. These results were achieved using only synthetic training data. This improves on the state-of-the-art for F1 accuracy by 20\% with a power reduction 25x when using DSP. This advancement brings deploying ultra-low-power vision systems in wearable devices closer and opens new possibilities for seamless human-computer interaction.</p>

This fine-tuning strategy retains the pre-trained structure of the foundation model, modifying only a specialised projector module comprising a small transformer and a token aggregation technique. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate significant improvements in classification tasks under extremely low-labelled conditions by effectively leveraging unlabelled data.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of collaborative robots into industrial environments has improved productivity, but has also highlighted significant challenges related to operator safety and ergonomics. This paper proposes an innovative framework that integrates advanced visual perception technologies, real-time ergonomic monitoring, and Behaviour Tree (BT)-based adaptive decision-making. Unlike traditional methods, which often operate in isolation or statically, our approach combines deep learning models (YOLO11 and SlowOnly), advanced tracking (Unscented Kalman Filter) and dynamic ergonomic assessments (OWAS), offering a modular, scalable and adaptive system. Experimental results show that the framework outperforms previous methods in several aspects: accuracy in detecting postures and actions, adaptivity in managing human-robot interactions, and ability to reduce ergonomic risk through timely robotic interventions. In particular, the visual perception module showed superiority over YOLOv9 and YOLOv8, while real-time ergonomic monitoring eliminated the limitations of static analysis. Adaptive role management, made possible by the Behaviour Tree, provided greater responsiveness than rule-based systems, making the framework suitable for complex industrial scenarios. Our system demonstrated a 92.5\% accuracy in grasping intention recognition and successfully classified ergonomic risks with real-time responsiveness (average latency of 0.57 seconds), enabling timely robotic</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xing Zi, Kairui Jin, Xian Tao, Jun Li, Ali Braytee, Rajiv Ratn Shah, Mukesh Prasad</p>
<p>Abstract: Pixel-level segmentation is essential in remote sensing, where foundational vision models like CLIP and Segment Anything Model(SAM) have demonstrated significant capabilities in zero-shot segmentation tasks. Despite their advances, challenges specific to remote sensing remain substantial. Firstly, The SAM without clear prompt constraints, often generates redundant masks, and making post-processing more complex. Secondly, the CLIP model, mainly designed for global feature alignment in foundational models, often overlooks local objects crucial to remote sensing. This oversight leads to inaccurate recognition or misplaced focus in multi-target remote sensing imagery. Thirdly, both models have not been pre-trained on multi-scale aerial views, increasing the likelihood of detection failures. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the innovative VTPSeg pipeline, utilizing the strengths of Grounding DINO, CLIP, and SAM for enhanced open-vocabulary image segmentation. The Grounding DINO+(GD+) module generates initial candidate bounding boxes, while the CLIP Filter++(CLIP++) module uses a combination of visual and textual prompts to refine and filter out irrelevant object bounding boxes, ensuring that only pertinent objects are considered. Subsequently, these refined bounding boxes serve as specific prompts for the FastSAM model, which executes precise segmentation. Our VTPSeg is validated by experimental and ablation study results on five popular remote sensing image segmentation datasets.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07926">Learning Gentle Grasping Using Vision, Sound, and Touch</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ken Nakahara, Roberto Calandra</p>
<p>Abstract: In our daily life, we often encounter objects that are fragile and can be damaged by excessive grasping force, such as fruits. For these objects, it is paramount to grasp gently -- not using the maximum amount of force possible, but rather the minimum amount of force necessary. This paper proposes using visual, tactile, and auditory signals to learn to grasp and regrasp objects stably and gently. Specifically, we use audio signals as an indicator of gentleness during the grasping, and then train end-to-end an action-conditional model from raw visuo-tactile inputs that predicts both the stability and the gentleness of future grasping candidates, thus allowing the selection and execution of the most promising action. Experimental results on a multi-fingered hand over 1,500 grasping trials demonstrated that our model is useful for gentle grasping by validating the predictive performance (3.27\% higher accuracy than the vision-only variant) and providing interpretations of their behavior. Finally, real-world experiments confirmed that the grasping performance with the trained multi-modal model outperformed other baselines (17\% higher rate for stable and gentle grasps than vision-only). Our approach requires neither tactile sensor calibration nor analytical force modeling, drastically reducing the engineering effort to grasp fragile objects.

<p>Abstract: While deep generative models have significantly advanced representation learning, they may inherit or amplify biases and fairness issues by encoding sensitive attributes alongside predictive features. Enforcing strict independence in disentanglement is often unrealistic when target and sensitive factors are naturally correlated. To address this challenge, we propose CAD-VAE (Correlation-Aware Disentangled VAE), which introduces a correlated latent code to capture the shared information between target and sensitive attributes. Given this correlated latent, our method effectively separates overlapping factors without extra domain knowledge by directly minimizing the conditional mutual information between target and sensitive codes. A relevance-driven optimization strategy refines the correlated code by efficiently capturing essential correlated features and eliminating redundancy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAD-VAE produces fairer representations, realistic counterfactuals, and improved fairness-aware image editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S M A Sharif, Rizwan Ali Naqvi, Mithun Biswas, Woong-Kee Loh</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to numerous hardware shortcomings, medical image acquisition devices are susceptible to producing low-quality (i.e., low contrast, inappropriate brightness, noisy, etc.) images. Regrettably, perceptually degraded images directly impact the diagnosis process and make the decision-making manoeuvre of medical practitioners notably complicated. This study proposes to enhance such low-quality images by incorporating end-to-end learning strategies for accelerating medical image analysis tasks. To the best concern, this is the first work in medical imaging which comprehensively tackles perceptual enhancement, including contrast correction, luminance correction, denoising, etc., with a fully convolutional deep network. The proposed network leverages residual blocks and a residual gating mechanism for diminishing visual artefacts and is guided by a multi-term objective function to perceive the perceptually plausible enhanced images. The practicability of the deep medical image enhancement method has been extensively investigated with sophisticated experiments. The experimental outcomes illustrate that the proposed method could outperform the existing enhancement methods for different medical image modalities by 5.00 to 7.00 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metrics and 4.00 to 6.00 in DeltaE metrics. Additionally, the proposed method can drastically improve the medical image analysis tasks' performance and reveal the potentiality of such an enhancement method in real-world applications.

<p>Abstract: Simple as it seems, moving an object to another location within an image is, in fact, a challenging image-editing task that requires re-harmonizing the lighting, adjusting the pose based on perspective, accurately filling occluded regions, and ensuring coherent synchronization of shadows and reflections while maintaining the object identity. In this paper, we present ObjectMover, a generative model that can perform object movement in highly challenging scenes. Our key insight is that we model this task as a sequence-to-sequence problem and fine-tune a video generation model to leverage its knowledge of consistent object generation across video frames. We show that with this approach, our model is able to adjust to complex real-world scenarios, handling extreme lighting harmonization and object effect movement. As large-scale data for object movement are unavailable, we construct a data generation pipeline using a modern game engine to synthesize high-quality data pairs. We further propose a multi-task learning strategy that enables training on real-world video data to improve the model generalization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ObjectMover achieves outstanding results and adapts well to real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we delve deeper into the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence loss and mathematically prove that it is equivalent to the Decoupled Kullback-Leibler (DKL) Divergence loss that consists of (1) a weighted Mean Square Error (wMSE) loss and (2) a Cross-Entropy loss incorporating soft labels. Thanks to the decoupled structure of DKL loss, we have identified two areas for improvement. Firstly, we address the limitation of KL loss in scenarios like knowledge distillation by breaking its asymmetric optimization property along with a smoother weight function. This modification effectively alleviates convergence challenges in optimization, particularly for classes with high predicted scores in soft labels. Secondly, we introduce class-wise global information into KL/DKL to reduce bias arising from individual samples. With these two enhancements, we derive the Generalized Kullback-Leibler (GKL) Divergence loss and evaluate its effectiveness by conducting experiments on CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, and vision-language datasets, focusing on adversarial training, and knowledge distillation tasks. Specifically, we achieve new state-of-the-art adversarial robustness on the public leaderboard -- RobustBench and competitive knowledge distillation performance across CIFAR/ImageNet models and CLIP models, demonstrating the substantial practical merits.

<p>Abstract: Tracking and mapping in large-scale, unbounded outdoor environments using only monocular RGB input presents substantial challenges for existing SLAM systems. Traditional Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SLAM methods are typically limited to small, bounded indoor settings. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GigaSLAM, the first NeRF/3DGS-based SLAM framework for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, as demonstrated on the KITTI and KITTI 360 datasets. Our approach employs a hierarchical sparse voxel map representation, where Gaussians are decoded by neural networks at multiple levels of detail. This design enables efficient, scalable mapping and high-fidelity viewpoint rendering across expansive, unbounded scenes. For front-end tracking, GigaSLAM utilizes a metric depth model combined with epipolar geometry and PnP algorithms to accurately estimate poses, while incorporating a Bag-of-Words-based loop closure mechanism to maintain robust alignment over long trajectories. Consequently, GigaSLAM delivers high-precision tracking and visually faithful rendering on urban outdoor benchmarks, establishing a robust SLAM solution for large-scale, long-term scenarios, and significantly extending the applicability of Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems to unbounded outdoor environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyeongkook Seo, Dong-Jun Han, Jaejun Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advancements in federated learning (FL), the integration of generative models into FL has been limited due to challenges such as high communication costs and unstable training in heterogeneous data environments. To address these issues, we propose PRISM, a FL framework tailored for generative models that ensures (i) stable performance in heterogeneous data distributions and (ii) resource efficiency in terms of communication cost and final model size. The key of our method is to search for an optimal stochastic binary mask for a random network rather than updating the model weights, identifying a sparse subnetwork with high generative performance; i.e., a ``strong lottery ticket''. By communicating binary masks in a stochastic manner, PRISM minimizes communication overhead. This approach, combined with the utilization of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss and a mask-aware dynamic moving average aggregation method (MADA) on the server side, facilitates stable and strong generative capabilities by mitigating local divergence in FL scenarios. Moreover, thanks to its sparsifying characteristic, PRISM yields a lightweight model without extra pruning or quantization, making it ideal for environments such as edge devices. Experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, CelebA, and CIFAR10 demonstrate that PRISM outperforms existing methods, while maintaining privacy with minimal communication costs. PRISM is the first to successfully generate images under challenging non-IID and privacy-preserving FL environments on complex datasets, where previous methods have struggled.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arghya Pal, Sailaja Rajanala, CheeMing Ting, Raphael Phan</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image denoising is essential for improving the reliability of clinical diagnosis and guiding subsequent image-based tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale approach that integrates anisotropic Gaussian filtering with progressive Bezier-path redrawing. Our method constructs a scale-space pyramid to mitigate noise while preserving critical structural details. Starting at the coarsest scale, we segment partially denoised images into coherent components and redraw each using a parametric Bezier path with representative color. Through iterative refinements at finer scales, small and intricate structures are accurately reconstructed, while large homogeneous regions remain robustly smoothed. We employ both mean square error and self-intersection constraints to maintain shape coherence during path optimization. Empirical results on multiple MRI datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in PSNR and SSIM over competing methods. This coarse-to-fine framework offers a robust, data-efficient solution for cross-domain denoising, reinforcing its potential clinical utility and versatility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soonwoo Kwon, Jin-Young Kim, Hyojun Go, Kyungjune Baek</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel study on enhancing the capability of preserving the content in world models, focusing on a property we term World Stability. Recent diffusion-based generative models have advanced the synthesis of immersive and realistic environments that are pivotal for applications such as reinforcement learning and interactive game engines. However, while these models excel in quality and diversity, they often neglect the preservation of previously generated scenes over time--a shortfall that can introduce noise into agent learning and compromise performance in safety-critical settings. In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework that measures world stability by having world models perform a sequence of actions followed by their inverses to return to their initial viewpoint, thereby quantifying the consistency between the starting and ending observations. Our comprehensive assessment of state-of-the-art diffusion-based world models reveals significant challenges in achieving high world stability. Moreover, we investigate several improvement strategies to enhance world stability. Our results underscore the importance of world stability in world modeling and provide actionable insights for future research in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chungpa Lee, Jeongheon Oh, Kibok Lee, Jy-yong Sohn</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised contrastive learning (SupCL) has emerged as a prominent approach in representation learning, leveraging both supervised and self-supervised losses. However, achieving an optimal balance between these losses is challenging; failing to do so can lead to class collapse, reducing discrimination among individual embeddings in the same class. In this paper, we present theoretically grounded guidelines for SupCL to prevent class collapse in learned representations. Specifically, we introduce the Simplex-to-Simplex Embedding Model (SSEM), a theoretical framework that models various embedding structures, including all embeddings that minimize the supervised contrastive loss. Through SSEM, we analyze how hyperparameters affect learned representations, offering practical guidelines for hyperparameter selection to mitigate the risk of class collapse. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical results across synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tristan Tomilin, Meng Fang, Mykola Pechenizkiy</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancing safe autonomous systems through reinforcement learning (RL) requires robust benchmarks to evaluate performance, analyze methods, and assess agent competencies. Humans primarily rely on embodied visual perception to safely navigate and interact with their surroundings, making it a valuable capability for RL agents. However, existing vision-based 3D benchmarks only consider simple navigation tasks. To address this shortcoming, we introduce \textbf{HASARD}, a suite of diverse and complex tasks to $\textbf{HA}$rness $\textbf{SA}$fe $\textbf{R}$L with $\textbf{D}$oom, requiring strategic decision-making, comprehending spatial relationships, and predicting the short-term future. HASARD features three difficulty levels and two action spaces. An empirical evaluation of popular baseline methods demonstrates the benchmark's complexity, unique challenges, and reward-cost trade-offs. Visualizing agent navigation during training with top-down heatmaps provides insight into a method's learning process. Incrementally training across difficulty levels offers an implicit learning curriculum. HASARD is the first safe RL benchmark to exclusively target egocentric vision-based learning, offering a cost-effective and insightful way to explore the potential and boundaries of current and future safe RL methods.

<p>Abstract: Progress in Embodied AI has made it possible for end-to-end-trained agents to navigate in photo-realistic environments with high-level reasoning and zero-shot or language-conditioned behavior, but benchmarks are still dominated by simulation. In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents Ev-Layout, a novel large-scale event-based multi-modal dataset designed for indoor layout estimation and tracking. Ev-Layout makes key contributions to the community by: Utilizing a hybrid data collection platform (with a head-mounted display and VR interface) that integrates both RGB and bio-inspired event cameras to capture indoor layouts in motion. Incorporating time-series data from inertial measurement units (IMUs) and ambient lighting conditions recorded during data collection to highlight the potential impact of motion speed and lighting on layout estimation accuracy. The dataset consists of 2.5K sequences, including over 771.3K RGB images and 10 billion event data points. Of these, 39K images are annotated with indoor layouts, enabling research in both event-based and video-based indoor layout estimation. Based on the dataset, we propose an event-based layout estimation pipeline with a novel event-temporal distribution feature module to effectively aggregate the spatio-temporal information from events. Additionally, we introduce a spatio-temporal feature fusion module that can be easily integrated into a transformer module for fusion purposes. Finally, we conduct benchmarking and extensive experiments on the Ev-Layout dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves the accuracy of dynamic indoor layout estimation compared to existing event-based methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite recent advancements in learning-based motion in-betweening, a key limitation has been overlooked: the requirement for character-specific datasets. In this work, we introduce AnyMoLe, a novel method that addresses this limitation by leveraging video diffusion models to generate motion in-between frames for arbitrary characters without external data.

Furthermore, to bridge the domain gap between real-world and rendered character animations, we introduce ICAdapt, a fine-tuning technique for video diffusion models. Additionally, we propose a ``motion-video mimicking'' optimization technique, enabling seamless motion generation for characters with arbitrary joint structures using 2D and 3D-aware features. AnyMoLe significantly reduces data dependency while generating smooth and realistic transitions, making it applicable to a wide range of motion in-betweening tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Armando Fortes, Tianyi Wei, Shangchen Zhou, Xingang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image models have revolutionized creative fields by generating visually captivating outputs from textual prompts; however, while traditional photography offers precise control over camera settings to shape visual aesthetics -- such as depth-of-field -- current diffusion models typically rely on prompt engineering to mimic such effects. This approach often results in crude approximations and inadvertently altering the scene content. In this work, we propose Bokeh Diffusion, a scene-consistent bokeh control framework that explicitly conditions a diffusion model on a physical defocus blur parameter. By grounding depth-of-field adjustments, our method preserves the underlying scene structure as the level of blur is varied. To overcome the scarcity of paired real-world images captured under different camera settings, we introduce a hybrid training pipeline that aligns in-the-wild images with synthetic blur augmentations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves flexible, lens-like blur control but also supports applications such as real image editing via inversion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the environment and a robot's physical reachability is crucial for task execution. While state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) excel in environmental perception, they often generate inaccurate or impractical responses in embodied visual reasoning tasks due to a lack of understanding of robotic physical reachability. To address this issue, we propose a unified representation of physical reachability across diverse robots, i.e., Space-Physical Reachability Map (S-P Map), and PhysVLM, a vision-language model that integrates this reachability information into visual reasoning. Specifically, the S-P Map abstracts a robot's physical reachability into a generalized spatial representation, independent of specific robot configurations, allowing the model to focus on reachability features rather than robot-specific parameters. Subsequently, PhysVLM extends traditional VLM architectures by incorporating an additional feature encoder to process the S-P Map, enabling the model to reason about physical reachability without compromising its general vision-language capabilities. To train and evaluate PhysVLM, we constructed a large-scale multi-robot dataset, Phys100K, and a challenging benchmark, EQA-phys, which includes tasks for six different robots in both simulated and real-world environments. Experimental results demonstrate that PhysVLM outperforms existing models, achieving a 14\% improvement over GPT-4o on EQA-phys and surpassing advanced embodied VLMs such as RoboMamba and SpatialVLM on the RoboVQA-val and OpenEQA benchmarks. Additionally, the S-P Map shows strong compatibility with various VLMs, and its integration into GPT-4o-mini yields a 7.1\% performance improvement.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08497">MMRL: Multi-Modal Representation Learning for Vision-Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuncheng Guo, Xiaodong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential for transfer learning across diverse tasks. However, adapting these models with limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, diminishing their performance on new tasks. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Representation Learning (MMRL) framework that introduces a shared, learnable, and modality-agnostic representation space. MMRL projects the space tokens to text and image representation tokens, facilitating more effective multi-modal interactions. Unlike previous approaches that solely optimize class token features, MMRL integrates representation tokens at higher layers of the encoders--where dataset-specific features are more prominent--while preserving generalized knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both representation and class features are optimized, with trainable projection layer applied to the representation tokens, whereas the class token projection layer remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. Furthermore, a regularization term is introduced to align the class features and text features with the zero-shot features from the frozen VLM, thereby safeguarding the model's generalization capacity. For inference, a decoupling strategy is employed, wherein both representation and class features are utilized for base classes, while only the class features, which retain more generalized knowledge, are used for new tasks. Extensive experiments across 15 datasets demonstrate that MMRL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a balanced trade-off between task-specific adaptation and generalization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> I. Grinberg, A. Levin, E. D. Rimon</p>
<p>Abstract: Manipulation of deformable linear objects (DLOs) in constrained environments is a challenging task. This paper describes a two-layered approach for placing DLOs on a flat surface using a single robot hand. The high-level layer is a novel DLO surface placement method based on Euler's elastica solutions. During this process one DLO endpoint is manipulated by the robot gripper while a variable interior point of the DLO serves as the start point of the portion aligned with the placement surface. The low-level layer forms a pipeline controller. The controller estimates the DLO current shape using a Residual Neural Network (ResNet) and uses low-level feedback to ensure task execution in the presence of modeling and placement errors. The resulting DLO placement approach can recover from states where the high-level manipulation planner has failed as required by practical robot manipulation systems. The DLO placement approach is demonstrated with simulations and experiments that use silicon mock-up objects prepared for fresh food applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiran Sun, Osama Mawlawi</p>
<p>Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality that enables the visualization of biochemical and physiological processes across various tissues. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based methods have demonstrated significant progress in directly mapping sinograms to PET images. However, regression-based DL models often yield overly smoothed reconstructions lacking of details (i.e., low distortion, low perceptual quality), whereas GAN-based and likelihood-based posterior sampling models tend to introduce undesirable artifacts in predictions (i.e., high distortion, high perceptual quality), limiting their clinical applicability. To achieve a robust perception-distortion tradeoff, we propose Posterior-Mean Denoising Diffusion Model (PMDM-PET), a novel approach that builds upon a recently established mathematical theory to explore the closed-form expression of perception-distortion function in diffusion model space for PET image reconstruction from sinograms. Specifically, PMDM-PET first obtained posterior-mean PET predictions under minimum mean square error (MSE), then optimally transports the distribution of them to the ground-truth PET images distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that PMDM-PET not only generates realistic PET images with possible minimum distortion and optimal perceptual quality but also outperforms five recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) DL baselines in both qualitative visual inspection and quantitative pixel-wise metrics PSNR (dB)/SSIM/NRMSE.</p>

<p>Abstract: Significant progress has been made in vision-language models. However, language-conditioned robotic manipulation for contact-rich tasks remains underexplored, particularly in terms of tactile sensing. To address this gap, we introduce the Tactile-Language-Action (TLA) model, which effectively processes sequential tactile feedback via cross-modal language grounding to enable robust policy generation in contact-intensive scenarios. In addition, we construct a comprehensive dataset that contains 24k pairs of tactile action instruction data, customized for fingertip peg-in-hole assembly, providing essential resources for TLA training and evaluation. Our results show that TLA significantly outperforms traditional imitation learning methods (e.g., diffusion policy) in terms of effective action generation and action accuracy, while demonstrating strong generalization capabilities by achieving over 85\% success rate on previously unseen assembly clearances and peg shapes. We publicly release all data and code in the hope of advancing research in language-conditioned tactile manipulation skill learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> R\"uveyda Yilmaz, Zhu Chen, Yuli Wu, Johannes Stegmaier</p>
<p>Abstract: Cell microscopy data are abundant; however, corresponding segmentation annotations remain scarce. Moreover, variations in cell types, imaging devices, and staining techniques introduce significant domain gaps between datasets. As a result, even large, pretrained segmentation models trained on diverse datasets (source datasets) struggle to generalize to unseen datasets (target datasets). To overcome this generalization problem, we propose CellStyle, which improves the segmentation quality of such models without requiring labels for the target dataset, thereby enabling zero-shot adaptation. CellStyle transfers the attributes of an unannotated target dataset, such as texture, color, and noise, to the annotated source dataset. This transfer is performed while preserving the cell shapes of the source images, ensuring that the existing source annotations can still be used while maintaining the visual characteristics of the target dataset. The styled synthetic images with the existing annotations enable the finetuning of a generalist segmentation model for application to the unannotated target data. We demonstrate that CellStyle significantly improves zero-shot cell segmentation performance across diverse datasets by finetuning multiple segmentation models on the style-transferred data. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehdi Hosseini Chagahi, Niloufar Delfan, Behzad Moshiri, Md. Jalil Piran, Jaber Hatam Parikhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a critical medical emergency caused by the rupture of cerebral blood vessels, leading to internal bleeding within the skull. Accurate and timely classification of hemorrhage subtypes is essential for effective clinical decision-making. To address this challenge, we propose an advanced pyramid vision transformer (PVT)-based model, leveraging its hierarchical attention mechanisms to capture both local and global spatial dependencies in brain CT scans. Instead of processing all extracted features indiscriminately, A SHAP-based feature selection method is employed to identify the most discriminative components, which are then used as a latent feature space to train a boosting neural network, reducing computational complexity. We introduce an entropy-aware aggregation strategy along with a fuzzy integral operator to fuse information across multiple CT slices, ensuring a more comprehensive and reliable scan-level diagnosis by accounting for inter-slice dependencies. Experimental results show that our PVT-based framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning architectures in terms of classification accuracy, precision, and robustness. By combining SHAP-driven feature selection, transformer-based modeling, and an entropy-aware fuzzy integral operator for decision fusion, our method offers a scalable and computationally efficient AI-driven solution for automated ICH subtype classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) technologies have made significant progress in recent years, there remains an unsatisfactory performance on closed-loop evaluation. The potential of leveraging planning in query design and interaction has not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we introduce a multi-granularity planning query representation that integrates heterogeneous waypoints, including spatial, temporal, and driving-style waypoints across various sampling patterns. It provides additional supervision for trajectory prediction, enhancing precise closed-loop control for the ego vehicle. Additionally, we explicitly utilize the geometric properties of planning trajectories to effectively retrieve relevant image features based on physical locations using deformable attention. By combining these strategies, we propose a novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework, termed HiP-AD, which simultaneously performs perception, prediction, and planning within a unified decoder. HiP-AD enables comprehensive interaction by allowing planning queries to iteratively interact with perception queries in the BEV space while dynamically extracting image features from perspective views. Experiments demonstrate that HiP-AD outperforms all existing end-to-end autonomous driving methods on the closed-loop benchmark Bench2Drive and achieves competitive performance on the real-world dataset nuScenes.</p>

<p>Abstract: A common belief is that intrinsically interpretable deep learning models ensure a correct, intuitive understanding of their behavior and offer greater robustness against accidental errors or intentional manipulation. However, these beliefs have not been comprehensively verified, and growing evidence casts doubt on them. In this paper, we highlight the risks related to overreliance and susceptibility to adversarial manipulation of these so-called "intrinsically (aka inherently) interpretable" models by design. We introduce two strategies for adversarial analysis with prototype manipulation and backdoor attacks against prototype-based networks, and discuss how concept bottleneck models defend against these attacks. Fooling the model's reasoning by exploiting its use of latent prototypes manifests the inherent uninterpretability of deep neural networks, leading to a false sense of security reinforced by a visual confirmation bias. The reported limitations of prototype-based networks put their trustworthiness and applicability into question, motivating further work on the robustness and alignment of (deep) interpretable models.</p>

Diffusion models assume that they can learn the statistical properties of the underlying probability distribution, enabling sampling from this distribution to generate realistic samples. But is this really how they work? To address this question, this paper conducts a detailed analysis of the objective function and inference methods of diffusion models, leading to several important conclusions that help answer the above question: 1) In high-dimensional sparse scenarios, the target of the objective function fitting degrades from a weighted sum of multiple samples to a single sample. 2) The mainstream inference methods can all be represented within a simple unified framework, without requiring statistical concepts such as Markov chains and SDEs. 3) Guided by this simple framework, more efficient inference methods can be discovered.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufeng Diao, Yichi Zhang, Daniele De Martini, Philip Guodong Zhao, Emma Liying Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a task-oriented co-design framework that integrates communication, computing, and control to address the key challenges of bandwidth limitations, noise interference, and latency in mission-critical industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). To improve communication efficiency and robustness, we design a task-oriented Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) using Information Bottleneck (IB) to enhance data transmission efficiency by prioritizing task-specific information. To mitigate the perceived End-to-End (E2E) delays, we develop a Delay-Aware Trajectory-Guided Control Prediction (DTCP) strategy that integrates trajectory planning with control prediction, predicting commands based on E2E delay. Moreover, the DTCP is co-designed with task-oriented JSCC, focusing on transmitting task-specific information for timely and reliable autonomous driving. Experimental results in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that, under an E2E delay of 1 second (20 time slots), the proposed framework achieves a driving score of 48.12, which is 31.59 points higher than using Better Portable Graphics (BPG) while reducing bandwidth usage by 99.19%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre Sermanet, Anirudha Majumdar, Alex Irpan, Dmitry Kalashnikov, Vikas Sindhwani</p>
<p>Abstract: Until recently, robotics safety research was predominantly about collision avoidance and hazard reduction in the immediate vicinity of a robot. Since the advent of large vision and language models (VLMs), robots are now also capable of higher-level semantic scene understanding and natural language interactions with humans. Despite their known vulnerabilities (e.g. hallucinations or jail-breaking), VLMs are being handed control of robots capable of physical contact with the real world. This can lead to dangerous behaviors, making semantic safety for robots a matter of immediate concern. Our contributions in this paper are two fold: first, to address these emerging risks, we release the ASIMOV Benchmark, a large-scale and comprehensive collection of datasets for evaluating and improving semantic safety of foundation models serving as robot brains. Our data generation recipe is highly scalable: by leveraging text and image generation techniques, we generate undesirable situations from real-world visual scenes and human injury reports from hospitals. Secondly, we develop a framework to automatically generate robot constitutions from real-world data to steer a robot's behavior using Constitutional AI mechanisms. We propose a novel auto-amending process that is able to introduce nuances in written rules of behavior; this can lead to increased alignment with human preferences on behavior desirability and safety. We explore trade-offs between generality and specificity across a diverse set of constitutions of different lengths, and demonstrate that a robot is able to effectively reject unconstitutional actions. We measure a top alignment rate of 84.3% on the ASIMOV Benchmark using generated constitutions, outperforming no-constitution baselines and human-written constitutions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanhao Wang, Cheng Zhang, Gon\c{c}alo Fraz\~ao, Jinlong Yang, Alexandru-Eugen Ichim, Thabo Beeler, Fernando De la Torre</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce GarmentCrafter, a new approach that enables non-professional users to create and modify 3D garments from a single-view image. While recent advances in image generation have facilitated 2D garment design, creating and editing 3D garments remains challenging for non-professional users. Existing methods for single-view 3D reconstruction often rely on pre-trained generative models to synthesize novel views conditioning on the reference image and camera pose, yet they lack cross-view consistency, failing to capture the internal relationships across different views. In this paper, we tackle this challenge through progressive depth prediction and image warping to approximate novel views. Subsequently, we train a multi-view diffusion model to complete occluded and unknown clothing regions, informed by the evolving camera pose. By jointly inferring RGB and depth, GarmentCrafter enforces inter-view coherence and reconstructs precise geometries and fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual fidelity and inter-view coherence compared to state-of-the-art single-view 3D garment reconstruction methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bohan Tang, Yiqi Zhong, Chenxin Xu, Wei-Tao Wu, Ulrich Neumann, Yanfeng Wang, Ya Zhang, Siheng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-modal multi-agent trajectory forecasting, two major challenges have not been fully tackled: 1) how to measure the uncertainty brought by the interaction module that causes correlations among the predicted trajectories of multiple agents; 2) how to rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal predicted trajectory. In order to handle these challenges, this work first proposes a novel concept, collaborative uncertainty (CU), which models the uncertainty resulting from interaction modules. Then we build a general CU-aware regression framework with an original permutation-equivariant uncertainty estimator to do both tasks of regression and uncertainty estimation. Further, we apply the proposed framework to current SOTA multi-agent multi-modal forecasting systems as a plugin module, which enables the SOTA systems to 1) estimate the uncertainty in the multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting task; 2) rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal one based on the estimated uncertainty. We conduct extensive experiments on a synthetic dataset and two public large-scale multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks. Experiments show that: 1) on the synthetic dataset, the CU-aware regression framework allows the model to appropriately approximate the ground-truth Laplace distribution; 2) on the multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks, the CU-aware regression framework steadily helps SOTA systems improve their performances. Specially, the proposed framework helps VectorNet improve by 262 cm regarding the Final Displacement Error of the chosen optimal prediction on the nuScenes dataset; 3) for multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting systems, prediction uncertainty is positively correlated with future stochasticity; and 4) the estimated CU values are highly related to the interactive information among agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Lou, Shu Zhang, Hong-Yu Zhou, Chuan Wu, Sibei Yang, Yizhou Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have integrated convolutions into transformers to introduce inductive bias and improve generalization performance. However, the static nature of conventional convolution prevents it from dynamically adapting to input variations, resulting in a representation discrepancy between convolution and self-attention as self-attention calculates attention matrices dynamically. Furthermore, when stacking token mixers that consist of convolution and self-attention to form a deep network, the static nature of convolution hinders the fusion of features previously generated by self-attention into convolution kernels. These two limitations result in a sub-optimal representation capacity of the constructed networks. To find a solution, we propose a lightweight Dual Dynamic Token Mixer (D-Mixer) to simultaneously learn global and local dynamics, that is, mechanisms that compute weights for aggregating global contexts and local details in an input-dependent manner. D-Mixer works by applying an efficient global attention module and an input-dependent depthwise convolution separately on evenly split feature segments, endowing the network with strong inductive bias and an enlarged effective receptive field. We use D-Mixer as the basic building block to design TransXNet, a novel hybrid CNN-Transformer vision backbone network that delivers compelling performance. In the ImageNet-1K classification task, TransXNet-T surpasses Swin-T by 0.3% in top-1 accuracy while requiring less than half of the computational cost. Furthermore, TransXNet-S and TransXNet-B exhibit excellent model scalability, achieving top-1 accuracy of 83.8% and 84.6% respectively, with reasonable computational costs. Additionally, our proposed network architecture demonstrates strong generalization capabilities in various dense prediction tasks, outperforming other state-of-the-art networks while having lower computational costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Chen, Yulun Zhang, Jinjin Gu, Xin Yuan, Linghe Kong, Guihai Chen, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image super-resolution (SR) methods typically model degradation to improve reconstruction accuracy in complex and unknown degradation scenarios. However, extracting degradation information from low-resolution images is challenging, which limits the model performance. To boost image SR performance, one feasible approach is to introduce additional priors. Inspired by advancements in multi-modal methods and text prompt image processing, we introduce text prompts to image SR to provide degradation priors. Specifically, we first design a text-image generation pipeline to integrate text into the SR dataset through the text degradation representation and degradation model. By adopting a discrete design, the text representation is flexible and user-friendly. Meanwhile, we propose the PromptSR to realize the text prompt SR. The PromptSR leverages the latest multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to generate prompts from low-resolution images. It also utilizes the pre-trained language model (e.g., T5 or CLIP) to enhance text comprehension. We train the PromptSR on the text-image dataset. Extensive experiments indicate that introducing text prompts into SR, yields impressive results on both synthetic and real-world images. Code: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/PromptSR.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent development of diffusion models has led to significant progress in solving inverse problems by leveraging these models as powerful generative priors. However, challenges persist due to the ill-posed nature of such problems, often arising from ambiguities in measurements or intrinsic system symmetries. To address this, here we introduce a novel latent diffusion inverse solver, regularization by text (TReg), inspired by the human ability to resolve visual ambiguities through perceptual biases. TReg integrates textual descriptions of preconceptions about the solution during reverse diffusion sampling, dynamically reinforcing these descriptions through null-text optimization, which we refer to as adaptive negation. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that TReg effectively mitigates ambiguity in inverse problems, improving both accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peilin Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the application of advanced image segmentation techniques to analyze C-fos immediate early gene expression, a crucial marker for neural activity. Due to the complexity and high variability of neural circuits, accurate segmentation of C-fos images is paramount for the development of new insights into neural function. Amidst this backdrop, this research aims to improve accuracy and minimize manual intervention in C-fos image segmentation by leveraging the capabilities of CNNs and the Unet model. We describe the development of a novel workflow for the segmentation process involving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the Unet model, demonstrating their efficiency in various image segmentation tasks. Our workflow incorporates pre-processing steps such as cropping, image feature extraction, and clustering for the training dataset selection. We used an AutoEncoder model to extract features and implement constrained clustering to identify similarities and differences in image types. Additionally, we utilized manual and automatic labeling approaches to enhance the performance of our model. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our method in distinguishing areas with significant C-fos expression from normal tissue areas. Lastly, we implemented a modified Unet network for the detection of C-fos expressions. This research contributes to the development of more efficient and automated image segmentation methods, advancing the understanding of neural function in neuroscience research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyu Ren, Junhui Hou, Xiaodong Chen, Hongkai Xiong, Wenping Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Qualifying the discrepancy between 3D geometric models, which could be represented with either point clouds or triangle meshes, is a pivotal issue with board applications. Existing methods mainly focus on directly establishing the correspondence between two models and then aggregating point-wise distance between corresponding points, resulting in them being either inefficient or ineffective. In this paper, we propose DirDist, an efficient, effective, robust, and differentiable distance metric for 3D geometry data. Specifically, we construct DirDist based on the proposed implicit representation of 3D models, namely directional distance field (DDF), which defines the directional distances of 3D points to a model to capture its local surface geometry. We then transfer the discrepancy between two 3D geometric models as the discrepancy between their DDFs defined on an identical domain, naturally establishing model correspondence. To demonstrate the advantage of our DirDist, we explore various distance metric-driven 3D geometric modeling tasks, including template surface fitting, rigid registration, non-rigid registration, scene flow estimation and human pose optimization. Extensive experiments show that our DirDist achieves significantly higher accuracy under all tasks. As a generic distance metric, DirDist has the potential to advance the field of 3D geometric modeling. The source code is available at https://github.com/rsy6318/DirDist.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding and anticipating intraoperative events and actions is critical for intraoperative assistance and decision-making during minimally invasive surgery. Automated prediction of events, actions, and the following consequences is addressed through various computational approaches with the objective of augmenting surgeons' perception and decision-making capabilities. We propose a predictive neural network that is capable of understanding and predicting critical interactive aspects of surgical workflow from intra-abdominal video, while flexibly leveraging surgical knowledge graphs. The approach incorporates a hypergraph-transformer (HGT) structure that encodes expert knowledge into the network design and predicts the hidden embedding of the graph. We verify our approach on established surgical datasets and applications, including the detection and prediction of action triplets, and the achievement of the Critical View of Safety (CVS). Moreover, we address specific, safety-related tasks, such as predicting the clipping of cystic duct or artery without prior achievement of the CVS. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to unstructured alternatives.</p>

<p>Abstract: Denoising diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for various image generation and editing tasks, facilitating the synthesis of visual content in an unconditional or input-conditional manner. The core idea behind them is learning to reverse the process of gradually adding noise to images, allowing them to generate high-quality samples from a complex distribution. In this survey, we provide an exhaustive overview of existing methods using diffusion models for image editing, covering both theoretical and practical aspects in the field. We delve into a thorough analysis and categorization of these works from multiple perspectives, including learning strategies, user-input conditions, and the array of specific editing tasks that can be accomplished. In addition, we pay special attention to image inpainting and outpainting, and explore both earlier traditional context-driven and current multimodal conditional methods, offering a comprehensive analysis of their methodologies. To further evaluate the performance of text-guided image editing algorithms, we propose a systematic benchmark, EditEval, featuring an innovative metric, LMM Score. Finally, we address current limitations and envision some potential directions for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guang Lin, Zerui Tao, Jianhai Zhang, Toshihisa Tanaka, Qibin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion model (DM) based adversarial purification (AP) has proven to be a powerful defense method that can remove adversarial perturbations and generate a purified example without threats. In principle, the pre-trained DMs can only ensure that purified examples conform to the same distribution of the training data, but it may inadvertently compromise the semantic information of input examples, leading to misclassification of purified examples. Recent advancements introduce guided diffusion techniques to preserve semantic information while removing the perturbations. However, these guidances often rely on distance measures between purified examples and diffused examples, which can also preserve perturbations in purified examples. To further unleash the robustness power of DM-based AP, we propose an adversarial guided diffusion model (AGDM) by introducing a novel adversarial guidance that contains sufficient semantic information but does not explicitly involve adversarial perturbations. The guidance is modeled by an auxiliary neural network obtained with adversarial training, considering the distance in the latent representations rather than at the pixel-level values. Extensive experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet to demonstrate that our method is effective for simultaneously maintaining semantic information and removing the adversarial perturbations. In addition, comprehensive comparisons show that our method significantly enhances the robustness of existing DM-based AP, with an average robust accuracy improved by up to 7.30% on CIFAR-10.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Hahlbohm, Linus Franke, Moritz Kappel, Susana Castillo, Martin Eisemann, Marc Stamminger, Marcus Magnor</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new approach for reconstruction and novel view synthesis of unbounded real-world scenes. In contrast to previous methods using either volumetric fields, grid-based models, or discrete point cloud proxies, we propose a hybrid scene representation, which implicitly encodes the geometry in a continuous octree-based probability field and view-dependent appearance in a multi-resolution hash grid. This allows for extraction of arbitrary explicit point clouds, which can be rendered using rasterization. In doing so, we combine the benefits of both worlds and retain favorable behavior during optimization: Our novel implicit point cloud representation and differentiable bilinear rasterizer enable fast rendering while preserving the fine geometric detail captured by volumetric neural fields. Furthermore, this representation does not depend on priors like structure-from-motion point clouds. Our method achieves state-of-the-art image quality on common benchmarks. Furthermore, we achieve fast inference at interactive frame rates, and can convert our trained model into a large, explicit point cloud to further enhance performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce RealmDreamer, a technique for generating forward-facing 3D scenes from text descriptions. Our method optimizes a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation to match complex text prompts using pretrained diffusion models. Our key insight is to leverage 2D inpainting diffusion models conditioned on an initial scene estimate to provide low variance supervision for unknown regions during 3D distillation. In conjunction, we imbue high-fidelity geometry with geometric distillation from a depth diffusion model, conditioned on samples from the inpainting model. We find that the initialization of the optimization is crucial, and provide a principled methodology for doing so. Notably, our technique doesn't require video or multi-view data and can synthesize various high-quality 3D scenes in different styles with complex layouts. Further, the generality of our method allows 3D synthesis from a single image. As measured by a comprehensive user study, our method outperforms all existing approaches, preferred by 88-95%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vandan Gorade, Azad Singh, Deepak Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising technique for analyzing medical modalities such as X-rays due to its ability to learn without annotations. However, conventional SSL methods face challenges in achieving semantic alignment and capturing subtle details, which limits their ability to accurately represent the underlying anatomical structures and pathological features. To address these limitations, we propose OTCXR, a novel SSL framework that leverages optimal transport (OT) to learn dense semantic invariance. By integrating OT with our innovative Cross-Viewpoint Semantics Infusion Module (CV-SIM), OTCXR enhances the model's ability to capture not only local spatial features but also global contextual dependencies across different viewpoints. This approach enriches the effectiveness of SSL in the context of chest radiographs. Furthermore, OTCXR incorporates variance and covariance regularizations within the OT framework to prioritize clinically relevant information while suppressing less informative features. This ensures that the learned representations are comprehensive and discriminative, particularly beneficial for tasks such as thoracic disease diagnosis. We validate OTCXR's efficacy through comprehensive experiments on three publicly available chest X-ray datasets. Our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of OTCXR over state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks, confirming its capability to learn semantically rich representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of foundational models has significantly advanced segmentation approaches. However, existing models still face challenges in automatically segmenting personalized instances in dense scenarios, where severe occlusions, scale variations, and background clutter hinder precise instance delineation. To address this, we propose PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot framework for personalized instance segmentation in dense images. We start with developing a new baseline capable of automatically generating instance-level point prompts via proposing a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps, encapsulating spatial distribution of objects in an image. To reduce false positives, we design the Point Prompt Selection Module (PPSM), which refines the output of IDM based on an adaptive threshold. Both IDM and PPSM seamlessly integrate into our model-agnostic framework. Furthermore, we introduce a feedback mechanism which enables PerSense to improve the accuracy of density maps by automating the exemplar selection process for density map generation. Finally, to promote algorithmic advances and effective tools for this relatively underexplored task, we introduce PerSense-D, an evaluation benchmark exclusive to personalized instance segmentation in dense images. Our extensive experiments establish PerSense superiority in dense scenarios compared to SOTA approaches. Additionally, our qualitative findings demonstrate the adaptability of our framework to images captured in-the-wild.</p>

<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an effective and efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingchao Peng, Thomas Bashford-Rogers, Francesco Banterle, Haitao Zhao, Kurt Debattista</p>
<p>Abstract: Capturing images with enough details to solve imaging tasks is a long-standing challenge in imaging, particularly due to the limitations of standard dynamic range (SDR) images which often lose details in underexposed or overexposed regions. Traditional high dynamic range (HDR) methods, like multi-exposure fusion or inverse tone mapping, struggle with ghosting and incomplete data reconstruction. Infrared (IR) imaging offers a unique advantage by being less affected by lighting conditions, providing consistent detail capture regardless of visible light intensity. In this paper, we introduce the HDRT dataset, the first comprehensive dataset that consists of HDR and thermal IR images. The HDRT dataset comprises 50,000 images captured across three seasons over six months in eight cities, providing a diverse range of lighting conditions and environmental contexts. Leveraging this dataset, we propose HDRTNet, a novel deep neural method that fuses IR and SDR content to generate HDR images. Extensive experiments validate HDRTNet against the state-of-the-art, showing substantial quantitative and qualitative quality improvements. The HDRT dataset not only advances IR-guided HDR imaging but also offers significant potential for broader research in HDR imaging, multi-modal fusion, domain transfer, and beyond.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jikai Wang, Qifan Zhang, Yu-Wei Chao, Bowen Wen, Xiaohu Guo, Yu Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a data capture system and a new dataset, HO-Cap, for 3D reconstruction and pose tracking of hands and objects in videos. The system leverages multiple RGBD cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boris Meinardus, Hector Rodriguez, Anil Batra, Anna Rohrbach, Marcus Rohrbach</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has prompted the extension to the multimodal domain developing image-text Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and then video-text models. In this work, we investigate the challenge of contextual and temporal comprehension in video-language models by exploring the task of temporal localization in videos. To address this problem, prior works have developed complex task-specific architectures, novel modules to embed time into MLLMs, or leveraged additional input signals such as video transcripts to best encode contextual and temporal information. Interestingly, we find that most of these efforts are surpassed by a much simpler design. We introduce Chrono, a universal sequence blueprint that can be applied to an image-text pretrained MLLM. Through extensive ablations across different MLLM architectures, finetuning and zero-shot settings, and different datasets, we achieve a new SOTA in moment retrieval on the most widely used benchmarks Charades-STA, QVHighlights, ActivityNet Captions, and grounded video question answering on NeXT-GQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanglei Yang, Haipeng Li, Mingbo Hong, Chen-Lin Zhang, Jiajun Li, Shuaicheng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present RS-Diffusion, the first Diffusion Models-based method for single-frame Rolling Shutter (RS) correction. RS artifacts compromise visual quality of frames due to the row-wise exposure of CMOS sensors. Most previous methods have focused on multi-frame approaches, using temporal information from consecutive frames for the motion rectification. However, few approaches address the more challenging but important single frame RS correction. In this work, we present an ``image-to-motion" framework via diffusion techniques, with a designed patch-attention module. In addition, we present the RS-Real dataset, comprised of captured RS frames alongside their corresponding Global Shutter (GS) ground-truth pairs. The GS frames are corrected from the RS ones, guided by the corresponding Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) gyroscope data acquired during capture. Experiments show that RS-Diffusion surpasses previous single-frame RS methods, demonstrates the potential of diffusion-based approaches, and provides a valuable dataset for further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niki Amini-Naieni, Tengda Han, Andrew Zisserman</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of this paper is to improve the generality and accuracy of open-vocabulary object counting in images. To improve the generality, we repurpose an open-vocabulary detection foundation model (GroundingDINO) for the counting task, and also extend its capabilities by introducing modules to enable specifying the target object to count by visual exemplars. In turn, these new capabilities - being able to specify the target object by multi-modalites (text and exemplars) - lead to an improvement in counting accuracy.
  We make three contributions: First, we introduce the first open-world counting model, CountGD, where the prompt can be specified by a text description or visual exemplars or both; Second, we show that the performance of the model significantly improves the state of the art on multiple counting benchmarks - when using text only, CountGD is comparable to or outperforms all previous text-only works, and when using both text and visual exemplars, we outperform all previous models; Third, we carry out a preliminary study into different interactions between the text and visual exemplar prompts, including the cases where they reinforce each other and where one restricts the other. The code and an app to test the model are available at https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/countgd/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tsung-Han Wu, Giscard Biamby, Jerome Quenum, Ritwik Gupta, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Trevor Darrell, David M. Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made significant strides in visual question-answering for single images. Recent advancements like long-context LMMs have allowed them to ingest larger, or even multiple, images. However, the ability to process a large number of visual tokens does not guarantee effective retrieval and reasoning for multi-image question answering (MIQA), especially in real-world applications like photo album searches or satellite imagery analysis. In this work, we first assess the limitations of current benchmarks for long-context LMMs. We address these limitations by introducing a new vision-centric, long-context benchmark, "Visual Haystacks (VHs)". We comprehensively evaluate both open-source and proprietary models on VHs, and demonstrate that these models struggle when reasoning across potentially unrelated images, perform poorly on cross-image reasoning, as well as exhibit biases based on the placement of key information within the context window. Towards a solution, we introduce MIRAGE (Multi-Image Retrieval Augmented Generation), an open-source, lightweight visual-RAG framework that processes up to 10k images on a single 40G A100 GPU -- far surpassing the 1k-image limit of contemporary models. MIRAGE demonstrates up to 13% performance improvement over existing open-source LMMs on VHs, sets a new state-of-the-art on the RetVQA multi-image QA benchmark, and achieves competitive performance on single-image QA with state-of-the-art LMMs. Our dataset, model, and code are available at: https://visual-haystacks.github.io.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has become an important approach in pretraining large neural networks, enabling unprecedented scaling of model and dataset sizes. While recent advances like I-JEPA have shown promising results for Vision Transformers, adapting such methods to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) presents unique challenges. In this paper, we introduce CNN-JEPA, a novel SSL method that successfully applies the joint embedding predictive architecture approach to CNNs. Our method incorporates a sparse CNN encoder to handle masked inputs, a fully convolutional predictor using depthwise separable convolutions, and an improved masking strategy. We demonstrate that CNN-JEPA outperforms I-JEPA with ViT architectures on ImageNet-100, achieving a 73.3% linear top-1 accuracy using a standard ResNet-50 encoder. Compared to other CNN-based SSL methods, CNN-JEPA requires 17-35% less training time for the same number of epochs and approaches the linear and k-NN top-1 accuracies of BYOL, SimCLR, and VICReg. Our approach offers a simpler, more efficient alternative to existing SSL methods for CNNs, requiring minimal augmentations and no separate projector network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haofeng Liu, Erli Zhang, Junde Wu, Mingxuan Hong, Yueming Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery and is vital for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has shown superior advancements in image and video segmentation. However, SAM2 struggles with efficiency due to the high computational demands of processing high-resolution images and complex and long-range temporal dynamics in surgical videos. To address these challenges, we introduce Surgical SAM 2 (SurgSAM2), an advanced model to utilize SAM2 with an Efficient Frame Pruning (EFP) mechanism, to facilitate real-time surgical video segmentation. The EFP mechanism dynamically manages the memory bank by selectively retaining only the most informative frames, reducing memory usage and computational cost while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgSAM2 significantly improves both efficiency and segmentation accuracy compared to the vanilla SAM2. Remarkably, SurgSAM2 achieves a 3$\times$ FPS compared with SAM2, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance after fine-tuning with lower-resolution data. These advancements establish SurgSAM2 as a leading model for surgical video analysis, making real-time surgical video segmentation in resource-constrained environments a reality.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09859">OccMamba: Semantic Occupancy Prediction with State Space Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng Li, Yuenan Hou, Xiaohan Xing, Yuexin Ma, Xiao Sun, Yanyong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Training deep learning models for semantic occupancy prediction is challenging due to factors such as a large number of occupancy cells, severe occlusion, limited visual cues, complicated driving scenarios, etc. Recent methods often adopt transformer-based architectures given their strong capability in learning input-conditioned weights and long-range relationships. However, transformer-based networks are notorious for their quadratic computation complexity, seriously undermining their efficacy and deployment in semantic occupancy prediction. Inspired by the global modeling and linear computation complexity of the Mamba architecture, we present the first Mamba-based network for semantic occupancy prediction, termed OccMamba. Specifically, we first design the hierarchical Mamba module and local context processor to better aggregate global and local contextual information, respectively. Besides, to relieve the inherent domain gap between the linguistic and 3D domains, we present a simple yet effective 3D-to-1D reordering scheme, i.e., height-prioritized 2D Hilbert expansion. It can maximally retain the spatial structure of 3D voxels as well as facilitate the processing of Mamba blocks. Endowed with the aforementioned designs, our OccMamba is capable of directly and efficiently processing large volumes of dense scene grids, achieving state-of-the-art performance across three prevalent occupancy prediction benchmarks, including OpenOccupancy, SemanticKITTI, and SemanticPOSS. Notably, on OpenOccupancy, our OccMamba outperforms the previous state-of-the-art Co-Occ by 5.1% IoU and 4.3% mIoU, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungduk Yu, Brian L. White, Anahita Bhiwandiwalla, Musashi Hinck, Matthew Lyle Olson, Yaniv Gurwicz, Raanan Y. Rohekar, Tung Nguyen, Vasudev Lal</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting and attributing temperature increases driven by climate change is crucial for understanding global warming and informing adaptation strategies. However, distinguishing human-induced climate signals from natural variability remains challenging for traditional detection and attribution (D&A) methods, which rely on identifying specific "fingerprints" -- spatial patterns expected to emerge from external forcings such as greenhouse gas emissions. Deep learning offers promise in discerning these complex patterns within expansive spatial datasets, yet the lack of standardized protocols has hindered consistent comparisons across studies.
  To address this gap, we introduce ClimDetect, a standardized dataset comprising 1.17M daily climate snapshots paired with target climate change indicator variables. The dataset is curated from both CMIP6 climate model simulations and real-world observation-assimilated reanalysis datasets (ERA5, JRA-3Q, and MERRA-2), and is designed to enhance model accuracy in detecting climate change signals. ClimDetect integrates various input and target variables used in previous research, ensuring comparability and consistency across studies. We also explore the application of vision transformers (ViT) to climate data -- a novel approach that, to our knowledge, has not been attempted before for climate change detection tasks. Our open-access data serve as a benchmark for advancing climate science by enabling end-to-end model development and evaluation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongpai Gao, Benjamin Planche, Meng Zheng, Anwesa Choudhuri, Terrence Chen, Ziyan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel view synthesis has advanced significantly with the development of neural radiance fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). However, achieving high quality without compromising real-time rendering remains challenging, particularly for physically-based ray tracing with view-dependent effects. Recently, N-dimensional Gaussians (N-DG) introduced a 6D spatial-angular representation to better incorporate view-dependent effects, but the Gaussian representation and control scheme are sub-optimal. In this paper, we revisit 6D Gaussians and introduce 6D Gaussian Splatting (6DGS), which enhances color and opacity representations and leverages the additional directional information in the 6D space for optimized Gaussian control. Our approach is fully compatible with the 3DGS framework and significantly improves real-time radiance field rendering by better modeling view-dependent effects and fine details. Experiments demonstrate that 6DGS significantly outperforms 3DGS and N-DG, achieving up to a 15.73 dB improvement in PSNR with a reduction of 66.5% Gaussian points compared to 3DGS.

<p>Abstract: The spatio-temporal complexity of video data presents significant challenges in tasks such as compression, generation, and inpainting. We present four key contributions to address the challenges of spatiotemporal video processing. First, we introduce the 3D Mobile Inverted Vector-Quantization Variational Autoencoder (3D-MBQ-VAE), which combines Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with masked token modeling to enhance spatiotemporal video compression. The model achieves superior temporal consistency and state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction quality by employing a novel training strategy with full frame masking. Second, we present MotionAura, a text-to-video generation framework that utilizes vector-quantized diffusion models to discretize the latent space and capture complex motion dynamics, producing temporally coherent videos aligned with text prompts. Third, we propose a spectral transformer-based denoising network that processes video data in the frequency domain using the Fourier Transform. This method effectively captures global context and long-range dependencies for high-quality video generation and denoising. Lastly, we introduce a downstream task of Sketch Guided Video Inpainting. This task leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our models achieve SOTA performance on a range of benchmarks. Our work offers robust frameworks for spatiotemporal modeling and user-driven video content manipulation. We will release the code, datasets, and models in open-source.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengwei Yang, Yuke Li, Qiang Sun, Basura Fernando, Heng Huang, Zheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing studies on few-shot learning focus on unimodal settings, where models are trained to generalize to unseen data using a limited amount of labeled examples from a single modality. However, real-world data are inherently multi-modal, and such unimodal approaches limit the practical applications of few-shot learning. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces the Cross-modal Few-Shot Learning (CFSL) task, which aims to recognize instances across multiple modalities while relying on scarce labeled data. This task presents unique challenges compared to classical few-shot learning arising from the distinct visual attributes and structural disparities inherent to each modality. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Generative Transfer Learning (GTL) framework by simulating how humans abstract and generalize concepts. Specifically, the GTL jointly estimates the latent shared concept across modalities and the in-modality disturbance through a generative structure. Establishing the relationship between latent concepts and visual content among abundant unimodal data enables GTL to effectively transfer knowledge from unimodal to novel multimodal data, as humans did. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the GTL achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven multi-modal datasets across RGB-Sketch, RGB-Infrared, and RGB-Depth.</p>

<p>Abstract: The translation of Low Dynamic Range (LDR) to High Dynamic Range (HDR) images is an important computer vision task. There is a significant amount of research utilizing both conventional non-learning methods and modern data-driven approaches, focusing on using both single-exposed and multi-exposed LDR for HDR image reconstruction. However, most current state-of-the-art methods require high-quality paired {LDR,HDR} datasets for model training. In addition, there is limited literature on using unpaired datasets for this task, that is, the model learns a mapping between domains, i.e., {LDR,HDR}. This paper proposes LLM-HDR, a method that integrates the perception of Large Language Models (LLM) into a modified semantic- and cycle-consistent adversarial architecture that utilizes unpaired {LDR,HDR} datasets for training. The method introduces novel artifact- and exposure-aware generators to address visual artifact removal and an encoder and loss to address semantic consistency, another under-explored topic. LLM-HDR is the first to use an LLM for the {LDR,HDR} translation task in a self-supervised setup. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance across several benchmark datasets and reconstructs high-quality HDR images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Tang, Ao Qu, Zhaokai Wang, Dingyi Zhuang, Zhaofeng Wu, Wei Ma, Shenhao Wang, Yunhan Zheng, Zhan Zhao, Jinhua Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, their proficiency in spatial reasoning remains limited, despite its crucial role in tasks involving navigation and interaction with physical environments. Specifically, most of these tasks rely on the core spatial reasoning capabilities in two-dimensional (2D) environments, and our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art VLMs frequently generate implausible and incorrect responses to composite spatial reasoning problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans can solve effortlessly at a glance. To address this, we explore an effective approach to enhance 2D spatial reasoning within VLMs by training the model solely on basic spatial capabilities. We begin by disentangling the key components of 2D spatial reasoning: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. Our central hypothesis is that mastering these basic spatial capabilities can significantly enhance a model's performance on composite spatial tasks requiring advanced spatial understanding and combinatorial problem-solving, with generalized improvements in real-world visual-spatial tasks. To investigate this hypothesis, we introduce Sparkle: a framework that uses synthetic data generation to provide targeted supervision for vision language models (VLMs) in three basic spatial capabilities, creating an instruction dataset for each capability. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs fine-tuned with Sparkle achieve significant performance gains, not only in the basic tasks themselves but also in generalizing to composite and out-of-distribution real-world spatial reasoning tasks. These findings offer insights into systematic strategies for improving VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reconstructing controllable Gaussian splats from monocular video is a challenging task due to its inherently insufficient constraints. Widely adopted approaches supervise complex interactions with additional masks and control signal annotations, limiting their real-world applications. In this paper, we propose an annotation guidance-free method, dubbed FreeGaussian, that mathematically derives dynamic Gaussian motion from optical flow and camera motion using novel dynamic Gaussian constraints. By establishing a connection between 2D flows and 3D Gaussian dynamic control, our method enables self-supervised optimization and continuity of dynamic Gaussian motions from flow priors. Furthermore, we introduce a 3D spherical vector controlling scheme, which represents the state with a 3D Gaussian trajectory, thereby eliminating the need for complex 1D control signal calculations and simplifying controllable Gaussian modeling. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art visual performance and control capability of our method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Royi Rassin, Aviv Slobodkin, Shauli Ravfogel, Yanai Elazar, Yoav Goldberg</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce GRADE, an automatic method for quantifying sample diversity in text-to-image models. Our method leverages the world knowledge embedded in large language models and visual question-answering systems to identify relevant concept-specific axes of diversity (e.g., ``shape'' for the concept ``cookie''). It then estimates frequency distributions of concepts and their attributes and quantifies diversity using entropy. We use GRADE to measure the diversity of 12 models over a total of 720K images, revealing that all models display limited variation, with clear deterioration in stronger models. Further, we find that models often exhibit default behaviors, a phenomenon where a model consistently generates concepts with the same attributes (e.g., 98% of the cookies are round). Lastly, we show that a key reason for low diversity is underspecified captions in training data. Our work proposes an automatic, semantically-driven approach to measure sample diversity and highlights the stunning homogeneity in text-to-image models.</p>

However, the existing LoRA model serving is excessively computationally expensive and causes extremely high latency. In this paper, we present an end-to-end solution that empowers diverse vision tasks and enriches vision applications with LoRA LMMs. Our system, VaLoRA, enables accurate and efficient vision tasks by 1) an accuracy-aware LoRA adapter generation approach that generates LoRA adapters rich in domain-specific knowledge to meet application-specific accuracy requirements, 2) an adaptive-tiling LoRA adapters batching operator that efficiently computes concurrent heterogeneous LoRA adapters, and 3) a flexible LoRA adapter orchestration mechanism that manages application requests and LoRA adapters to achieve the lowest average response latency. We prototype VaLoRA on five popular vision tasks on three LMMs. Experiment results reveal that VaLoRA improves 24-62% of the accuracy compared to the original LMMs and reduces 20-89% of the latency compared to the state-of-the-art LoRA model serving systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Abu Bakr Siddique, Jiayi Wu, Ioannis Rekleitis, Md Jahidul Islam</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the idea of AquaFuse, a physics-based method for synthesizing waterbody properties in underwater imagery. We formulate a closed-form solution for waterbody fusion that facilitates realistic data augmentation and geometrically consistent underwater scene rendering. AquaFuse leverages the physical characteristics of light propagation underwater to synthesize the waterbody from one scene to the object contents of another. Unlike data-driven style transfer, AquaFuse preserves the depth consistency and object geometry in an input scene. We validate this unique feature by comprehensive experiments over diverse underwater scenes. We find that the AquaFused images preserve over 94% depth consistency and 90-95% structural similarity of the input scenes. We also demonstrate that it generates accurate 3D view synthesis by preserving object geometry while adapting to the inherent waterbody fusion process. AquaFuse opens up a new research direction in data augmentation by geometry-preserving style transfer for underwater imaging and robot vision applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuorui Ye, Farzan Farnia</p>
<p>Abstract: Saliency maps have been widely used to interpret the decisions of neural network classifiers and discover phenomena from their learned functions. However, standard gradient-based maps are frequently observed to be highly sensitive to the randomness of training data and the stochasticity in the training process. In this work, we study the role of Gaussian smoothing in the well-known Smooth-Grad algorithm in the stability of the gradient-based maps to the randomness of training samples. We extend the algorithmic stability framework to gradient-based interpretation maps and prove bounds on the stability error of standard Simple-Grad, Integrated-Gradients, and Smooth-Grad saliency maps. Our theoretical results suggest the role of Gaussian smoothing in boosting the stability of gradient-based maps to the randomness of training settings. On the other hand, we analyze the faithfulness of the Smooth-Grad maps to the original Simple-Grad and show the lower fidelity under a more intense Gaussian smoothing. We support our theoretical results by performing several numerical experiments on standard image datasets. Our empirical results confirm our hypothesis on the fidelity-stability trade-off in the application of Gaussian smoothing to gradient-based interpretation maps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihang Fan, Huaibo Huang, Ran He</p>
<p>Abstract: The Softmax attention mechanism in Transformer models is notoriously computationally expensive, particularly due to its quadratic complexity, posing significant challenges in vision applications. In contrast, linear attention provides a far more efficient solution by reducing the complexity to linear levels. However, compared to Softmax attention, linear attention often experiences significant performance degradation. Our experiments indicate that this performance drop is due to the low-rank nature of linear attention's feature map, which hinders its ability to adequately model complex spatial information. In this paper, to break the low-rank dilemma of linear attention, we conduct rank analysis from two perspectives: the KV buffer and the output features. Consequently, we introduce Rank-Augmented Linear Attention (RALA), which rivals the performance of Softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity and high efficiency. Based on RALA, we construct the Rank-Augmented Vision Linear Transformer (RAVLT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAVLT achieves excellent performance across various vision tasks. Specifically, without using any additional labels, data, or supervision during training, RAVLT achieves an 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k with only 26M parameters and 4.6G FLOPs. This result significantly surpasses previous linear attention mechanisms, fully illustrating the potential of RALA. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/RALA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaobin Deng, Changyu Diao, Min Li, Ruohan Yu, Duanqing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated outstanding performance in novel view synthesis, achieving a balance between rendering quality and real-time performance. 3DGS employs Adaptive Density Control (ADC) to increase the number of Gaussians. However, the clone and split operations within ADC are not sufficiently efficient, impacting optimization speed and detail recovery. Additionally, overfitted Gaussians that affect rendering quality may exist, and the original ADC is unable to remove them. To address these issues, we propose two key innovations: (1) Long-Axis Split, which precisely controls the position, shape, and opacity of child Gaussians to minimize the difference before and after splitting. (2) Recovery-Aware Pruning, which leverages differences in recovery speed after resetting opacity to prune overfitted Gaussians, thereby improving generalization performance. Experimental results show that our method significantly enhances rendering quality. Code is available at https://github.com/XiaoBin2001/EDC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Immel, Richard Fehler, Frank Bieder, Jan-Hendrik Pauls, Christoph Stiller</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on HD maps for their operation, but offline HD maps eventually become outdated. For this reason, online HD map construction methods use live sensor data to infer map information instead. Research on real map changes shows that oftentimes entire parts of an HD map remain unchanged and can be used as a prior. We therefore introduce M3TR (Multi-Masking Map Transformer), a generalist approach for HD map completion both with and without offline HD map priors. As a necessary foundation, we address shortcomings in ground truth labels for Argoverse 2 and nuScenes and propose the first comprehensive benchmark for HD map completion. Unlike existing models that specialize in a single kind of map change, which is unrealistic for deployment, our Generalist model handles all kinds of changes, matching the effectiveness of Expert models. With our map masking as augmentation regime, we can even achieve a +1.4 mAP improvement without a prior. Finally, by fully utilizing prior HD map elements and optimizing query designs, M3TR outperforms existing methods by +4.3 mAP while being the first real-world deployable model for offline HD map priors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunsheng Ma, Burhaneddin Yaman, Xin Ye, Jingru Luo, Feng Tao, Abhirup Mallik, Ziran Wang, Liu Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Bird's eye view (BEV)-based 3D perception plays a crucial role in autonomous driving applications. The rise of large language models has spurred interest in BEV-based captioning to understand object behavior in the surrounding environment. However, existing approaches treat perception and captioning as separate tasks, focusing on the performance of only one task and overlooking the potential benefits of multimodal alignment. To bridge this gap between modalities, we introduce MTA, a novel multimodal task alignment framework that boosts both BEV perception and captioning. MTA consists of two key components: (1) BEV-Language Alignment (BLA), a contextual learning mechanism that aligns the BEV scene representations with ground-truth language representations, and (2) Detection-Captioning Alignment (DCA), a cross-modal prompting mechanism that aligns detection and captioning outputs. MTA seamlessly integrates into state-of-the-art baselines during training, adding no extra computational complexity at runtime. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and TOD3Cap datasets show that MTA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both tasks, achieving a 10.7% improvement in challenging rare perception scenarios and a 9.2% improvement in captioning. These results underscore the effectiveness of unified alignment in reconciling BEV-based perception and captioning.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10794">Going Beyond Conventional OOD Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sudarshan Regmi</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical to ensure the safe deployment of deep learning models in critical applications. Deep learning models can often misidentify OOD samples as in-distribution (ID) samples. This vulnerability worsens in the presence of spurious correlation in the training set. Likewise, in fine-grained classification settings, detection of fine-grained OOD samples becomes inherently challenging due to their high similarity to ID samples. However, current research on OOD detection has largely ignored these challenging scenarios, focusing instead on relatively easier (conventional) cases. In this work, we present a unified Approach to Spurious, fine-grained, and Conventional OOD Detection (ASCOOD). First, we propose synthesizing virtual outliers from ID data by approximating the destruction of invariant features. To this end, we identify invariant features with the pixel attribution method using the model being learned. This approach eliminates the burden of curating external OOD datasets. Then, we simultaneously incentivize ID classification and predictive uncertainty towards virtual outliers leveraging standardized feature representation. Our approach effectively mitigates the impact of spurious correlations and encourages capturing fine-grained attributes. Extensive experiments across seven datasets demonstrate the merit of ASCOOD in spurious, fine-grained, and conventional settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinxing Zhou, Dan Guo, Ruohao Guo, Yuxin Mao, Jingjing Hu, Yiran Zhong, Xiaojun Chang, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Audio-Visual Event Localization (AVEL) task aims to temporally locate and classify video events that are both audible and visible. Most research in this field assumes a closed-set setting, which restricts these models' ability to handle test data containing event categories absent (unseen) during training. Recently, a few studies have explored AVEL in an open-set setting, enabling the recognition of unseen events as ``unknown'', but without providing category-specific semantics. In this paper, we advance the field by introducing the Open-Vocabulary Audio-Visual Event Localization (OV-AVEL) problem, which requires localizing audio-visual events and predicting explicit categories for both seen and unseen data at inference. To address this new task, we propose the OV-AVEBench dataset, comprising 24,800 videos across 67 real-life audio-visual scenes (seen:unseen = 46:21), each with manual segment-level annotation. We also establish three evaluation metrics for this task. Moreover, we investigate two baseline approaches, one training-free and one using a further fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we utilize the unified multimodal space from the pretrained ImageBind model to extract audio, visual, and textual (event classes) features. The training-free baseline then determines predictions by comparing the consistency of audio-text and visual-text feature similarities. The fine-tuning baseline incorporates lightweight temporal layers to encode temporal relations within the audio and visual modalities, using OV-AVEBench training data for model fine-tuning. We evaluate these baselines on the proposed OV-AVEBench dataset and discuss potential directions for future work in this new field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Zhao, Hao Wang, Xingyue Zhao, Hao Fei, Hongqiu Wang, Chengjiang Long, Hua Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D generation models have opened new possibilities for simulating dynamic 3D object movements and customizing behaviors, yet creating this content remains challenging. Current methods often require manual assignment of precise physical properties for simulations or rely on video generation models to predict them, which is computationally intensive. In this paper, we rethink the usage of multi-modal large language model (MLLM) in physics-based simulation, and present Sim Anything, a physics-based approach that endows static 3D objects with interactive dynamics. We begin with detailed scene reconstruction and object-level 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, progressing to multi-view image in-painting. Inspired by human visual reasoning, we propose MLLM-based Physical Property Perception (MLLM-P3) to predict mean physical properties of objects in a zero-shot manner. Based on the mean values and the object's geometry, the Material Property Distribution Prediction model (MPDP) model then estimates the full distribution, reformulating the problem as probability distribution estimation to reduce computational costs. Finally, we simulate objects in an open-world scene with particles sampled via the Physical-Geometric Adaptive Sampling (PGAS) strategy, efficiently capturing complex deformations and significantly reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate our Sim Anything achieves more realistic motion than state-of-the-art methods within 2 minutes on a single GPU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gayatri Deshmukh, Somsubhra De, Chirag Sehgal, Jishu Sen Gupta, Sparsh Mittal</p>
<p>Abstract: Specialized datasets that capture the fashion industry's rich language and styling elements can boost progress in AI-driven fashion design. We present FLORA (Fashion Language Outfit Representation for Apparel Generation), the first comprehensive dataset containing 4,330 curated pairs of fashion outfits and corresponding textual descriptions. Each description utilizes industry-specific terminology and jargon commonly used by professional fashion designers, providing precise and detailed insights into the outfits. Hence, the dataset captures the delicate features and subtle stylistic elements necessary to create high-fidelity fashion designs. We demonstrate that fine-tuning generative models on the FLORA dataset significantly enhances their capability to generate accurate and stylistically rich images from textual descriptions of fashion sketches. FLORA will catalyze the creation of advanced AI models capable of comprehending and producing subtle, stylistically rich fashion designs. It will also help fashion designers and end-users to bring their ideas to life.
  As a second orthogonal contribution, we introduce KAN Adapters, which leverage Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as adaptive modules. They serve as replacements for traditional MLP-based LoRA adapters. With learnable spline-based activations, KAN Adapters excel in modeling complex, non-linear relationships, achieving superior fidelity, faster convergence and semantic alignment. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on our proposed FLORA dataset validate the superiority of KAN Adapters over LoRA adapters. To foster further research and collaboration, we will open-source both the FLORA and our implementation code.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human communication often relies on visual cues to resolve ambiguity. While humans can intuitively integrate these cues, AI systems often find it challenging to engage in sophisticated multimodal reasoning. We introduce VAGUE, a benchmark evaluating multimodal AI systems' ability to integrate visual context for intent disambiguation. VAGUE consists of 1.6K ambiguous textual expressions, each paired with an image and multiple-choice interpretations, where the correct answer is only apparent with visual context. The dataset spans both staged, complex (Visual Commonsense Reasoning) and natural, personal (Ego4D) scenes, ensuring diversity. Our experiments reveal that existing multimodal AI models struggle to infer the speaker's true intent. While performance consistently improves from the introduction of more visual cues, the overall accuracy remains far below human performance, highlighting a critical gap in multimodal reasoning. Analysis of failure cases demonstrates that current models fail to distinguish true intent from superficial correlations in the visual scene, indicating that they perceive images but do not effectively reason with them.

<p>Abstract: We present OminiControl, a novel approach that rethinks how image conditions are integrated into Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures. Current image conditioning methods either introduce substantial parameter overhead or handle only specific control tasks effectively, limiting their practical versatility. OminiControl addresses these limitations through three key innovations: (1) a minimal architectural design that leverages the DiT's own VAE encoder and transformer blocks, requiring just 0.1% additional parameters; (2) a unified sequence processing strategy that combines condition tokens with image tokens for flexible token interactions; and (3) a dynamic position encoding mechanism that adapts to both spatially-aligned and non-aligned control tasks. Our extensive experiments show that this streamlined approach not only matches but surpasses the performance of specialized methods across multiple conditioning tasks. To overcome data limitations in subject-driven generation, we also introduce Subjects200K, a large-scale dataset of identity-consistent image pairs synthesized using DiT models themselves. This work demonstrates that effective image control can be achieved without architectural complexity, opening new possibilities for efficient and versatile image generation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengfei Zhang, Pinxin Liu, Hyeongwoo Kim, Pablo Garrido, Bindita Chaudhuri</p>
<p>Abstract: Current human motion synthesis frameworks rely on global action descriptions, creating a modality gap that limits both motion understanding and generation capabilities. A single coarse description, such as ``run", fails to capture details like variations in speed, limb positioning, and kinematic dynamics, leading to ambiguities between text and motion modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{KinMo}, a unified framework built on a hierarchical describable motion representation that extends beyond global action by incorporating kinematic group movements and their interactions. We design an automated annotation pipeline to generate high-quality, fine-grained descriptions for this decomposition, resulting in the KinMo dataset. To leverage these structured descriptions, we propose Hierarchical Text-Motion Alignment, improving spatial understanding by integrating additional motion details. Furthermore, we introduce a coarse-to-fine generation procedure to leverage enhanced spatial understanding to improve motion synthesis. Experimental results show that KinMo significantly improves motion understanding, demonstrated by enhanced text-motion retrieval performance and enabling more fine-grained motion generation and editing capabilities.

<p>Abstract: In object recognition, both the subject of interest (referred to as foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG) may play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to unintended over-reliance on the BG, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. The problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG, sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose "Localize to Recognize Robustly" (L2R2), a novel recognition approach which exploits the benefits of context-aware classification while maintaining robustness to distribution shifts. L2R2 leverages advances in zero-shot detection to localize the FG before recognition. It improves the performance of both standard recognition with supervised training, as well as multimodal zero-shot recognition with VLMs, while being robust to long-tail BGs and distribution shifts. The results confirm localization before recognition is possible for a wide range of datasets and they highlight the limits of object detection on others</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in the Mamba architecture, with its linear computational complexity, being a promising alternative to transformer architectures suffering from quadratic complexity. While existing works primarily focus on adapting Mamba as vision encoders, the critical role of task-specific Mamba decoders remains under-explored, particularly for distortion-prone dense prediction tasks. This paper addresses two interconnected challenges: (1) The design of a Mamba-based decoder that seamlessly adapts to various architectures (e.g., CNN-, Transformer-, and Mamba-based backbones), and (2) The performance degradation in decoders lacking distortion-aware capability when processing wide-FoV images (e.g., 180{\deg} fisheye and 360{\deg} panoramic settings). We propose the Deformable Mamba Decoder, an efficient distortion-aware decoder that integrates Mamba's computational efficiency with adaptive distortion awareness. Comprehensive experiments on five wide-FoV segmentation benchmarks validate its effectiveness. Notably, our decoder achieves a +2.5% performance improvement on the 360{\deg} Stanford2D3D segmentation benchmark while reducing 72% parameters and 97% FLOPs, as compared to the widely-used decoder heads.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Virtual Try-On (VTO) have demonstrated exceptional efficacy in generating realistic images and preserving garment details, largely attributed to the robust generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion backbones. However, the T2I models that underpin these methods have become outdated, thereby limiting the potential for further improvement in VTO. Additionally, current methods face notable challenges in accurately rendering text on garments without distortion and preserving fine-grained details, such as textures and material fidelity. The emergence of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) based T2I models has showcased impressive performance and offers a promising opportunity for advancing VTO. Directly applying existing VTO techniques to transformer-based T2I models is ineffective due to substantial architectural differences, which hinder their ability to fully leverage the models' advanced capabilities for improved text generation. To address these challenges and unlock the full potential of DiT-based T2I models for VTO, we propose TED-VITON, a novel framework that integrates a Garment Semantic (GS) Adapter for enhancing garment-specific features, a Text Preservation Loss to ensure accurate and distortion-free text rendering, and a constraint mechanism to generate prompts by optimizing Large Language Model (LLM). These innovations enable state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in visual quality and text fidelity, establishing a new benchmark for VTO task. Project page: https://zhenchenwan.github.io/TED-VITON/</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enables the evaluation of image quality through natural language descriptions. This advancement allows for more detailed assessments. However, these MLLM-based IQA methods primarily rely on general contextual descriptions, sometimes limiting fine-grained quality assessment. To address this limitation, we introduce a new image quality assessment (IQA) task paradigm, grounding-IQA. This paradigm integrates multimodal referring and grounding with IQA to realize more fine-grained quality perception. Specifically, grounding-IQA comprises two subtasks: grounding-IQA-description (GIQA-DES) and visual question answering (GIQA-VQA). GIQA-DES involves detailed descriptions with precise locations (e.g., bounding boxes), while GIQA-VQA focuses on quality QA for local regions. To realize grounding-IQA, we construct a corresponding dataset, GIQA-160K, through our proposed automated annotation pipeline. Furthermore, we develop a well-designed benchmark, GIQA-Bench. The benchmark comprehensively evaluates the model grounding-IQA performance from three perspectives: description quality, VQA accuracy, and grounding precision. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed task paradigm, dataset, and benchmark facilitate the more fine-grained IQA application. Code: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/Grounding-IQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stuti Pathak, Prashant Kumar, Dheeraj Baiju, Nicholus Mboga, Gunther Steenackers, Rudi Penne</p>
<p>Abstract: Point clouds acquired in constrained, challenging, uncontrolled, and multi-sensor real-world settings are noisy, incomplete, and non-uniformly sparse. This presents acute challenges for the vital task of point cloud completion. Using tools from Algebraic Topology and Persistent Homology (PH), we demonstrate that current benchmark object point clouds lack rich topological features that are integral part of point clouds captured in realistic environments. To facilitate research in this direction, we contribute the first real-world industrial dataset for point cloud completion, RealPC - a diverse, rich and varied set of point clouds. It consists of ~ 40,000 pairs across 21 categories of industrial structures in railway establishments. Benchmark results on several strong baselines reveal that existing methods fail in real-world scenarios. We discover a striking observation - unlike current datasets, RealPC consists of multiple 0- and 1-dimensional PH-based topological features. We prove that integrating these topological priors into existing works helps improve completion. We present how 0-dimensional PH priors extract the global topology of a complete shape in the form of a 3D skeleton and assist a model in generating topologically consistent complete shapes. Since computing Homology is expensive, we present a simple, yet effective Homology Sampler guided network, BOSHNet that bypasses the Homology computation by sampling proxy backbones akin to 0-dim PH. These backbones provide similar benefits of 0-dim PH right from the start of the training, unlike similar methods where accurate backbones are obtained only during later phases of the training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renshuai Tao, Haoyu Wang, Wei Wang, Yunchao Wei, Yao Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: X-ray prohibited item detection faces challenges due to the long-tail distribution and unique characteristics of X-ray imaging. Traditional data augmentation strategies, such as copy-paste and mixup, are ineffective at improving the detection of rare items due to the complex interactions between overlapping objects. Furthermore, X-ray imaging removes easily distinguishable features like color and texture, making it difficult to differentiate between visually similar categories. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose the X-ray Imaging-driven Detection Network (XIDNet). Inspired by the unique characteristics of X-ray imaging, this network introduces two key innovations: a novel X-ray-specific augmentation strategy that generates more realistic training samples for rare items, thereby improving detection performance for categories with insufficient samples, and an contextual feature integration algorithm that captures the spatial and semantic interactions between objects and surroundings under X-ray imaging, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish between similar categories. Extensive experimental results show that XIDNet effectively leverages X-ray imaging characteristics to significantly improve detection performance, outperforming popular SoTA methods by up to 17.2% in tail categories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Zhang, Junxian Li, Jingdi Lei, Xunzhi Wang, Yujie Liu, Zonglin Yang, Jiatong Li, Weida Wang, Suorong Yang, Jianbo Wu, Peng Ye, Wanli Ouyang, Dongzhan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks. However, they still often generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses due to issues like hallucinated image understandings or unrefined reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we introduce Critic-V, a novel framework inspired by the Actor-Critic paradigm to boost the reasoning capability of VLMs. This framework decouples the reasoning process and critic process by integrating two independent components: the Reasoner, which generates reasoning paths based on visual and textual inputs, and the Critic, which provides constructive critique to refine these paths. In this approach, the Reasoner generates reasoning responses according to text prompts, which can evolve iteratively as a policy based on feedback from the Critic. This interaction process was theoretically driven by a reinforcement learning framework where the Critic offers natural language critiques instead of scalar rewards, enabling more nuanced feedback to boost the Reasoner's capability on complex reasoning tasks. The Critic model is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a preference dataset of critiques ranked by Rule-based Reward~(RBR) to enhance its critic capabilities. Evaluation results show that the Critic-V framework significantly outperforms existing methods, including GPT-4V, on 5 out of 8 benchmarks, especially regarding reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Combining a dynamic text-based policy for the Reasoner and constructive feedback from the preference-optimized Critic enables a more reliable and context-sensitive multimodal reasoning process. Our approach provides a promising solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs, improving their performance in real-world reasoning-heavy multimodal applications such as autonomous driving and embodied intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qing Jiang, Gen Luo, Yuqin Yang, Yuda Xiong, Yihao Chen, Zhaoyang Zeng, Tianhe Ren, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Perception and understanding are two pillars of computer vision. While multimodal large language models (MLLM) have demonstrated remarkable visual understanding capabilities, they arguably lack accurate perception abilities, e.g. the stage-of-the-art model Qwen2-VL only achieves a 43.9 recall rate on the COCO dataset, limiting many tasks requiring the combination of perception and understanding. In this work, we aim to bridge this perception gap from both model designing and data development perspectives. We first introduce ChatRex, an MLLM with a decoupled perception design. Instead of having the LLM directly predict box coordinates, we feed the output boxes from a universal proposal network into the LLM, allowing it to output the corresponding box indices to represent its detection results, turning the regression task into a retrieval-based task that LLM handles more proficiently. From the data perspective, we build a fully automated data engine and construct the Rexverse-2M dataset which possesses multiple granularities to support the joint training of perception and understanding. After a three-stage training approach, ChatRex demonstrates strong perception and understanding performance, and the combination of these two capabilities also unlocks many attractive applications, demonstrating their complementary roles in MLLM.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentao Wang, Hang Ye, Fangzhou Hong, Xue Yang, Jianfu Zhang, Yizhou Wang, Ziwei Liu, Liang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a single in-the-wild human photo, it remains a challenging task to reconstruct a high-fidelity 3D human model. Existing methods face difficulties including a) the varying body proportions captured by in-the-wild human images; b) diverse personal belongings within the shot; and c) ambiguities in human postures and inconsistency in human textures. In addition, the scarcity of high-quality human data intensifies the challenge. To address these problems, we propose a Generalizable image-to-3D huMAN reconstruction framework, dubbed GeneMAN, building upon a comprehensive multi-source collection of high-quality human data, including 3D scans, multi-view videos, single photos, and our generated synthetic human data. GeneMAN encompasses three key modules. 1) Without relying on parametric human models (e.g., SMPL), GeneMAN first trains a human-specific text-to-image diffusion model and a view-conditioned diffusion model, serving as GeneMAN 2D human prior and 3D human prior for reconstruction, respectively. 2) With the help of the pretrained human prior models, the Geometry Initialization-&-Sculpting pipeline is leveraged to recover high-quality 3D human geometry given a single image. 3) To achieve high-fidelity 3D human textures, GeneMAN employs the Multi-Space Texture Refinement pipeline, consecutively refining textures in the latent and the pixel spaces. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GeneMAN could generate high-quality 3D human models from a single image input, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods. Notably, GeneMAN could reveal much better generalizability in dealing with in-the-wild images, often yielding high-quality 3D human models in natural poses with common items, regardless of the body proportions in the input images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunyang Han, Yibo Hu, Mengxue Qu, Hailin Shi, Yao Zhao, Yunchao Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled open-vocabulary and free-text segmentation, yet existing models still require predefined category prompts, limiting free-form category self-generation. Most segmentation LMMs also remain confined to sparse predictions, restricting their applicability in open-set environments. In contrast, we propose ROSE, a Revolutionary Open-set dense SEgmentation LMM, which enables dense mask prediction and open-category generation through patch-wise perception. Our method treats each image patch as an independent region of interest candidate, enabling the model to predict both dense and sparse masks simultaneously. Additionally, a newly designed instruction-response paradigm takes full advantage of the generation and generalization capabilities of LMMs, achieving category prediction independent of closed-set constraints or predefined categories. To further enhance mask detail and category precision, we introduce a conversation-based refinement paradigm, integrating the prediction result from previous step with textual prompt for revision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROSE achieves competitive performance across various segmentation tasks in a unified framework. Code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bohai Gu, Hao Luo, Song Guo, Peiran Dong, Qihua Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The text-guided video inpainting technique has significantly improved the performance of content generation applications. A recent family for these improvements uses diffusion models, which have become essential for achieving high-quality video inpainting results, yet they still face performance bottlenecks in temporal consistency and computational efficiency. This motivates us to propose a new video inpainting framework using optical Flow-guided Efficient Diffusion (FloED) for higher video coherence. Specifically, FloED employs a dual-branch architecture, where the time-agnostic flow branch restores corrupted flow first, and the multi-scale flow adapters provide motion guidance to the main inpainting branch. Besides, a training-free latent interpolation method is proposed to accelerate the multi-step denoising process using flow warping. With the flow attention cache mechanism, FLoED efficiently reduces the computational cost of incorporating optical flow. Extensive experiments on background restoration and object removal tasks show that FloED outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods in both quality and efficiency. Our codes and models will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan-Yun Sun, Weiyu Liu, Siyi Gu, Dylan Lim, Goutam Bhat, Federico Tombari, Manling Li, Nick Haber, Jiajun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, enabling intuitive understanding and manipulation of objects in three-dimensional space. While foundation models demonstrate remarkable performance on some benchmarks, they still struggle with 3D reasoning tasks like arranging objects in space according to open-ended language instructions, particularly in dense and physically constrained environments. We introduce LayoutVLM, a framework and scene layout representation that exploits the semantic knowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and supports differentiable optimization to ensure physical plausibility. LayoutVLM employs VLMs to generate two mutually reinforcing representations from visually marked images, and a self-consistent decoding process to improve VLMs spatial planning. Our experiments show that LayoutVLM addresses the limitations of existing LLM and constraint-based approaches, producing physically plausible 3D layouts better aligned with the semantic intent of input language instructions. We also demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs with the proposed scene layout representation extracted from existing scene datasets can improve their reasoning performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyuan Zhang, Qintong Zhang, Bin Wang, Linke Ouyang, Zichen Wen, Ying Li, Ka-Ho Chow, Conghui He, Wentao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge to reduce hallucinations and incorporate up-to-date information without retraining. As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance. Our OHRBench, including PDF documents, Q&As, and the ground truth structured data are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R. R. Samani, A. Nunez, B. De Schutter</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing volume of available infrastructural monitoring data enables the development of powerful datadriven approaches to estimate infrastructure health conditions using direct measurements. This paper proposes a deep learning methodology to estimate infrastructure physical parameters, such as railway track stiffness, using drive-by vibration response signals. The proposed method employs a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) feature extractor accounting for temporal dependencies in the feature extraction phase, and a bidirectional Long Short-term Memory (BiLSTM) networks to leverage bidirectional temporal dependencies in both the forward and backward paths of the drive-by vibration response in condition estimation phase. Additionally, a framing approach is employed to enhance the resolution of the monitoring task to the beam level by segmenting the vibration signal into frames equal to the distance between individual beams, centering the frames over the beam nodes. The proposed LSTM-BiLSTM model offers a versatile tool for various bridge and railway infrastructure conditions monitoring using direct drive-by vibration response measurements. The results demonstrate the potential of incorporating temporal analysis in the feature extraction phase and emphasize the pivotal role of bidirectional temporal information in infrastructure health condition estimation. The proposed methodology can accurately and automatically estimate railway track stiffness and identify local stiffness reductions in the presence of noise using drive-by measurements. An illustrative case study of vehicle-track interaction simulation is used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model, achieving a maximum mean absolute percentage error of 1.7% and 0.7% in estimating railpad and ballast stiffness, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Zhang, Ryota Yoshihashi, Shunsuke Kitada, Atsuki Osanai, Yuta Nakashima</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have proven effective for layout generation due to their ability to produce structure-description languages, such as HTML or JSON. In this paper, we argue that while LLMs can perform reasonably well in certain cases, their intrinsic limitation of not being able to perceive images restricts their effectiveness in tasks requiring visual content, e.g., content-aware layout generation. Therefore, we explore whether large vision-language models (LVLMs) can be applied to content-aware layout generation. To this end, inspired by the iterative revision and heuristic evaluation workflow of designers, we propose the training-free Visual-Aware Self-Correction LAyout GeneRation (VASCAR). VASCAR enables LVLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini) iteratively refine their outputs with reference to rendered layout images, which are visualized as colored bounding boxes on poster background (i.e., canvas). Extensive experiments and user study demonstrate VASCAR's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) layout generation quality. Furthermore, the generalizability of VASCAR across GPT-4o and Gemini demonstrates its versatility.</p>

Once the coherent panoramic image and its corresponding depth are obtained, the scene can be reconstructed by inpainting the small occluded regions and projecting them into 3D space. Our key contribution is formulating single-image panorama and depth estimation as two optimization tasks and introducing alternating minimization strategies to effectively solve their objectives. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing techniques in single-image 360{\deg} 3D scene reconstruction in terms of consistency and overall quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating high-fidelity, controllable, and annotated training data is critical for autonomous driving. Existing methods typically generate a single data form directly from a coarse scene layout, which not only fails to output rich data forms required for diverse downstream tasks but also struggles to model the direct layout-to-data distribution. In this paper, we introduce UniScene, the first unified framework for generating three key data forms - semantic occupancy, video, and LiDAR - in driving scenes. UniScene employs a progressive generation process that decomposes the complex task of scene generation into two hierarchical steps: (a) first generating semantic occupancy from a customized scene layout as a meta scene representation rich in both semantic and geometric information, and then (b) conditioned on occupancy, generating video and LiDAR data, respectively, with two novel transfer strategies of Gaussian-based Joint Rendering and Prior-guided Sparse Modeling. This occupancy-centric approach reduces the generation burden, especially for intricate scenes, while providing detailed intermediate representations for the subsequent generation stages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniScene outperforms previous SOTAs in the occupancy, video, and LiDAR generation, which also indeed benefits downstream driving tasks.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervision and contrastive learning have brought the performance of foundation models to unprecedented levels in a variety of tasks. Fueled by this progress, these models are becoming the prevailing approach for a wide array of real-world vision problems, including risk-sensitive and high-stakes applications. However, ensuring safe deployment in these scenarios requires a more comprehensive understanding of their uncertainty modeling capabilities, which has been barely explored. In this work, we delve into the behaviour of vision and vision-language foundation models under Conformal Prediction (CP), a statistical framework that provides theoretical guarantees of marginal coverage of the true class. Across extensive experiments including popular vision classification benchmarks, well-known foundation vision models, and three CP methods, our findings reveal that foundation models are well-suited for conformalization procedures, particularly those integrating Vision Transformers. We also show that calibrating the confidence predictions of these models, a popular strategy to improve their uncertainty quantification, actually leads to efficiency degradation of the conformal set on adaptive CP methods. Furthermore, few-shot adaptation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks, whose popularity is surging, enhances conformal scores compared to zero-shot predictions. Last, our empirical study exposes APS as particularly promising in the context of vision foundation models, as it does not violate the marginal coverage guarantees across multiple challenging, yet realistic scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen significant progress with diffusion models, enabling generation of photo-realistic images from text prompts. Despite this progress, existing methods still face challenges in following complex text prompts, especially those requiring compositional and multi-step reasoning. Given such complex instructions, SOTA models often make mistakes in faithfully modeling object attributes, and relationships among them. In this work, we present an alternate paradigm for T2I synthesis, decomposing the task of complex multi-step generation into three steps, (a) Generate: we first generate an image using existing diffusion models (b) Plan: we make use of Multi-Modal LLMs (MLLMs) to identify the mistakes in the generated image expressed in terms of individual objects and their properties, and produce a sequence of corrective steps required in the form of an edit-plan. (c) Edit: we make use of an existing text-guided image editing models to sequentially execute our edit-plan over the generated image to get the desired image which is faithful to the original instruction. Our approach derives its strength from the fact that it is modular in nature, is training free, and can be applied over any combination of image generation and editing models. As an added contribution, we also develop a model capable of compositional editing, which further helps improve the overall accuracy of our proposed approach. Our method flexibly trades inference time compute with performance on compositional text prompts. We perform extensive experimental evaluation across 3 benchmarks and 10 T2I models including DALLE-3 and the latest -- SD-3.5-Large. Our approach not only improves the performance of the SOTA models, by upto 3 points, it also reduces the performance gap between weaker and stronger models. $\href{https://dair-iitd.github.io/GraPE/}{https://dair-iitd.github.io/GraPE/}$</p>

<p>Abstract: Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a sustainable and essential approach for infrastructure maintenance, enabling the early detection of structural defects. Leveraging computer vision (CV) methods for automated infrastructure monitoring can significantly enhance monitoring efficiency and precision. However, these methods often face challenges in efficiency and accuracy, particularly in complex environments. Recent CNN-based and SAM-based approaches have demonstrated excellent performance in crack segmentation, but their high computational demands limit their applicability on edge devices. This paper introduces CrackESS, a novel system for detecting and segmenting concrete cracks. The approach first utilizes a YOLOv8 model for self-prompting and a LoRA-based fine-tuned SAM model for crack segmentation, followed by refining the segmentation masks through the proposed Crack Mask Refinement Module (CMRM). We conduct experiments on three datasets(Khanhha's dataset, Crack500, CrackCR) and validate CrackESS on a climbing robot system to demonstrate the advantage and effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Xing, Nhat Chung, Jie Zhang, Yue Cao, Ivor Tsang, Yang Liu, Lei Ma, Qing Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Physical adversarial attacks in driving scenarios can expose critical vulnerabilities in visual perception models. However, developing such attacks remains challenging due to diverse real-world environments and the requirement for maintaining visual naturality. Building upon this challenge, we reformulate physical adversarial attacks as a one-shot patch generation problem. Our approach generates adversarial patches through a deep generative model that considers the specific scene context, enabling direct physical deployment in matching environments. The primary challenge lies in simultaneously achieving two objectives: generating adversarial patches that effectively mislead object detection systems while determining contextually appropriate deployment within the scene. We propose MAGIC (Mastering Physical Adversarial Generation In Context), a novel framework powered by multi-modal LLM agents to address these challenges. MAGIC automatically understands scene context and generates adversarial patch through the synergistic interaction of language and vision capabilities. In particular, MAGIC orchestrates three specialized LLM agents: The adv-patch generation agent (GAgent) masters the creation of deceptive patches through strategic prompt engineering for text-to-image models. The adv-patch deployment agent (DAgent) ensures contextual coherence by determining optimal deployment strategies based on scene understanding. The self-examination agent (EAgent) completes this trilogy by providing critical oversight and iterative refinement of both processes. We validate our method on both digital and physical levels, i.e., nuImage and manually captured real-world scenes, where both statistical and visual results prove that our MAGIC is powerful and effective for attacking widely applied object detection systems, i.e., YOLO and DETR series.</p>

To address this challenge, we propose DMin (Diffusion Model influence), a scalable framework for estimating the influence of each training data sample on a given generated image. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first method capable of influence estimation for DMs with billions of parameters. Leveraging efficient gradient compression, DMin reduces storage requirements from hundreds of TBs to mere MBs or even KBs, and retrieves the top-k most influential training samples in under 1 second, all while maintaining performance. Our empirical results demonstrate DMin is both effective in identifying influential training samples and efficient in terms of computational and storage requirements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihan Cao, Jiazhao Zhang, Zhinan Yu, Shuzhen Liu, Zheng Qin, Qin Zou, Bo Du, Kai Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied AI, requiring an agent to locate a target object in previously unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhentao Tan, Ben Xue, Jian Jia, Junhao Wang, Wencai Ye, Shaoyun Shi, Mingjie Sun, Wenjin Wu, Quan Chen, Peng Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the \textbf{S}emantic-a\textbf{W}ar\textbf{E} spatial-t\textbf{E}mporal \textbf{T}okenizer (SweetTok), a novel video tokenizer to overcome the limitations in current video tokenization methods for compacted yet effective discretization. Unlike previous approaches that process flattened local visual patches via direct discretization or adaptive query tokenization, SweetTok proposes a decoupling framework, compressing visual inputs through distinct spatial and temporal queries via \textbf{D}ecoupled \textbf{Q}uery \textbf{A}uto\textbf{E}ncoder (DQAE). This design allows SweetTok to efficiently compress video token count while achieving superior fidelity by capturing essential information across spatial and temporal dimensions. Furthermore, we design a \textbf{M}otion-enhanced \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{C}odebook (MLC) tailored for spatial and temporal compression to address the differences in semantic representation between appearance and motion information. SweetTok significantly improves video reconstruction results by \textbf{42.8\%} w.r.t rFVD on UCF-101 dataset. With a better token compression strategy, it also boosts downstream video generation results by \textbf{15.1\%} w.r.t gFVD. Additionally, the compressed decoupled tokens are imbued with semantic information, enabling few-shot recognition capabilities powered by LLMs in downstream applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision Mamba has shown close to state of the art performance on computer vision tasks, drawing much interest in increasing it's efficiency. A promising approach is token reduction (that has been successfully implemented in ViTs). Pruning informative tokens in Mamba leads to a high loss of key knowledge and degraded performance. An alternative, of merging tokens preserves more information than pruning, also suffers for large compression ratios. Our key insight is that a quick round of retraining after token merging yeilds robust results across various compression ratios. Empirically, pruned Vims only drop up to 0.9% accuracy on ImageNet-1K, recovered by our proposed framework R-MeeTo in our main evaluation. We show how simple and effective the fast recovery can be achieved at minute-level, in particular, a 35.9% accuracy spike over 3 epochs of training on Vim-Ti. Moreover, Vim-Ti/S/B are re-trained within 5/7/17 minutes, and Vim-S only drops 1.3% with 1.2x (up to 1.5x) speed up in inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Sun, Benlei Cui, Xue-Mei Dong, Jingqun Tang, Yi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have emerged as promising newcomers in the field of generative models, shining brightly in image generation. However, when employed for object removal tasks, they still encounter issues such as generating random artifacts and the incapacity to repaint foreground object areas with appropriate content after removal. To tackle these problems, we propose Attentive Eraser, a tuning-free method to empower pre-trained diffusion models for stable and effective object removal. Firstly, in light of the observation that the self-attention maps influence the structure and shape details of the generated images, we propose Attention Activation and Suppression (ASS), which re-engineers the self-attention mechanism within the pre-trained diffusion models based on the given mask, thereby prioritizing the background over the foreground object during the reverse generation process. Moreover, we introduce Self-Attention Redirection Guidance (SARG), which utilizes the self-attention redirected by ASS to guide the generation process, effectively removing foreground objects within the mask while simultaneously generating content that is both plausible and coherent. Experiments demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of Attentive Eraser in object removal across a variety of pre-trained diffusion models, outperforming even training-based methods. Furthermore, Attentive Eraser can be implemented in various diffusion model architectures and checkpoints, enabling excellent scalability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danila Rukhovich, Elona Dupont, Dimitrios Mallis, Kseniya Cherenkova, Anis Kacem, Djamila Aouada</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models are typically constructed by sequentially drawing parametric sketches and applying CAD operations to obtain a 3D model. The problem of 3D CAD reverse engineering consists of reconstructing the sketch and CAD operation sequences from 3D representations such as point clouds. In this paper, we address this challenge through novel contributions across three levels: CAD sequence representation, network design, and training dataset. In particular, we represent CAD sketch-extrude sequences as Python code. The proposed CAD-Recode translates a point cloud into Python code that, when executed, reconstructs the CAD model. Taking advantage of the exposure of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to Python code, we leverage a relatively small LLM as a decoder for CAD-Recode and combine it with a lightweight point cloud projector. CAD-Recode is trained on a procedurally generated dataset of one million CAD sequences. CAD-Recode significantly outperforms existing methods across the DeepCAD, Fusion360 and real-world CC3D datasets. Furthermore, we show that our CAD Python code output is interpretable by off-the-shelf LLMs, enabling CAD editing and CAD-specific question answering from point clouds.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose AV-Link, a unified framework for Video-to-Audio (A2V) and Audio-to-Video (A2V) generation that leverages the activations of frozen video and audio diffusion models for temporally-aligned cross-modal conditioning. The key to our framework is a Fusion Block that facilitates bidirectional information exchange between video and audio diffusion models through temporally-aligned self attention operations. Unlike prior work that uses dedicated models for A2V and V2A tasks and relies on pretrained feature extractors, AV-Link achieves both tasks in a single self-contained framework, directly leveraging features obtained by the complementary modality (i.e. video features to generate audio, or audio features to generate video). Extensive automatic and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves a substantial improvement in audio-video synchronization, outperforming more expensive baselines such as the MovieGen video-to-audio model.</p>

<p>Abstract: A good co-speech motion generation cannot be achieved without a careful integration of common rhythmic motion and rare yet essential semantic motion. In this work, we propose SemTalk for holistic co-speech motion generation with frame-level semantic emphasis. Our key insight is to separately learn base motions and sparse motions, and then adaptively fuse them. In particular, coarse2fine cross-attention module and rhythmic consistency learning are explored to establish rhythm-related base motion, ensuring a coherent foundation that synchronizes gestures with the speech rhythm. Subsequently, semantic emphasis learning is designed to generate semantic-aware sparse motion, focusing on frame-level semantic cues. Finally, to integrate sparse motion into the base motion and generate semantic-emphasized co-speech gestures, we further leverage a learned semantic score for adaptive synthesis. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons on two public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art, delivering high-quality co-speech motion with enhanced semantic richness over a stable base motion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Wang, Qingyi Si, Jianlong Wu, Shiyu Zhu, Li Cao, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, existing VideoLLMs often inherit the limitations of their backbone LLMs in handling long sequences, leading to challenges for long video understanding. Common solutions either simply uniformly sample videos' frames or compress visual tokens, which focus primarily on low-level temporal visual redundancy, overlooking high-level knowledge redundancy. This limits the achievable compression rate with minimal loss. To this end. we introduce a training-free method, $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, containing two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly model and reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for long video understanding. Specifically, DPSelect identifies keyframes with local maximum peak distance based on their visual features, which are closely aligned with human video perception. PivotKV employs the obtained keyframes as pivots and conducts KV-Cache compression for the non-pivot tokens with low attention scores, which are derived from the learned prior knowledge of LLMs. Experiments on benchmarks VideoMME, MLVU, and LVBench, show that ReTaKe can support 4x longer video sequences with minimal performance loss (<1%) and outperform all similar-size VideoLLMs with 3%-5%, even surpassing or on par with much larger ones.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vriksha Srihari, R. Bhavya, Shruti Jayaraman, V. Mary Anita Rajam</p>
<p>Abstract: While generative models such as text-to-image, large language models and text-to-video have seen significant progress, the extension to text-to-virtual-reality remains largely unexplored, due to a deficit in training data and the complexity of achieving realistic depth and motion in virtual environments. This paper proposes an approach to coalesce existing generative systems to form a stereoscopic virtual reality video from text.
  Carried out in three main stages, we start with a base text-to-image model that captures context from an input text. We then employ Stable Diffusion on the rudimentary image produced, to generate frames with enhanced realism and overall quality. These frames are processed with depth estimation algorithms to create left-eye and right-eye views, which are stitched side-by-side to create an immersive viewing experience. Such systems would be highly beneficial in virtual reality production, since filming and scene building often require extensive hours of work and post-production effort.
  We utilize image evaluation techniques, specifically Fr\'echet Inception Distance and CLIP Score, to assess the visual quality of frames produced for the video. These quantitative measures establish the proficiency of the proposed method.
  Our work highlights the exciting possibilities of using natural language-driven graphics in fields like virtual reality simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangyang Qi, Zhixiong Zhang, Ye Fang, Jiaqi Wang, Hengshuang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant strides in image-text understanding tasks. However, their performance in 3D spatial comprehension, which is critical for embodied intelligence, remains limited. Recent advances have leveraged 3D point clouds and multi-view images as inputs, yielding promising results. However, we propose exploring a purely vision-based solution inspired by human perception, which merely relies on visual cues for 3D spatial understanding. This paper empirically investigates the limitations of VLMs in 3D spatial knowledge, revealing that their primary shortcoming lies in the lack of global-local correspondence between the scene and individual frames. To address this, we introduce GPT4Scene, a novel visual prompting paradigm in VLM training and inference that helps build the global-local relationship, significantly improving the 3D spatial understanding of indoor scenes. Specifically, GPT4Scene constructs a Bird's Eye View (BEV) image from the video and marks consistent object IDs across both frames and the BEV image. The model then inputs the concatenated BEV image and video frames with markers. In zero-shot evaluations, GPT4Scene improves performance over closed-source VLMs like GPT-4o. Additionally, we prepare a processed video dataset consisting of 165K text annotation to fine-tune open-source VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on all 3D understanding tasks. Surprisingly, after training with the GPT4Scene paradigm, VLMs consistently improve during inference, even without object marker prompting and BEV image as explicit correspondence. It demonstrates that the proposed paradigm helps VLMs develop an intrinsic ability to understand 3D scenes, which paves the way for a seamless approach to extending pre-trained VLMs for 3D scene understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuyang Liu, Ziming Wang, Yuhang Han, Yingyao Wang, Jiale Yuan, Jun Song, Bo Zheng, Linfeng Zhang, Siteng Huang, Honggang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel at visual understanding and reasoning, but face efficiency challenges due to quadratic complexity in processing long multimodal contexts. While token compression techniques can reduce computational costs, existing approaches are designed for single-view LVLMs and fail to consider the unique multi-view characteristics of recent high-resolution LVLMs with dynamic tiling. While existing methods treat all tokens uniformly, our analysis reveals that global thumbnails can naturally guide the compression of local crops by providing holistic context for informativeness evaluation. In this paper, we first analyze dynamic tiling strategy comprehensively, revealing both the complementary nature between thumbnails and crops, and the distinctive characteristics across different crops. Based on our observations, we propose "Global Compression Commander" (i.e., GlobalCom$^2$), a novel plug-and-play token compression framework for HR-LVLMs. GlobalCom$^2$ leverages thumbnail as the "commander" to guide the compression process of local crops, adaptively preserving informative details while eliminating redundancy. Extensive experiments show that GlobalCom$^2$ maintains over 90\% performance while compressing 90\% visual tokens, reducing FLOPs and peak memory to 9.1\% and 60\% respectively across multiple benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Wang, Qianyi Wu, Dan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of generalizable 3D-aware generation from monocular datasets, e.g., ImageNet. The key challenge of this task is learning a robust 3D-aware representation without multi-view or dynamic data, while ensuring consistent texture and geometry across different viewpoints. Although some baseline methods are capable of 3D-aware generation, the quality of the generated images still lags behind state-of-the-art 2D generation approaches, which excel in producing high-quality, detailed images. To address this severe limitation, we propose a novel feed-forward pipeline based on pixel-aligned Gaussian Splatting, coined as F3D-Gaus, which can produce more realistic and reliable 3D renderings from monocular inputs. In addition, we introduce a self-supervised cycle-aggregative constraint to enforce cross-view consistency in the learned 3D representation. This training strategy naturally allows aggregation of multiple aligned Gaussian primitives and significantly alleviates the interpolation limitations inherent in single-view pixel-aligned Gaussian Splatting. Furthermore, we incorporate video model priors to perform geometry-aware refinement, enhancing the generation of fine details in wide-viewpoint scenarios and improving the model's capability to capture intricate 3D textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves high-quality, multi-view consistent 3D-aware generation from monocular datasets, but also significantly improves training and inference efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inpainting algorithms have achieved remarkable progress in removing objects from images, yet still face two challenges: 1) struggle to handle the object's visual effects such as shadow and reflection; 2) easily generate shape-like artifacts and unintended content. In this paper, we propose Video4Removal, a large-scale dataset comprising over 100,000 high-quality samples with realistic object shadows and reflections. By constructing object-background pairs from video frames with off-the-shelf vision models, the labor costs of data acquisition can be significantly reduced. To avoid generating shape-like artifacts and unintended content, we propose Object-Background Guidance, an elaborated paradigm that takes both the foreground object and background images. It can guide the diffusion process to harness richer contextual information. Based on the above two designs, we present OmniEraser, a novel method that seamlessly removes objects and their visual effects using only object masks as input. Extensive experiments show that OmniEraser significantly outperforms previous methods, particularly in complex in-the-wild scenes. And it also exhibits a strong generalization ability in anime-style images. Datasets, models, and codes will be published.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) technology, as demonstrated by models such as Runway Gen-3, Pika, Sora, and Kling, have significantly broadened the applicability and popularity of the technology. This progress has created a growing demand for accurate quality assessment metrics to evaluate the perceptual quality of T2V-generated videos and optimize video generation models. However, assessing the quality of text-to-video outputs remain challenging due to the presence of highly complex distortions, such as unnatural actions and phenomena that defy human cognition. To address these challenges, we constructed T2VEval-Bench, a multi-dimensional benchmark dataset for text-to-video quality evaluation, which contains 148 textual prompts and 1,783 videos generated by 13 T2V models. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we scored each video on four dimensions in the subjective experiment, which are overall impression, text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Based on T2VEval-Bench, we developed T2VEval, a multi-branch fusion scheme for T2V quality evaluation. T2VEval assesses videos across three branches: text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Using an attention-based fusion module, T2VEval effectively integrates features from each branch and predicts scores with the aid of a large language model. Additionally, we implemented a divide-and-conquer training strategy, enabling each branch to learn targeted knowledge while maintaining synergy with the others. Experimental results demonstrate that T2VEval achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Virtual try-on has emerged as a pivotal task at the intersection of computer vision and fashion, aimed at digitally simulating how clothing items fit on the human body. Despite notable progress in single-image virtual try-on (VTO), current methodologies often struggle to preserve a consistent and authentic appearance of clothing across extended video sequences.

We leverage pre-existing video foundation models to introduce RealVVT, a photoRealistic Video Virtual Try-on framework tailored to bolster stability and realism within dynamic video contexts. Our methodology encompasses a Clothing & Temporal Consistency strategy, an Agnostic-guided Attention Focus Loss mechanism to ensure spatial consistency, and a Pose-guided Long Video VTO technique adept at handling extended video sequences.Extensive experiments across various datasets confirms that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both single-image and video VTO tasks, offering a viable solution for practical applications within the realms of fashion e-commerce and virtual fitting environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive problem-solving abilities across a wide range of tasks and domains. However, their capacity for face understanding has not been systematically studied. To address this gap, we introduce FaceXBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs on complex face understanding tasks. FaceXBench includes 5,000 multimodal multiple-choice questions derived from 25 public datasets and a newly created dataset, FaceXAPI. These questions cover 14 tasks across 6 broad categories, assessing MLLMs' face understanding abilities in bias and fairness, face authentication, recognition, analysis, localization and tool retrieval. Using FaceXBench, we conduct an extensive evaluation of 26 open-source MLLMs alongside 2 proprietary models, revealing the unique challenges in complex face understanding tasks. We analyze the models across three evaluation settings: zero-shot, in-context task description, and chain-of-thought prompting. Our detailed analysis reveals that current MLLMs, including advanced models like GPT-4o, and GeminiPro 1.5, show significant room for improvement. We believe FaceXBench will be a crucial resource for developing MLLMs equipped to perform sophisticated face understanding. Code: https://github.com/Kartik-3004/facexbench</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyang Wang, Xi Chen, Xiaogang Xu, Sihui Ji, Yu Liu, Yujun Shen, Hengshuang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: In spite of recent progress, image diffusion models still produce artifacts. A common solution is to leverage the feedback provided by quality assessment systems or human annotators to optimize the model, where images are generally rated in their entirety. In this work, we believe problem-solving starts with identification, yielding the request that the model should be aware of not just the presence of defects in an image, but their specific locations. Motivated by this, we propose DiffDoctor, a two-stage pipeline to assist image diffusion models in generating fewer artifacts. Concretely, the first stage targets developing a robust artifact detector, for which we collect a dataset of over 1M flawed synthesized images and set up an efficient human-in-the-loop annotation process, incorporating a carefully designed class-balance strategy. The learned artifact detector is then involved in the second stage to optimize the diffusion model by providing pixel-level feedback. Extensive experiments on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness of our artifact detector as well as the soundness of our diagnose-then-treat design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Nuno Wolf, Emre Kavak, Fabian Bongratz, Christian Wachinger</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of deep learning models in critical domains necessitates a balance between high accuracy and interpretability. We introduce SIC, an inherently interpretable neural network that provides local and global explanations of its decision-making process. Leveraging the concept of case-based reasoning, SIC extracts class-representative support vectors from training images, ensuring they capture relevant features while suppressing irrelevant ones. Classification decisions are made by calculating and aggregating similarity scores between these support vectors and the input's latent feature vector. We employ B-Cos transformations, which align model weights with inputs, to yield coherent pixel-level explanations in addition to global explanations of case-based reasoning. We evaluate SIC on three tasks: fine-grained classification on Stanford Dogs and FunnyBirds, multi-label classification on Pascal VOC, and pathology detection on the RSNA dataset. Results indicate that SIC not only achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art black-box and inherently interpretable models but also offers insightful explanations verified through practical evaluation on the FunnyBirds benchmark. Our theoretical analysis proves that these explanations fulfill established axioms for explanations. Our findings underscore SIC's potential for applications where understanding model decisions is as critical as the decisions themselves.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faegheh Sardari, Armin Mustafa, Philip J. B. Jackson, Adrian Hilton</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense action detection involves detecting multiple co-occurring actions while action classes are often ambiguous and represent overlapping concepts. We argue that handling the dual challenge of temporal and class overlaps is too complex to effectively be tackled by a single network. To address this, we propose to decompose the task of detecting dense ambiguous actions into detecting dense, unambiguous sub-concepts that form the action classes (i.e., action entities and action motions), and assigning these sub-tasks to distinct sub-networks. By isolating these unambiguous concepts, the sub-networks can focus exclusively on resolving a single challenge, dense temporal overlaps. Furthermore, simultaneous actions in a video often exhibit interrelationships, and exploiting these relationships can improve the method performance. However, current dense action detection networks fail to effectively learn these relationships due to their reliance on binary cross-entropy optimization, which treats each class independently. To address this limitation, we propose providing explicit supervision on co-occurring concepts during network optimization through a novel language-guided contrastive learning loss. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial improvements of 3.8% and 1.7% on average across all metrics on the challenging benchmark datasets, Charades and MultiTHUMOS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyu Wang, Tengyu Pan, Zhenyu Li, Ji Wu, Xiuxing Li, Jianyong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) visual decoding involves decoding the original image from brain signals elicited by visual stimuli. This often relies on manually labeled ROIs (Regions of Interest) to select brain voxels. However, these ROIs can contain redundant information and noise, reducing decoding performance. Additionally, the lack of automated ROI labeling methods hinders the practical application of fMRI visual decoding technology, especially for new subjects. This work presents TROI (Trainable Region of Interest), a novel two-stage, data-driven ROI labeling method for cross-subject fMRI decoding tasks, particularly when subject samples are limited. TROI leverages labeled ROIs in the dataset to pretrain an image decoding backbone on a cross-subject dataset, enabling efficient optimization of the input layer for new subjects without retraining the entire model from scratch. In the first stage, we introduce a voxel selection method that combines sparse mask training and low-pass filtering to quickly generate the voxel mask and determine input layer dimensions. In the second stage, we apply a learning rate rewinding strategy to fine-tune the input layer for downstream tasks. Experimental results on the same small sample dataset as the baseline method for brain visual retrieval and reconstruction tasks show that our voxel selection method surpasses the state-of-the-art method MindEye2 with an annotated ROI mask.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bojia Zi, Penghui Ruan, Marco Chen, Xianbiao Qi, Shaozhe Hao, Shihao Zhao, Youze Huang, Bin Liang, Rong Xiao, Kam-Fai Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have spurred the development of video editing techniques, which can be divided into inversion-based and end-to-end methods. However, current video editing methods still suffer from several challenges. Inversion-based methods, though training-free and flexible, are time-consuming during inference, struggle with fine-grained editing instructions, and produce artifacts and jitter. On the other hand, end-to-end methods, which rely on edited video pairs for training, offer faster inference speeds but often produce poor editing results due to a lack of high-quality training video pairs. In this paper, to close the gap in end-to-end methods, we introduce Se\~norita-2M, a high-quality video editing dataset. Se\~norita-2M consists of approximately 2 millions of video editing pairs. It is built by crafting four high-quality, specialized video editing models, each crafted and trained by our team to achieve state-of-the-art editing results. We also propose a filtering pipeline to eliminate poorly edited video pairs. Furthermore, we explore common video editing architectures to identify the most effective structure based on current pre-trained generative model. Extensive experiments show that our dataset can help to yield remarkably high-quality video editing results. More details are available at https://senorita.github.io.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-class cell segmentation in high-resolution gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) is crucial for various clinical applications. However, training such models typically requires labor-intensive, pixel-wise annotations by domain experts. Recent efforts have democratized this process by involving lay annotators without medical expertise. However, conventional non-corrective approaches struggle to handle annotation noise adaptively because they lack mechanisms to mitigate false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) at both the image-feature and pixel levels. In this paper, we propose a consensus-aware self-corrective AI agent that leverages the Consensus Matrix to guide its learning process. The Consensus Matrix defines regions where both the AI and annotators agree on cell and non-cell annotations, which are prioritized with stronger supervision. Conversely, areas of disagreement are adaptively weighted based on their feature similarity to high-confidence consensus regions, with more similar regions receiving greater attention. Additionally, contrastive learning is employed to separate features of noisy regions from those of reliable consensus regions by maximizing their dissimilarity. This paradigm enables the model to iteratively refine noisy labels, enhancing its robustness. Validated on one real-world lay-annotated cell dataset and two reasoning-guided simulated noisy datasets, our method demonstrates improved segmentation performance, effectively correcting FP and FN errors and showcasing its potential for training robust models on noisy datasets. The official implementation and cell annotations are publicly available at https://github.com/ddrrnn123/CASC-AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Guo, Xiuwei Xu, Ziwei Wang, Jianjiang Feng, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-level convolution architecture for 3D visual grounding. Conventional methods are difficult to meet the requirements of real-time inference due to the two-stage or point-based architecture. Inspired by the success of multi-level fully sparse convolutional architecture in 3D object detection, we aim to build a new 3D visual grounding framework following this technical route. However, as in 3D visual grounding task the 3D scene representation should be deeply interacted with text features, sparse convolution-based architecture is inefficient for this interaction due to the large amount of voxel features. To this end, we propose text-guided pruning (TGP) and completion-based addition (CBA) to deeply fuse 3D scene representation and text features in an efficient way by gradual region pruning and target completion. Specifically, TGP iteratively sparsifies the 3D scene representation and thus efficiently interacts the voxel features with text features by cross-attention. To mitigate the affect of pruning on delicate geometric information, CBA adaptively fixes the over-pruned region by voxel completion with negligible computational overhead. Compared with previous single-stage methods, our method achieves top inference speed and surpasses previous fastest method by 100\% FPS. Our method also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy even compared with two-stage methods, with $+1.13$ lead of Acc@0.5 on ScanRefer, and $+2.6$ and $+3.2$ leads on NR3D and SR3D respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shutong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation is an important task for autonomous driving. A powerful autonomous driving system should be capable of handling images under all conditions, including nighttime. Generating accurate and diverse nighttime semantic segmentation datasets is crucial for enhancing the performance of computer vision algorithms in low-light conditions. In this thesis, we introduce a novel approach named NPSim, which enables the simulation of realistic nighttime images from real daytime counterparts with monocular inverse rendering and ray tracing. NPSim comprises two key components: mesh reconstruction and relighting. The mesh reconstruction component generates an accurate representation of the scene structure by combining geometric information extracted from the input RGB image and semantic information from its corresponding semantic labels. The relighting component integrates real-world nighttime light sources and material characteristics to simulate the complex interplay of light and object surfaces under low-light conditions. The scope of this thesis mainly focuses on the implementation and evaluation of the mesh reconstruction component. Through experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the mesh reconstruction component in producing high-quality scene meshes and their generality across different autonomous driving datasets. We also propose a detailed experiment plan for evaluating the entire pipeline, including both quantitative metrics in training state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised semantic segmentation approaches and human perceptual studies, aiming to indicate the capability of our approach to generate realistic nighttime images and the value of our dataset in steering future progress in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timon Winter, Stanislav Frolov, Brian Bernhard Moser, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) have improved synthesis results, but challenges remain in layout control and generating omnidirectional panoramic images. Dense T2I (DT2I) and spherical T2I (ST2I) models address these issues, but so far no unified approach exists. Trivial approaches, like prompting a DT2I model to generate panoramas can not generate proper spherical distortions and seamless transitions at the borders. Our work shows that spherical dense text-to-image (SDT2I) can be achieved by integrating training-free DT2I approaches into finetuned panorama models. Specifically, we propose MultiStitchDiffusion (MSTD) and MultiPanFusion (MPF) by integrating MultiDiffusion into StitchDiffusion and PanFusion, respectively. Since no benchmark for SDT2I exists, we further construct Dense-Synthetic-View (DSynView), a new synthetic dataset containing spherical layouts to evaluate our models. Our results show that MSTD outperforms MPF across image quality as well as prompt- and layout adherence. MultiPanFusion generates more diverse images but struggles to synthesize flawless foreground objects. We propose bootstrap-coupling and turning off equirectangular perspective-projection attention in the foreground as an improvement of MPF.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Salimi, Tristan Aumentado-Armstrong, Marcus A. Brubaker, Konstantinos G. Derpanis</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we focus on 3D scene inpainting, where parts of an input image set, captured from different viewpoints, are masked out. The main challenge lies in generating plausible image completions that are geometrically consistent across views. Most recent work addresses this challenge by combining generative models with a 3D radiance field to fuse information across a relatively dense set of viewpoints. However, a major drawback of these methods is that they often produce blurry images due to the fusion of inconsistent cross-view images. To avoid blurry inpaintings, we eschew the use of an explicit or implicit radiance field altogether and instead fuse cross-view information in a learned space. In particular, we introduce a geometry-aware conditional generative model, capable of multi-view consistent inpainting using reference-based geometric and appearance cues. A key advantage of our approach over existing methods is its unique ability to inpaint masked scenes with a limited number of views (i.e., few-view inpainting), whereas previous methods require relatively large image sets for their 3D model fitting step. Empirically, we evaluate and compare our scene-centric inpainting method on two datasets, SPIn-NeRF and NeRFiller, which contain images captured at narrow and wide baselines, respectively, and achieve state-of-the-art 3D inpainting performance on both. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in the few-view setting compared to prior methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangyong Yu, Changyong Shu, Dawei Yang, Sifan Zhou, Zichen Yu, Xing Hu, Yan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection has emerged as an attractive solution for autonomous driving due to its low cost and broad applicability. However, despite the strong performance of PETR-based methods in 3D perception benchmarks, their direct INT8 quantization for onboard deployment leads to drastic accuracy drops-up to 58.2% in mAP and 36.9% in NDS on the NuScenes dataset. In this work, we propose Q-PETR, a quantization-aware position embedding transformation that re-engineers key components of the PETR framework to reconcile the discrepancy between the dynamic ranges of positional encodings and image features, and to adapt the cross-attention mechanism for low-bit inference. By redesigning the positional encoding module and introducing an adaptive quantization strategy, Q-PETR maintains floating-point performance with a performance degradation of less than 1% under standard 8-bit per-tensor post-training quantization. Moreover, compared to its FP32 counterpart, Q-PETR achieves a two-fold speedup and reduces memory usage by three times, thereby offering a deployment-friendly solution for resource-constrained onboard devices. Extensive experiments across various PETR-series models validate the strong generalization and practical benefits of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Rudman, Michal Golovanesky, Amir Bar, Vedant Palit, Yann LeCun, Carsten Eickhoff, Ritambhara Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite strong performance on vision-language tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with mathematical problem-solving, with both open-source and state-of-the-art models falling short of human performance on visual-math benchmarks. To systematically examine visual-mathematical reasoning in MLLMs, we (1) evaluate their understanding of geometric primitives, (2) test multi-step reasoning, and (3) explore a potential solution to improve visual reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental shortcomings in shape recognition, with top models achieving under 50% accuracy in identifying regular polygons. We analyze these failures through the lens of dual-process theory and show that MLLMs rely on System 1 (intuitive, memorized associations) rather than System 2 (deliberate reasoning). Consequently, MLLMs fail to count the sides of both familiar and novel shapes, suggesting they have neither learned the concept of sides nor effectively process visual inputs. Finally, we propose Visually Cued Chain-of-Thought (VC-CoT) prompting, which enhances multi-step mathematical reasoning by explicitly referencing visual annotations in diagrams, boosting GPT-4o's accuracy on an irregular polygon side-counting task from 7% to 93%. Our findings suggest that System 2 reasoning in MLLMs remains an open problem, and visually-guided prompting is essential for successfully engaging visual reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Yuan, Guiwei Zhang, Changxiao Ma, Tianyi Zhang, Guanglin Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) aims to extract accurate identity representation features. However, during feature extraction, individual samples are inevitably affected by noise (background, occlusions, and model limitations). Considering that features from the same identity follow a normal distribution around identity centers after training, we propose a Training-Free Feature Centralization ReID framework (Pose2ID) by aggregating the same identity features to reduce individual noise and enhance the stability of identity representation, which preserves the feature's original distribution for following strategies such as re-ranking. Specifically, to obtain samples of the same identity, we introduce two components: Identity-Guided Pedestrian Generation: by leveraging identity features to guide the generation process, we obtain high-quality images with diverse poses, ensuring identity consistency even in complex scenarios such as infrared, and occlusion. Neighbor Feature Centralization: it explores each sample's potential positive samples from its neighborhood. Experiments demonstrate that our generative model exhibits strong generalization capabilities and maintains high identity consistency. With the Feature Centralization framework, we achieve impressive performance even with an ImageNet pre-trained model without ReID training, reaching mAP/Rank-1 of 52.81/78.92 on Market1501. Moreover, our method sets new state-of-the-art results across standard, cross-modality, and occluded ReID tasks, showcasing strong adaptability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guotao Liang, Baoquan Zhang, Zhiyuan Wen, Junteng Zhao, Yunming Ye, Kola Ye, Yao He</p>
<p>Abstract: Image quantization is a crucial technique in image generation, aimed at learning a codebook that encodes an image into a discrete token sequence. Recent advancements have seen researchers exploring learning multi-modal codebook (i.e., text-aligned codebook) by utilizing image caption semantics, aiming to enhance codebook performance in cross-modal tasks. However, existing image-text paired datasets exhibit a notable flaw in that the text descriptions tend to be overly concise, failing to adequately describe the images and provide sufficient semantic knowledge, resulting in limited alignment of text and codebook at a fine-grained level. In this paper, we propose a novel Text-Augmented Codebook Learning framework, named TA-VQ, which generates longer text for each image using the visual-language model for improved text-aligned codebook learning. However, the long text presents two key challenges: how to encode text and how to align codebook and text. To tackle two challenges, we propose to split the long text into multiple granularities for encoding, i.e., word, phrase, and sentence, so that the long text can be fully encoded without losing any key semantic knowledge. Following this, a hierarchical encoder and novel sampling-based alignment strategy are designed to achieve fine-grained codebook-text alignment. Additionally, our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing VQ models. Extensive experiments in reconstruction and various downstream tasks demonstrate its effectiveness compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianzhong You, Yuan Gao, Sangwook Kim, Chris Mcintosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is a key imaging modality for diagnosis, yet its clinical utility is marred by high radiation exposure and long turnaround times, restricting its use for larger-scale screening. Although chest radiography (CXR) is more accessible and safer, existing CXR foundation models focus primarily on detecting diseases that are readily visible on the CXR. Recently, works have explored training disease classification models on simulated CXRs, but they remain limited to recognizing a single disease type from CT. CT foundation models have also emerged with significantly improved detection of pathologies in CT. However, the generalized application of CT-derived labels on CXR has remained illusive. In this study, we propose X2CT-CLIP, a tri-modal knowledge transfer learning framework that bridges the modality gap between CT and CXR while reducing the computational burden of model training. Our approach is the first work to enable multi-abnormality classification in CT, using CXR, by transferring knowledge from 3D CT volumes and associated radiology reports to a CXR encoder via a carefully designed tri-modal alignment mechanism in latent space. Extensive evaluations on three multi-label CT datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cross-modal retrieval, few-shot adaptation, and external validation. These results highlight the potential of CXR, enriched with knowledge derived from CT, as a viable efficient alternative for disease detection in resource-limited settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thilo Reinold, Suman Ghosh, Guillermo Gallego</p>
<p>Abstract: Robot manipulation is a common task in fields like industrial manufacturing. Detecting when objects slip from a robot's grasp is crucial for safe and reliable operation. Event cameras, which register pixel-level brightness changes at high temporal resolution (called ``events''), offer an elegant feature when mounted on a robot's end effector: since they only detect motion relative to their viewpoint, a properly grasped object produces no events, while a slipping object immediately triggers them. To research this feature, representative datasets are essential, both for analytic approaches and for training machine learning models. The majority of current research on slip detection with event-based data is done on real-world scenarios and manual data collection, as well as additional setups for data labeling. This can result in a significant increase in the time required for data collection, a lack of flexibility in scene setups, and a high level of complexity in the repetition of experiments. This paper presents a simulation pipeline for generating slip data using the described camera-gripper configuration in a robot arm, and demonstrates its effectiveness through initial data-driven experiments. The use of a simulator, once it is set up, has the potential to reduce the time spent on data collection, provide the ability to alter the setup at any time, simplify the process of repetition and the generation of arbitrarily large data sets. Two distinct datasets were created and validated through visual inspection and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Visual inspection confirmed photorealistic frame generation and accurate slip modeling, while three ANNs trained on this data achieved high validation accuracy and demonstrated good generalization capabilities on a separate test set, along with initial applicability to real-world data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Bian, Zhaoyang Zhang, Xuan Ju, Mingdeng Cao, Liangbin Xie, Ying Shan, Qiang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Video inpainting, which aims to restore corrupted video content, has experienced substantial progress. Despite these advances, existing methods, whether propagating unmasked region pixels through optical flow and receptive field priors, or extending image-inpainting models temporally, face challenges in generating fully masked objects or balancing the competing objectives of background context preservation and foreground generation in one model, respectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-stream paradigm VideoPainter that incorporates an efficient context encoder (comprising only 6% of the backbone parameters) to process masked videos and inject backbone-aware background contextual cues to any pre-trained video DiT, producing semantically consistent content in a plug-and-play manner. This architectural separation significantly reduces the model's learning complexity while enabling nuanced integration of crucial background context. We also introduce a novel target region ID resampling technique that enables any-length video inpainting, greatly enhancing our practical applicability. Additionally, we establish a scalable dataset pipeline leveraging current vision understanding models, contributing VPData and VPBench to facilitate segmentation-based inpainting training and assessment, the largest video inpainting dataset and benchmark to date with over 390K diverse clips. Using inpainting as a pipeline basis, we also explore downstream applications including video editing and video editing pair data generation, demonstrating competitive performance and significant practical potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate VideoPainter's superior performance in both any-length video inpainting and editing, across eight key metrics, including video quality, mask region preservation, and textual coherence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong He, Hongshan Yu, Mingtao Feng, Tongjia Chen, Zechuan Li, Anwaar Ulhaq, Saeed Anwar, Ajmal Saeed Mian</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models are traditionally used to generate colors at fixed pixel positions in 2D images. Building on this, we extend diffusion models to point cloud semantic segmentation, where point positions also remain fixed, and the diffusion model generates point labels instead of colors. To accelerate the denoising process in reverse diffusion, we introduce a noisy label embedding mechanism. This approach integrates semantic information into the noisy label, providing an initial semantic reference that improves the reverse diffusion efficiency. Additionally, we propose a point frequency transformer that enhances the adjustment of high-level context in point clouds. To reduce computational complexity, we introduce the position condition into MLP and propose denoising PointNet to process the high-resolution point cloud without sacrificing geometric details. Finally, we integrate the proposed noisy label embedding, point frequency transformer and denoising PointNet in our proposed dual conditional diffusion model-based network (PointDiffuse) to perform large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of PointDiffuse, achieving the state-of-the-art mIoU of 74.2\% on S3DIS Area 5, 81.2\% on S3DIS 6-fold and 64.8\% on SWAN dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tieqiao Wang, Sinisa Todorovic</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing approaches to action segmentation use pre-computed frame features extracted by methods which have been trained on tasks that are different from action segmentation. Also, recent approaches typically use deep framewise representations that lack explicit modeling of action segments. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the first end-to-end solution to action segmentation -- End-to-End Action Segmentation Transformer (EAST). Our key contributions include: (1) a simple and efficient adapter design for effective backbone fine-tuning; (2) a segmentation-by-detection framework for leveraging action proposals initially predicted over a coarsely downsampled video toward labeling of all frames; and (3) a new action-proposal based data augmentation for robust training. EAST achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, including GTEA, 50Salads, Breakfast, and Assembly-101. The model and corresponding code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quanjian Song, Zhihang Lin, Zhanpeng Zeng, Ziyue Zhang, Liujuan Cao, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing camera motion-controlled video generation methods face computational bottlenecks in fine-tuning and inference. This paper proposes LightMotion, a light and tuning-free method for simulating camera motion in video generation. Operating in the latent space, it eliminates additional fine-tuning, inpainting, and depth estimation, making it more streamlined than existing methods. The endeavors of this paper comprise: (i) The latent space permutation operation effectively simulates various camera motions like panning, zooming, and rotation. (ii) The latent space resampling strategy combines background-aware sampling and cross-frame alignment to accurately fill new perspectives while maintaining coherence across frames. (iii) Our in-depth analysis shows that the permutation and resampling cause an SNR shift in latent space, leading to poor-quality generation. To address this, we propose latent space correction, which reintroduces noise during denoising to mitigate SNR shift and enhance video generation quality. Exhaustive experiments show that our LightMotion outperforms existing methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Huang, Bohan Jia, Zijie Zhai, Shaosheng Cao, Zheyu Ye, Fei Zhao, Zhe Xu, Yao Hu, Shaohui Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: DeepSeek-R1-Zero has successfully demonstrated the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs purely through Reinforcement Learning (RL). Inspired by this breakthrough, we explore how RL can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capability of MLLMs. However, direct training with RL struggles to activate complex reasoning capabilities such as questioning and reflection in MLLMs, due to the absence of substantial high-quality multimodal reasoning data. To address this issue, we propose the reasoning MLLM, Vision-R1, to improve multimodal reasoning capability. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality multimodal CoT dataset without human annotations by leveraging an existing MLLM and DeepSeek-R1 through modality bridging and data filtering to obtain a 200K multimodal CoT dataset, Vision-R1-cold dataset. It serves as cold-start initialization data for Vision-R1. To mitigate the optimization challenges caused by overthinking after cold start, we propose Progressive Thinking Suppression Training (PTST) strategy and employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with the hard formatting result reward function to gradually refine the model's ability to learn correct and complex reasoning processes on a 10K multimodal math dataset. Comprehensive experiments show our model achieves an average improvement of $\sim$6% across various multimodal math reasoning benchmarks. Vision-R1-7B achieves a 73.5% accuracy on the widely used MathVista benchmark, which is only 0.4% lower than the leading reasoning model, OpenAI O1.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizheng Sun, Hao Li, Chang Xu, Chenghua Lin, Riza Batista-Navarro, Jingyuan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have excelled in visual reasoning but often incur high computational costs. One key reason is the redundancy of visual tokens. Although recent token reduction methods claim to achieve minimal performance loss, our extensive experiments reveal that token reduction can substantially alter a model's output distribution, leading to changes in prediction patterns that standard metrics such as accuracy loss do not fully capture. Such inconsistencies are especially concerning for practical applications where system stability is critical. To investigate this phenomenon, we analyze how token reduction influences the energy distribution of a VLM's internal representations using a lower-rank approximation via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Our results show that changes in the Inverse Participation Ratio of the singular value spectrum are strongly correlated with the model's consistency after token reduction. Based on these insights, we propose LoFi--a training-free visual token reduction method that utilizes the leverage score from SVD for token pruning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that LoFi not only reduces computational costs with minimal performance degradation but also significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of output consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ta Duc Huy, Sen Kim Tran, Phan Nguyen, Nguyen Hoang Tran, Tran Bao Sam, Anton van den Hengel, Zhibin Liao, Johan W. Verjans, Minh-Son To, Vu Minh Hieu Phan</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to interpret and intervene model decisions is important for the adoption of computer-aided diagnosis methods in clinical workflows. Recent concept-based methods link the model predictions with interpretable concepts and modify their activation scores to interact with the model. However, these concepts are at the image level, which hinders the model from pinpointing the exact patches the concepts are activated. Alternatively, prototype-based methods learn representations from training image patches and compare these with test image patches, using the similarity scores for final class prediction. However, interpreting the underlying concepts of these patches can be challenging and often necessitates post-hoc guesswork. To address this issue, this paper introduces the novel Concept-based Similarity Reasoning network (CSR), which offers (i) patch-level prototype with intrinsic concept interpretation, and (ii) spatial interactivity. First, the proposed CSR provides localized explanation by grounding prototypes of each concept on image regions. Second, our model introduces novel spatial-level interaction, allowing doctors to engage directly with specific image areas, making it an intuitive and transparent tool for medical imaging. CSR improves upon prior state-of-the-art interpretable methods by up to 4.5\% across three biomedical datasets. Our code is released at https://github.com/tadeephuy/InteractCSR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanghao Li, Mingzhi Chen, Hao Yu, Shuting Dong, Wenhao Jiang, Ming Tang, Chun Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based denoising models have been widely employed in vision tasks, functioning as filters to eliminate noise while retaining crucial semantic information. Additionally, they play a vital role in defending against adversarial perturbations that threaten downstream tasks. However, these models can be intrinsically susceptible to adversarial attacks due to their dependence on specific noise assumptions. Existing attacks on denoising models mainly aim at deteriorating visual clarity while neglecting semantic manipulation, rendering them either easily detectable or limited in effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Mutual Information-Guided Attack (MIGA), the first method designed to directly attack deep denoising models by strategically disrupting their ability to preserve semantic content via adversarial perturbations. By minimizing the mutual information between the original and denoised images, a measure of semantic similarity. MIGA forces the denoiser to produce perceptually clean yet semantically altered outputs. While these images appear visually plausible, they encode systematically distorted semantics, revealing a fundamental vulnerability in denoising models. These distortions persist in denoised outputs and can be quantitatively assessed through downstream task performance. We propose new evaluation metrics and systematically assess MIGA on four denoising models across five datasets, demonstrating its consistent effectiveness in disrupting semantic fidelity. Our findings suggest that denoising models are not always robust and can introduce security risks in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyu Zhou, Haonan Wang, Haoyue Liu, Yuxing Duan, Yi Chang, Luxin Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: High-dynamic scene optical flow is a challenging task, which suffers spatial blur and temporal discontinuous motion due to large displacement in frame imaging, thus deteriorating the spatiotemporal feature of optical flow. Typically, existing methods mainly introduce event camera to directly fuse the spatiotemporal features between the two modalities. However, this direct fusion is ineffective, since there exists a large gap due to the heterogeneous data representation between frame and event modalities. To address this issue, we explore a common-latent space as an intermediate bridge to mitigate the modality gap. In this work, we propose a novel common spatiotemporal fusion between frame and event modalities for high-dynamic scene optical flow, including visual boundary localization and motion correlation fusion. Specifically, in visual boundary localization, we figure out that frame and event share the similar spatiotemporal gradients, whose similarity distribution is consistent with the extracted boundary distribution. This motivates us to design the common spatiotemporal gradient to constrain the reference boundary localization. In motion correlation fusion, we discover that the frame-based motion possesses spatially dense but temporally discontinuous correlation, while the event-based motion has spatially sparse but temporally continuous correlation. This inspires us to use the reference boundary to guide the complementary motion knowledge fusion between the two modalities. Moreover, common spatiotemporal fusion can not only relieve the cross-modal feature discrepancy, but also make the fusion process interpretable for dense and continuous optical flow. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the superiority of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Due to the data-driven nature of current face identity (FaceID) customization methods, all state-of-the-art models rely on large-scale datasets containing millions of high-quality text-image pairs for training. However, none of these datasets are publicly available, which restricts transparency and hinders further advancements in the field.
  To address this issue, in this paper, we collect and release FaceID-6M, the first large-scale, open-source FaceID dataset containing 6 million high-quality text-image pairs. Filtered from LAION-5B \cite{schuhmann2022laion}, FaceID-6M undergoes a rigorous image and text filtering steps to ensure dataset quality, including resolution filtering to maintain high-quality images and faces, face filtering to remove images that lack human faces, and keyword-based strategy to retain descriptions containing human-related terms (e.g., nationality, professions and names). Through these cleaning processes, FaceID-6M provides a high-quality dataset optimized for training powerful FaceID customization models, facilitating advancements in the field by offering an open resource for research and development.
  We conduct extensive experiments to show the effectiveness of our FaceID-6M, demonstrating that models trained on our FaceID-6M dataset achieve performance that is comparable to, and slightly better than currently available industrial models. Additionally, to support and advance research in the FaceID customization community, we make our code, datasets, and models fully publicly available.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenglu Pan, Xiaogang Xu, Ganggui Ding, Yunke Zhang, Wenbo Li, Jiarong Xu, Qingbiao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Restoring low-resolution text images presents a significant challenge, as it requires maintaining both the fidelity and stylistic realism of the text in restored images. Existing text image restoration methods often fall short in hard situations, as the traditional super-resolution models cannot guarantee clarity, while diffusion-based methods fail to maintain fidelity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework aimed at improving the generalization ability of diffusion models for text image super-resolution (SR), especially promoting fidelity. First, we propose a progressive data sampling strategy that incorporates diverse image types at different stages of training, stabilizing the convergence and improving the generalization. For the network architecture, we leverage a pre-trained SR prior to provide robust spatial reasoning capabilities, enhancing the model's ability to preserve textual information. Additionally, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to better integrate textual priors. To further reduce errors in textual priors, we utilize confidence scores to dynamically adjust the importance of textual features during training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only produces text images with more realistic visual appearances but also improves the accuracy of text structure.</p>

<p>Abstract: While existing anomaly synthesis methods have made remarkable progress, achieving both realism and diversity in synthesis remains a major obstacle. To address this, we propose AnomalyPainter, a zero-shot framework that breaks the diversity-realism trade-off dilemma through synergizing Vision Language Large Model (VLLM), Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), and our newly introduced texture library Tex-9K. Tex-9K is a professional texture library containing 75 categories and 8,792 texture assets crafted for diverse anomaly synthesis. Leveraging VLLM's general knowledge, reasonable anomaly text descriptions are generated for each industrial object and matched with relevant diverse textures from Tex-9K. These textures then guide the LDM via ControlNet to paint on normal images. Furthermore, we introduce Texture-Aware Latent Init to stabilize the natural-image-trained ControlNet for industrial images. Extensive experiments show that AnomalyPainter outperforms existing methods in realism, diversity, and generalization, achieving superior downstream performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Keypoints are what enable Structure-from-Motion (SfM) systems to scale to thousands of images. However, designing a keypoint detection objective is a non-trivial task, as SfM is non-differentiable. Typically, an auxiliary objective involving a descriptor is optimized. This however induces a dependency on the descriptor, which is undesirable. In this paper we propose a fully self-supervised and descriptor-free objective for keypoint detection, through reinforcement learning. To ensure training does not degenerate, we leverage a balanced top-K sampling strategy. While this already produces competitive models, we find that two qualitatively different types of detectors emerge, which are only able to detect light and dark keypoints respectively. To remedy this, we train a third detector, DaD, that optimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the pointwise maximum of both light and dark detectors. Our approach significantly improve upon SotA across a range of benchmarks. Code and model weights are publicly available at https://github.com/parskatt/dad</p>

<p>Abstract: Human pose estimation is a critical task in computer vision and sports biomechanics, with applications spanning sports science, rehabilitation, and biomechanical research. While significant progress has been made in monocular 3D pose estimation, current datasets often fail to capture the complex, high-acceleration movements typical of competitive sports. In this work, we introduce AthletePose3D, a novel dataset designed to address this gap. AthletePose3D includes 12 types of sports motions across various disciplines, with approximately 1.3 million frames and 165 thousand individual postures, specifically capturing high-speed, high-acceleration athletic movements. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular 2D and 3D pose estimation models on the dataset, revealing that models trained on conventional datasets perform poorly on athletic motions. However, fine-tuning these models on AthletePose3D notably reduces the SOTA model mean per joint position error (MPJPE) from 214mm to 65mm-a reduction of over 69%. We also validate the kinematic accuracy of monocular pose estimations through waveform analysis, highlighting strong correlations in joint angle estimations but limitations in velocity estimation. Our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of monocular pose estimation models in the context of sports, contributing valuable insights for advancing monocular pose estimation techniques in high-performance sports environments.

<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has demonstrated powerful capability and scalability in generating high-quality images and videos. Further pursuing the unification of generation and editing tasks has yielded significant progress in the domain of image content creation. However, due to the intrinsic demands for consistency across both temporal and spatial dynamics, achieving a unified approach for video synthesis remains challenging. We introduce VACE, which enables users to perform Video tasks within an All-in-one framework for Creation and Editing. These tasks include reference-to-video generation, video-to-video editing, and masked video-to-video editing. Specifically, we effectively integrate the requirements of various tasks by organizing video task inputs, such as editing, reference, and masking, into a unified interface referred to as the Video Condition Unit (VCU). Furthermore, by utilizing a Context Adapter structure, we inject different task concepts into the model using formalized representations of temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing it to handle arbitrary video synthesis tasks flexibly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the unified model of VACE achieves performance on par with task-specific models across various subtasks. Simultaneously, it enables diverse applications through versatile task combinations. Project page: https://ali-vilab.github.io/VACE-Page/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuwei Sun, Hideya Ochiai, Zhirong Wu, Stephen Lin, Ryota Kanai</p>
<p>Abstract: Emerging from the pairwise attention in conventional Transformers, there is a growing interest in sparse attention mechanisms that align more closely with localized, contextual learning in the biological brain. Existing studies such as the Coordination method employ iterative cross-attention mechanisms with a bottleneck to enable the sparse association of inputs. However, these methods are parameter inefficient and fail in more complex relational reasoning tasks. To this end, we propose Associative Transformer (AiT) to enhance the association among sparsely attended input tokens, improving parameter efficiency and performance in various vision tasks such as classification and relational reasoning. AiT leverages a learnable explicit memory comprising specialized priors that guide bottleneck attentions to facilitate the extraction of diverse localized tokens. Moreover, AiT employs an associative memory-based token reconstruction using a Hopfield energy function. The extensive empirical experiments demonstrate that AiT requires significantly fewer parameters and attention layers outperforming a broad range of sparse Transformer models. Additionally, AiT outperforms the SOTA sparse Transformer models including the Coordination method on the Sort-of-CLEVR dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeke Zexi Hu, Xiaoming Chen, Vera Yuk Ying Chung, Yiran Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: The effective extraction of spatial-angular features plays a crucial role in light field image super-resolution (LFSR) tasks, and the introduction of convolution and Transformers leads to significant improvement in this area. Nevertheless, due to the large 4D data volume of light field images, many existing methods opted to decompose the data into a number of lower-dimensional subspaces and perform Transformers in each sub-space individually. As a side effect, these methods inadvertently restrict the self-attention mechanisms to a One-to-One scheme accessing only a limited subset of LF data, explicitly preventing comprehensive optimization on all spatial and angular cues. In this paper, we identify this limitation as subspace isolation and introduce a novel Many-to-Many Transformer (M2MT) to address it. M2MT aggregates angular information in the spatial subspace before performing the self-attention mechanism. It enables complete access to all information across all sub-aperture images (SAIs) in a light field image. Consequently, M2MT is enabled to comprehensively capture long-range correlation dependencies. With M2MT as the pivotal component, we develop a simple yet effective M2MT network for LFSR. Our experimental results demonstrate that M2MT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various public datasets. We further conduct in-depth analysis using local attribution maps (LAM) to obtain visual interpretability, and the results validate that M2MT is empowered with a truly non-local context in both spatial and angular subspaces to mitigate subspace isolation and acquire effective spatial-angular representation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoye Lu, Spencer Szabados, Yaoliang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have become the leading approach for distribution learning. This paper focuses on structure-preserving diffusion models (SPDM), a specific subset of diffusion processes tailored for distributions with inherent structures, such as group symmetries. We complement existing sufficient conditions for constructing SPDMs by proving complementary necessary ones. Additionally, we propose a new framework that considers the geometric structures affecting the diffusion process. Leveraging this framework, we design a structure-preserving bridge model that maintains alignment between the model's endpoint couplings. Empirical evaluations on equivariant diffusion models demonstrate their effectiveness in learning symmetric distributions and modeling transitions between them. Experiments on real-world medical images confirm that our models preserve equivariance while maintaining high sample quality. We also showcase the practical utility of our framework by implementing an equivariant denoising diffusion bridge model, which achieves reliable equivariant image noise reduction and style transfer, irrespective of prior knowledge of image orientation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vishnu Sashank Dorbala, Bhrij Patel, Amrit Singh Bedi, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied Navigation tasks often involve constructing topological graphs of a scene during exploration to facilitate high-level planning and decision-making for execution in continuous environments. Prior literature makes the assumption of static graphs with stationary targets, which does not hold in many real-world environments with moving objects. To address this, we present a novel formulation generalizing navigation to dynamic environments by introducing structured object transitions to dynamize static topological graphs called Object Transition Graphs (OTGs). OTGs simulate portable targets following structured routes inspired by human habits. We apply this technique to Matterport3D (MP3D), a popular simulator for evaluating embodied tasks. On these dynamized OTGs, we establish a navigation benchmark by evaluating Oracle-based, Reinforcement Learning, and Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches on a multi-object finding task. Further, we quantify agent adaptability, and make key inferences such as agents employing learned decision-making strategies generalize better than those relying on privileged oracle knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to introduce structured temporal dynamism on topological graphs for studying generalist embodied navigation policies. The code and dataset for our OTGs will be made publicly available to foster research on embodied navigation in dynamic scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michal Nazarczuk, Jan Kristof Behrens, Karla Stepanova, Matej Hoffmann, Krystian Mikolajczyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied reasoning systems integrate robotic hardware and cognitive processes to perform complex tasks, typically in response to a natural language query about a specific physical environment. This usually involves changing the belief about the scene or physically interacting and changing the scene (e.g. sort the objects from lightest to heaviest). In order to facilitate the development of such systems we introduce a new modular Closed Loop Interactive Embodied Reasoning (CLIER) approach that takes into account the measurements of non-visual object properties, changes in the scene caused by external disturbances as well as uncertain outcomes of robotic actions. CLIER performs multi-modal reasoning and action planning and generates a sequence of primitive actions that can be executed by a robot manipulator. Our method operates in a closed loop, responding to changes in the environment. Our approach is developed with the use of MuBle simulation environment and tested in 10 interactive benchmark scenarios. We extensively evaluate our reasoning approach in simulation and in real-world manipulation tasks with a success rate above 76% and 64%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manjie Xu, Chenxing Li, Xinyi Tu, Yong Ren, Rilin Chen, Yu Gu, Wei Liang, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating semantically and temporally aligned audio content in accordance with video input has become a focal point for researchers, particularly following the remarkable breakthrough in text-to-video generation. In this work, we aim to offer insights into the video-to-audio generation paradigm, focusing on three crucial aspects: vision encoders, auxiliary embeddings, and data augmentation techniques. Beginning with a foundational model built on a simple yet surprisingly effective intuition, we explore various vision encoders and auxiliary embeddings through ablation studies. Employing a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that emphasizes generation quality and video-audio synchronization alignment, we demonstrate that our model exhibits state-of-the-art video-to-audio generation capabilities. Furthermore, we provide critical insights into the impact of different data augmentation methods on enhancing the generation framework's overall capacity. We showcase possibilities to advance the challenge of generating synchronized audio from semantic and temporal perspectives. We hope these insights will serve as a stepping stone toward developing more realistic and accurate audio-visual generation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saige Rutherford, Thomas Wolfers, Charlotte Fraza, Nathaniel G. Harnett, Christian F. Beckmann, Henricus G. Ruhe, Andre F. Marquand</p>
<p>Abstract: Reference classes in healthcare establish healthy norms, such as pediatric growth charts of height and weight, and are used to chart deviations from these norms which represent potential clinical risk. How the demographics of the reference class influence clinical interpretation of deviations is unknown. Using normative modeling, a method for building reference classes, we evaluate the fairness (racial bias) in reference models of structural brain images that are widely used in psychiatry and neurology. We test whether including race in the model creates fairer models. We predict self-reported race using the deviation scores from three different reference class normative models, to better understand bias in an integrated, multivariate sense. Across all of these tasks, we uncover racial disparities that are not easily addressed with existing data or commonly used modeling techniques. Our work suggests that deviations from the norm could be due to demographic mismatch with the reference class, and assigning clinical meaning to these deviations should be done with caution. Our approach also suggests that acquiring more representative samples is an urgent research priority.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinqi Su, Zitong Yu, Yawen Cui, Ajian Liu, Xun Lin, Yuhao Wang, Haochen Liang, Wenhui Li, Li Shen, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: In current web environment, fake news spreads rapidly across online social networks, posing serious threats to society. Existing multimodal fake news detection methods can generally be classified into knowledge-based and semantic-based approaches. However, these methods are heavily rely on human expertise and feedback, lacking flexibility. To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Analysis and Adaptive Discriminator (DAAD) approach for fake news detection. For knowledge-based methods, we introduce the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to leverage the self-reflective capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for prompt optimization, providing richer, domain-specific details and guidance to the LLMs, while enabling more flexible integration of LLM comment on news content. For semantic-based methods, we define four typical deceit patterns: emotional exaggeration, logical inconsistency, image manipulation, and semantic inconsistency, to reveal the mechanisms behind fake news creation. To detect these patterns, we carefully design four discriminators and expand them in depth and breadth, using the soft-routing mechanism to explore optimal detection models. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. The code will be available at: https://github.com/SuXinqi/DAAD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaron Young, Nevindu M. Batagoda, Harry Zhang, Akshat Dave, Adithya Pediredla, Dan Negrut, Ramesh Raskar</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust autonomous navigation in environments with limited visibility remains a critical challenge in robotics. We present a novel approach that leverages Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) sensing using single-photon LiDAR to improve visibility and enhance autonomous navigation. Our method enables mobile robots to "see around corners" by utilizing multi-bounce light information, effectively expanding their perceptual range without additional infrastructure. We propose a three-module pipeline: (1) Sensing, which captures multi-bounce histograms using SPAD-based LiDAR; (2) Perception, which estimates occupancy maps of hidden regions from these histograms using a convolutional neural network; and (3) Control, which allows a robot to follow safe paths based on the estimated occupancy. We evaluate our approach through simulations and real-world experiments on a mobile robot navigating an L-shaped corridor with hidden obstacles. Our work represents the first experimental demonstration of NLOS imaging for autonomous navigation, paving the way for safer and more efficient robotic systems operating in complex environments. We also contribute a novel dynamics-integrated transient rendering framework for simulating NLOS scenarios, facilitating future research in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sohwi Kim, Tae-Kyun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts, often relying on effective downsampling to generate diverse and realistic training pairs. In this work, we propose a co-learning framework that jointly optimizes a single-step diffusion-based upsampler and a learnable downsampler, enhanced by two discriminators and a cyclic distillation strategy. Our learnable downsampler is designed to better capture realistic degradation patterns while preserving structural details in the LR domain, which is crucial for enhancing SR performance. By leveraging a diffusion-based approach, our model generates diverse LR-HR pairs during training, enabling robust learning across varying degradations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both general real-world and domain-specific face SR tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Our approach not only improves efficiency with a single inference step but also ensures high-quality image reconstruction, bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world SR scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoan Xu, Tianshu Zheng, Xinyi Xu, Yao Shen, Jiwei Sun, Cong Sun, Guangbin Wang, Zhaopeng Cui, Dan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate automatic tissue segmentation in fetal brain MRI is a crucial step in clinical diagnosis but remains challenging, particularly due to the dynamically changing anatomy and tissue contrast during fetal development. Existing segmentation networks can only implicitly learn age-related features, leading to a decline in accuracy at extreme early or late gestational ages (GAs). To improve segmentation performance throughout gestation, we introduce AtlasSeg, a dual-U-shape convolution network that explicitly integrates GA-specific information as guidance. By providing a publicly available fetal brain atlas with segmentation labels corresponding to relevant GAs, AtlasSeg effectively extracts age-specific patterns in the atlas branch and generates precise tissue segmentation in the segmentation branch. Multi-scale spatial attention feature fusions are constructed during both encoding and decoding stages to enhance feature flow and facilitate better information interactions between two branches. We compared AtlasSeg with six well-established networks in a seven-tissue segmentation task, achieving the highest average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.91. The improvement was particularly evident in extreme early or late GA cases, where training data was scare. Furthermore, AtlasSeg exhibited minimal performance degradation on low-quality images with contrast changes and noise, attributed to its anatomical shape priors. Overall, AtlasSeg demonstrated enhanced segmentation accuracy, better consistency across fetal ages, and robustness to perturbations, making it a powerful tool for reliable fetal brain MRI tissue segmentation, particularly suited for diagnostic assessments during early gestation.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14833">Cell as Point: One-Stage Framework for Efficient Cell Tracking</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaxuan Song, Jianan Fan, Heng Huang, Mei Chen, Weidong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional multi-stage cell tracking approaches rely heavily on detection or segmentation in each frame as a prerequisite, requiring substantial resources for high-quality segmentation masks and increasing the overall prediction time. To address these limitations, we propose CAP, a novel end-to-end one-stage framework that reimagines cell tracking by treating Cell as Point. Unlike traditional methods, CAP eliminates the need for explicit detection or segmentation, instead jointly tracking cells for sequences in one stage by leveraging the inherent correlations among their trajectories. This simplification reduces both labeling requirements and pipeline complexity. However, directly processing the entire sequence in one stage poses challenges related to data imbalance in capturing cell division events and long sequence inference. To solve these challenges, CAP introduces two key innovations: (1) adaptive event-guided (AEG) sampling, which prioritizes cell division events to mitigate the occurrence imbalance of cell events, and (2) the rolling-as-window (RAW) inference strategy, which ensures continuous and stable tracking of newly emerging cells over extended sequences. By removing the dependency on segmentation-based preprocessing while addressing the challenges of imbalanced occurrence of cell events and long-sequence tracking, CAP demonstrates promising cell tracking performance and is 10 to 55 times more efficient than existing methods. The code and model checkpoints will be available soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Xie, Weijie Zheng, Hanxun Huang, Guangnan Ye, Xingjun Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, evaluating their vulnerabilities to adversarial perturbations is essential for ensuring their reliability and trustworthiness. Over the past decade, a large number of white-box adversarial robustness evaluation methods (i.e., attacks) have been proposed, ranging from single-step to multi-step methods and from individual to ensemble methods. Despite these advances, challenges remain in conducting meaningful and comprehensive robustness evaluations, particularly when it comes to large-scale testing and ensuring evaluations reflect real-world adversarial risks. In this work, we focus on image classification models and propose a novel individual attack method, Probability Margin Attack (PMA), which defines the adversarial margin in the probability space rather than the logits space. We analyze the relationship between PMA and existing cross-entropy or logits-margin-based attacks, and show that PMA can outperform the current state-of-the-art individual methods. Building on PMA, we propose two types of ensemble attacks that balance effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, we create a million-scale dataset, CC1M, derived from the existing CC3M dataset, and use it to conduct the first million-scale white-box adversarial robustness evaluation of adversarially-trained ImageNet models. Our findings provide valuable insights into the robustness gaps between individual versus ensemble attacks and small-scale versus million-scale evaluations.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Mamba-based image restoration backbones have recently demonstrated significant potential in balancing global reception and computational efficiency. However, the inherent causal modeling limitation of Mamba, where each token depends solely on its predecessors in the scanned sequence, restricts the full utilization of pixels across the image and thus presents new challenges in image restoration. In this work, we propose MambaIRv2, which equips Mamba with the non-causal modeling ability similar to ViTs to reach the attentive state space restoration model. Specifically, the proposed attentive state-space equation allows to attend beyond the scanned sequence and facilitate image unfolding with just one single scan. Moreover, we further introduce a semantic-guided neighboring mechanism to encourage interaction between distant but similar pixels. Extensive experiments show our MambaIRv2 outperforms SRFormer by even 0.35dB PSNR for lightweight SR even with 9.3\% less parameters and suppresses HAT on classic SR by up to 0.29dB.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chia-Ming Lee, Ching-Heng Cheng, Yu-Fan Lin, Yi-Ching Cheng, Wo-Ting Liao, Fu-En Yang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Chih-Chung Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in All-in-One (AiO) RGB image restoration have demonstrated the effectiveness of prompt learning in handling multiple degradations within a single model. However, extending these approaches to hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration is challenging due to the domain gap between RGB and HSI features, information loss in visual prompts under severe composite degradations, and difficulties in capturing HSI-specific degradation patterns via text prompts. In this paper, we propose PromptHSI, the first universal AiO HSI restoration framework that addresses these challenges. By incorporating frequency-aware feature modulation, which utilizes frequency analysis to narrow down the restoration search space and employing vision-language model (VLM)-guided prompt learning, our approach decomposes text prompts into intensity and bias controllers that effectively guide the restoration process while mitigating domain discrepancies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified architecture excels at both fine-grained recovery and global information restoration across diverse degradation scenarios, highlighting its significant potential for practical remote sensing applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyang Guo, Jinxu Xiang, Kai Ma, Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li, Ran Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D characters are essential to modern creative industries, but making them animatable often demands extensive manual work in tasks like rigging and skinning. Existing automatic rigging tools face several limitations, including the necessity for manual annotations, rigid skeleton topologies, and limited generalization across diverse shapes and poses. An alternative approach is to generate animatable avatars pre-bound to a rigged template mesh. However, this method often lacks flexibility and is typically limited to realistic human shapes. To address these issues, we present Make-It-Animatable, a novel data-driven method to make any 3D humanoid model ready for character animation in less than one second, regardless of its shapes and poses. Our unified framework generates high-quality blend weights, bones, and pose transformations. By incorporating a particle-based shape autoencoder, our approach supports various 3D representations, including meshes and 3D Gaussian splats. Additionally, we employ a coarse-to-fine representation and a structure-aware modeling strategy to ensure both accuracy and robustness, even for characters with non-standard skeleton structures. We conducted extensive experiments to validate our framework's effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in both quality and speed.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tjark Behrens, Ren\'e Zurbr\"ugg, Marc Pollefeys, Zuria Bauer, Hermann Blum</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent approaches have successfully focused on the segmentation of static reconstructions, thereby equipping downstream applications with semantic 3D understanding. However, the world in which we live is dynamic, characterized by numerous interactions between the environment and humans or robotic agents. Static semantic maps are unable to capture this information, and the naive solution of rescanning the environment after every change is both costly and ineffective in tracking e.g. objects being stored away in drawers. With Lost & Found we present an approach that addresses this limitation. Based solely on egocentric recordings with corresponding hand position and camera pose estimates, we are able to track the 6DoF poses of the moving object within the detected interaction interval. These changes are applied online to a transformable scene graph that captures object-level relations. Compared to state-of-the-art object pose trackers, our approach is more reliable in handling the challenging egocentric viewpoint and the lack of depth information. It outperforms the second-best approach by 34% and 56% for translational and orientational error, respectively, and produces visibly smoother 6DoF object trajectories. In addition, we illustrate how the acquired interaction information in the dynamic scene graph can be employed in the context of robotic applications that would otherwise be unfeasible: We show how our method allows to command a mobile manipulator through teach & repeat, and how information about prior interaction allows a mobile manipulator to retrieve an object hidden in a drawer.

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the inherent inference latency challenges associated with deploying multimodal large language models (MLLM) in quadruped vision-language-action (QUAR-VLA) tasks. Our investigation reveals that conventional parameter reduction techniques ultimately impair the performance of the language foundation model during the action instruction tuning phase, making them unsuitable for this purpose. We introduce a novel latency-free quadruped MLLM model, dubbed QUART-Online, designed to enhance inference efficiency without degrading the performance of the language foundation model. By incorporating Action Chunk Discretization (ACD), we compress the original action representation space, mapping continuous action values onto a smaller set of discrete representative vectors while preserving critical information. Subsequently, we fine-tune the MLLM to integrate vision, language, and compressed actions into a unified semantic space. Experimental results demonstrate that QUART-Online operates in tandem with the existing MLLM system, achieving real-time inference in sync with the underlying controller frequency, significantly boosting the success rate across various tasks by 65%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Badhan Kumar Das, Gengyan Zhao, Han Liu, Thomas J. Re, Dorin Comaniciu, Eli Gibson, Andreas Maier</p>
<p>Abstract: The Masked Autoencoder (MAE) has recently demonstrated effectiveness in pre-training Vision Transformers (ViT) for analyzing natural images. By reconstructing complete images from partially masked inputs, the ViT encoder gathers contextual information to predict the missing regions. This capability to aggregate context is especially important in medical imaging, where anatomical structures are functionally and mechanically linked to surrounding regions. However, current methods do not consider variations in the number of input images, which is typically the case in real-world Magnetic Resonance (MR) studies. To address this limitation, we propose a 3D Adaptive Masked Autoencoders (AMAE) architecture that accommodates a variable number of 3D input contrasts per subject. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset of 45,364 subjects was used for pretraining and a subset of 1648 training, 193 validation and 215 test subjects were used for finetuning. The performance demonstrates that self pre-training of this adaptive masked autoencoders can enhance the infarct segmentation performance by 2.8%-3.7% for ViT-based segmentation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ella Koresh, Ronit D. Gross, Yuval Meir, Yarden Tzach, Tal Halevi, Ido Kanter</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) evaluate short-range correlations in input images which progress along the layers, whereas vision transformer (ViT) architectures evaluate long-range correlations, using repeated transformer encoders composed of fully connected layers. Both are designed to solve complex classification tasks but from different perspectives. This study demonstrates that CNNs and ViT architectures stem from a unified underlying learning mechanism, which quantitatively measures the single-nodal performance (SNP) of each node in feedforward (FF) and multi-head attention (MHA) sub-blocks. Each node identifies small clusters of possible output labels, with additional noise represented as labels outside these clusters. These features are progressively sharpened along the transformer encoders, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio. This unified underlying learning mechanism leads to two main findings. First, it enables an efficient applied nodal diagonal connection (ANDC) pruning technique without affecting the accuracy. Second, based on the SNP, spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs among the MHA heads, such that each head focuses its attention on a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. Consequently, each head becomes an expert in recognizing its designated labels, representing a quantitative MHA modus vivendi mechanism. This statistical mechanics inspired viewpoint enables to reveal macroscopic behavior of the entire network from the microscopic performance of each node. These results are based on a compact convolutional transformer architecture trained on the CIFAR-100 and Flowers-102 datasets and call for their extension to other architectures and applications, such as natural language processing.</p>

We provide an upper bound on the expected ratio-cut, as well as an unbiased estimate of its gradient, to learn the parameters of the assignment variables in an online setting. The clustering resulting from our probabilistic approach (PRCut) outperforms the Rayleigh quotient relaxation of the combinatorial problem, its online learning extensions, and several widely used methods. We demonstrate that the PRCut clustering closely aligns with the similarity measure and can perform as well as a supervised classifier when label-based similarities are provided. This novel approach can leverage out-of-the-box self-supervised representations to achieve competitive performance and serve as an evaluation method for the quality of these representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanzhou Ke, Shengfeng He, Xiao Li Wang, Bo Wang, Guoqing Chao, Yuanyang Zhang, Yi Xie, HeXing Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous successful approaches to missing modality completion rely on carefully designed fusion techniques and extensive pre-training on complete data, which can limit their generalizability in out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. In this study, we pose a new challenge: can we develop a missing modality completion model that is both resource-efficient and robust to OOD generalization? To address this, we present a training-free framework for missing modality completion that leverages large multimodal models (LMMs). Our approach, termed the "Knowledge Bridger", is modality-agnostic and integrates generation and ranking of missing modalities. By defining domain-specific priors, our method automatically extracts structured information from available modalities to construct knowledge graphs. These extracted graphs connect the missing modality generation and ranking modules through the LMM, resulting in high-quality imputations of missing modalities. Experimental results across both general and medical domains show that our approach consistently outperforms competing methods, including in OOD generalization. Additionally, our knowledge-driven generation and ranking techniques demonstrate superiority over variants that directly employ LMMs for generation and ranking, offering insights that may be valuable for applications in other domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huang Huang, Fangchen Liu, Letian Fu, Tingfan Wu, Mustafa Mukadam, Jitendra Malik, Ken Goldberg, Pieter Abbeel</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to predict robotic actions based on visual observations and language instructions. Existing approaches require fine-tuning pre-trained visionlanguage models (VLMs) as visual and language features are independently fed into downstream policies, degrading the pre-trained semantic alignments. We propose OTTER, a novel VLA architecture that leverages these existing alignments through explicit, text-aware visual feature extraction. Instead of processing all visual features, OTTER selectively extracts and passes only task-relevant visual features that are semantically aligned with the language instruction to the policy transformer. This allows OTTER to keep the pre-trained vision-language encoders frozen. Thereby, OTTER preserves and utilizes the rich semantic understanding learned from large-scale pre-training, enabling strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. In simulation and real-world experiments, OTTER significantly outperforms existing VLA models, demonstrating strong zeroshot generalization to novel objects and environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyeop Yoon, Yujin Oh, Matthew Tivnan, Sifan Song, Pengfei Jin, Sekeun Kim, Hyun Jin Cho, Dufan Wu, Raul Uppot, Quanzheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a 3D flow-matching model designed to predict the progression of the frozen region (iceball) during kidney cryoablation. Precise intraoperative guidance is critical in cryoablation to ensure complete tumor eradication while preserving adjacent healthy tissue. However, conventional methods, typically based on physics driven or diffusion based simulations, are computationally demanding and often struggle to represent complex anatomical structures accurately. To address these limitations, our approach leverages intraoperative CT imaging to inform the model. The proposed 3D flow matching model is trained to learn a continuous deformation field that maps early-stage CT scans to future predictions. This transformation not only estimates the volumetric expansion of the iceball but also generates corresponding segmentation masks, effectively capturing spatial and morphological changes over time. Quantitative analysis highlights the model robustness, demonstrating strong agreement between predictions and ground-truth segmentations. The model achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.61 and a Dice coefficient of 0.75. By integrating real time CT imaging with advanced deep learning techniques, this approach has the potential to enhance intraoperative guidance in kidney cryoablation, improving procedural outcomes and advancing the field of minimally invasive surgery.</p>
