<p><b>Authors:</b> Alain Andres, Aitor Martinez-Seras, Ibai La\~na, Javier Del Ser</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of human-machine interaction, artificial intelligence has become a powerful tool for accelerating data modeling tasks. Object detection methods have achieved outstanding results and are widely used in critical domains like autonomous driving and video surveillance. However, their adoption in high-risk applications, where errors may cause severe consequences, remains limited. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods aim to address this issue, but many existing techniques are model-specific and designed for classification tasks, making them less effective for object detection and difficult for non-specialists to interpret. In this work we focus on model-agnostic XAI methods for object detection models and propose D-MFPP, an extension of the Morphological Fragmental Perturbation Pyramid (MFPP), which uses segmentation-based mask generation. Additionally, we introduce D-Deletion, a novel metric combining faithfulness and localization, adapted specifically to meet the unique demands of object detectors. We evaluate these methods on real-world industrial and robotic datasets, examining the influence of parameters such as the number of masks, model size, and image resolution on the quality of explanations. Our experiments use single-stage object detection models applied to two safety-critical robotic environments: i) a shared human-robot workspace where safety is of paramount importance, and ii) an assembly area of battery kits, where safety is critical due to the potential for damage among high-risk components. Our findings evince that D-Deletion effectively gauges the performance of explanations when multiple elements of the same class appear in the same scene, while D-MFPP provides a promising alternative to D-RISE when fewer masks are used.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kang Yin, Hye-Bin Shin, Dan Li, Seong-Whan Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning has been a popular area of research, yet integrating electroencephalogram (EEG) data poses unique challenges due to its inherent variability and limited availability. In this paper, we introduce a novel multimodal framework that accommodates not only conventional modalities such as video, images, and audio, but also incorporates EEG data. Our framework is designed to flexibly handle varying input sizes, while dynamically adjusting attention to account for feature importance across modalities. We evaluate our approach on a recently introduced emotion recognition dataset that combines data from three modalities, making it an ideal testbed for multimodal learning. The experimental results provide a benchmark for the dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This work highlights the potential of integrating EEG into multimodal systems, paving the way for more robust and comprehensive applications in emotion recognition and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial expressions are crucial to human communication, offering insights into emotional states. This study examines how specific facial features influence emotion classification, using facial perturbations on the Fer2013 dataset. As expected, models trained on data with the removal of some important facial feature experienced up to an 85% accuracy drop when compared to baseline for emotions like happy and surprise. Surprisingly, for the emotion disgust, there seem to be slight improvement in accuracy for classifier after mask have been applied. Building on top of this observation, we applied a training scheme to mask out facial features during training, motivating our proposed Perturb Scheme. This scheme, with three phases-attention-based classification, pixel clustering, and feature-focused training, demonstrates improvements in classification accuracy. The experimental results obtained suggests there are some benefits to removing individual facial features in emotion recognition tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> an Zhang, Ming Li, Chun Li, Zhaoxia Liu, Ye Zhang, Fei Richard Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Evidence-based deep learning represents a burgeoning paradigm for uncertainty estimation, offering reliable predictions with negligible extra computational overheads. Existing methods usually adopt Kullback-Leibler divergence to estimate the uncertainty of network predictions, ignoring domain gaps among various modalities. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a novel algorithm based on H\"older Divergence (HD) to enhance the reliability of multi-view learning by addressing inherent uncertainty challenges from incomplete or noisy data. Generally, our method extracts the representations of multiple modalities through parallel network branches, and then employs HD to estimate the prediction uncertainties. Through the Dempster-Shafer theory, integration of uncertainty from different modalities, thereby generating a comprehensive result that considers all available representations. Mathematically, HD proves to better measure the ``distance'' between real data distribution and predictive distribution of the model and improve the performances of multi-class recognition tasks.
  Specifically, our method surpass the existing state-of-the-art counterparts on all evaluating benchmarks.
  We further conduct extensive experiments on different backbones to verify our superior robustness. It is demonstrated that our method successfully pushes the corresponding performance boundaries. Finally, we perform experiments on more challenging scenarios, \textit{i.e.}, learning with incomplete or noisy data, revealing that our method exhibits a high tolerance to such corrupted data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00827">IDEATOR: Jailbreaking VLMs Using VLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruofan Wang, Bo Wang, Xingjun Ma, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) continue to gain prominence, ensuring their safety deployment in real-world applications has become a critical concern. Recently, significant research efforts have focused on evaluating the robustness of VLMs against jailbreak attacks. Due to challenges in obtaining multi-modal data, current studies often assess VLM robustness by generating adversarial or query-relevant images based on harmful text datasets. However, the jailbreak images generated this way exhibit certain limitations. Adversarial images require white-box access to the target VLM and are relatively easy to defend against, while query-relevant images must be linked to the target harmful content, limiting their diversity and effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel jailbreak method named IDEATOR, which autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is a VLM-based approach inspired by our conjecture that a VLM itself might be a powerful red team model for generating jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR employs a VLM to generate jailbreak texts while leveraging a state-of-the-art diffusion model to create corresponding jailbreak images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the high effectiveness and transferability of IDEATOR. It successfully jailbreaks MiniGPT-4 with a 94% success rate and transfers seamlessly to LLaVA and InstructBLIP, achieving high success rates of 82% and 88%, respectively. IDEATOR uncovers previously unrecognized vulnerabilities in VLMs, calling for advanced safety mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Badr AlKhamissi, Yingtian Tang, Abd\"ulkadir G\"okce, Johannes Mehrer, Martin Schrimpf</p>
<p>Abstract: While today's large language models exhibit impressive abilities in generating human-like text, they require massive amounts of data during training. We here take inspiration from human cognitive development to train models in limited data conditions. Specifically we present a self-synthesis approach that iterates through four phases: Phase 1 sets up fundamental language abilities, training the model from scratch on a small corpus. Language is then associated with the visual environment in phase 2, integrating the model with a vision encoder to generate descriptive captions from labeled images. In the "self-synthesis" phase 3, the model generates captions for unlabeled images, that it then uses to further train its language component with a mix of synthetic, and previous real-world text. This phase is meant to expand the model's linguistic repertoire, similar to humans self-annotating new experiences. Finally, phase 4 develops advanced cognitive skills, by training the model on specific tasks such as visual question answering and reasoning. Our approach offers a proof of concept for training a multimodal model using a developmentally plausible amount of data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teerath Kumar, Alessandra Mileo, Malika Bendechache</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation has become a pivotal tool in enhancing the performance of computer vision tasks, with the KeepOriginalAugment method emerging as a standout technique for its intelligent incorporation of salient regions within less prominent areas, enabling augmentation in both regions. Despite its success in image classification, its potential in addressing biases remains unexplored. In this study, we introduce an extension of the KeepOriginalAugment method, termed FaceKeepOriginalAugment, which explores various debiasing aspects-geographical, gender, and stereotypical biases-in computer vision models. By maintaining a delicate balance between data diversity and information preservation, our approach empowers models to exploit both diverse salient and non-salient regions, thereby fostering increased diversity and debiasing effects. We investigate multiple strategies for determining the placement of the salient region and swapping perspectives to decide which part undergoes augmentation. Leveraging the Image Similarity Score (ISS), we quantify dataset diversity across a range of datasets, including Flickr Faces HQ (FFHQ), WIKI, IMDB, Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW), UTK Faces, and Diverse Dataset. We evaluate the effectiveness of FaceKeepOriginalAugment in mitigating gender bias across CEO, Engineer, Nurse, and School Teacher datasets, utilizing the Image-Image Association Score (IIAS) in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). Our findings shows the efficacy of FaceKeepOriginalAugment in promoting fairness and inclusivity within computer vision models, demonstrated by reduced gender bias and enhanced overall fairness. Additionally, we introduce a novel metric, Saliency-Based Diversity and Fairness Metric, which quantifies both diversity and fairness while handling data imbalance across various datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Yoga has recently become an essential aspect of human existence for maintaining a healthy body and mind. People find it tough to devote time to the gym for workouts as their lives get more hectic and they work from home. This kind of human pose estimation is one of the notable problems as it has to deal with locating body key points or joints. Yoga-82, a benchmark dataset for large-scale yoga pose recognition with 82 classes, has challenging positions that could make precise annotations impossible. We have used VGG-16, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-121 and finetuned them in different ways to get better results. We also used Neural Architecture Search to add more layers on top of this pre-trained architecture. The experimental result shows the best performance of DenseNet-121 having the top-1 accuracy of 85% and top-5 accuracy of 96% outperforming the current state-of-the-art result.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00836">DynaMath: A Dynamic Visual Benchmark for Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning Robustness of Vision Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengke Zou, Xingang Guo, Rui Yang, Junyu Zhang, Bin Hu, Huan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great potential in tackling mathematical reasoning tasks that involve visual context. Unlike humans who can reliably apply solution steps to similar problems with minor modifications, we found that SOTA VLMs like GPT-4o can consistently fail in these scenarios, revealing limitations in their mathematical reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the mathematical reasoning robustness in VLMs and evaluate how well these models perform under different variants of the same question, such as changes in visual numerical values or function graphs. While several vision-based math benchmarks have been developed to assess VLMs' problem-solving capabilities, these benchmarks contain only static sets of problems and cannot easily evaluate mathematical reasoning robustness. To fill this gap, we introduce DynaMath, a dynamic visual math benchmark designed for in-depth assessment of VLMs. DynaMath includes 501 high-quality, multi-topic seed questions, each represented as a Python program. Those programs are carefully designed and annotated to enable the automatic generation of a much larger set of concrete questions, including many different types of visual and textual variations. DynaMath allows us to evaluate the generalization ability of VLMs, by assessing their performance under varying input conditions of a seed question. We evaluated 14 SOTA VLMs with 5,010 generated concrete questions. Our results show that the worst-case model accuracy, defined as the percentage of correctly answered seed questions in all 10 variants, is significantly lower than the average-case accuracy. Our analysis emphasizes the need to study the robustness of VLMs' reasoning abilities, and DynaMath provides valuable insights to guide the development of more reliable models for mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengbo Zhou, Degan Hao, Dooman Arefan, Margarita Zuley, Jules Sumkin, Shandong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In breast cancer detection and diagnosis, the longitudinal analysis of mammogram images is crucial. Contemporary models excel in detecting temporal imaging feature changes, thus enhancing the learning process over sequential imaging exams. Yet, the resilience of these longitudinal models against adversarial attacks remains underexplored. In this study, we proposed a novel attack method that capitalizes on the feature-level relationship between two sequential mammogram exams of a longitudinal model, guided by both cross-entropy loss and distance metric learning, to achieve significant attack efficacy, as implemented using attack transferring in a black-box attacking manner. We performed experiments on a cohort of 590 breast cancer patients (each has two sequential mammogram exams) in a case-control setting. Results showed that our proposed method surpassed several state-of-the-art adversarial attacks in fooling the diagnosis models to give opposite outputs. Our method remained effective even if the model was trained with the common defending method of adversarial training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Wu, Simin Chen, Zehua Wang, Wei Chen, Zijian Tian, F. Richard Yu, Victor C. M. Leung</p>
<p>Abstract: As the volume of image data grows, data-oriented cloud computing in Internet of Video Things (IoVT) systems encounters latency issues. Task-oriented edge computing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However, limited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing visual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with low resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while device-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to adapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design framework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies during inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic model structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based model partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge devices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance throughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and convergence of partitioned models. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in throughput (12.05\% on MNIST, 18.83\% on ImageNet) and superior classification accuracy compared to baseline algorithms. Our method consistently achieves stable performance across different devices, underscoring its adaptability. Simulated experiments further confirm its efficacy in high-accuracy, real-time detection for small objects in IoVT systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre-\'Etienne H. Fiquet, Eero P. Simoncelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal prediction is inherently uncertain, but representing the ambiguity in natural image sequences is a challenging high-dimensional probabilistic inference problem. For natural scenes, the curse of dimensionality renders explicit density estimation statistically and computationally intractable. Here, we describe an implicit regression-based framework for learning and sampling the conditional density of the next frame in a video given previous observed frames. We show that sequence-to-image deep networks trained on a simple resilience-to-noise objective function extract adaptive representations for temporal prediction. Synthetic experiments demonstrate that this score-based framework can handle occlusion boundaries: unlike classical methods that average over bifurcating temporal trajectories, it chooses among likely trajectories, selecting more probable options with higher frequency. Furthermore, analysis of networks trained on natural image sequences reveals that the representation automatically weights predictive evidence by its reliability, which is a hallmark of statistical inference</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siwen Quan, Junhao Yu, Ziming Nie, Muze Wang, Sijia Feng, Pei An, Jiaqi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud data now are popular data representations in a number of three-dimensional (3D) vision research realms. However, due to the limited performance of sensors and sensing noise, the raw data usually suffer from sparsity, noise, and incompleteness. This poses great challenges to down-stream point cloud processing tasks. In recent years, deep-learning-based point cloud enhancement methods, which aim to achieve dense, clean, and complete point clouds from low-quality raw point clouds using deep neural networks, are gaining tremendous research attention. This paper, for the first time to our knowledge, presents a comprehensive survey for deep-learning-based point cloud enhancement methods. It covers three main perspectives for point cloud enhancement, i.e., (1) denoising to achieve clean data; (2) completion to recover unseen data; (3) upsampling to obtain dense data. Our survey presents a new taxonomy for recent state-of-the-art methods and systematic experimental results on standard benchmarks. In addition, we share our insightful observations, thoughts, and inspiring future research directions for point cloud enhancement with deep learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a reliable temporal grounding pipeline for video-to-analytic alignment of basketball broadcast footage. Given a series of frames as input, our method quickly and accurately extracts time-remaining and quarter values from basketball broadcast scenes. Our work intends to expedite the development of large, multi-modal video datasets to train data-hungry video models in the sports action recognition domain. Our method aligns a pre-labeled corpus of play-by-play annotations containing dense event annotations to video frames, enabling quick retrieval of labeled video segments. Unlike previous methods, we forgo the need to localize game clocks by fine-tuning an out-of-the-box object detector to find semantic text regions directly. Our end-to-end approach improves the generality of our work. Additionally, interpolation and parallelization techniques prepare our pipeline for deployment in a large computing cluster.

The MRKR dataset also features imaging metadata such as image laterality, view type, and presence of hardware, enhancing its value for research and model development. MRKR addresses significant gaps in existing datasets by offering a more representative sample for studying osteoarthritis and related outcomes, particularly among minority populations, thereby providing a valuable resource for clinicians and researchers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery is commonly interpreted as the task of localizing and/or categorizing objects in visual data without the need for labeled examples. While current object recognition methods have proven highly effective for practical applications, the ongoing demand for annotated data in real-world scenarios drives research into unsupervised approaches. Furthermore, existing literature in object discovery is both extensive and diverse, posing a significant challenge for researchers that aim to navigate and synthesize this knowledge. Motivated by the evidenced interest in this avenue of research, and the lack of comprehensive studies that could facilitate a holistic understanding of unsupervised object discovery, this survey conducts an in-depth exploration of the existing approaches and systematically categorizes this compendium based on the tasks addressed and the families of techniques employed. Additionally, we present an overview of common datasets and metrics, highlighting the challenges of comparing methods due to varying evaluation protocols.

<p>Abstract: In the task of temporal action localization of ActivityNet-1.3 datasets, we propose to locate the temporal boundaries of each action and predict action class in untrimmed videos. We first apply VideoSwinTransformer as feature extractor to extract different features. Then we apply a unified network following Faster-TAD to simultaneously obtain proposals and semantic labels.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonggyu Jang, Hyeonsu Lyu, Jungyeon Koh, Hyun Jong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The conventional targeted adversarial attacks add a small perturbation to an image to make neural network models estimate the image as a predefined target class, even if it is not the correct target class. Recently, for visual-language models (VLMs), the focus of targeted adversarial attacks is to generate a perturbation that makes VLMs answer intended target text outputs. For example, they aim to make a small perturbation on an image to make VLMs' answers change from "there is an apple" to "there is a baseball." However, answering just intended text outputs is insufficient for tricky questions like "if there is a baseball, tell me what is below it." This is because the target of the adversarial attacks does not consider the overall integrity of the original image, thereby leading to a lack of visual reasoning. In this work, we focus on generating targeted adversarial examples with visual reasoning against VLMs. To this end, we propose 1) a novel adversarial attack procedure -- namely, Replace-then-Perturb and 2) a contrastive learning-based adversarial loss -- namely, Contrastive-Adv. In Replace-then-Perturb, we first leverage a text-guided segmentation model to find the target object in the image. Then, we get rid of the target object and inpaint the empty space with the desired prompt. By doing this, we can generate a target image corresponding to the desired prompt, while maintaining the overall integrity of the original image. Furthermore, in Contrastive-Adv, we design a novel loss function to obtain better adversarial examples. Our extensive benchmark results demonstrate that Replace-then-Perturb and Contrastive-Adv outperform the baseline adversarial attack algorithms. We note that the source code to reproduce the results will be available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Mi, Weijun Wang, Wenming Tu, Qingfeng He, Rui Kong, Xinyu Fang, Yazhu Dong, Yikang Zhang, Yunchun Li, Meng Li, Haipeng Dai, Guihai Chen, Yunxin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown significant progress in various complex vision tasks with the solid linguistic and reasoning capacity inherited from large language models (LMMs). Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offers a promising method to integrate external knowledge into LMMs, compensating for their limitations on domain-specific tasks. However, the existing LoRA model serving is excessively computationally expensive and causes extremely high latency. In this paper, we present an end-to-end solution that empowers diverse vision tasks and enriches vision applications with LoRA LMMs. Our system, VaLoRA, enables accurate and efficient vision tasks by 1) an accuracy-aware LoRA adapter generation approach that generates LoRA adapters rich in domain-specific knowledge to meet application-specific accuracy requirements, 2) an adaptive-tiling LoRA adapters batching operator that efficiently computes concurrent heterogeneous LoRA adapters, and 3) a flexible LoRA adapter orchestration mechanism that manages application requests and LoRA adapters to achieve the lowest average response latency. We prototype VaLoRA on five popular vision tasks on three LMMs. Experiment results reveal that VaLoRA improves 24-62% of the accuracy compared to the original LMMs and reduces 20-89% of the latency compared to the state-of-the-art LoRA model serving systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Osteoporosis is a common condition that increases fracture risk, especially in older adults. Early diagnosis is vital for preventing fractures, reducing treatment costs, and preserving mobility. However, healthcare providers face challenges like limited labeled data and difficulties in processing medical images. This study presents a novel multi-modal learning framework that integrates clinical and imaging data to improve diagnostic accuracy and model interpretability. The model utilizes three pre-trained networks-VGG19, InceptionV3, and ResNet50-to extract deep features from X-ray images. These features are transformed using PCA to reduce dimensionality and focus on the most relevant components. A clustering-based selection process identifies the most representative components, which are then combined with preprocessed clinical data and processed through a fully connected network (FCN) for final classification. A feature importance plot highlights key variables, showing that Medical History, BMI, and Height were the main contributors, emphasizing the significance of patient-specific data. While imaging features were valuable, they had lower importance, indicating that clinical data are crucial for accurate predictions. This framework promotes precise and interpretable predictions, enhancing transparency and building trust in AI-driven diagnoses for clinical integration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duy Nhat Phan, Sushant Jha, James P. Mavo, Erin L. Lanigan, Linh Nguyen, Lokendra Poudel, Rahul Bhowmik</p>
<p>Abstract: Additive Manufacturing (AM) is transforming the manufacturing sector by enabling efficient production of intricately designed products and small-batch components. However, metal parts produced via AM can include flaws that cause inferior mechanical properties, including reduced fatigue response, yield strength, and fracture toughness. To address this issue, we leverage convolutional neural networks (CNN) to analyze thermal images of printed layers, automatically identifying anomalies that impact these properties. We also investigate various synthetic data generation techniques to address limited and imbalanced AM training data. Our models' defect detection capabilities were assessed using images of Nickel alloy 718 layers produced on a laser powder bed fusion AM machine and synthetic datasets with and without added noise. Our results show significant accuracy improvements with synthetic data, emphasizing the importance of expanding training sets for reliable defect detection. Specifically, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)-generated datasets streamlined data preparation by eliminating human intervention while maintaining high performance, thereby enhancing defect detection capabilities. Additionally, our denoising approach effectively improves image quality, ensuring reliable defect detection. Finally, our work integrates these models in the CLoud ADditive MAnufacturing (CLADMA) module, a user-friendly interface, to enhance their accessibility and practicality for AM applications. This integration supports broader adoption and practical implementation of advanced defect detection in AM processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parham Jafary, Anna Bazangeya, Michelle Pham, Lesley G. Campbell, Sajad Saeedi, Kourosh Zareinia, Habiba Bougherara</p>
<p>Abstract: The future of the agriculture industry is intertwined with automation. Accurate fruit detection, yield estimation, and harvest time estimation are crucial for optimizing agricultural practices. These tasks can be carried out by robots to reduce labour costs and improve the efficiency of the process. To do so, deep learning models should be trained to perform knowledge-based tasks, which outlines the importance of contributing valuable data to the literature. In this paper, we introduce Raspberry PhenoSet, a phenology-based dataset designed for detecting and segmenting raspberry fruit across seven developmental stages. To the best of our knowledge, Raspberry PhenoSet is the first fruit dataset to integrate biology-based classification with fruit detection tasks, offering valuable insights for yield estimation and precise harvest timing. This dataset contains 1,853 high-resolution images, the highest quality in the literature, captured under controlled artificial lighting in a vertical farm. The dataset has a total of 6,907 instances of mask annotations, manually labelled to reflect the seven phenology stages. We have also benchmarked Raspberry PhenoSet using several state-of-the-art deep learning models, including YOLOv8, YOLOv10, RT-DETR, and Mask R-CNN, to provide a comprehensive evaluation of their performance on the dataset. Our results highlight the challenges of distinguishing subtle phenology stages and underscore the potential of Raspberry PhenoSet for both deep learning model development and practical robotic applications in agriculture, particularly in yield prediction and supply chain management. The dataset and the trained models are publicly available for future studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kei Iino, Miho Takahashi, Hiroshi Watanabe, Ichiro Morinaga, Shohei Enomoto, Xu Shi, Akira Sakamoto, Takeharu Eda</p>
<p>Abstract: In Collaborative Intelligence, a deep neural network (DNN) is partitioned and deployed at the edge and the cloud for bandwidth saving and system optimization. When a model input is an image, it has been confirmed that the intermediate feature map, the output from the edge, can be smaller than the input data size. However, its effectiveness has not been reported when the input is a video. In this study, we propose a method to compress the feature map of surveillance videos by applying inter-feature-map differential coding (IFMDC). IFMDC shows a compression ratio comparable to, or better than, HEVC to the input video in the case of small accuracy reduction. Our method is especially effective for videos that are sensitive to image quality degradation when HEVC is applied</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicola Dall'Asen, Yiming Wang, Enrico Fini, Elisa Ricci</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-resource domains, characterized by scarce data and annotations, present significant challenges for language and visual understanding tasks, with the latter much under-explored in the literature. Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLM) have shown promising results in high-resource domains but fall short in low-resource concepts that are under-represented (e.g. only a handful of images per category) in the pre-training set. We tackle the challenging task of zero-shot low-resource image classification from a novel perspective. By leveraging a retrieval-based strategy, we achieve this in a training-free fashion. Specifically, our method, named CoRE (Combination of Retrieval Enrichment), enriches the representation of both query images and class prototypes by retrieving relevant textual information from large web-crawled databases. This retrieval-based enrichment significantly boosts classification performance by incorporating the broader contextual information relevant to the specific class. We validate our method on a newly established benchmark covering diverse low-resource domains, including medical imaging, rare plants, and circuits. Our experiments demonstrate that CORE outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods that rely on synthetic data generation and model fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zachary H. Hendrix, Peter T. Brown, Tim Flanagan, Douglas P. Shepherd, Ayush Saurabh, Steve Press\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Richardson-Lucy deconvolution is widely used to restore images from degradation caused by the broadening effects of a point spread function and corruption by photon shot noise, in order to recover an underlying object. In practice, this is achieved by iteratively maximizing a Poisson emission likelihood. However, the RL algorithm is known to prefer sparse solutions and overfit noise, leading to high-frequency artifacts. The structure of these artifacts is sensitive to the number of RL iterations, and this parameter is typically hand-tuned to achieve reasonable perceptual quality of the inferred object. Overfitting can be mitigated by introducing tunable regularizers or other ad hoc iteration cutoffs in the optimization as otherwise incorporating fully realistic models can introduce computational bottlenecks. To resolve these problems, we present Bayesian deconvolution, a rigorous deconvolution framework that combines a physically accurate image formation model avoiding the challenges inherent to the RL approach. Our approach achieves deconvolution while satisfying the following desiderata:
  I deconvolution is performed in the spatial domain (as opposed to the frequency domain) where all known noise sources are accurately modeled and integrated in the spirit of providing full probability distributions over the density of the putative object recovered;
  II the probability distribution is estimated without making assumptions on the sparsity or continuity of the underlying object;
  III unsupervised inference is performed and converges to a stable solution with no user-dependent parameter tuning or iteration cutoff;
  IV deconvolution produces strictly positive solutions; and
  V implementation is amenable to fast, parallelizable computation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kimia Hamidieh, Haoran Zhang, Walter Gerych, Thomas Hartvigsen, Marzyeh Ghassemi</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models, like CLIP (Contrastive Language Image Pretraining), are becoming increasingly popular for a wide range of multimodal retrieval tasks. However, prior work has shown that large language and deep vision models can learn historical biases contained in their training sets, leading to perpetuation of stereotypes and potential downstream harm. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the social biases that are present in CLIP, with a focus on the interaction between image and text modalities. We first propose a taxonomy of social biases called So-B-IT, which contains 374 words categorized across ten types of bias. Each type can lead to societal harm if associated with a particular demographic group. Using this taxonomy, we examine images retrieved by CLIP from a facial image dataset using each word as part of a prompt. We find that CLIP frequently displays undesirable associations between harmful words and specific demographic groups, such as retrieving mostly pictures of Middle Eastern men when asked to retrieve images of a "terrorist". Finally, we conduct an analysis of the source of such biases, by showing that the same harmful stereotypes are also present in a large image-text dataset used to train CLIP models for examples of biases that we find. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating and addressing bias in vision-language models, and suggest the need for transparency and fairness-aware curation of large pre-training datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Gutwein, Martin Kampel, Sabine Taschner-Mandl, Roxane Licandro</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting genetic aberrations is crucial in cancer diagnosis, typically through fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). However, existing FISH image classification methods face challenges due to signal variability, the need for costly manual annotations and fail to adequately address the intrinsic uncertainty. We introduce a novel approach that leverages synthetic images to eliminate the requirement for manual annotations and utilizes a joint contrastive and classification objective for training to account for inter-class variation effectively. We demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities and uncertainty calibration of our method, which is trained on synthetic data, by testing it on a manually annotated dataset of real-world FISH images. Our model offers superior calibration in terms of classification accuracy and uncertainty quantification with a classification accuracy of 96.7% among the 50% most certain cases. The presented end-to-end method reduces the demands on personnel and time and improves the diagnostic workflow due to its accuracy and adaptability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanghyun Byun, Jacob Song, Woo Seong Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: Monocular metric depth estimation (MMDE) is a crucial task to solve for indoor scene reconstruction on edge devices. Despite this importance, existing models are sensitive to factors such as boundary frequency of objects in the scene and scene complexity, failing to fully capture many indoor scenes. In this work, we propose to close this gap through the task of monocular metric depth refinement (MMDR) by leveraging state-of-the-art MMDE models. MultiDepth proposes a solution by taking samples of the image along with the initial depth map prediction made by a pre-trained MMDE model. Compared to existing iterative depth refinement techniques, MultiDepth does not employ normal map prediction as part of its architecture, effectively lowering the model size and computation overhead while outputting impactful changes from refining iterations. MultiDepth implements a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture for the refinement network, processing multiple samples from the given image, including segmentation masking. We evaluate MultiDepth on four datasets and compare them to state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate its effective refinement with minimal overhead, displaying accuracy improvement upward of 45%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bryan Bo Cao, Lawrence O'Gorman, Michael Coss, Shubham Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Few-Class Arena (FCA), as a unified benchmark with focus on testing efficient image classification models for few classes. A wide variety of benchmark datasets with many classes (80-1000) have been created to assist Computer Vision architectural evolution. An increasing number of vision models are evaluated with these many-class datasets. However, real-world applications often involve substantially fewer classes of interest (2-10). This gap between many and few classes makes it difficult to predict performance of the few-class applications using models trained on the available many-class datasets. To date, little has been offered to evaluate models in this Few-Class Regime. We conduct a systematic evaluation of the ResNet family trained on ImageNet subsets from 2 to 1000 classes, and test a wide spectrum of Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformer architectures over ten datasets by using our newly proposed FCA tool. Furthermore, to aid an up-front assessment of dataset difficulty and a more efficient selection of models, we incorporate a difficulty measure as a function of class similarity. FCA offers a new tool for efficient machine learning in the Few-Class Regime, with goals ranging from a new efficient class similarity proposal, to lightweight model architecture design, to a new scaling law. FCA is user-friendly and can be easily extended to new models and datasets, facilitating future research work. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/fewclassarena/fca.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently shown great progress in text-rich image understanding, yet they still struggle with complex, multi-page, visually-rich documents. Traditional methods using document parsers for retrieval-augmented generation suffer from performance and efficiency limitations, while directly presenting all pages to LMMs leads to inefficiencies, especially with lengthy documents. In this work, we present a novel framework named LoRA-Contextualizing Adaptation of Large multimodal models (LoCAL), which broadens the capabilities of any LMM to support long-document understanding. We demonstrate that LMMs can effectively serve as multimodal retrievers, fetching relevant pages to answer user questions based on these pages. LoCAL is implemented with two specific LMM adapters: one for evidence page retrieval and another for question answering. Empirical results show state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of LoCAL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses distribution shifts during testing by adapting a pretrained model without access to source data. In this work, we propose a novel TTA approach for 3D point cloud classification, combining sampling variation with weight averaging. Our method leverages Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to create multiple point cloud representations, adapting the model for each variation using the TENT algorithm. The final model parameters are obtained by averaging the adapted weights, leading to improved robustness against distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on ModelNet40-C, ShapeNet-C, and ScanObjectNN-C datasets, with different backbones (Point-MAE, PointNet, DGCNN), demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods while maintaining minimal resource overhead.

<p>Abstract: We introduce the idea of AquaFuse, a physics-based method for synthesizing waterbody properties in underwater imagery. We formulate a closed-form solution for waterbody fusion that facilitates realistic data augmentation and geometrically consistent underwater scene rendering. AquaFuse leverages the physical characteristics of light propagation underwater to synthesize the waterbody from one scene to the object contents of another. Unlike data-driven style transfer, AquaFuse preserves the depth consistency and object geometry in an input scene. We validate this unique feature by comprehensive experiments over diverse underwater scenes. We find that the AquaFused images preserve over 94% depth consistency and 90-95% structural similarity of the input scenes. We also demonstrate that it generates accurate 3D view synthesis by preserving object geometry while adapting to the inherent waterbody fusion process. AquaFuse opens up a new research direction in data augmentation by geometry-preserving style transfer for underwater imaging and robot vision applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichen Xie, Chenfeng Xu, Chensheng Peng, Shuqi Zhao, Nhat Ho, Alexander T. Pham, Mingyu Ding, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Wei Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements have exploited diffusion models for the synthesis of either LiDAR point clouds or camera image data in driving scenarios. Despite their success in modeling single-modality data marginal distribution, there is an under-exploration in the mutual reliance between different modalities to describe complex driving scenes. To fill in this gap, we propose a novel framework, X-DRIVE, to model the joint distribution of point clouds and multi-view images via a dual-branch latent diffusion model architecture. Considering the distinct geometrical spaces of the two modalities, X-DRIVE conditions the synthesis of each modality on the corresponding local regions from the other modality, ensuring better alignment and realism. To further handle the spatial ambiguity during denoising, we design the cross-modality condition module based on epipolar lines to adaptively learn the cross-modality local correspondence. Besides, X-DRIVE allows for controllable generation through multi-level input conditions, including text, bounding box, image, and point clouds. Extensive results demonstrate the high-fidelity synthetic results of X-DRIVE for both point clouds and multi-view images, adhering to input conditions while ensuring reliable cross-modality consistency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rujiao Long, Pengfei Wang, Zhibo Yang, Cong Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end visual information extraction (VIE) aims at integrating the hierarchical subtasks of VIE, including text spotting, word grouping, and entity labeling, into a unified framework. Dealing with the gaps among the three subtasks plays a pivotal role in designing an effective VIE model. OCR-dependent methods heavily rely on offline OCR engines and inevitably suffer from OCR errors, while OCR-free methods, particularly those employing a black-box model, might produce outputs that lack interpretability or contain hallucinated content. Inspired by CenterNet, DeepSolo, and ESP, we propose HIP, which models entities as HIerarchical Points to better conform to the hierarchical nature of the end-to-end VIE task. Specifically, such hierarchical points can be flexibly encoded and subsequently decoded into desired text transcripts, centers of various regions, and categories of entities. Furthermore, we devise corresponding hierarchical pre-training strategies, categorized as image reconstruction, layout learning, and language enhancement, to reinforce the cross-modality representation of the hierarchical encoders. Quantitative experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that HIP outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, while qualitative results show its excellent interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sonit Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have enabled researchers to explore tasks at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, such as image captioning, visual question answering, visual dialogue, and visual language navigation. Taking inspiration from image captioning, the task of radiology report generation aims at automatically generating radiology reports by having a comprehensive understanding of medical images. However, automatically generating radiology reports from medical images is a challenging task due to the complexity, diversity, and nature of medical images. In this paper, we outline the design of a robust radiology report generation system by integrating different modules and highlighting best practices drawing upon lessons from our past work and also from relevant studies in the literature. We also discuss the impact of integrating different components to form a single integrated system. We believe that these best practices, when implemented, could improve automatic radiology report generation, augment radiologists in decision making, and expedite diagnostic workflow, in turn improve healthcare and save human lives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Zhan, Yushu Wu, Yifan Gong, Zichong Meng, Zhenglun Kong, Changdi Yang, Geng Yuan, Pu Zhao, Wei Niu, Yanzhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid progress in artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC), especially with diffusion models, has significantly advanced development of high-quality video generation. However, current video diffusion models exhibit demanding computational requirements and high peak memory usage, especially for generating longer and higher-resolution videos. These limitations greatly hinder the practical application of video diffusion models on standard hardware platforms. To tackle this issue, we present a novel, training-free framework named Streamlined Inference, which leverages the temporal and spatial properties of video diffusion models. Our approach integrates three core components: Feature Slicer, Operator Grouping, and Step Rehash. Specifically, Feature Slicer effectively partitions input features into sub-features and Operator Grouping processes each sub-feature with a group of consecutive operators, resulting in significant memory reduction without sacrificing the quality or speed. Step Rehash further exploits the similarity between adjacent steps in diffusion, and accelerates inference through skipping unnecessary steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces peak memory and computational overhead, making it feasible to generate high-quality videos on a single consumer GPU (e.g., reducing peak memory of AnimateDiff from 42GB to 11GB, featuring faster inference on 2080Ti).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijie Hu, Guanyu Yang, Zhaorui Tan, Xiaowei Huang, Kaizhu Huang, Qiu-Feng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL) presents a challenging yet realistic scenario, which requires the model to continually learn new classes with limited labeled data (i.e., incremental sessions) while retaining knowledge of previously learned base classes (i.e., base sessions). Due to the limited data in incremental sessions, models are prone to overfitting new classes and suffering catastrophic forgetting of base classes. To tackle these issues, recent advancements resort to prototype-based approaches to constrain the base class distribution and learn discriminative representations of new classes. Despite the progress, the limited data issue still induces ill-divided feature space, leading the model to confuse the new class with old classes or fail to facilitate good separation among new classes. In this paper, we aim to mitigate these issues by directly constraining the span of each class distribution from a covariance perspective. In detail, we propose a simple yet effective covariance constraint loss to force the model to learn each class distribution with the same covariance matrix. In addition, we propose a perturbation approach to perturb the few-shot training samples in the feature space, which encourages the samples to be away from the weighted distribution of other classes. Regarding perturbed samples as new class data, the classifier is forced to establish explicit boundaries between each new class and the existing ones. Our approach is easy to integrate into existing FSCIL approaches to boost performance. Experiments on three benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance of FSCIL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonguk Cho, Seokeon Choi, Debasmit Das, Matthias Reisser, Taesup Kim, Sungrack Yun, Fatih Porikli</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have enabled the personalization of these models to generate custom images from textual prompts. This paper presents an efficient LoRA-based personalization approach for on-device subject-driven generation, where pre-trained diffusion models are fine-tuned with user-specific data on resource-constrained devices. Our method, termed Hollowed Net, enhances memory efficiency during fine-tuning by modifying the architecture of a diffusion U-Net to temporarily remove a fraction of its deep layers, creating a hollowed structure. This approach directly addresses on-device memory constraints and substantially reduces GPU memory requirements for training, in contrast to previous methods that primarily focus on minimizing training steps and reducing the number of parameters to update. Additionally, the personalized Hollowed Net can be transferred back into the original U-Net, enabling inference without additional memory overhead. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that our approach not only reduces training memory to levels as low as those required for inference but also maintains or improves personalization performance compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takeshi Noda, Chao Chen, Weiqi Zhang, Xinhai Liu, Yu-Shen Liu, Zhizhong Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing a continuous surface from a raw 3D point cloud is a challenging task. Recent methods usually train neural networks to overfit on single point clouds to infer signed distance functions (SDFs). However, neural networks tend to smooth local details due to the lack of ground truth signed distances or normals, which limits the performance of overfitting-based methods in reconstruction tasks. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel method, named MultiPull, to learn multi-scale implicit fields from raw point clouds by optimizing accurate SDFs from coarse to fine. We achieve this by mapping 3D query points into a set of frequency features, which makes it possible to leverage multi-level features during optimization. Meanwhile, we introduce optimization constraints from the perspective of spatial distance and normal consistency, which play a key role in point cloud reconstruction based on multi-scale optimization strategies. Our experiments on widely used object and scene benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in surface reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yitong Deng, Winnie Lin, Lingxiao Li, Dmitriy Smirnov, Ryan Burgert, Ning Yu, Vincent Dedun, Mohammad H. Taghavi</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting pretrained image-based diffusion models to generate temporally consistent videos has become an impactful generative modeling research direction. Training-free noise-space manipulation has proven to be an effective technique, where the challenge is to preserve the Gaussian white noise distribution while adding in temporal consistency. Recently, Chang et al. (2024) formulated this problem using an integral noise representation with distribution-preserving guarantees, and proposed an upsampling-based algorithm to compute it. However, while their mathematical formulation is advantageous, the algorithm incurs a high computational cost. Through analyzing the limiting-case behavior of their algorithm as the upsampling resolution goes to infinity, we develop an alternative algorithm that, by gathering increments of multiple Brownian bridges, achieves their infinite-resolution accuracy while simultaneously reducing the computational cost by orders of magnitude. We prove and experimentally validate our theoretical claims, and demonstrate our method's effectiveness in real-world applications. We further show that our method readily extends to the 3-dimensional space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengze Li, Jishuai He, Jieming Ma, Zhijing Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction is essential in robotic minimally invasive surgery, providing crucial spatial information that enhances surgical precision and outcomes. However, existing methods struggle to address the complex, temporally dynamic nature of endoscopic scenes. This paper presents ST-Endo4DGS, a novel framework that models the spatio-temporal volume of dynamic endoscopic scenes using unbiased 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) primitives, parameterized by anisotropic ellipses with flexible 4D rotations. This approach enables precise representation of deformable tissue dynamics, capturing intricate spatial and temporal correlations in real time. Additionally, we extend spherindrical harmonics to represent time-evolving appearance, achieving realistic adaptations to lighting and view changes. A new endoscopic normal alignment constraint (ENAC) further enhances geometric fidelity by aligning rendered normals with depth-derived geometry. Extensive evaluations show that ST-Endo4DGS outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and real-time performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art in dynamic scene reconstruction for endoscopic surgery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Tan, Yukang Zhang, Keke Han, Pingyang Dai, Yan Zhang, Yongjian Wu, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper makes a step towards modeling the modality discrepancy in the cross-spectral re-identification task. Based on the Lambertain model, we observe that the non-linear modality discrepancy mainly comes from diverse linear transformations acting on the surface of different materials. From this view, we unify all data augmentation strategies for cross-spectral re-identification by mimicking such local linear transformations and categorizing them into moderate transformation and radical transformation. By extending the observation, we propose a Random Linear Enhancement (RLE) strategy which includes Moderate Random Linear Enhancement (MRLE) and Radical Random Linear Enhancement (RRLE) to push the boundaries of both types of transformation. Moderate Random Linear Enhancement is designed to provide diverse image transformations that satisfy the original linear correlations under constrained conditions, whereas Radical Random Linear Enhancement seeks to generate local linear transformations directly without relying on external information. The experimental results not only demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of RLE but also confirm its great potential as a general-purpose data augmentation for cross-spectral re-identification.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wang Zhao, Jiachen Liu, Sheng Zhang, Yishu Li, Sili Chen, Sharon X Huang, Yong-Jin Liu, Hengkai Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a generalizable 3D plane detection and reconstruction framework named MonoPlane. Unlike previous robust estimator-based works (which require multiple images or RGB-D input) and learning-based works (which suffer from domain shift), MonoPlane combines the best of two worlds and establishes a plane reconstruction pipeline based on monocular geometric cues, resulting in accurate, robust and scalable 3D plane detection and reconstruction in the wild. Specifically, we first leverage large-scale pre-trained neural networks to obtain the depth and surface normals from a single image. These monocular geometric cues are then incorporated into a proximity-guided RANSAC framework to sequentially fit each plane instance. We exploit effective 3D point proximity and model such proximity via a graph within RANSAC to guide the plane fitting from noisy monocular depths, followed by image-level multi-plane joint optimization to improve the consistency among all plane instances. We further design a simple but effective pipeline to extend this single-view solution to sparse-view 3D plane reconstruction. Extensive experiments on a list of datasets demonstrate our superior zero-shot generalizability over baselines, achieving state-of-the-art plane reconstruction performance in a transferring setting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingming Long, Jie Zhang, Shiguang Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Face Anti-spoofing (FAS) models tend to make overly confident predictions even when encountering unfamiliar scenarios or unknown presentation attacks, which leads to serious potential risks. To solve this problem, we propose a Confidence Aware Face Anti-spoofing (CA-FAS) model, which is aware of its capability boundary, thus achieving reliable liveness detection within this boundary. To enable the CA-FAS to "know what it doesn't know", we propose to estimate its confidence during the prediction of each sample. Specifically, we build Gaussian distributions for both the live faces and the known attacks. The prediction confidence for each sample is subsequently assessed using the Mahalanobis distance between the sample and the Gaussians for the "known data". We further introduce the Mahalanobis distance-based triplet mining to optimize the parameters of both the model and the constructed Gaussians as a whole. Extensive experiments show that the proposed CA-FAS can effectively recognize samples with low prediction confidence and thus achieve much more reliable performance than other FAS models by filtering out samples that are beyond its reliable range.</p>

We introduce a theoretical mode-tracking process capable of pinpointing the exact mode of the denoising distribution, and we propose a practical high-probability sampler that consistently generates images of higher likelihood than usual samplers. Our empirical findings reveal the existence of significantly higher likelihood samples that typical samplers do not produce, often manifesting as cartoon-like drawings or blurry images depending on the noise level. Curiously, these patterns emerge in datasets devoid of such examples. We also present a novel approach to track sample likelihoods in diffusion SDEs, which remarkably incurs no additional computational cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the scale of vision Transformer-based models continuing to grow, finetuning these large-scale pretrained models for new tasks has become increasingly parameter-intensive. Visual prompt tuning is introduced as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method to this trend. Despite its successes, a notable research challenge persists within almost all PEFT approaches: significant performance degradation is observed when there is a substantial disparity between the datasets applied in pretraining and finetuning phases. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from human visual cognition, and propose the Visual Fourier Prompt Tuning (VFPT) method as a general and effective solution for adapting large-scale transformer-based models. Our approach innovatively incorporates the Fast Fourier Transform into prompt embeddings and harmoniously considers both spatial and frequency domain information. Apart from its inherent simplicity and intuitiveness, VFPT exhibits superior performance across all datasets, offering a general solution to dataset challenges, irrespective of data disparities. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines on two benchmarks, with low parameter usage (e.g., 0.57% of model parameters on VTAB-1k) and notable performance enhancements (e.g., 73.20% of mean accuracy on VTAB-1k).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aarjav Kavathia, Simeon Sayer</p>
<p>Abstract: As violent crimes continue to happen, it becomes necessary to have security cameras that can rapidly identify moments of violence with excellent accuracy. The purpose of this study is to identify how many frames should be analyzed at a time in order to optimize a violence detection model's accuracy as a parameter of the depth of a 3D convolutional network. Previous violence classification models have been created, but their application to live footage may be flawed. In this project, a convolutional neural network was created to analyze optical flow frames of each video. The number of frames analyzed at a time would vary with one, two, three, ten, and twenty frames, and each model would be trained for 20 epochs. The greatest validation accuracy was 94.87% and occurred with the model that analyzed three frames at a time. This means that machine learning models to detect violence may function better when analyzing three frames at a time for this dataset. The methodology used to identify the optimal number of frames to analyze at a time could be used in other applications of video classification, especially those of complex or abstract actions, such as violence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning models in medical contexts face challenges like data scarcity, inhomogeneity, and privacy concerns. This study focuses on improving ventricular segmentation in brain MRI images using synthetic data. We employed two latent diffusion models (LDMs): a mask generator trained using 10,000 masks, and a corresponding SPADE image generator optimized using 6,881 scans to create an MRI conditioned on a 3D brain mask. Conditioning the mask generator on ventricular volume in combination with classifier-free guidance enabled the control of the ventricular volume distribution of the generated synthetic images. Next, the performance of the synthetic data was tested using three nnU-Net segmentation models trained on a real, augmented and entirely synthetic data, respectively. The resulting models were tested on a completely independent hold-out dataset of patients with enlarged ventricles, with manual delineation of the ventricles used as ground truth. The model trained on real data showed a mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.09 \pm 12.18 mL in predicted ventricular volume, while the models trained on synthetic and augmented data showed MAEs of 7.52 \pm 4.81 mL and 6.23 \pm 4.33 mL, respectively. Both the synthetic and augmented model also outperformed the state-of-the-art model SynthSeg, which due to limited performance in cases of large ventricular volumes, showed an MAE of 7.73 \pm 12.12 mL with a factor of 3 higher standard deviation. The model trained on augmented data showed the highest Dice score of 0.892 \pm 0.05, slightly outperforming SynthSeg and on par with the model trained on real data. The synthetic model performed similar to SynthSeg. In summary, we provide evidence that guided synthesis of labeled brain MRI data using LDMs improves the segmentation of enlarged ventricles and outperforms existing state-of-the-art segmentation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach for segmenting pediatric brain tumors using a deep learning architecture, inspired by expert radiologists' segmentation strategies. Our model delineates four distinct tumor labels and is benchmarked on a held-out PED BraTS 2024 test set (i.e., pediatric brain tumor datasets introduced by BraTS). Furthermore, we evaluate our model's performance against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model using a new external dataset of 30 patients from CBTN (Children's Brain Tumor Network), labeled in accordance with the PED BraTS 2024 guidelines. We compare segmentation outcomes with the winning algorithm from the PED BraTS 2023 challenge as the SOTA model. Our proposed algorithm achieved an average Dice score of 0.642 and an HD95 of 73.0 mm on the CBTN test data, outperforming the SOTA model, which achieved a Dice score of 0.626 and an HD95 of 84.0 mm.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiang Wen, Bin Xie, Bin Duan, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Precise alignment of multi-modal images with inherent feature discrepancies poses a pivotal challenge in deformable image registration. Traditional learning-based approaches often consider registration networks as black boxes without interpretability. One core insight is that disentangling alignment features and non-alignment features across modalities bring benefits. Meanwhile, it is challenging for the prominent methods for image registration tasks, such as convolutional neural networks, to capture long-range dependencies by their local receptive fields. The methods often fail when the given image pair has a large misalignment due to the lack of effectively learning long-range dependencies and correspondence. In this paper, we propose MambaReg, a novel Mamba-based architecture that integrates Mamba's strong capability in capturing long sequences to address these challenges. With our proposed several sub-modules, MambaReg can effectively disentangle modality-independent features responsible for registration from modality-dependent, non-aligning features. By selectively attending to the relevant features, our network adeptly captures the correlation between multi-modal images, enabling focused deformation field prediction and precise image alignment. The Mamba-based architecture seamlessly integrates the local feature extraction power of convolutional layers with the long-range dependency modeling capabilities of Mamba. Experiments on public non-rigid RGB-IR image datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming existing approaches in terms of registration accuracy and deformation field smoothness.</p>

However, prevailing techniques often fall short in accurately extracting and utilizing road features, as well as in the implementation of view transformation. In response, we introduce HeightMapNet, a novel framework that establishes a dynamic relationship between image features and road surface height distributions. By integrating height priors, our approach refines the accuracy of Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features beyond conventional methods. HeightMapNet also introduces a foreground-background separation network that sharply distinguishes between critical road elements and extraneous background components, enabling precise focus on detailed road micro-features. Additionally, our method leverages multi-scale features within the BEV space, optimally utilizing spatial geometric information to boost model performance. HeightMapNet has shown exceptional results on the challenging nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets, outperforming several widely recognized approaches.

<p>Abstract: Floods cause extensive global damage annually, making effective monitoring essential. While satellite observations have proven invaluable for flood detection and tracking, comprehensive global flood datasets spanning extended time periods remain scarce. In this study, we introduce a novel deep learning flood detection model that leverages the cloud-penetrating capabilities of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery, enabling consistent flood extent mapping in any weather condition. By applying this model to nearly 10 years of SAR data, we create a unique, longitudinal global flood extent dataset with predictions unaffected by cloud coverage, offering comprehensive and consistent insights into historically flood-prone areas over the past decade. We use our model predictions to identify historically flood-prone areas in Ethiopia and demonstrate real-time disaster response capabilities during the May 2024 floods in Kenya. Additionally, our longitudinal analysis reveals potential increasing trends in global flood extent over time, although further validation is required to explore links to climate change. To maximize impact, we provide public access to both our model predictions and a code repository, empowering researchers and practitioners worldwide to advance flood monitoring and enhance disaster response strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Zhou, Peng Wang, Lei Zhang, Zhenghua Chen, Wei Wei, Chen Ding, Guosheng Lin, Yanning Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Meta-learning offers a promising avenue for few-shot learning (FSL), enabling models to glean a generalizable feature embedding through episodic training on synthetic FSL tasks in a source domain. Yet, in practical scenarios where the target task diverges from that in the source domain, meta-learning based method is susceptible to over-fitting. To overcome this, we introduce a novel framework, Meta-Exploiting Frequency Prior for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning, which is crafted to comprehensively exploit the cross-domain transferable image prior that each image can be decomposed into complementary low-frequency content details and high-frequency robust structural characteristics. Motivated by this insight, we propose to decompose each query image into its high-frequency and low-frequency components, and parallel incorporate them into the feature embedding network to enhance the final category prediction. More importantly, we introduce a feature reconstruction prior and a prediction consistency prior to separately encourage the consistency of the intermediate feature as well as the final category prediction between the original query image and its decomposed frequency components. This allows for collectively guiding the network's meta-learning process with the aim of learning generalizable image feature embeddings, while not introducing any extra computational cost in the inference phase. Our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results on multiple cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miso Lee, Jihwan Kim, Jae-Pil Heo</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-scene absolute pose regression addresses the demand for fast and memory-efficient camera pose estimation across various real-world environments. Nowadays, transformer-based model has been devised to regress the camera pose directly in multi-scenes. Despite its potential, transformer encoders are underutilized due to the collapsed self-attention map, having low representation capacity. This work highlights the problem and investigates it from a new perspective: distortion of query-key embedding space. Based on the statistical analysis, we reveal that queries and keys are mapped in completely different spaces while only a few keys are blended into the query region. This leads to the collapse of the self-attention map as all queries are considered similar to those few keys. Therefore, we propose simple but effective solutions to activate self-attention. Concretely, we present an auxiliary loss that aligns queries and keys, preventing the distortion of query-key space and encouraging the model to find global relations by self-attention. In addition, the fixed sinusoidal positional encoding is adopted instead of undertrained learnable one to reflect appropriate positional clues into the inputs of self-attention. As a result, our approach resolves the aforementioned problem effectively, thus outperforming existing methods in both outdoor and indoor scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Wang, Chengcheng Chen, Hongyu Chen, Yugang Chang, Weiming Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Current visual question answering (VQA) tasks often require constructing multimodal datasets and fine-tuning visual language models, which demands significant time and resources. This has greatly hindered the application of VQA to downstream tasks, such as ship information analysis based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. To address this challenge, this letter proposes a novel VQA approach that integrates object detection networks with visual language models, specifically designed for analyzing ships in SAR images. This integration aims to enhance the capabilities of VQA systems, focusing on aspects such as ship location, density, and size analysis, as well as risk behavior detection. Initially, we conducted baseline experiments using YOLO networks on two representative SAR ship detection datasets, SSDD and HRSID, to assess each model's performance in terms of detection accuracy. Based on these results, we selected the optimal model, YOLOv8n, as the most suitable detection network for this task. Subsequently, leveraging the vision-language model Qwen2-VL, we designed and implemented a VQA task specifically for SAR scenes. This task employs the ship location and size information output by the detection network to generate multi-turn dialogues and scene descriptions for SAR imagery. Experimental results indicate that this method not only enables fundamental SAR scene question-answering without the need for additional datasets or fine-tuning but also dynamically adapts to complex, multi-turn dialogue requirements, demonstrating robust semantic understanding and adaptability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirui Wang, Xinran Zhao, Simon Stepputtis, Woojun Kim, Tongshuang Wu, Katia Sycara, Yaqi Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and predicting human actions has been a long-standing challenge and is a crucial measure of perception in robotics AI. While significant progress has been made in anticipating the future actions of individual agents, prior work has largely overlooked a key aspect of real-world human activity -- interactions. To address this gap in human-like forecasting within multi-agent environments, we present the Hierarchical Memory-Aware Transformer (HiMemFormer), a transformer-based model for online multi-agent action anticipation. HiMemFormer integrates and distributes global memory that captures joint historical information across all agents through a transformer framework, with a hierarchical local memory decoder that interprets agent-specific features based on these global representations using a coarse-to-fine strategy. In contrast to previous approaches, HiMemFormer uniquely hierarchically applies the global context with agent-specific preferences to avoid noisy or redundant information in multi-agent action anticipation. Extensive experiments on various multi-agent scenarios demonstrate the significant performance of HiMemFormer, compared with other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Bai, Hong Song, Yucong Lin, Tianyu Fu, Deqiang Xiao, Danni Ai, Jingfan Fan, Jian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance in many individual tasks, deep neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning from continuous data streams in real-world scenarios. Current Non-Exemplar Class-Incremental Learning (NECIL) methods mitigate forgetting by storing a single prototype per class, which serves to inject previous information when sequentially learning new classes. However, these stored prototypes or their augmented variants often fail to simultaneously capture spatial distribution diversity and precision needed for representing old classes. Moreover, as the model acquires new knowledge, these prototypes gradually become outdated, making them less effective. To overcome these limitations, we propose a more efficient NECIL method that replaces prototypes with synthesized retrospective features for old classes. Specifically, we model each old class's feature space using a multivariate Gaussian distribution and generate deep representations by sampling from high-likelihood regions. Additionally, we introduce a similarity-based feature compensation mechanism that integrates generated old class features with similar new class features to synthesize robust retrospective representations. These retrospective features are then incorporated into our incremental learning framework to preserve the decision boundaries of previous classes while learning new ones. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-Subset demonstrate that our method significantly improves the efficiency of non-exemplar class-incremental learning and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01469">Exploring PCA-based feature representations of image pixels via CNN to enhance food image segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: For open vocabulary recognition of ingredients in food images, segmenting the ingredients is a crucial step. This paper proposes a novel approach that explores PCA-based feature representations of image pixels using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance segmentation. An internal clustering metric based on the silhouette score is defined to evaluate the clustering quality of various pixel-level feature representations generated by different feature maps derived from various CNN backbones. Using this metric, the paper explores optimal feature representation selection and suitable clustering methods for ingredient segmentation. Additionally, it is found that principal component (PC) maps derived from concatenations of backbone feature maps improve the clustering quality of pixel-level feature representations, resulting in stable segmentation outcomes. Notably, the number of selected eigenvalues can be used as the number of clusters to achieve good segmentation results. The proposed method performs well on the ingredient-labeled dataset FoodSeg103, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score of 0.5423. Importantly, the proposed method is unsupervised, and pixel-level feature representations from backbones are not fine-tuned on specific datasets. This demonstrates the flexibility, generalizability, and interpretability of the proposed method, while reducing the need for extensive labeled datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zian Qian, Chenyang Qi, Ka Lung Law, Hao Fu, Chenyang Lei, Qifeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Different camera sensors have different noise patterns, and thus an image denoising model trained on one sensor often does not generalize well to a different sensor. One plausible solution is to collect a large dataset for each sensor for training or fine-tuning, which is inevitably time-consuming. To address this cross-domain challenge, we present a novel adaptive domain learning (ADL) scheme for cross-domain RAW image denoising by utilizing existing data from different sensors (source domain) plus a small amount of data from the new sensor (target domain). The ADL training scheme automatically removes the data in the source domain that are harmful to fine-tuning a model for the target domain (some data are harmful as adding them during training lowers the performance due to domain gaps). Also, we introduce a modulation module to adopt sensor-specific information (sensor type and ISO) to understand input data for image denoising. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets with various smartphone and DSLR cameras, which show our proposed model outperforms prior work on cross-domain image denoising, given a small amount of image data from the target domain sensor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> MD Shaikh Rahman, Feiroz Humayara, Syed Maudud E Rabbi, Muhammad Mahbubur Rashid</p>
<p>Abstract: That datasets that are used in todays research are especially vast in the medical field. Different types of medical images such as X-rays, MRI, CT scan etc. take up large amounts of space. This volume of data introduces challenges like accessing and retrieving specific images due to the size of the database. An efficient image retrieval system is essential as the database continues to grow to save time and resources. In this paper, we propose an approach to medical image retrieval using DenseNet for feature extraction and use FAISS for similarity search. DenseNet is well-suited for feature extraction in complex medical images and FAISS enables efficient handling of high-dimensional data in large-scale datasets. Unlike existing methods focused solely on classification accuracy, our method prioritizes both retrieval speed and diagnostic relevance, addressing a critical gap in real-time case comparison for radiologists. We applied the classification of breast cancer images using the BIRADS system. We utilized DenseNet's powerful feature representation and FAISSs efficient indexing capabilities to achieve high precision and recall in retrieving relevant images for diagnosis. We experimented on a dataset of 2006 images from the Categorized Digital Database for Low Energy and Subtracted Contrast Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CDD-CESM) images available on The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Our method outperforms conventional retrieval techniques, achieving a precision of 80% at k=5 for BIRADS classification. The dataset includes annotated CESM images and medical reports, providing a comprehensive foundation for our research.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study presents an approach to developing a model for classifying abnormalities in video capsule endoscopy (VCE) frames. Given the challenges of data imbalance, we implemented a tiered augmentation strategy using the albumentations library to enhance minority class representation. Additionally, we addressed learning complexities by progressively structuring training tasks, allowing the model to differentiate between normal and abnormal cases and then gradually adding more specific classes based on data availability. Our pipeline, developed in PyTorch, employs a flexible architecture enabling seamless adjustments to classification complexity. We tested our approach using ResNet50 and a custom ViT-CNN hybrid model, with training conducted on the Kaggle platform. This work demonstrates a scalable approach to abnormality classification in VCE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Li, Jike Zhong, Tianle Chen, Yuxiang Lai, Konstantinos Psounis</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies on large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated promising skills in various domains including science and mathematics. However, their capability in more challenging and real-world related scenarios like engineering has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we propose EEE-Bench, a multimodal benchmark aimed at assessing LMMs' capabilities in solving practical engineering tasks, using electrical and electronics engineering (EEE) as the testbed. Our benchmark consists of 2860 carefully curated problems spanning 10 essential subdomains such as analog circuits, control systems, etc. Compared to benchmarks in other domains, engineering problems are intrinsically 1) more visually complex and versatile and 2) less deterministic in solutions. Successful solutions to these problems often demand more-than-usual rigorous integration of visual and textual information as models need to understand intricate images like abstract circuits and system diagrams while taking professional instructions, making them excellent candidates for LMM evaluations. Alongside EEE-Bench, we provide extensive quantitative evaluations and fine-grained analysis of 17 widely-used open and closed-sourced LLMs and LMMs. Our results demonstrate notable deficiencies of current foundation models in EEE, with an average performance ranging from 19.48% to 46.78%. Finally, we reveal and explore a critical shortcoming in LMMs which we term laziness: the tendency to take shortcuts by relying on the text while overlooking the visual context when reasoning for technical image problems. In summary, we believe EEE-Bench not only reveals some noteworthy limitations of LMMs but also provides a valuable resource for advancing research on their application in practical engineering tasks, driving future improvements in their capability to handle complex, real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation is a comprehensive task to segment an object referred by a textual query from an image. In nature, the level of difficulty in this task is affected by the existence of similar objects and the complexity of the referring expression. Recent RIS models still show a significant performance gap between easy and hard scenarios. We pose that the bottleneck exists in the data, and propose a simple but powerful data augmentation method, Negative-mined Mosaic Augmentation (NeMo). This method augments a training image into a mosaic with three other negative images carefully curated by a pretrained multimodal alignment model, e.g., CLIP, to make the sample more challenging. We discover that it is critical to properly adjust the difficulty level, neither too ambiguous nor too trivial. The augmented training data encourages the RIS model to recognize subtle differences and relationships between similar visual entities and to concretely understand the whole expression to locate the right target better. Our approach shows consistent improvements on various datasets and models, verified by extensive experiments.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01499">Polar R-CNN: End-to-End Lane Detection with Fewer Anchors</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengqi Wang, Junmin Liu, Xiangyong Cao, Zengjie Song, Kai Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Lane detection is a critical and challenging task in autonomous driving, particularly in real-world scenarios where traffic lanes can be slender, lengthy, and often obscured by other vehicles, complicating detection efforts. Existing anchor-based methods typically rely on prior lane anchors to extract features and subsequently refine the location and shape of lanes. While these methods achieve high performance, manually setting prior anchors is cumbersome, and ensuring sufficient coverage across diverse datasets often requires a large amount of dense anchors. Furthermore, the use of Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to eliminate redundant predictions complicates real-world deployment and may underperform in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose Polar R-CNN, an end-to-end anchor-based method for lane detection. By incorporating both local and global polar coordinate systems, Polar R-CNN facilitates flexible anchor proposals and significantly reduces the number of anchors required without compromising performance.Additionally, we introduce a triplet head with heuristic structure that supports NMS-free paradigm, enhancing deployment efficiency and performance in scenarios with dense lanes.Our method achieves competitive results on five popular lane detection benchmarks--Tusimple, CULane,LLAMAS, CurveLanes, and DL-Rai--while maintaining a lightweight design and straightforward structure.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthias Tangemann, Matthias K\"ummerer, Matthias Bethge</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans excel at detecting and segmenting moving objects according to the Gestalt principle of "common fate". Remarkably, previous works have shown that human perception generalizes this principle in a zero-shot fashion to unseen textures or random dots. In this work, we seek to better understand the computational basis for this capability by evaluating a broad range of optical flow models and a neuroscience inspired motion energy model for zero-shot figure-ground segmentation of random dot stimuli. Specifically, we use the extensively validated motion energy model proposed by Simoncelli and Heeger in 1998 which is fitted to neural recordings in cortex area MT. We find that a cross section of 40 deep optical flow models trained on different datasets struggle to estimate motion patterns in random dot videos, resulting in poor figure-ground segmentation performance. Conversely, the neuroscience-inspired model significantly outperforms all optical flow models on this task. For a direct comparison to human perception, we conduct a psychophysical study using a shape identification task as a proxy to measure human segmentation performance. All state-of-the-art optical flow models fall short of human performance, but only the motion energy model matches human capability. This neuroscience-inspired model successfully addresses the lack of human-like zero-shot generalization to random dot stimuli in current computer vision models, and thus establishes a compelling link between the Gestalt psychology of human object perception and cortical motion processing in the brain.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karel Kleisner, Jaroslav Trnka, Petr Turecek</p>
<p>Abstract: Landmark digitization is essential in geometric morphometrics, enabling the quantification of biological shapes, such as facial structures, for in-depth morphological analysis. Traditional landmarking, which identifies specific anatomical points, can be complemented by semilandmarks when precise locations are challenging to define. However, manual placement of numerous landmarks is time-consuming and prone to human error, leading to inconsistencies across studies. To address this, we introduce FaceDig, an AI-powered tool designed to automate landmark placement with human-level precision, focusing on anatomically sound facial points. FaceDig is open-source and integrates seamlessly with analytical platforms like R and Python. It was trained using one of the largest and most ethnically diverse face datasets, applying a landmark configuration optimized for 2D enface photographs. Our results demonstrate that FaceDig provides reliable landmark coordinates, comparable to those placed manually by experts. The tool's output is compatible with the widely-used TpsDig2 software, facilitating adoption and ensuring consistency across studies. Users are advised to work with standardized facial images and visually inspect the results for potential corrections. Despite the growing preference for 3D morphometrics, 2D facial photographs remain valuable due to their cultural and practical significance. Future enhancements to FaceDig will include support for profile views, further expanding its utility. By offering a standardized approach to landmark placement, FaceDig promotes reproducibility in facial morphology research and provides a robust alternative to existing 2D tools.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present InstantGeoAvatar, a method for efficient and effective learning from monocular video of detailed 3D geometry and appearance of animatable implicit human avatars. Our key observation is that the optimization of a hash grid encoding to represent a signed distance function (SDF) of the human subject is fraught with instabilities and bad local minima. We thus propose a principled geometry-aware SDF regularization scheme that seamlessly fits into the volume rendering pipeline and adds negligible computational overhead. Our regularization scheme significantly outperforms previous approaches for training SDFs on hash grids. We obtain competitive results in geometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis in as little as five minutes of training time, a significant reduction from the several hours required by previous work. InstantGeoAvatar represents a significant leap forward towards achieving interactive reconstruction of virtual avatars.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jitesh Joshi, Sos S. Agaian, Youngjun Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables non-invasive extraction of blood volume pulse signals through imaging, transforming spatial-temporal data into time series signals. Advances in end-to-end rPPG approaches have focused on this transformation where attention mechanisms are crucial for feature extraction. However, existing methods compute attention disjointly across spatial, temporal, and channel dimensions. Here, we propose the Factorized Self-Attention Module (FSAM), which jointly computes multidimensional attention from voxel embeddings using nonnegative matrix factorization. To demonstrate FSAM's effectiveness, we developed FactorizePhys, an end-to-end 3D-CNN architecture for estimating blood volume pulse signals from raw video frames. Our approach adeptly factorizes voxel embeddings to achieve comprehensive spatial, temporal, and channel attention, enhancing performance of generic signal extraction tasks. Furthermore, we deploy FSAM within an existing 2D-CNN-based rPPG architecture to illustrate its versatility. FSAM and FactorizePhys are thoroughly evaluated against state-of-the-art rPPG methods, each representing different types of architecture and attention mechanism. We perform ablation studies to investigate the architectural decisions and hyperparameters of FSAM. Experiments on four publicly available datasets and intuitive visualization of learned spatial-temporal features substantiate the effectiveness of FSAM and enhanced cross-dataset generalization in estimating rPPG signals, suggesting its broader potential as a multidimensional attention mechanism.

<p>Abstract: A plethora of text-guided image editing methods has recently been developed by leveraging the impressive capabilities of large-scale diffusion-based generative models especially Stable Diffusion. Despite the success of diffusion models in producing high-quality images, their application to small object generation has been limited due to difficulties in aligning cross-modal attention maps between text and these objects. Our approach offers a training-free method that significantly mitigates this alignment issue with local and global attention guidance , enhancing the model's ability to accurately render small objects in accordance with textual descriptions. We detail the methodology in our approach, emphasizing its divergence from traditional generation techniques and highlighting its advantages. What's more important is that we also provide~\textit{SOEBench} (Small Object Editing), a standardized benchmark for quantitatively evaluating text-based small object generation collected from \textit{MSCOCO} and \textit{OpenImage}. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing marked improvements in the fidelity and accuracy of small object generation compared to existing models. This advancement not only contributes to the field of AI and computer vision but also opens up new possibilities for applications in various industries where precise image generation is critical.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Geng, Jiaming Wang, Jun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has excelled in medical image classification, but its clinical application is limited by poor interpretability. Capsule networks, known for encoding hierarchical relationships and spatial features, show potential in addressing this issue. Nevertheless, traditional capsule networks often underperform due to their shallow structures, and deeper variants lack hierarchical architectures, thereby compromising interpretability. This paper introduces a novel capsule network, ParseCaps, which utilizes the sparse axial attention routing and parse convolutional capsule layer to form a parse-tree-like structure, enhancing both depth and interpretability. Firstly, sparse axial attention routing optimizes connections between child and parent capsules, as well as emphasizes the weight distribution across instantiation parameters of parent capsules. Secondly, the parse convolutional capsule layer generates capsule predictions aligning with the parse tree. Finally, based on the loss design that is effective whether concept ground truth exists or not, ParseCaps advances interpretability by associating each dimension of the global capsule with a comprehensible concept, thereby facilitating clinician trust and understanding of the model's classification results. Experimental results on CE-MRI, PH$^2$, and Derm7pt datasets show that ParseCaps not only outperforms other capsule network variants in classification accuracy, redundancy reduction and robustness, but also provides interpretable explanations, regardless of the availability of concept labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bing Cao, Xingxin Xu, Pengfei Zhu, Qilong Wang, Qinghua Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from multiple input images acquired through various sources to synthesize a new fused image. Existing methods usually employ distinct constraint designs tailored to specific scenes, forming fixed fusion paradigms. However, this data-driven fusion approach is challenging to deploy in varying scenarios, especially in rapidly changing environments. To address this issue, we propose a conditional controllable fusion (CCF) framework for general image fusion tasks without specific training. Due to the dynamic differences of different samples, our CCF employs specific fusion constraints for each individual in practice. Given the powerful generative capabilities of the denoising diffusion model, we first inject the specific constraints into the pre-trained DDPM as adaptive fusion conditions. The appropriate conditions are dynamically selected to ensure the fusion process remains responsive to the specific requirements in each reverse diffusion stage. Thus, CCF enables conditionally calibrating the fused images step by step. Extensive experiments validate our effectiveness in general fusion tasks across diverse scenarios against the competing methods without additional training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Wang, Yali Li, Hengshuang Zhao, Shengjin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The current trend in computer vision is to utilize one universal model to address all various tasks. Achieving such a universal model inevitably requires incorporating multi-domain data for joint training to learn across multiple problem scenarios. In point cloud based 3D object detection, however, such multi-domain joint training is highly challenging, because large domain gaps among point clouds from different datasets lead to the severe domain-interference problem. In this paper, we propose \textbf{OneDet3D}, a universal one-for-all model that addresses 3D detection across different domains, including diverse indoor and outdoor scenes, within the \emph{same} framework and only \emph{one} set of parameters. We propose the domain-aware partitioning in scatter and context, guided by a routing mechanism, to address the data interference issue, and further incorporate the text modality for a language-guided classification to unify the multi-dataset label spaces and mitigate the category interference issue. The fully sparse structure and anchor-free head further accommodate point clouds with significant scale disparities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong universal ability of OneDet3D to utilize only one trained model for addressing almost all 3D object detection tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Yang, Yanlong Zang, Ziwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) transfers a target clothing image to a reference person, where clothing fidelity is a key requirement for downstream e-commerce applications. However, existing VTON methods still fall short in high-fidelity try-on due to the conflict between the high diversity of dressing styles (\eg clothes occluded by pants or distorted by posture) and the limited paired data for training. In this work, we propose a novel framework \textbf{Boosted Virtual Try-on (BVTON)} to leverage the large-scale unpaired learning for high-fidelity try-on. Our key insight is that pseudo try-on pairs can be reliably constructed from vastly available fashion images. Specifically, \textbf{1)} we first propose a compositional canonicalizing flow that maps on-model clothes into pseudo in-shop clothes, dubbed canonical proxy. Each clothing part (sleeves, torso) is reversely deformed into an in-shop-like shape to compositionally construct the canonical proxy. \textbf{2)} Next, we design a layered mask generation module that generates accurate semantic layout by training on canonical proxy. We replace the in-shop clothes used in conventional pipelines with the derived canonical proxy to boost the training process. \textbf{3)} Finally, we propose an unpaired try-on synthesizer by constructing pseudo training pairs with randomly misaligned on-model clothes, where intricate skin texture and clothes boundaries can be generated. Extensive experiments on high-resolution ($1024\times768$) datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Notably, BVTON shows great generalizability and scalability to various dressing styles and data sources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Lin, Danfeng Hong, Shuhang Ge, Chuyao Luo, Kai Jiang, Hao Jin, Congcong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote Sensing Image Captioning (RSIC) presents unique challenges and plays a critical role in applications. Traditional RSIC methods often struggle to produce rich and diverse descriptions. Recently, with advancements in VLMs, efforts have emerged to integrate these models into the remote sensing domain and to introduce descriptive datasets specifically designed to enhance VLM training. This paper proposes RS-MoE, a first Mixture of Expert based VLM specifically customized for remote sensing domain. Unlike traditional MoE models, the core of RS-MoE is the MoE Block, which incorporates a novel Instruction Router and multiple lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert models. The Instruction Router is designed to generate specific prompts tailored for each corresponding LLM, guiding them to focus on distinct aspects of the RSIC task. This design not only allows each expert LLM to concentrate on a specific subset of the task, thereby enhancing the specificity and accuracy of the generated captions, but also improves the scalability of the model by facilitating parallel processing of sub-tasks. Additionally, we present a two-stage training strategy for tuning our RS-MoE model to prevent performance degradation due to sparsity. We fine-tuned our model on the RSICap dataset using our proposed training strategy. Experimental results on the RSICap dataset, along with evaluations on other traditional datasets where no additional fine-tuning was applied, demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating precise and contextually relevant captions. Notably, our RS-MoE-1B variant achieves performance comparable to 13B VLMs, demonstrating the efficiency of our model design. Moreover, our model demonstrates promising generalization capabilities by consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA) task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiayang Xiao, Zhuoxuan Li, Haipeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current mainstream SAR image object detection methods still lack robustness when dealing with unknown objects in open environments. Open-set detection aims to enable detectors trained on a closed set to detect all known objects and identify unknown objects in open-set environments. The key challenges are how to improve the generalization to potential unknown objects and reduce the empirical classification risk of known categories under strong supervision. To address these challenges, a novel open-set aircraft detector for SAR images is proposed, named Open-Set Aircraft Detection (OSAD), which is equipped with three dedicated components: global context modeling (GCM), location quality-driven pseudo labeling generation (LPG), and prototype contrastive learning (PCL). GCM effectively enhances the network's representation of objects by attention maps which is formed through the capture of long sequential positional relationships. LPG leverages clues about object positions and shapes to optimize localization quality, avoiding overfitting to known category information and enhancing generalization to potential unknown objects. PCL employs prototype-based contrastive encoding loss to promote instance-level intra-class compactness and inter-class variance, aiming to minimize the overlap between known and unknown distributions and reduce the empirical classification risk of known categories. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively detect unknown objects and exhibit competitive performance without compromising closed-set performance. The highest absolute gain which ranges from 0 to 18.36% can be achieved on the average precision of unknown objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yean Cheng, Ziqi Cai, Ming Ding, Wendi Zheng, Shiyu Huang, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Boxin Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce DreamPolish, a text-to-3D generation model that excels in producing refined geometry and high-quality textures. In the geometry construction phase, our approach leverages multiple neural representations to enhance the stability of the synthesis process. Instead of relying solely on a view-conditioned diffusion prior in the novel sampled views, which often leads to undesired artifacts in the geometric surface, we incorporate an additional normal estimator to polish the geometry details, conditioned on viewpoints with varying field-of-views. We propose to add a surface polishing stage with only a few training steps, which can effectively refine the artifacts attributed to limited guidance from previous stages and produce 3D objects with more desirable geometry. The key topic of texture generation using pretrained text-to-image models is to find a suitable domain in the vast latent distribution of these models that contains photorealistic and consistent renderings. In the texture generation phase, we introduce a novel score distillation objective, namely domain score distillation (DSD), to guide neural representations toward such a domain. We draw inspiration from the classifier-free guidance (CFG) in textconditioned image generation tasks and show that CFG and variational distribution guidance represent distinct aspects in gradient guidance and are both imperative domains for the enhancement of texture quality. Extensive experiments show our proposed model can produce 3D assets with polished surfaces and photorealistic textures, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filipe R. Cordeiro, Gustavo Carneiro</p>
<p>Abstract: An important stage of most state-of-the-art (SOTA) noisy-label learning methods consists of a sample selection procedure that classifies samples from the noisy-label training set into noisy-label or clean-label subsets. The process of sample selection typically consists of one of the two approaches: loss-based sampling, where high-loss samples are considered to have noisy labels, or feature-based sampling, where samples from the same class tend to cluster together in the feature space and noisy-label samples are identified as anomalies within those clusters. Empirically, loss-based sampling is robust to a wide range of noise rates, while feature-based sampling tends to work effectively in particular scenarios, e.g., the filtering of noisy instances via their eigenvectors (FINE) sampling exhibits greater robustness in scenarios with low noise rates, and the K nearest neighbor (KNN) sampling mitigates better high noise-rate problems. This paper introduces the Adaptive Nearest Neighbors and Eigenvector-based (ANNE) sample selection methodology, a novel approach that integrates loss-based sampling with the feature-based sampling methods FINE and Adaptive KNN to optimize performance across a wide range of noise rate scenarios. ANNE achieves this integration by first partitioning the training set into high-loss and low-loss sub-groups using loss-based sampling. Subsequently, within the low-loss subset, sample selection is performed using FINE, while the high-loss subset employs Adaptive KNN for effective sample selection. We integrate ANNE into the noisy-label learning state of the art (SOTA) method SSR+, and test it on CIFAR-10/-100 (with symmetric, asymmetric and instance-dependent noise), Webvision and ANIMAL-10, where our method shows better accuracy than the SOTA in most experiments, with a competitive training time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Zhang, Jin Gao, Fudong Ge, Guan Luo, Bing Li, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Haibin Ling, Weiming Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Bird's-eye-view (BEV) map layout estimation requires an accurate and full understanding of the semantics for the environmental elements around the ego car to make the results coherent and realistic. Due to the challenges posed by occlusion, unfavourable imaging conditions and low resolution, \emph{generating} the BEV semantic maps corresponding to corrupted or invalid areas in the perspective view (PV) is appealing very recently. \emph{The question is how to align the PV features with the generative models to facilitate the map estimation}. In this paper, we propose to utilize a generative model similar to the Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) to acquire prior knowledge for the high-level BEV semantics in the tokenized discrete space. Thanks to the obtained BEV tokens accompanied with a codebook embedding encapsulating the semantics for different BEV elements in the groundtruth maps, we are able to directly align the sparse backbone image features with the obtained BEV tokens from the discrete representation learning based on a specialized token decoder module, and finally generate high-quality BEV maps with the BEV codebook embedding serving as a bridge between PV and BEV. We evaluate the BEV map layout estimation performance of our model, termed VQ-Map, on both the nuScenes and Argoverse benchmarks, achieving 62.2/47.6 mean IoU for surround-view/monocular evaluation on nuScenes, as well as 73.4 IoU for monocular evaluation on Argoverse, which all set a new record for this map layout estimation task.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01624">PreCM: The Padding-based Rotation Equivariant Convolution Mode for Semantic Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Xu, Huazhen Liu, Huilin Xiong, Wenxian Yu, Tao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation is an important branch of image processing and computer vision. With the popularity of deep learning, various deep semantic segmentation networks have been proposed for pixel-level classification and segmentation tasks. However, the imaging angles are often arbitrary in real world, such as water body images in remote sensing, and capillary and polyp images in medical field, and we usually cannot obtain prior orientation information to guide these networks to extract more effective features. Additionally, learning the features of objects with multiple orientation information is also challenging, as most CNN-based semantic segmentation networks do not have rotation equivariance to resist the disturbance from orientation information. To address the same, in this paper, we first establish a universal convolution-group framework to more fully utilize the orientation information and make the networks rotation equivariant. Then, we mathematically construct the padding-based rotation equivariant convolution mode (PreCM), which can be used not only for multi-scale images and convolution kernels, but also as a replacement component to replace multiple convolutions, like dilated convolution, transposed convolution, variable stride convolution, etc. In order to verify the realization of rotation equivariance, a new evaluation metric named rotation difference (RD) is finally proposed. The experiments carried out on the datesets Satellite Images of Water Bodies, DRIVE and Floodnet show that the PreCM-based networks can achieve better segmentation performance than the original and data augmentation-based networks. In terms of the average RD value, the former is 0% and the latter two are respectively 7.0503% and 3.2606%. Last but not least, PreCM also effectively enhances the robustness of networks to rotation perturbations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenbin Wang, Lei Zhang, Lituan Wang, Minjuan Zhu, Zhenwei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical video generation models are expected to have a profound impact on the healthcare industry, including but not limited to medical education and training, surgical planning, and simulation. Current video diffusion models typically build on image diffusion architecture by incorporating temporal operations (such as 3D convolution and temporal attention). Although this approach is effective, its oversimplification limits spatio-temporal performance and consumes substantial computational resources. To counter this, we propose Medical Simulation Video Generator (MedSora), which incorporates three key elements: i) a video diffusion framework integrates the advantages of attention and Mamba, balancing low computational load with high-quality video generation, ii) an optical flow representation alignment method that implicitly enhances attention to inter-frame pixels, and iii) a video variational autoencoder (VAE) with frequency compensation addresses the information loss of medical features that occurs when transforming pixel space into latent features and then back to pixel frames. Extensive experiments and applications demonstrate that MedSora exhibits superior visual quality in generating medical videos, outperforming the most advanced baseline methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaole Tang, Xiang Gu, Xiaoyi He, Xin Hu, Jian Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: All-in-one image restoration has emerged as a practical and promising low-level vision task for real-world applications. In this context, the key issue lies in how to deal with different types of degraded images simultaneously. In this work, we present a Degradation-Aware Residual-Conditioned Optimal Transport (DA-RCOT) approach that models (all-in-one) image restoration as an optimal transport (OT) problem for unpaired and paired settings, introducing the transport residual as a degradation-specific cue for both the transport cost and the transport map. Specifically, we formalize image restoration with a residual-guided OT objective by exploiting the degradation-specific patterns of the Fourier residual in the transport cost. More crucially, we design the transport map for restoration as a two-pass DA-RCOT map, in which the transport residual is computed in the first pass and then encoded as multi-scale residual embeddings to condition the second-pass restoration. This conditioning process injects intrinsic degradation knowledge (e.g., degradation type and level) and structural information from the multi-scale residual embeddings into the OT map, which thereby can dynamically adjust its behaviors for all-in-one restoration. Extensive experiments across five degradations demonstrate the favorable performance of DA-RCOT as compared to state-of-the-art methods, in terms of distortion measures, perceptual quality, and image structure preservation. Notably, DA-RCOT delivers superior adaptability to real-world scenarios even with multiple degradations and shows distinctive robustness to both degradation levels and the number of degradations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle (AV) perception systems require more than simply seeing, via e.g., object detection or scene segmentation. They need a holistic understanding of what is happening within the scene for safe interaction with other road users. Few datasets exist for the purpose of developing and training algorithms to comprehend the actions of other road users. This paper presents ROAD-Waymo, an extensive dataset for the development and benchmarking of techniques for agent, action, location and event detection in road scenes, provided as a layer upon the (US) Waymo Open dataset. Considerably larger and more challenging than any existing dataset (and encompassing multiple cities), it comes with 198k annotated video frames, 54k agent tubes, 3.9M bounding boxes and a total of 12.4M labels. The integrity of the dataset has been confirmed and enhanced via a novel annotation pipeline designed for automatically identifying violations of requirements specifically designed for this dataset. As ROAD-Waymo is compatible with the original (UK) ROAD dataset, it provides the opportunity to tackle domain adaptation between real-world road scenarios in different countries within a novel benchmark: ROAD++.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper we reexamine the process through which a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) can be trained to produce novel LiDAR views of a scene. Unlike image applications where camera pixels integrate light over time, LiDAR pulses arrive at specific times. As such, multiple LiDAR returns are possible for any given detector and the classification of these returns is inherently probabilistic. Applying a traditional NeRF training routine can result in the network learning phantom surfaces in free space between conflicting range measurements, similar to how floater aberrations may be produced by an image model. We show that by formulating loss as an integral of probability (rather than as an integral of optical density) the network can learn multiple peaks for a given ray, allowing the sampling of first, nth, or strongest returns from a single output channel.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Madalena Caldeira, Plinio Moreno</p>
<p>Abstract: The Next Best View problem is a computer vision problem widely studied in robotics. To solve it, several methodologies have been proposed over the years. Some, more recently, propose the use of deep learning models. Predictions obtained with the help of deep learning models naturally have some uncertainty associated with them. Despite this, the standard models do not allow for their quantification. However, Bayesian estimation theory contributed to the demonstration that dropout layers allow to estimate prediction uncertainty in neural networks.
  This work adapts the point-net-based neural network for Next-Best-View (PC-NBV). It incorporates dropout layers into the model's architecture, thus allowing the computation of the uncertainty estimate associated with its predictions. The aim of the work is to improve the network's accuracy in correctly predicting the next best viewpoint, proposing a way to make the 3D reconstruction process more efficient.
  Two uncertainty measurements capable of reflecting the prediction's error and accuracy, respectively, were obtained. These enabled the reduction of the model's error and the increase in its accuracy from 30\% to 80\% by identifying and disregarding predictions with high values of uncertainty. Another method that directly uses these uncertainty metrics to improve the final prediction was also proposed. However, it showed very residual improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanyi Zhang, Binglin Qiu, Qi Jia, Yu Liu, Ran He</p>
<p>Abstract: Most incremental learners excessively prioritize coarse classes of objects while neglecting various kinds of states (e.g. color and material) attached to the objects. As a result, they are limited in the ability to reason fine-grained compositionality of state-object pairs. To remedy this limitation, we propose a novel task called Compositional Incremental Learning (composition-IL), enabling the model to recognize state-object compositions as a whole in an incremental learning fashion. Since the lack of suitable benchmarks, we re-organize two existing datasets and make them tailored for composition-IL. Then, we propose a prompt-based Composition Incremental Learner (CompILer), to overcome the ambiguous composition boundary problem which challenges composition-IL largely. Specifically, we exploit multi-pool prompt learning, which is regularized by inter-pool prompt discrepancy and intra-pool prompt diversity. Besides, we devise object-injected state prompting by using object prompts to guide the selection of state prompts. Furthermore, we fuse the selected prompts by a generalized-mean strategy, to eliminate irrelevant information learned in the prompts. Extensive experiments on two datasets exhibit state-of-the-art performance achieved by CompILer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Xu, Huazhen Liu, Feiming Wei, Huilin Xiong, Wenxian Yu, Tao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud is often regarded as a discrete sampling of Riemannian manifold and plays a pivotal role in the 3D image interpretation. Particularly, rotation perturbation, an unexpected small change in rotation caused by various factors (like equipment offset, system instability, measurement errors and so on), can easily lead to the inferior results in point cloud learning tasks. However, classical point cloud learning methods are sensitive to rotation perturbation, and the existing networks with rotation robustness also have much room for improvements in terms of performance and noise tolerance. Given these, this paper remodels the point cloud from the perspective of manifold as well as designs a manifold distillation method to achieve the robustness of rotation perturbation without any coordinate transformation. In brief, during the training phase, we introduce a teacher network to learn the rotation robustness information and transfer this information to the student network through online distillation. In the inference phase, the student network directly utilizes the original 3D coordinate information to achieve the robustness of rotation perturbation. Experiments carried out on four different datasets verify the effectiveness of our method. Averagely, on the Modelnet40 and ScanobjectNN classification datasets with random rotation perturbations, our classification accuracy has respectively improved by 4.92% and 4.41%, compared to popular rotation-robust networks; on the ShapeNet and S3DIS segmentation datasets, compared to the rotation-robust networks, the improvements of mIoU are 7.36% and 4.82%, respectively. Besides, from the experimental results, the proposed algorithm also shows excellent performance in resisting noise and outliers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Geometric estimation is required for scene understanding and analysis in panoramic 360{\deg} images. Current methods usually predict a single feature, such as depth or surface normal. These methods can lack robustness, especially when dealing with intricate textures or complex object surfaces. We introduce a novel multi-task learning (MTL) network that simultaneously estimates depth and surface normals from 360{\deg} images. Our first innovation is our MTL architecture, which enhances predictions for both tasks by integrating geometric information from depth and surface normal estimation, enabling a deeper understanding of 3D scene structure. Another innovation is our fusion module, which bridges the two tasks, allowing the network to learn shared representations that improve accuracy and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that our MTL architecture significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both depth and surface normal estimation, showing superior performance in complex and diverse scenes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Sun, Fan Yu, Shaoxiang Chen, Yu Zhang, Junwei Huang, Chenhui Li, Yang Li, Changbo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual object tracking aims to locate a targeted object in a video sequence based on an initial bounding box. Recently, Vision-Language~(VL) trackers have proposed to utilize additional natural language descriptions to enhance versatility in various applications. However, VL trackers are still inferior to State-of-The-Art (SoTA) visual trackers in terms of tracking performance. We found that this inferiority primarily results from their heavy reliance on manual textual annotations, which include the frequent provision of ambiguous language descriptions. In this paper, we propose ChatTracker to leverage the wealth of world knowledge in the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate high-quality language descriptions and enhance tracking performance. To this end, we propose a novel reflection-based prompt optimization module to iteratively refine the ambiguous and inaccurate descriptions of the target with tracking feedback. To further utilize semantic information produced by MLLM, a simple yet effective VL tracking framework is proposed and can be easily integrated as a plug-and-play module to boost the performance of both VL and visual trackers. Experimental results show that our proposed ChatTracker achieves a performance comparable to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thai Vu Nguyen, Long Bao Le, Anderson Avila</p>
<p>Abstract: In Federated Learning (FL), training is conducted on client devices, typically with limited computational resources and storage capacity. To address these constraints, we propose an automatic pruning scheme tailored for FL systems. Our solution improves computation efficiency on client devices, while minimizing communication costs. One of the challenges of tuning pruning hyper-parameters in FL systems is the restricted access to local data. Thus, we introduce an automatic pruning paradigm that dynamically determines pruning boundaries. Additionally, we utilized a structured pruning algorithm optimized for mobile devices that lack hardware support for sparse computations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving accuracy comparable to existing methods. Our method notably reduces the number of parameters by 89% and FLOPS by 90%, with minimal impact on the accuracy of the FEMNIST and CelebFaces datasets. Furthermore, our pruning method decreases communication overhead by up to 5x and halves inference time when deployed on Android devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuanchuan Wang, Ahmad Sufril Azlan Mohmamed, Xiao Yang, Xiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents ARN-LSTM, a novel multi-stream action recognition model designed to address the challenge of simultaneously capturing spatial motion and temporal dynamics in action sequences. Traditional methods often focus solely on spatial or temporal features, limiting their ability to comprehend complex human activities fully. Our proposed model integrates joint, motion, and temporal information through a multi-stream fusion architecture. Specifically, it comprises a joint stream for extracting skeleton features, a temporal stream for capturing dynamic temporal features, and an ARN-LSTM block that utilizes Time-Distributed Long Short-Term Memory (TD-LSTM) layers followed by an Attention Relation Network (ARN) to model temporal relations. The outputs from these streams are fused in a fully connected layer to provide the final action prediction. Evaluations on the NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving effective performance, particularly in group activity recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueyan Niu, Cristina Savin, Eero P. Simoncelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Prediction is a fundamental capability of all living organisms, and has been proposed as an objective for learning sensory representations. Recent work demonstrates that in primate visual systems, prediction is facilitated by neural representations that follow straighter temporal trajectories than their initial photoreceptor encoding, which allows for prediction by linear extrapolation. Inspired by these experimental findings, we develop a self-supervised learning (SSL) objective that explicitly quantifies and promotes straightening. We demonstrate the power of this objective in training deep feedforward neural networks on smoothly-rendered synthetic image sequences that mimic commonly-occurring properties of natural videos. The learned model contains neural embeddings that are predictive, but also factorize the geometric, photometric, and semantic attributes of objects. The representations also prove more robust to noise and adversarial attacks compared to previous SSL methods that optimize for invariance to random augmentations. Moreover, these beneficial properties can be transferred to other training procedures by using the straightening objective as a regularizer, suggesting a broader utility for straightening as a principle for robust unsupervised learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, transformer-based techniques incorporating superpoints have become prevalent in 3D instance segmentation. However, they often encounter an over-segmentation problem, especially noticeable with large objects. Additionally, unreliable mask predictions stemming from superpoint mask prediction further compound this issue. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called MSTA3D.

Furthermore, MSTA3D integrates a box query with a box regularizer, offering a complementary spatial constraint alongside semantic queries. Experimental evaluations on ScanNetV2, ScanNet200 and S3DIS datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art 3D instance segmentation methods.</p>

In response to this issue, the Aerial Image Water Resource (AIWR) dataset was developed, comprising 800 aerial images focused on natural and artificial water bodies in this region. The dataset was created using Bing Maps and follows the standards of the Fundamental Geographic Data Set (FGDS). It includes ground truth annotations validated by experts in remote sensing, making it an invaluable resource for researchers in geoinformatics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. The AIWR dataset presents considerable challenges, such as segmentation due to variations in the size, color, shape, and similarity of water bodies, which often resemble other land use categories.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01800">Expanding Sparse Tuning for Low Memory Usage</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shufan Shen, Junshu Sun, Xiangyang Ji, Qingming Huang, Shuhui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is an effective method for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks by tuning a small subset of parameters. Among PEFT methods, sparse tuning achieves superior performance by only adjusting the weights most relevant to downstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the whole weight matrix. However, this performance improvement has been accompanied by increases in memory usage, which stems from two factors, i.e., the storage of the whole weight matrix as learnable parameters in the optimizer and the additional storage of tunable weight indexes. In this paper, we propose a method named SNELL (Sparse tuning with kerNELized LoRA) for sparse tuning with low memory usage. To achieve low memory usage, SNELL decomposes the tunable matrix for sparsification into two learnable low-rank matrices, saving from the costly storage of the whole original matrix. A competition-based sparsification mechanism is further proposed to avoid the storage of tunable weight indexes. To maintain the effectiveness of sparse tuning with low-rank matrices, we extend the low-rank decomposition by applying nonlinear kernel functions to the whole-matrix merging. Consequently, we gain an increase in the rank of the merged matrix, enhancing the ability of SNELL in adapting the pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple downstream tasks show that SNELL achieves state-of-the-art performance with low memory usage, endowing PEFT with sparse tuning to large-scale models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongwon Kim, Seoyeon Kim, Suha Kwak</p>
<p>Abstract: Object-centric learning (OCL) aims to learn representations of individual objects within visual scenes without manual supervision, facilitating efficient and effective visual reasoning. Traditional OCL methods primarily employ bottom-up approaches that aggregate homogeneous visual features to represent objects. However, in complex visual environments, these methods often fall short due to the heterogeneous nature of visual features within an object. To address this, we propose a novel OCL framework incorporating a top-down pathway. This pathway first bootstraps the semantics of individual objects and then modulates the model to prioritize features relevant to these semantics. By dynamically modulating the model based on its own output, our top-down pathway enhances the representational quality of objects. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple synthetic and real-world object-discovery benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Gao, Fangxu Xing, Daniel Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation models, like mask2former, often demand a substantial amount of manually annotated data, which is time-consuming and inefficient to acquire. Leveraging state-of-the-art text-to-image models like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion has emerged as an effective strategy for automatically generating synthetic data instead of human annotations. However, prior approaches have been constrained to synthesizing single-instance images due to the instability inherent in generating multiple instances with Stable Diffusion. To expand the domains and diversity of synthetic datasets, this paper introduces a novel paradigm named DiffuMask-Editor, which combines the Diffusion Model for Segmentation with Image Editing. By integrating multiple objects into images using Text2Image models, our method facilitates the creation of more realistic datasets that closely resemble open-world settings while simultaneously generating accurate masks. Our approach significantly reduces the laborious effort associated with manual annotation while ensuring precise mask generation. Experimental results demonstrate that synthetic data generated by DiffuMask-Editor enable segmentation methods to achieve superior performance compared to real data. Particularly in zero-shot backgrounds, DiffuMask-Editor achieves new state-of-the-art results on Unseen classes of VOC 2012. The code and models will be publicly available soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi He, Feiyu Du, Xiaohan Yu, Yang Zhao, Tao Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: The scarcity of labelled data is specifically an urgent challenge in the field of quantum machine learning (QML). Two transfer fusion frameworks are proposed in this paper to predict the labels of a target domain data by aligning its distribution to a different but related labelled source domain on quantum devices. The frameworks fuses the quantum data from two different, but related domains through a quantum information infusion channel. The predicting tasks in the target domain can be achieved with quantum advantages by post-processing quantum measurement results. One framework, the quantum basic linear algebra subroutines (QBLAS) based implementation, can theoretically achieve the procedure of transfer fusion with quadratic speedup on a universal quantum computer. In addition, the other framework, a hardware-scalable architecture, is implemented on the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices through a variational hybrid quantum-classical procedure. Numerical experiments on the synthetic and handwritten digits datasets demonstrate that the variatioinal transfer fusion (TF) framework can reach state-of-the-art (SOTA) quantum DA method performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have greatly improved their abilities in image understanding. However, these models often struggle with grasping pixel-level semantic details, e.g., the keypoints of an object. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel challenge of Semantic Keypoint Comprehension, which aims to comprehend keypoints across different task scenarios, including keypoint semantic understanding, visual prompt-based keypoint detection, and textual prompt-based keypoint detection. Moreover, we introduce KptLLM, a unified multimodal model that utilizes an identify-then-detect strategy to effectively address these challenges. KptLLM underscores the initial discernment of semantics in keypoints, followed by the precise determination of their positions through a chain-of-thought process. With several carefully designed modules, KptLLM adeptly handles various modality inputs, facilitating the interpretation of both semantic contents and keypoint locations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate KptLLM's superiority in various keypoint detection benchmarks and its unique semantic capabilities in interpreting keypoints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaochao Song, Chong Cheng, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel method for efficient and effective 3D surface reconstruction in open scenes. Existing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based works typically require extensive training and rendering time due to the adopted implicit representations. In contrast, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) uses an explicit and discrete representation, hence the reconstructed surface is built by the huge number of Gaussian primitives, which leads to excessive memory consumption and rough surface details in sparse Gaussian areas. To address these issues, we propose Gaussian Voxel Kernel Functions (GVKF), which establish a continuous scene representation based on discrete 3DGS through kernel regression. The GVKF integrates fast 3DGS rasterization and highly effective scene implicit representations, achieving high-fidelity open scene surface reconstruction. Experiments on challenging scene datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed GVKF, featuring with high reconstruction quality, real-time rendering speed, significant savings in storage and training memory consumption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kezheng Xiong, Haoen Xiang, Qingshan Xu, Chenglu Wen, Siqi Shen, Jonathan Li, Cheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud registration, a fundamental task in 3D vision, has achieved remarkable success with learning-based methods in outdoor environments. Unsupervised outdoor point cloud registration methods have recently emerged to circumvent the need for costly pose annotations. However, they fail to establish reliable optimization objectives for unsupervised training, either relying on overly strong geometric assumptions, or suffering from poor-quality pseudo-labels due to inadequate integration of low-level geometric and high-level contextual information. We have observed that in the feature space, latent new inlier correspondences tend to cluster around respective positive anchors that summarize features of existing inliers. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel unsupervised registration method termed INTEGER to incorporate high-level contextual information for reliable pseudo-label mining. Specifically, we propose the Feature-Geometry Coherence Mining module to dynamically adapt the teacher for each mini-batch of data during training and discover reliable pseudo-labels by considering both high-level feature representations and low-level geometric cues. Furthermore, we propose Anchor-Based Contrastive Learning to facilitate contrastive learning with anchors for a robust feature space. Lastly, we introduce a Mixed-Density Student to learn density-invariant features, addressing challenges related to density variation and low overlap in the outdoor scenario. Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our INTEGER achieves competitive performance in terms of accuracy and generalizability.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view stereo (MVS) framework that gets rid of the depth range prior. Unlike recent prior-free MVS methods that work in a pair-wise manner, our method simultaneously considers all the source images. Specifically, we introduce a Multi-view Disparity Attention (MDA) module to aggregate long-range context information within and across multi-view images. Considering the asymmetry of the epipolar disparity flow, the key to our method lies in accurately modeling multi-view geometric constraints. We integrate pose embedding to encapsulate information such as multi-view camera poses, providing implicit geometric constraints for multi-view disparity feature fusion dominated by attention. Additionally, we construct corresponding hidden states for each source image due to significant differences in the observation quality of the same pixel in the reference frame across multiple source frames. We explicitly estimate the quality of the current pixel corresponding to sampled points on the epipolar line of the source image and dynamically update hidden states through the uncertainty estimation module. Extensive results on the DTU dataset and Tanks&Temple benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at our project page: https://zju3dv.github.io/GD-PoseMVS/.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01916">Masked Autoencoders are Parameter-Efficient Federated Continual Learners</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen He, Xiangfeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning is a specific distributed learning paradigm in which a central server aggregates updates from multiple clients' local models, thereby enabling the server to learn without requiring clients to upload their private data, maintaining data privacy. While existing federated learning methods are primarily designed for static data, real-world applications often require clients to learn new categories over time. This challenge necessitates the integration of continual learning techniques, resulting in federated continual learning (FCL). Although advanced prompt-based continual learning methods leverage pre-trained transformers to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, they do not adequately address the non-IID challenges in federated learning. To address both catastrophic forgetting and non-IID issues, we propose to use masked autoencoders (MAEs) as parameter-efficient federated continual learners, called pMAE. pMAE learns reconstructive prompt on the client side through image reconstruction using MAEs. On the server side, it reconstructs the uploaded restore information to capture the data distribution across previous tasks and different clients, using these reconstructed images to finetune discriminative prompt and classifier parameters designed for classification, thereby alleviating catastrophic forgetting and non-IID challenges on a global scale. Experimental results demonstrate that pMAE achieves performance comparable to existing prompt-based methods and can enhance their effectiveness, particularly when using self-supervised pre-trained transformers as the backbone.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sharat Agarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Objects, in the real world, rarely occur in isolation and exhibit typical arrangements governed by their independent utility, and their expected interaction with humans and other objects in the context. For example, a chair is expected near a table, and a computer is expected on top. Humans use this spatial context and relative placement as an important cue for visual recognition in case of ambiguities. Similar to human's, DNN's exploit contextual information from data to learn representations. Our research focuses on harnessing the contextual aspects of visual data to optimize data annotation and enhance the training of deep networks. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) We introduce the notion of contextual diversity for active learning CDAL and show its applicability in three different visual tasks semantic segmentation, object detection and image classification, (2) We propose a data repair algorithm to curate contextually fair data to reduce model bias, enabling the model to detect objects out of their obvious context, (3) We propose Class-based annotation, where contextually relevant classes are selected that are complementary for model training under domain shift. Understanding the importance of well-curated data, we also emphasize the necessity of involving humans in the loop to achieve accurate annotations and to develop novel interaction strategies that allow humans to serve as fact-checkers. In line with this we are working on developing image retrieval system for wildlife camera trap images and reliable warning system for poor quality rural roads. For large-scale annotation, we are employing a strategic combination of human expertise and zero-shot models, while also integrating human input at various stages for continuous feedback.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01948">Learning Where to Edit Vision Transformers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunqiao Yang, Long-Kai Huang, Shengzhuang Chen, Kede Ma, Ying Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Model editing aims to data-efficiently correct predictive errors of large pre-trained models while ensuring generalization to neighboring failures and locality to minimize unintended effects on unrelated examples. While significant progress has been made in editing Transformer-based large language models, effective strategies for editing vision Transformers (ViTs) in computer vision remain largely untapped. In this paper, we take initial steps towards correcting predictive errors of ViTs, particularly those arising from subpopulation shifts. Taking a locate-then-edit approach, we first address the where-to-edit challenge by meta-learning a hypernetwork on CutMix-augmented data generated for editing reliability. This trained hypernetwork produces generalizable binary masks that identify a sparse subset of structured model parameters, responsive to real-world failure samples. Afterward, we solve the how-to-edit problem by simply fine-tuning the identified parameters using a variant of gradient descent to achieve successful edits. To validate our method, we construct an editing benchmark that introduces subpopulation shifts towards natural underrepresented images and AI-generated images, thereby revealing the limitations of pre-trained ViTs for object recognition. Our approach not only achieves superior performance on the proposed benchmark but also allows for adjustable trade-offs between generalization and locality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Colomer Matachana</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate identification of individual leopards across camera trap images is critical for population monitoring and ecological studies. This paper introduces a deep learning framework to distinguish between individual leopards based on their unique spot patterns. This approach employs a novel adaptive angular margin method in the form of a modified CosFace architecture. In addition, I propose a preprocessing pipeline that combines RGB channels with an edge detection channel to underscore the critical features learned by the model.
  This approach significantly outperforms the Triplet Network baseline, achieving a Dynamic Top-5 Average Precision of 0.8814 and a Top-5 Rank Match Detection of 0.9533, demonstrating its potential for open-set learning in wildlife identification. While not surpassing the performance of the SIFT-based Hotspotter algorithm, this method represents a substantial advancement in applying deep learning to patterned wildlife identification.
  This research contributes to the field of computer vision and provides a valuable tool for biologists aiming to study and protect leopard populations. It also serves as a stepping stone for applying the power of deep learning in Capture-Recapture studies for other patterned species.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Mudit Adityaja, Saurabh J. Shigwan, Nitin Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: The data-intensive nature of supervised classification drives the interest of the researchers towards unsupervised approaches, especially for problems such as medical image segmentation, where labeled data is scarce. Building on the recent advancements of Vision transformers (ViT) in computer vision, we propose an unsupervised segmentation framework using a pre-trained Dino-ViT. In the proposed method, we leverage the inherent graph structure within the image to realize a significant performance gain for segmentation in medical images. For this, we introduce a modularity-based loss function coupled with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to effectively capture the inherent graph topology within the image. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, even significantly surpassing or matching that of existing (semi)supervised technique such as MedSAM which is a Segment Anything Model in medical images. We demonstrate this using two challenging medical image datasets ISIC-2018 and CVC-ColonDB. This work underscores the potential of unsupervised approaches in advancing medical image analysis in scenarios where labeled data is scarce.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyang Yu, Arthur Aubret, Marcel C. Raabe, Jane Yang, Chen Yu, Jochen Triesch</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to significant variations in the projection of the same object from different viewpoints, machine learning algorithms struggle to recognize the same object across various perspectives. In contrast, toddlers quickly learn to recognize objects from different viewpoints with almost no supervision. Recent works argue that toddlers develop this ability by mapping close-in-time visual inputs to similar representations while interacting with objects. High acuity vision is only available in the central visual field, which may explain why toddlers (much like adults) constantly move their gaze around during such interactions. It is unclear whether/how much toddlers curate their visual experience through these eye movements to support learning object representations. In this work, we explore whether a bio inspired visual learning model can harness toddlers' gaze behavior during a play session to develop view-invariant object recognition. Exploiting head-mounted eye tracking during dyadic play, we simulate toddlers' central visual field experience by cropping image regions centered on the gaze location. This visual stream feeds a time-based self-supervised learning algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate that toddlers' gaze strategy supports the learning of invariant object representations. Our analysis also reveals that the limited size of the central visual field where acuity is high is crucial for this. We further find that toddlers' visual experience elicits more robust representations compared to adults' mostly because toddlers look at objects they hold themselves for longer bouts. Overall, our work reveals how toddlers' gaze behavior supports self-supervised learning of view-invariant object recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Faghihi, Mohammedreza Zarenejad, Ali-Asghar Beheshti Shirazi</p>
<p>Abstract: Capturing a video's meaning and critical concepts by analyzing the subtle details is a fundamental yet challenging task in video captioning. Identifying the dominant emotional tone in a video significantly enhances the perception of its context. Despite a strong emphasis on video captioning, existing models often need to adequately address emotional themes, resulting in suboptimal captioning results. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Semantic Processing and Emotion-informed video-Captioning Through Retrieval and Understanding Modalities (SPECTRUM) framework to empower the generation of emotionally and semantically credible captions. Leveraging our pioneering structure, SPECTRUM discerns multimodal semantics and emotional themes using Visual Text Attribute Investigation (VTAI) and determines the orientation of descriptive captions through a Holistic Concept-Oriented Theme (HCOT), expressing emotionally-informed and field-acquainted references. They exploit video-to-text retrieval capabilities and the multifaceted nature of video content to estimate the emotional probabilities of candidate captions. Then, the dominant theme of the video is determined by appropriately weighting embedded attribute vectors and applying coarse- and fine-grained emotional concepts, which define the video's contextual alignment. Furthermore, using two loss functions, SPECTRUM is optimized to integrate emotional information and minimize prediction errors. Extensive experiments on the EmVidCap, MSVD, and MSRVTT video captioning datasets demonstrate that our model significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations highlight the model's ability to accurately capture and convey video emotions and multimodal attributes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Liu, Jiequan Cui, Zhuotao Tian, Senqiao Yang, Qingdong He, Xiaoling Wang, Jingyong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often suffer from the overconfidence issue, where incorrect predictions are made with high confidence scores, hindering the applications in critical systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Typicalness-Aware Learning (TAL) to address this issue and improve failure detection performance. We observe that, with the cross-entropy loss, model predictions are optimized to align with the corresponding labels via increasing logit magnitude or refining logit direction. However, regarding atypical samples, the image content and their labels may exhibit disparities. This discrepancy can lead to overfitting on atypical samples, ultimately resulting in the overconfidence issue that we aim to address. To tackle the problem, we have devised a metric that quantifies the typicalness of each sample, enabling the dynamic adjustment of the logit magnitude during the training process. By allowing atypical samples to be adequately fitted while preserving reliable logit direction, the problem of overconfidence can be mitigated. TAL has been extensively evaluated on benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority over existing failure detection methods. Specifically, TAL achieves a more than 5% improvement on CIFAR100 in terms of the Area Under the Risk-Coverage Curve (AURC) compared to the state-of-the-art.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengpeng Wang, Li Chen, Lili Wang, Zhaofan Li, Xuebin Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: On facial expression datasets with complex and numerous feature types, where the significance and dominance of labeled features are difficult to predict, facial expression recognition(FER) encounters the challenges of inter-class similarity and intra-class variances, making it difficult to mine effective features. We aim to solely leverage the feature similarity among facial samples to address this. We introduce the Cross Similarity Attention (CSA), an input-output position-sensitive attention mechanism that harnesses feature similarity across different images to compute the corresponding global spatial attention. Based on this, we propose a four-branch circular framework, called Quadruplet Cross Similarity (QCS), to extract discriminative features from the same class and eliminate redundant ones from different classes synchronously to refine cleaner features. The symmetry of the network ensures balanced and stable training and reduces the amount of CSA interaction matrix. Contrastive residual distillation is utilized to transfer the information learned in the cross module back to the base network. The cross-attention module exists during training, and only one base branch is retained during inference. our proposed QCS model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several popular FER datasets, without requiring additional landmark information or other extra training data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Li, Weiwei Guo, Xue Yang, Ning Liao, Shaofeng Zhang, Yi Yu, Wenxian Yu, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, aerial object detection has been increasingly pivotal in various earth observation applications. However, current algorithms are limited to detecting a set of pre-defined object categories, demanding sufficient annotated training samples, and fail to detect novel object categories. In this paper, we put forth a novel formulation of the aerial object detection problem, namely open-vocabulary aerial object detection (OVAD), which can detect objects beyond training categories without costly collecting new labeled data. We propose CastDet, a CLIP-activated student-teacher detection framework that serves as the first OVAD detector specifically designed for the challenging aerial scenario, where objects often exhibit weak appearance features and arbitrary orientations. Our framework integrates a robust localization teacher along with several box selection strategies to generate high-quality proposals for novel objects. Additionally, the RemoteCLIP model is adopted as an omniscient teacher, which provides rich knowledge to enhance classification capabilities for novel categories. A dynamic label queue is devised to maintain high-quality pseudo-labels during training. By doing so, the proposed CastDet boosts not only novel object proposals but also classification. Furthermore, we extend our approach from horizontal OVAD to oriented OVAD with tailored algorithm designs to effectively manage bounding box representation and pseudo-label generation. Extensive experiments for both tasks on multiple existing aerial object detection datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanay Agrawal, Abid Ali, Antitza Dantcheva, Francois Bremond</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models, in particular \textit{image} models, have recently gained generalisability and robustness. %are becoming more general and robust by the day. In this work, we propose to exploit such advances in the realm of \textit{video} classification. Video foundation models suffer from the requirement of extensive pretraining and a large training time. Towards mitigating such limitations, we propose "\textit{Attention Map (AM) Flow}" for image models, a method for identifying pixels relevant to motion in each input video frame. In this context, we propose two methods to compute AM flow, depending on camera motion. AM flow allows the separation of spatial and temporal processing, while providing improved results over combined spatio-temporal processing (as in video models). Adapters, one of the popular techniques in parameter efficient transfer learning, facilitate the incorporation of AM flow into pretrained image models, mitigating the need for full-finetuning. We extend adapters to "\textit{temporal processing adapters}" by incorporating a temporal processing unit into the adapters. Our work achieves faster convergence, therefore reducing the number of epochs needed for training. Moreover, we endow an image model with the ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on popular action recognition datasets. This reduces training time and simplifies pretraining. We present experiments on Kinetics-400, Something-Something v2, and Toyota Smarthome datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art or comparable results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhupendra Solanki, Ashwin Nair, Mainak Singha, Souradeep Mukhopadhyay, Ankit Jha, Biplab Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to cluster unlabeled images into known and novel categories using labeled images from known classes. To address the challenge of transferring features from known to unknown classes while mitigating model bias, we introduce GraphVL, a novel approach for vision-language modeling in GCD, leveraging CLIP. Our method integrates a graph convolutional network (GCN) with CLIP's text encoder to preserve class neighborhood structure. We also employ a lightweight visual projector for image data, ensuring discriminative features through margin-based contrastive losses for image-text mapping. This neighborhood preservation criterion effectively regulates the semantic space, making it less sensitive to known classes. Additionally, we learn textual prompts from known classes and align them to create a more contextually meaningful semantic feature space for the GCN layer using a contextual similarity loss. Finally, we represent unlabeled samples based on their semantic distance to class prompts from the GCN, enabling semi-supervised clustering for class discovery and minimizing errors. Our experiments on seven benchmark datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of GraphVL when integrated with the CLIP backbone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Idris Zakariyya, Linda Tran, Kaushik Bhargav Sivangi, Paul Henderson, Fani Deligianni</p>
<p>Abstract: Human motion analysis offers significant potential for healthcare monitoring and early detection of diseases. The advent of radar-based sensing systems has captured the spotlight for they are able to operate without physical contact and they can integrate with pre-existing Wi-Fi networks. They are also seen as less privacy-invasive compared to camera-based systems. However, recent research has shown high accuracy in recognizing subjects or gender from radar gait patterns, raising privacy concerns. This study addresses these issues by investigating privacy vulnerabilities in radar-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems and proposing a novel method for privacy preservation using Differential Privacy (DP) driven by attributions derived with Integrated Decision Gradient (IDG) algorithm. We investigate Black-box Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Models in HAR settings across various levels of attacker-accessible information. We extensively evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed IDG-DP method by designing a CNN-based HAR model and rigorously assessing its resilience against MIAs. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of IDG-DP in mitigating privacy attacks while maintaining utility across all settings, particularly excelling against label-only and shadow model black-box MIA attacks. This work represents a crucial step towards balancing the need for effective radar-based HAR with robust privacy protection in healthcare environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a framework for extracting georeferenced vehicle trajectories from high-altitude drone footage, addressing key challenges in urban traffic monitoring and limitations of traditional ground-based systems. We employ state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning to create an end-to-end pipeline that enhances vehicle detection, tracking, and trajectory stabilization. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study used a multi-drone experiment over 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. We developed a novel track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, which, combined with advanced georeferencing techniques, accurately transforms vehicle coordinates into real-world geographical data. Additionally, our framework includes robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation for in-depth traffic analysis. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising nearly 1 million unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated frames with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons between drone-derived data and high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our framework's extraction in dense urban settings. By publicly releasing these datasets and the pipeline source code, this work sets new benchmarks for data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise, cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for the research community to develop intelligent transportation systems and improve traffic management strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanqi Yao, Gang Wu, Kui Jiang, Siao Liu, Jian Kuai, Xianming Liu, Junjun Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning a self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) model with great generalization remains significantly challenging. Despite the success of adversarial augmentation in the supervised learning generalization, naively incorporating it into self-supervised MDE models potentially causes over-regularization, suffering from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we conduct qualitative analysis and illuminate the main causes: (i) inherent sensitivity in the UNet-alike depth network and (ii) dual optimization conflict caused by over-regularization. To tackle these issues, we propose a general adversarial training framework, named Stabilized Conflict-optimization Adversarial Training (SCAT), integrating adversarial data augmentation into self-supervised MDE methods to achieve a balance between stability and generalization. Specifically, we devise an effective scaling depth network that tunes the coefficients of long skip connection and effectively stabilizes the training process. Then, we propose a conflict gradient surgery strategy, which progressively integrates the adversarial gradient and optimizes the model toward a conflict-free direction. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that SCAT can achieve state-of-the-art performance and significantly improve the generalization capability of existing self-supervised MDE methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiqin Zhao, Mallesham Dasari, Tian Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality environment lighting is the foundation of creating immersive user experiences in mobile augmented reality (AR) applications. However, achieving visually coherent environment lighting estimation for Mobile AR is challenging due to several key limitations associated with AR device sensing capabilities, including limitations in device camera FoV and pixel dynamic ranges. Recent advancements in generative AI, which can generate high-quality images from different types of prompts, including texts and images, present a potential solution for high-quality lighting estimation. Still, to effectively use generative image diffusion models, we must address their key limitations of generation hallucination and slow inference process. To do so, in this work, we design and implement a generative lighting estimation system called CleAR that can produce high-quality and diverse environment maps in the format of 360$^\circ$ images. Specifically, we design a two-step generation pipeline guided by AR environment context data to ensure the results follow physical environment visual context and color appearances. To improve the estimation robustness under different lighting conditions, we design a real-time refinement component to adjust lighting estimation results on AR devices. To train and test our generative models, we curate a large-scale environment lighting estimation dataset with diverse lighting conditions. Through quantitative evaluation and user study, we show that CleAR outperforms state-of-the-art lighting estimation methods on both estimation accuracy and robustness. Moreover, CleAR supports real-time refinement of lighting estimation results, ensuring robust and timely environment lighting updates for AR applications. Our end-to-end generative estimation takes as fast as 3.2 seconds, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 110x.</p>

<p>Abstract: When presented with one or a few photos of a previously unseen object, humans can instantly recognize it in different scenes. Although the human brain mechanism behind this phenomenon is still not fully understood, this work introduces a novel technical realization of this task. It consists of two phases: (1) generating a Similarity Density Map (SDM) by convolving the scene image with the given object image patch(es) so that the highlight areas in the SDM indicate the possible locations; (2) obtaining the object occupied areas in the scene through a Region Alignment Network (RAN). The RAN is constructed on a backbone of Deep Siamese Network (DSN), and different from the traditional DSNs, it aims to obtain the object accurate regions by regressing the location and area differences between the ground truths and the predicted ones indicated by the highlight areas in SDM. By pre-learning from labels annotated in traditional datasets, the SDM-RAN can detect previously unknown objects without fine-tuning. Experiments were conducted on the MS COCO, PASCAL VOC datasets. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the same task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anjith George, Sebastien Marcel</p>
<p>Abstract: The accuracy of face recognition systems has improved significantly in the past few years, thanks to the large amount of data collected and the advancement in neural network architectures. However, these large-scale datasets are often collected without explicit consent, raising ethical and privacy concerns. To address this, there have been proposals to use synthetic datasets for training face recognition models. Yet, such models still rely on real data to train the generative models and generally exhibit inferior performance compared to those trained on real datasets. One of these datasets, DigiFace, uses a graphics pipeline to generate different identities and different intra-class variations without using real data in training the models. However, the performance of this approach is poor on face recognition benchmarks, possibly due to the lack of realism in the images generated from the graphics pipeline. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for realism transfer aimed at enhancing the realism of synthetically generated face images. Our method leverages the large-scale face foundation model, and we adapt the pipeline for realism enhancement. By integrating the controllable aspects of the graphics pipeline with our realism enhancement technique, we generate a large amount of realistic variations-combining the advantages of both approaches. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that models trained using our enhanced dataset significantly improve the performance of face recognition systems over the baseline.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepayan Das, Davide Talon, Massimiliano Mancini, Yiming Wang, Elisa Ricci</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant promise in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks by leveraging web-scale multimodal datasets. However, these models often struggle with continual learning due to catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new tasks. As an effective remedy to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, rehearsal strategy uses the data of past tasks upon learning new task. However, such strategy incurs the need of storing past data, which might not be feasible due to hardware constraints or privacy concerns. In this work, we propose the first data-free method that leverages the language generation capability of a VLM, instead of relying on external models, to produce pseudo-rehearsal data for addressing continual VQA. Our proposal, named as GaB, generates pseudo-rehearsal data by posing previous task questions on new task data. Yet, despite being effective, the distribution of generated questions skews towards the most frequently posed questions due to the limited and task-specific training data. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a pseudo-rehearsal balancing module that aligns the generated data towards the ground-truth data distribution using either the question meta-statistics or an unsupervised clustering method. We evaluate our proposed method on two recent benchmarks, \ie VQACL-VQAv2 and CLOVE-function benchmarks. GaB outperforms all the data-free baselines with substantial improvement in maintaining VQA performance across evolving tasks, while being on-par with methods with access to the past data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryoma Yataka, Pu Perry Wang, Petros Boufounos, Ryuhei Takahashi</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional radar feature extraction faces limitations due to low spatial resolution, noise, multipath reflection, the presence of ghost targets, and motion blur. Such limitations can be exacerbated by nonlinear object motion, particularly from an ego-centric viewpoint. It becomes evident that to address these challenges, the key lies in exploiting temporal feature relation over an extended horizon and enforcing spatial motion consistency for effective association. To this end, this paper proposes SIRA (Scalable Inter-frame Relation and Association) with two designs. First, inspired by Swin Transformer, we introduce extended temporal relation, generalizing the existing temporal relation layer from two consecutive frames to multiple inter-frames with temporally regrouped window attention for scalability. Second, we propose motion consistency track with the concept of a pseudo-tracklet generated from observational data for better trajectory prediction and subsequent object association. Our approach achieves 58.11 mAP@0.5 for oriented object detection and 47.79 MOTA for multiple object tracking on the Radiate dataset, surpassing previous state-of-the-art by a margin of +4.11 mAP@0.5 and +9.94 MOTA, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruihong Yin, Vladimir Yugay, Yue Li, Sezer Karaoglu, Theo Gevers</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of novel view synthesis from images has seen rapid advancements with the introduction of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and more recently with 3D Gaussian Splatting. Gaussian Splatting became widely adopted due to its efficiency and ability to render novel views accurately. While Gaussian Splatting performs well when a sufficient amount of training images are available, its unstructured explicit representation tends to overfit in scenarios with sparse input images, resulting in poor rendering performance. To address this, we present a 3D Gaussian-based novel view synthesis method using sparse input images that can accurately render the scene from the viewpoints not covered by the training images. We propose a multi-stage training scheme with matching-based consistency constraints imposed on the novel views without relying on pre-trained depth estimation or diffusion models. This is achieved by using the matches of the available training images to supervise the generation of the novel views sampled between the training frames with color, geometry, and semantic losses. In addition, we introduce a locality preserving regularization for 3D Gaussians which removes rendering artifacts by preserving the local color structure of the scene. Evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates competitive or superior performance of our method in few-shot novel view synthesis compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02236">3D Audio-Visual Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Artem Sokolov, Swapnil Bhosale, Xiatian Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognizing the sounding objects in scenes is a longstanding objective in embodied AI, with diverse applications in robotics and AR/VR/MR. To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandros Haliassos, Rodrigo Mira, Honglie Chen, Zoe Landgraf, Stavros Petridis, Maja Pantic</p>
<p>Abstract: Research in auditory, visual, and audiovisual speech recognition (ASR, VSR, and AVSR, respectively) has traditionally been conducted independently. Even recent self-supervised studies addressing two or all three tasks simultaneously tend to yield separate models, leading to disjoint inference pipelines with increased memory requirements and redundancies. This paper proposes unified training strategies for these systems. We demonstrate that training a single model for all three tasks enhances VSR and AVSR performance, overcoming typical optimisation challenges when training from scratch. Moreover, we introduce a greedy pseudo-labelling approach to more effectively leverage unlabelled samples, addressing shortcomings in related self-supervised methods. Finally, we develop a self-supervised pre-training method within our framework, proving its effectiveness alongside our semi-supervised approach. Despite using a single model for all tasks, our unified approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to recent methods on LRS3 and LRS2 for ASR, VSR, and AVSR, as well as on the newly released WildVSR dataset.

<p>Abstract: While 3D generative models have greatly improved artists' workflows, the existing diffusion models for 3D generation suffer from slow generation and poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage approach named Hunyuan3D-1.0 including a lite version and a standard version, that both support text- and image-conditioned generation. In the first stage, we employ a multi-view diffusion model that efficiently generates multi-view RGB in approximately 4 seconds. These multi-view images capture rich details of the 3D asset from different viewpoints, relaxing the tasks from single-view to multi-view reconstruction. In the second stage, we introduce a feed-forward reconstruction model that rapidly and faithfully reconstructs the 3D asset given the generated multi-view images in approximately 7 seconds. The reconstruction network learns to handle noises and in-consistency introduced by the multi-view diffusion and leverages the available information from the condition image to efficiently recover the 3D structure. % Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Hunyuan3D-1.0 in generating high-quality 3D assets. Our framework involves the text-to-image model ~\ie, Hunyuan-DiT, making it a unified framework to support both text- and image-conditioned 3D generation. Our standard version has $10\times$ more parameters than our lite and other existing model. Our Hunyuan3D-1.0 achieves an impressive balance between speed and quality, significantly reducing generation time while maintaining the quality and diversity of the produced assets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongzhen Zhao, Vivienne Wang, Juho Kannala, Joni Pajarinen</p>
<p>Abstract: Object-Centric Learning (OCL) can discover objects in images or videos by simply reconstructing the input. For better object discovery, representative OCL methods reconstruct the input as its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) intermediate representation, which suppresses pixel noises and promotes object separability by discretizing continuous super-pixels with template features. However, treating features as units overlooks their composing attributes, thus impeding model generalization; indexing features with scalar numbers loses attribute-level similarities and differences, thus hindering model convergence. We propose \textit{Grouped Discrete Representation} (GDR) for OCL. We decompose features into combinatorial attributes via organized channel grouping, and compose these attributes into discrete representation via tuple indexes. Experiments show that our GDR improves both Transformer- and Diffusion-based OCL methods consistently on various datasets. Visualizations show that our GDR captures better object separability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyang Zhao, Chung-Ching Lin, Kevin Lin, Zhiwen Yan, Linjie Li, Zhengyuan Yang, Jianfeng Wang, Gim Hee Lee, Lijuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments in 2D visual generation have been remarkably successful. However, 3D and 4D generation remain challenging in real-world applications due to the lack of large-scale 4D data and effective model design. In this paper, we propose to jointly investigate general 3D and 4D generation by leveraging camera and object movements commonly observed in daily life. Due to the lack of real-world 4D data in the community, we first propose a data curation pipeline to obtain camera poses and object motion strength from videos. Based on this pipeline, we introduce a large-scale real-world 4D scene dataset: CamVid-30K. By leveraging all the 3D and 4D data, we develop our framework, GenXD, which allows us to produce any 3D or 4D scene. We propose multiview-temporal modules, which disentangle camera and object movements, to seamlessly learn from both 3D and 4D data. Additionally, GenXD employs masked latent conditions to support a variety of conditioning views. GenXD can generate videos that follow the camera trajectory as well as consistent 3D views that can be lifted into 3D representations. We perform extensive evaluations across various real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating GenXD's effectiveness and versatility compared to previous methods in 3D and 4D generation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02327">PPLLaVA: Varied Video Sequence Understanding With Prompt Guidance</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruyang Liu, Haoran Tang, Haibo Liu, Yixiao Ge, Ying Shan, Chen Li, Jiankun Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The past year has witnessed the significant advancement of video-based large language models. However, the challenge of developing a unified model for both short and long video understanding remains unresolved. Most existing video LLMs cannot handle hour-long videos, while methods custom for long videos tend to be ineffective for shorter videos and images. In this paper, we identify the key issue as the redundant content in videos. To address this, we propose a novel pooling strategy that simultaneously achieves token compression and instruction-aware visual feature aggregation. Our model is termed Prompt-guided Pooling LLaVA, or PPLLaVA for short. Specifically, PPLLaVA consists of three core components: the CLIP-based visual-prompt alignment that extracts visual information relevant to the user's instructions, the prompt-guided pooling that compresses the visual sequence to arbitrary scales using convolution-style pooling, and the clip context extension designed for lengthy prompt common in visual dialogue. Moreover, our codebase also integrates the most advanced video Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and visual interleave training. Extensive experiments have validated the performance of our model. With superior throughput and only 1024 visual context, PPLLaVA achieves better results on image benchmarks as a video LLM, while achieving state-of-the-art performance across various video benchmarks, excelling in tasks ranging from caption generation to multiple-choice questions, and handling video lengths from seconds to hours.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Cheng, Juncheng Mu, Xianfang Zeng, Xin Chen, Anqi Pang, Chi Zhang, Zhibin Wang, Bin Fu, Gang Yu, Ziwei Liu, Liang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Texturing is a crucial step in the 3D asset production workflow, which enhances the visual appeal and diversity of 3D assets. Despite recent advancements in Text-to-Texture (T2T) generation, existing methods often yield subpar results, primarily due to local discontinuities, inconsistencies across multiple views, and their heavy dependence on UV unwrapping outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel generation-refinement 3D texturing framework called MVPaint, which can generate high-resolution, seamless textures while emphasizing multi-view consistency. MVPaint mainly consists of three key modules. 1) Synchronized Multi-view Generation (SMG). Given a 3D mesh model, MVPaint first simultaneously generates multi-view images by employing an SMG model, which leads to coarse texturing results with unpainted parts due to missing observations. 2) Spatial-aware 3D Inpainting (S3I). To ensure complete 3D texturing, we introduce the S3I method, specifically designed to effectively texture previously unobserved areas. 3) UV Refinement (UVR). Furthermore, MVPaint employs a UVR module to improve the texture quality in the UV space, which first performs a UV-space Super-Resolution, followed by a Spatial-aware Seam-Smoothing algorithm for revising spatial texturing discontinuities caused by UV unwrapping. Moreover, we establish two T2T evaluation benchmarks: the Objaverse T2T benchmark and the GSO T2T benchmark, based on selected high-quality 3D meshes from the Objaverse dataset and the entire GSO dataset, respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MVPaint surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, MVPaint could generate high-fidelity textures with minimal Janus issues and highly enhanced cross-view consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Sharma, Ramin Nateghi, Marina Ayad, Lee A. D. Cooper, Jeffery A. Goldstein</p>
<p>Abstract: The placenta forms a critical barrier to infection through pregnancy, labor and, delivery. Inflammatory processes in the placenta have short-term, and long-term consequences for offspring health. Digital pathology and machine learning can play an important role in understanding placental inflammation, and there have been very few investigations into methods for predicting and understanding Maternal Inflammatory Response (MIR). This work intends to investigate the potential of using machine learning to understand MIR based on whole slide images (WSI), and establish early benchmarks. To that end, we use Multiple Instance Learning framework with 3 feature extractors: ImageNet-based EfficientNet-v2s, and 2 histopathology foundation models, UNI and Phikon to investigate predictability of MIR stage from histopathology WSIs. We also interpret predictions from these models using the learned attention maps from these models. We also use the MIL framework for predicting white blood cells count (WBC) and maximum fever temperature ($T_{max}$). Attention-based MIL models are able to classify MIR with a balanced accuracy of up to 88.5% with a Cohen's Kappa ($\kappa$) of up to 0.772. Furthermore, we found that the pathology foundation models (UNI and Phikon) are both able to achieve higher performance with balanced accuracy and $\kappa$, compared to ImageNet-based feature extractor (EfficientNet-v2s). For WBC and $T_{max}$ prediction, we found mild correlation between actual values and those predicted from histopathology WSIs. We used MIL framework for predicting MIR stage from WSIs, and compared effectiveness of foundation models as feature extractors, with that of an ImageNet-based model. We further investigated model failure cases and found them to be either edge cases prone to interobserver variability, examples of pathologist's overreach, or mislabeled due to processing errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neel Dey, Benjamin Billot, Hallee E. Wong, Clinton J. Wang, Mengwei Ren, P. Ellen Grant, Adrian V. Dalca, Polina Golland</p>
<p>Abstract: Current volumetric biomedical foundation models struggle to generalize as public 3D datasets are small and do not cover the broad diversity of medical procedures, conditions, anatomical regions, and imaging protocols. We address this by creating a representation learning method that instead anticipates strong domain shifts at training time itself. We first propose a data engine that synthesizes highly variable training samples that enable generalization to new biomedical contexts. To then train a single 3D network for any voxel-level task, we develop a contrastive learning method that pretrains the network to be stable against nuisance imaging variation simulated by the data engine, a key inductive bias for generalization. This network's features can be used as robust representations of input images for downstream tasks and its weights provide a strong, dataset-agnostic initialization for finetuning on new datasets. As a result, we set new standards across both multimodality registration and few-shot segmentation, a first for any 3D biomedical vision model, all without (pre-)training on any existing dataset of real images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingyi Kang, Yang Yue, Rui Lu, Zhijie Lin, Yang Zhao, Kaixin Wang, Gao Huang, Jiashi Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: OpenAI's Sora highlights the potential of video generation for developing world models that adhere to fundamental physical laws. However, the ability of video generation models to discover such laws purely from visual data without human priors can be questioned. A world model learning the true law should give predictions robust to nuances and correctly extrapolate on unseen scenarios. In this work, we evaluate across three key scenarios: in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and combinatorial generalization. We developed a 2D simulation testbed for object movement and collisions to generate videos deterministically governed by one or more classical mechanics laws. This provides an unlimited supply of data for large-scale experimentation and enables quantitative evaluation of whether the generated videos adhere to physical laws. We trained diffusion-based video generation models to predict object movements based on initial frames. Our scaling experiments show perfect generalization within the distribution, measurable scaling behavior for combinatorial generalization, but failure in out-of-distribution scenarios. Further experiments reveal two key insights about the generalization mechanisms of these models: (1) the models fail to abstract general physical rules and instead exhibit "case-based" generalization behavior, i.e., mimicking the closest training example; (2) when generalizing to new cases, models are observed to prioritize different factors when referencing training data: color > size > velocity > shape. Our study suggests that scaling alone is insufficient for video generation models to uncover fundamental physical laws, despite its role in Sora's broader success.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shivam Duggal, Phillip Isola, Antonio Torralba, William T. Freeman</p>
<p>Abstract: Current vision systems typically assign fixed-length representations to images, regardless of the information content. This contrasts with human intelligence - and even large language models - which allocate varying representational capacities based on entropy, context and familiarity. Inspired by this, we propose an approach to learn variable-length token representations for 2D images. Our encoder-decoder architecture recursively processes 2D image tokens, distilling them into 1D latent tokens over multiple iterations of recurrent rollouts. Each iteration refines the 2D tokens, updates the existing 1D latent tokens, and adaptively increases representational capacity by adding new tokens. This enables compression of images into a variable number of tokens, ranging from 32 to 256. We validate our tokenizer using reconstruction loss and FID metrics, demonstrating that token count aligns with image entropy, familiarity and downstream task requirements. Recurrent token processing with increasing representational capacity in each iteration shows signs of token specialization, revealing potential for object / part discovery.</p>

In this work, we present AutoVFX, a framework that automatically creates realistic and dynamic VFX videos from a single video and natural language instructions. By carefully integrating neural scene modeling, LLM-based code generation, and physical simulation, AutoVFX is able to provide physically-grounded, photorealistic editing effects that can be controlled directly using natural language instructions. We conduct extensive experiments to validate AutoVFX's efficacy across a diverse spectrum of videos and instructions. Quantitative and qualitative results suggest that AutoVFX outperforms all competing methods by a large margin in generative quality, instruction alignment, editing versatility, and physical plausibility.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated excellent capabilities in text-to-image generation. Their semantic understanding (i.e., prompt following) ability has also been greatly improved with large language models (e.g., T5, Llama). However, existing models cannot perfectly handle long and complex text prompts, especially when the text prompts contain various objects with numerous attributes and interrelated spatial relationships. While many regional prompting methods have been proposed for UNet-based models (SD1.5, SDXL), but there are still no implementations based on the recent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, such as SD3 and FLUX.1.In this report, we propose and implement regional prompting for FLUX.1 based on attention manipulation, which enables DiT with fined-grained compositional text-to-image generation capability in a training-free manner.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kumara Kahatapitiya, Haozhe Liu, Sen He, Ding Liu, Menglin Jia, Michael S. Ryoo, Tian Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating temporally-consistent high-fidelity videos can be computationally expensive, especially over longer temporal spans. More-recent Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) -- despite making significant headway in this context -- have only heightened such challenges as they rely on larger models and heavier attention mechanisms, resulting in slower inference speeds. In this paper, we introduce a training-free method to accelerate video DiTs, termed Adaptive Caching (AdaCache), which is motivated by the fact that "not all videos are created equal": meaning, some videos require fewer denoising steps to attain a reasonable quality than others. Building on this, we not only cache computations through the diffusion process, but also devise a caching schedule tailored to each video generation, maximizing the quality-latency trade-off. We further introduce a Motion Regularization (MoReg) scheme to utilize video information within AdaCache, essentially controlling the compute allocation based on motion content. Altogether, our plug-and-play contributions grant significant inference speedups (e.g. up to 4.7x on Open-Sora 720p - 2s video generation) without sacrificing the generation quality, across multiple video DiT baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sixu An, Xiangguo Sun, Yicong Li, Yu Yang, Guandong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Personality analysis from online short videos has gained prominence due to its applications in personalized recommendation systems, sentiment analysis, and human-computer interaction. Traditional assessment methods, such as questionnaires based on the Big Five Personality Framework, are limited by self-report biases and are impractical for large-scale or real-time analysis. Leveraging the rich, multi-modal data present in short videos offers a promising alternative for more accurate personality inference. However, integrating these diverse and asynchronous modalities poses significant challenges, particularly in aligning time-varying data and ensuring models generalize well to new domains with limited labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal personality analysis framework that addresses these challenges by synchronizing and integrating features from multiple modalities and enhancing model generalization through domain adaptation. We introduce a timestamp-based modality alignment mechanism that synchronizes data based on spoken word timestamps, ensuring accurate correspondence across modalities and facilitating effective feature integration. To capture temporal dependencies and inter-modal interactions, we employ Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks and self-attention mechanisms, allowing the model to focus on the most informative features for personality prediction. Furthermore, we develop a gradient-based domain adaptation method that transfers knowledge from multiple source domains to improve performance in target domains with scarce labeled data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in personality prediction tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing complex behavioral cues and robustness in adapting to new domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sun-Young Jeon, Sen Wang, Adam S. Wang, Garry E. Gold, Jang-Hwan Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Fluoroscopy is critical for real-time X-ray visualization in medical imaging. However, low-dose images are compromised by noise, potentially affecting diagnostic accuracy. Noise reduction is crucial for maintaining image quality, especially given such challenges as motion artifacts and the limited availability of clean data in medical imaging. To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised training framework for dynamic context-aware denoising of fluoroscopy image sequences. First, we train the multi-scale recurrent attention U-Net (MSR2AU-Net) without requiring clean data to address the initial noise. Second, we incorporate a knowledge distillation-based uncorrelated noise suppression module and a recursive filtering-based correlated noise suppression module enhanced with motion compensation to further improve motion compensation and achieve superior denoising performance. Finally, we introduce a novel approach by combining these modules with a pixel-wise dynamic object motion cross-fusion matrix, designed to adapt to motion, and an edge-preserving loss for precise detail retention. To validate the proposed method, we conducted extensive numerical experiments on medical image datasets, including 3500 fluoroscopy images from dynamic phantoms (2,400 images for training, 1,100 for testing) and 350 clinical images from a spinal surgery patient. Moreover, we demonstrated the robustness of our approach across different imaging modalities by testing it on the publicly available 2016 Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset, using 4,800 images for training and 1,136 for testing. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised algorithms in both visual quality and quantitative evaluation while achieving comparable performance to well-established supervised learning methods across low-dose fluoroscopy and CT imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arezoo Borji, Gernot Kronreif, Bernhard Angermayr, Sepideh Hatamikia</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning are transforming medical image analysis, particularly in cancer detection and classification. Techniques such as deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), are now enabling the precise analysis of complex histopathological images, automating detection, and enhancing classification accuracy across various cancer types. This study focuses on osteosarcoma (OS), the most common bone cancer in children and adolescents, which affects the long bones of the arms and legs. Early and accurate detection of OS is essential for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality. However, the increasing prevalence of cancer and the demand for personalized treatments create challenges in achieving precise diagnoses and customized therapies. We propose a novel hybrid model that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) and vision transformers (ViT) to improve diagnostic accuracy for OS using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histopathological images. The CNN model extracts local features, while the ViT captures global patterns from histopathological images. These features are combined and classified using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) into four categories: non-tumor (NT), non-viable tumor (NVT), viable tumor (VT), and none-viable ratio (NVR). Using the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) dataset, the model achieved an accuracy of 99.08%, precision of 99.10%, recall of 99.28%, and an F1-score of 99.23%. This is the first successful four-class classification using this dataset, setting a new benchmark in OS research and offering promising potential for future diagnostic advancements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hichem Debbi</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has led to tremendous success in many real-world applications of computer vision, thanks to sophisticated architectures such as Convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, CNNs have been shown to be vulnerable to crafted adversarial perturbations in inputs. These inputs appear almost indistinguishable from natural images, yet they are incorrectly classified by CNN architectures. This vulnerability of adversarial examples has led researchers to focus on enhancing the robustness of deep learning models in general, and CNNs in particular, by creating defense and detection methods to distinguish adversarials inputs from natural ones. In this paper, we address the adversarial robustness of CNNs through causal reasoning.
  We propose CausAdv: a causal framework for detecting adversarial examples based on counterfactual reasoning. CausAdv learns causal and non-causal features of every input, and quantifies the counterfactual information (CI) of every filter of the last convolutional layer. Then we perform statistical analysis on the filters CI of every sample, whether clan or adversarials, to demonstrate how adversarial examples indeed exhibit different CI distributions compared to clean samples. Our results show that causal reasoning enhances the process of adversarials detection without the need to train a separate detector. In addition, we illustrate the efficiency of causal explanations as a helpful detection technique through visualizing the causal features. The results can be reproduced using the code available in the repository: https://github.com/HichemDebbi/CausAdv.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanzhi Cheng, Yantao Li, Fangzhi Xu, Jianbing Zhang, Hao Zhou, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) has proven to improve the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). However, due to the complexity of multimodal scenarios and the difficulty in collecting high-quality CoT data, CoT reasoning in multimodal LLMs has been largely overlooked. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework, R3V, which iteratively enhances the model's Vision-language Reasoning by Reflecting on CoT Rationales. Our framework consists of two interleaved parts: (1) iteratively bootstrapping positive and negative solutions for reasoning datasets, and (2) reflection on rationale for learning from mistakes. Specifically, we introduce the self-refine and self-select losses, enabling the model to refine flawed rationale and derive the correct answer by comparing rationale candidates. Experiments on a wide range of vision-language tasks show that R3V consistently improves multimodal LLM reasoning, achieving a relative improvement of 23 to 60 percent over GPT-distilled baselines. Additionally, our approach supports self-reflection on generated solutions, further boosting performance through test-time computation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale deployment of large language models (LLMs) in various applications, such as chatbots and virtual assistants, requires LLMs to be culturally sensitive to the user to ensure inclusivity. Culture has been widely studied in psychology and anthropology, and there has been a recent surge in research on making LLMs more culturally inclusive in LLMs that goes beyond multilinguality and builds on findings from psychology and anthropology. In this paper, we survey efforts towards incorporating cultural awareness into text-based and multimodal LLMs. We start by defining cultural awareness in LLMs, taking the definitions of culture from anthropology and psychology as a point of departure. We then examine methodologies adopted for creating cross-cultural datasets, strategies for cultural inclusion in downstream tasks, and methodologies that have been used for benchmarking cultural awareness in LLMs. Further, we discuss the ethical implications of cultural alignment, the role of Human-Computer Interaction in driving cultural inclusion in LLMs, and the role of cultural alignment in driving social science research. We finally provide pointers to future research based on our findings about gaps in the literature.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of vision loss in working-age adults worldwide, yet under-resourced regions lack ophthalmologists. Current state-of-the-art deep learning systems struggle at these institutions due to limited generalizability. This paper explores a novel federated learning system for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis with the EfficientNetB0 architecture to leverage fundus data from multiple institutions to improve diagnostic generalizability at under-resourced hospitals while preserving patient-privacy. The federated model achieved 93.21% accuracy in five-category classification on an unseen dataset and 91.05% on lower-quality images from a simulated under-resourced institution. The model was deployed onto two apps for quick and accurate diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahin Mohammadi, Saman Jamshidi</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain tumors pose a serious health threat due to their rapid growth and potential for metastasis. While medical imaging has advanced significantly, accurately identifying and characterizing these tumors remains a challenge. This study addresses this challenge by leveraging the innovative TrAdaBoost methodology to enhance the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS2020) dataset, aiming to improve the efficiency and accuracy of brain tumor classification. Our approach combines state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, including the Vision Transformer (ViT), Capsule Neural Network (CapsNet), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as ResNet-152 and VGG16. By integrating these models within a multi-classifier framework, we harness the strengths of each approach to achieve more robust and reliable tumor classification. A novel decision template is employed to synergistically combine outputs from different algorithms, further enhancing classification accuracy. To augment the training process, we incorporate a secondary dataset, "Brain Tumor MRI Dataset," as a source domain, providing additional data for model training and improving generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate a high accuracy rate in classifying tumor versus non-tumor images, signifying the effectiveness of our approach in the medical imaging domain. This study highlights the potential of advanced machine learning techniques to contribute significantly to the early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors, ultimately improving patient outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianqian Wang, Wei Wang, Yuqi Fang, Hong-Jun Li, Andrea Bozoki, Mingxia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain networks/graphs derived from resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) help study underlying pathophysiology of neurocognitive disorders by measuring neuronal activities in the brain. Some studies utilize learning-based methods for brain network analysis, but typically suffer from low model generalizability caused by scarce labeled fMRI data. As a notable self-supervised strategy, graph contrastive learning helps leverage auxiliary unlabeled data. But existing methods generally arbitrarily perturb graph nodes/edges to generate augmented graphs, without considering essential topology information of brain networks. To this end, we propose a topology-aware graph augmentation (TGA) framework, comprising a pretext model to train a generalizable encoder on large-scale unlabeled fMRI cohorts and a task-specific model to perform downstream tasks on a small target dataset. In the pretext model, we design two novel topology-aware graph augmentation strategies: (1) hub-preserving node dropping that prioritizes preserving brain hub regions according to node importance, and (2) weight-dependent edge removing that focuses on keeping important functional connectivities based on edge weights. Experiments on 1, 688 fMRI scans suggest that TGA outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arianna Bunnell, Thomas Wolfgruber, Brandon Quon, Kailee Hung, Brenda Hernandez, Peter Sadowski, John A. Shepherd</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Mammographic breast density, as defined by the American College of Radiology's Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer, but is derived from mammographic images. Breast ultrasound (BUS) is an alternative breast cancer screening modality, particularly useful for early detection in low-resource, rural contexts. The purpose of this study was to explore an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict BI-RADS mammographic breast density category from clinical, handheld BUS imaging. Methods: All data are sourced from the Hawaii and Pacific Islands Mammography Registry. We compared deep learning methods from BUS imaging, as well as machine learning models from image statistics alone. The use of AI-derived BUS density as a risk factor for breast cancer was then compared to clinical BI-RADS breast density while adjusting for age. The BUS data were split by individual into 70/20/10% groups for training, validation, and testing. Results: 405,120 clinical BUS images from 14.066 women were selected for inclusion in this study, resulting in 9.846 women for training (302,574 images), 2,813 for validation (11,223 images), and 1,406 for testing (4,042 images). On the held-out testing set, the strongest AI model achieves AUROC 0.854 predicting BI-RADS mammographic breast density from BUS imaging and outperforms all shallow machine learning methods based on image statistics. In cancer risk prediction, age-adjusted AI BUS breast density predicted 5-year breast cancer risk with 0.633 AUROC, as compared to 0.637 AUROC from age-adjusted clinical breast density. Conclusions: BI-RADS mammographic breast density can be estimated from BUS imaging with high accuracy using a deep learning model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AI-derived BUS breast density is predictive of 5-year breast cancer risk in our population.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00893">Blind Time-of-Flight Imaging: Sparse Deconvolution on the Continuum with Unknown Kernels</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiming Guo, Ayush Bhandari</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, computational Time-of-Flight (ToF) imaging has emerged as an exciting and a novel imaging modality that offers new and powerful interpretations of natural scenes, with applications extending to 3D, light-in-flight, and non-line-of-sight imaging. Mathematically, ToF imaging relies on algorithmic super-resolution, as the back-scattered sparse light echoes lie on a finer time resolution than what digital devices can capture. Traditional methods necessitate knowledge of the emitted light pulses or kernels and employ sparse deconvolution to recover scenes. Unlike previous approaches, this paper introduces a novel, blind ToF imaging technique that does not require kernel calibration and recovers sparse spikes on a continuum, rather than a discrete grid. By studying the shared characteristics of various ToF modalities, we capitalize on the fact that most physical pulses approximately satisfy the Strang-Fix conditions from approximation theory. This leads to a new mathematical formulation for sparse super-resolution. Our recovery approach uses an optimization method that is pivoted on an alternating minimization strategy. We benchmark our blind ToF method against traditional kernel calibration methods, which serve as the baseline. Extensive hardware experiments across different ToF modalities demonstrate the algorithmic advantages, flexibility and empirical robustness of our approach. We show that our work facilitates super-resolution in scenarios where distinguishing between closely spaced objects is challenging, while maintaining performance comparable to known kernel situations. Examples of light-in-flight imaging and light-sweep videos highlight the practical benefits of our blind super-resolution method in enhancing the understanding of natural scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng-Xun Li, Jin-Gang Yu, Yuan Gao, Cui Huang, Gui-Song Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) typically requires hundreds of X-ray projections, which raises concerns about radiation exposure. While sparse-view reconstruction reduces the exposure by using fewer projections, it struggles to achieve satisfactory image quality. To address this challenge, this article introduces a novel sparse-view CBCT reconstruction method, which empowers the neural field with human tissue regularization. Our approach, termed tissue-guided neural tomography (TNT), is motivated by the distinct intensity differences between bone and soft tissue in CBCT. Intuitively, separating these components may aid the learning process of the neural field. More precisely, TNT comprises a heterogeneous quadruple network and the corresponding training strategy. The network represents the intensity field as a combination of soft and hard tissue components, along with their respective textures. We train the network with guidance from estimated tissue projections, enabling efficient learning of the desired patterns for the network heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the sparse-view CBCT reconstruction with a limited number of projections ranging from 10 to 60. Our method achieves comparable reconstruction quality with fewer projections and faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art neural rendering based methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Seismic exploration is currently the most important method for understanding subsurface structures. However, due to surface conditions, seismic receivers may not be uniformly distributed along the measurement line, making the entire exploration work difficult to carry out. Previous deep learning methods for reconstructing seismic data often relied on additional datasets for training. While some existing methods do not require extra data, they lack constraints on the reconstruction data, leading to unstable reconstruction performance. In this paper, we proposed a zero-shot self-consistency learning strategy and employed an extremely lightweight network for seismic data reconstruction. Our method does not require additional datasets and utilizes the correlations among different parts of the data to design a self-consistency learning loss function, driving a network with only 90,609 learnable parameters. We applied this method to experiments on the USGS National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska public dataset and the results indicate that our proposed approach achieved good reconstruction results. Additionally, our method also demonstrates a certain degree of noise suppression, which is highly beneficial for large and complex seismic exploration tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In drug discovery, accurate lung tumor segmentation is an important step for assessing tumor size and its progression using \textit{in-vivo} imaging such as MRI. While deep learning models have been developed to automate this process, the focus has predominantly been on human subjects, neglecting the pivotal role of animal models in pre-clinical drug development. In this work, we focus on optimizing lung tumor segmentation in mice. First, we demonstrate that the nnU-Net model outperforms the U-Net, U-Net3+, and DeepMeta models. Most importantly, we achieve better results with nnU-Net 3D models than 2D models, indicating the importance of spatial context for segmentation tasks in MRI mice scans. This study demonstrates the importance of 3D input over 2D input images for lung tumor segmentation in MRI scans. Finally, we outperform the prior state-of-the-art approach that involves the combined segmentation of lungs and tumors within the lungs. Our work achieves comparable results using only lung tumor annotations requiring fewer annotations, saving time and annotation efforts. This work\footnote{\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/lung-tumour-mice-mri-64BB}} is an important step in automating pre-clinical animal studies to quantify the efficacy of experimental drugs, particularly in assessing tumor changes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conventional histopathology has long been essential for disease diagnosis, relying on visual inspection of tissue sections. Immunohistochemistry aids in detecting specific biomarkers but is limited by its single-marker approach, restricting its ability to capture the full tissue environment. The advent of multiplexed imaging technologies, like multiplexed immunofluorescence and spatial transcriptomics, allows for simultaneous visualization of multiple biomarkers in a single section, enhancing morphological data with molecular and spatial information. This provides a more comprehensive view of the tissue microenvironment, cellular interactions, and disease mechanisms - crucial for understanding disease progression, prognosis, and treatment response. However, the extensive data from multiplexed imaging necessitates sophisticated computational methods for preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and spatial analysis. These tools are vital for managing large, multidimensional datasets, converting raw imaging data into actionable insights. By automating labor-intensive tasks and enhancing reproducibility and accuracy, computational tools are pivotal in diagnostics and research. This review explores the current landscape of multiplexed imaging in pathology, detailing workflows and key technologies like PathML, an AI-powered platform that streamlines image analysis, making complex dataset interpretation accessible for clinical and research settings.</p>

However, concerns persist regarding the transparency and context of data collection methodologies, especially when sourced through crowdsourcing platforms.

We apply this methodology to develop a dataset and AI model for evaluating public space quality using street view images, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing diverse perspectives and fostering higher-quality data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Li, Dianne Cook, Emi Tanaka, Susan VanderPlas, Klaus Ackermann</p>
<p>Abstract: Plotting the residuals is a recommended procedure to diagnose deviations from linear model assumptions, such as non-linearity, heteroscedasticity, and non-normality. The presence of structure in residual plots can be tested using the lineup protocol to do visual inference. There are a variety of conventional residual tests, but the lineup protocol, used as a statistical test, performs better for diagnostic purposes because it is less sensitive and applies more broadly to different types of departures. However, the lineup protocol relies on human judgment which limits its scalability. This work presents a solution by providing a computer vision model to automate the assessment of residual plots. It is trained to predict a distance measure that quantifies the disparity between the residual distribution of a fitted classical normal linear regression model and the reference distribution, based on Kullback-Leibler divergence. From extensive simulation studies, the computer vision model exhibits lower sensitivity than conventional tests but higher sensitivity than human visual tests. It is slightly less effective on non-linearity patterns. Several examples from classical papers and contemporary data illustrate the new procedures, highlighting its usefulness in automating the diagnostic process and supplementing existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sina Soleimani-Fard, Won Gi Jeong, Francis Ferri Ripalda, Hasti Sasani, Younhee Choi, S Deiva, Gong Yong Jin, Seok-bum Ko</p>
<p>Abstract: To automatically detect Anterior Mediastinum Lesions (AMLs) in the Anterior Mediastinum (AM), the primary requirement will be an automatic segmentation model specifically designed for the AM. The prevalence of AML is extremely low, making it challenging to conduct screening research similar to lung cancer screening. Retrospectively reviewing chest CT scans over a specific period to investigate the prevalence of AML requires substantial time. Therefore, developing an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to find location of AM helps radiologist to enhance their ability to manage workloads and improve diagnostic accuracy for AMLs. In this paper, we introduce a U-shaped structure network to segment AM. Two attention mechanisms were used for maintaining long-range dependencies and localization. In order to have the potential of Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) and a lightweight network, we designed a parallel MHSA named Wide-MHSA (W-MHSA). Maintaining long-range dependencies is crucial for segmentation when we upsample feature maps. Therefore, we designed a Dilated Depth-Wise Parallel Path connection (DDWPP) for this purpose. In order to design a lightweight architecture, we introduced an expanding convolution block and combine it with the proposed W-MHSA for feature extraction in the encoder part of the proposed U-shaped network. The proposed network was trained on 2775 AM cases, which obtained an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 87.83%, mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 79.16%, and Sensitivity of 89.60%. Our proposed architecture exhibited superior segmentation performance compared to the most advanced segmentation networks, such as Trans Unet, Attention Unet, Res Unet, and Res Unet++.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranav Jeevan, Neeraj Nixon, Abhijeet Patil, Amit Sethi</p>
<p>Abstract: Our study introduces ResNet-L2 (RL2), a novel metric for evaluating generative models and image quality in histopathology, addressing limitations of traditional metrics, such as Frechet inception distance (FID), when the data is scarce. RL2 leverages ResNet features with a normalizing flow to calculate RMSE distance in the latent space, providing reliable assessments across diverse histopathology datasets. We evaluated the performance of RL2 on degradation types, such as blur, Gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise, and rectangular patches, as well as diffusion processes. RL2's monotonic response to increasing degradation makes it well-suited for models that assess image quality, proving a valuable advancement for evaluating image generation techniques in histopathology. It can also be used to discard low-quality patches while sampling from a whole slide image. It is also significantly lighter and faster compared to traditional metrics and requires fewer images to give stable metric value.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adriel Saporta, Aahlad Puli, Mark Goldstein, Rajesh Ranganath</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, leverage naturally paired data-for example, images and their corresponding text captions-to learn general representations that transfer efficiently to downstream tasks. While such approaches are generally applied to two modalities, domains such as robotics, healthcare, and video need to support many types of data at once. We show that the pairwise application of CLIP fails to capture joint information between modalities, thereby limiting the quality of the learned representations. To address this issue, we present Symile, a simple contrastive learning approach that captures higher-order information between any number of modalities. Symile provides a flexible, architecture-agnostic objective for learning modality-specific representations. To develop Symile's objective, we derive a lower bound on total correlation, and show that Symile representations for any set of modalities form a sufficient statistic for predicting the remaining modalities. Symile outperforms pairwise CLIP, even with modalities missing in the data, on cross-modal classification and retrieval across several experiments including on an original multilingual dataset of 33M image, text and audio samples and a clinical dataset of chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, and laboratory measurements.

<p>Abstract: A crucial question in active patient care is determining if a treatment is having the desired effect, especially when changes are subtle over short periods. We propose using inter-patient data to train models that can learn to detect these fine-grained changes within a single patient. Specifically, can a model trained on multi-patient scans predict subtle changes in an individual patient's scans? Recent years have seen increasing use of deep learning (DL) in predicting diseases using biomedical imaging, such as predicting COVID-19 severity using lung ultrasound (LUS) data. While extensive literature exists on successful applications of DL systems when well-annotated large-scale datasets are available, it is quite difficult to collect a large corpus of personalized datasets for an individual. In this work, we investigate the ability of recent computer vision models to learn fine-grained differences while being trained on data showing larger differences. We evaluate on an in-house LUS dataset and a public ADNI brain MRI dataset. We find that models pre-trained on clips from multiple patients can better predict fine-grained differences in scans from a single patient by employing contrastive learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: The COVID19 pandemic has had a detrimental impact on the health and welfare of the worlds population. An important strategy in the fight against COVID19 is the effective screening of infected patients, with one of the primary screening methods involving radiological imaging with the use of chest Xrays. This is why this study introduces a customized convolutional neural network (CCNN) for medical image classification. This study used a dataset of 6432 images named Chest Xray (COVID19 and Pneumonia), and images were preprocessed using techniques, including resizing, normalizing, and augmentation, to improve model training and performance. The proposed CCNN was compared with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and other models that used the same dataset. This research found that the Convolutional Neural Network (CCNN) achieved 95.62% validation accuracy and 0.1270 validation loss. This outperformed earlier models and studies using the same dataset. This result indicates that our models learn effectively from training data and adapt efficiently to new, unseen data. In essence, the current CCNN model achieves better medical image classification performance, which is why this CCNN model efficiently classifies medical images. Future research may extend the models application to other medical imaging datasets and develop realtime offline medical image classification websites or apps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miko{\l}aj Ma{\l}ki\'nski, Szymon Pawlonka, Jacek Ma\'ndziuk</p>
<p>Abstract: Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) encompasses a suite of tasks whose solving requires the ability to discover common concepts underlying the set of pictures through an analogy-making process, similarly to human IQ tests. Bongard Problems (BPs), proposed in 1968, constitute a fundamental challenge in this domain mainly due to their requirement to combine visual reasoning and verbal description. This work poses a question whether multimodal large language models (MLLMs) inherently designed to combine vision and language are capable of tackling BPs. To this end, we propose a set of diverse MLLM-suited strategies to tackle BPs and examine four popular proprietary MLLMs: GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and four open models: InternVL2-8B, LLaVa-1.6 Mistral-7B, Phi-3.5-Vision, and Pixtral 12B. The above MLLMs are compared on three BP datasets: a set of original BP instances relying on synthetic, geometry-based images and two recent datasets based on real-world images, i.e., Bongard-HOI and Bongard-OpenWorld. The experiments reveal significant limitations of MLLMs in solving BPs. In particular, the models struggle to solve the classical set of synthetic BPs, despite their visual simplicity. Though their performance ameliorates on real-world concepts expressed in Bongard-HOI and Bongard-OpenWorld, the models still have difficulty in utilizing new information to improve their predictions, as well as utilizing a dialog context window effectively. To capture the reasons of performance discrepancy between synthetic and real-world AVR domains, we propose Bongard-RWR, a new BP dataset consisting of real-world images that translates concepts from hand-crafted synthetic BPs to real-world concepts. The MLLMs' results on Bongard-RWR suggest that their poor performance on classical BPs is not due to domain specificity but rather reflects their general AVR limitations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Manipulating garments and fabrics has long been a critical endeavor in the development of home-assistant robots. However, due to complex dynamics and topological structures, garment manipulations pose significant challenges. Recent successes in reinforcement learning and vision-based methods offer promising avenues for learning garment manipulation. Nevertheless, these approaches are severely constrained by current benchmarks, which offer limited diversity of tasks and unrealistic simulation behavior. Therefore, we present GarmentLab, a content-rich benchmark and realistic simulation designed for deformable object and garment manipulation. Our benchmark encompasses a diverse range of garment types, robotic systems and manipulators. The abundant tasks in the benchmark further explores of the interactions between garments, deformable objects, rigid bodies, fluids, and human body. Moreover, by incorporating multiple simulation methods such as FEM and PBD, along with our proposed sim-to-real algorithms and real-world benchmark, we aim to significantly narrow the sim-to-real gap. We evaluate state-of-the-art vision methods, reinforcement learning, and imitation learning approaches on these tasks, highlighting the challenges faced by current algorithms, notably their limited generalization capabilities. Our proposed open-source environments and comprehensive analysis show promising boost to future research in garment manipulation by unlocking the full potential of these methods. We guarantee that we will open-source our code as soon as possible. You can watch the videos in supplementary files to learn more about the details of our work.

<p>Abstract: This letter provides what is, to the best of our knowledge, a first study on the applicability of ultra-low-resolution thermal cameras for providing rotational odometry measurements to navigational devices such as rovers and drones. Our use of an ultra-low-resolution thermal camera instead of other modalities such as an RGB camera is motivated by its robustness to lighting conditions, while being one order of magnitude less cost-expensive compared to higher-resolution thermal cameras. After setting up a custom data acquisition system and acquiring thermal camera data together with its associated rotational speed label, we train a small 4-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regressing the rotational speed from the thermal data. Experiments and ablation studies are conducted for determining the impact of thermal camera resolution and the number of successive frames on the CNN estimation precision. Finally, our novel dataset for the study of low-resolution thermal odometry is openly released with the hope of benefiting future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy DR is a severe complication of diabetes. Damaged or abnormal blood vessels can cause loss of vision. The need for massive screening of a large population of diabetic patients has generated an interest in a computer-aided fully automatic diagnosis of DR. In the realm of Deep learning frameworks, particularly convolutional neural networks CNNs, have shown great interest and promise in detecting DR by analyzing retinal images. However, several challenges have been faced in the application of deep learning in this domain. High-quality, annotated datasets are scarce, and the variations in image quality and class imbalances pose significant hurdles in developing a dependable model. In this paper, we demonstrate the proficiency of two Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs based models, UNET and Stacked UNET utilizing the APTOS Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society Dataset. This system achieves an accuracy of 92.81% for the UNET and 93.32% for the stacked UNET architecture. The architecture classifies the images into five categories ranging from 0 to 4, where 0 is no DR and 4 is proliferative DR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> George Yiasemis, Nikita Moriakov, Jan-Jakob Sonke, Jonas Teuwen</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiac MRI (CMRI) is a cornerstone imaging modality that provides in-depth insights into cardiac structure and function. Multi-contrast CMRI (MCCMRI), which acquires sequences with varying contrast weightings, significantly enhances diagnostic capabilities by capturing a wide range of cardiac tissue characteristics. However, MCCMRI is often constrained by lengthy acquisition times and susceptibility to motion artifacts. To mitigate these challenges, accelerated imaging techniques that use k-space undersampling via different sampling schemes at acceleration factors have been developed to shorten scan durations. In this context, we propose a deep learning-based reconstruction method for 2D dynamic multi-contrast, multi-scheme, and multi-acceleration MRI. Our approach integrates the state-of-the-art vSHARP model, which utilizes half-quadratic variable splitting and ADMM optimization, with a Variational Network serving as an Auxiliary Refinement Network (ARN) to better adapt to the diverse nature of MCCMRI data. Specifically, the subsampled k-space data is fed into the ARN, which produces an initial prediction for the denoising step used by vSHARP. This, along with the subsampled k-space, is then used by vSHARP to generate high-quality 2D sequence predictions. Our method outperforms traditional reconstruction techniques and other vSHARP-based models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retinal fundus photography enhancement is important for diagnosing and monitoring retinal diseases. However, early approaches to retinal image enhancement, such as those based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), often struggle to preserve the complex topological information of blood vessels, resulting in spurious or missing vessel structures. The persistence diagram, which captures topological features based on the persistence of topological structures under different filtrations, provides a promising way to represent the structure information. In this work, we propose a topology-preserving training paradigm that regularizes blood vessel structures by minimizing the differences of persistence diagrams. We call the resulting framework Topology Preserving Optimal Transport (TPOT). Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised techniques, both in terms of image quality and performance in the downstream blood vessel segmentation task.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirun Guo, Tao Jin, Jingyuan Chen, Zhou Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning has developed very fast in recent years. However, during the multimodal training process, the model tends to rely on only one modality based on which it could learn faster, thus leading to inadequate use of other modalities. Existing methods to balance the training process always have some limitations on the loss functions, optimizers and the number of modalities and only consider modulating the magnitude of the gradients while ignoring the directions of the gradients. To solve these problems, in this paper, we present a novel method to balance multimodal learning with Classifier-Guided Gradient Modulation (CGGM), considering both the magnitude and directions of the gradients. We conduct extensive experiments on four multimodal datasets: UPMC-Food 101, CMU-MOSI, IEMOCAP and BraTS 2021, covering classification, regression and segmentation tasks. The results show that CGGM outperforms all the baselines and other state-of-the-art methods consistently, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijian Luo, Wei Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient sampling from un-normalized target distributions is pivotal in scientific computing and machine learning. While neural samplers have demonstrated potential with a special emphasis on sampling efficiency, existing neural implicit samplers still have issues such as poor mode covering behavior, unstable training dynamics, and sub-optimal performances. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we introduce Denoising Fisher Training (DFT), a novel training approach for neural implicit samplers with theoretical guarantees. We frame the training problem as an objective of minimizing the Fisher divergence by deriving a tractable yet equivalent loss function, which marks a unique theoretical contribution to assessing the intractable Fisher divergences. DFT is empirically validated across diverse sampling benchmarks, including two-dimensional synthetic distribution, Bayesian logistic regression, and high-dimensional energy-based models (EBMs). Notably, in experiments with high-dimensional EBMs, our best one-step DFT neural sampler achieves results on par with MCMC methods with up to 200 sampling steps, leading to a substantially greater efficiency over 100 times higher. This result not only demonstrates the superior performance of DFT in handling complex high-dimensional sampling but also sheds light on efficient sampling methodologies across broader applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyao Geng, Yuan Zhang, Jiaqi Huang, Feng Xue, Falong Tan, Chuanlong Xie, Shumei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Model library is an effective tool for improving the performance of single-model Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detector, mainly through model selection and detector fusion. However, existing methods in the literature do not provide uncertainty quantification for model selection results. Additionally, the model ensemble process primarily focuses on controlling the True Positive Rate (TPR) while neglecting the False Positive Rate (FPR). In this paper, we emphasize the significance of the proportion of models in the library that identify the test sample as an OoD sample. This proportion holds crucial information and directly influences the error rate of OoD detection.To address this, we propose inverting the commonly-used sequential p-value strategies. We define the rejection region initially and then estimate the error rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel perspective from change-point detection and propose an approach for proportion estimation with automatic hyperparameter selection. We name the proposed approach as DOS-Storey-based Detector Ensemble (DSDE). Experimental results on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in tackling OoD detection challenges. Specifically, the CIFAR10 experiments show that DSDE reduces the FPR from 11.07% to 3.31% compared to the top-performing single-model detector.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengting Yu, Fengzhao Zhang, Ruizhe Chen, Zuozhu Liu, Shurun Tan, Er-Ping Li, Aili Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD), a learning manner with a larger teacher network guiding a smaller student network, transfers dark knowledge from the teacher to the student via logits or intermediate features, with the aim of producing a well-performed lightweight model. Notably, many subsequent feature-based KD methods outperformed the earliest logit-based KD method and iteratively generated numerous state-of-the-art distillation methods. Nevertheless, recent work has uncovered the potential of the logit-based method, bringing the simple KD form based on logits back into the limelight. Features or logits? They partially implement the KD with entirely distinct perspectives; therefore, choosing between logits and features is not straightforward. This paper provides a unified perspective of feature alignment in order to obtain a better comprehension of their fundamental distinction. Inheriting the design philosophy and insights of feature-based and logit-based methods, we introduce a block-wise logit distillation framework to apply implicit logit-based feature alignment by gradually replacing teacher's blocks as intermediate stepping-stone models to bridge the gap between the student and the teacher. Our method obtains comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art distillation methods. This paper demonstrates the great potential of combining logit and features, and we hope it will inspire future research to revisit KD from a higher vantage point.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shi Yin, Hongqi Tan, Li Ming Chong, Haofeng Liu, Hui Liu, Kang Hao Lee, Jeffrey Kit Loong Tuan, Dean Ho, Yueming Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) plays a crucial role in image-guided radiotherapy, but artifacts and noise make them unsuitable for accurate dose calculation. Artificial intelligence methods have shown promise in enhancing CBCT quality to produce synthetic CT (sCT) images. However, existing methods either produce images of suboptimal quality or incur excessive time costs, failing to satisfy clinical practice standards. Methods and materials: We propose a novel hybrid conditional latent diffusion model for efficient and accurate CBCT-to-CT synthesis, named HC$^3$L-Diff. We employ the Unified Feature Encoder (UFE) to compress images into a low-dimensional latent space, thereby optimizing computational efficiency. Beyond the use of CBCT images, we propose integrating its high-frequency knowledge as a hybrid condition to guide the diffusion model in generating sCT images with preserved structural details. This high-frequency information is captured using our designed High-Frequency Extractor (HFE). During inference, we utilize denoising diffusion implicit model to facilitate rapid sampling. We construct a new in-house prostate dataset with paired CBCT and CT to validate the effectiveness of our method. Result: Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of sCT quality and generation efficiency. Moreover, our medical physicist conducts the dosimetric evaluations to validate the benefit of our method in practical dose calculation, achieving a remarkable 93.8% gamma passing rate with a 2%/2mm criterion, superior to other methods. Conclusion: The proposed HC$^3$L-Diff can efficiently achieve high-quality CBCT-to-CT synthesis in only over 2 mins per patient. Its promising performance in dose calculation shows great potential for enhancing real-world adaptive radiotherapy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deploying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained devices necessitates efficient management of computational resources, often via distributed systems susceptible to latency from straggler nodes. This paper introduces the Flexible Coded Distributed Convolution Computing (FCDCC) framework to enhance fault tolerance and numerical stability in distributed CNNs. We extend Coded Distributed Computing (CDC) with Circulant and Rotation Matrix Embedding (CRME) which was originally proposed for matrix multiplication to high-dimensional tensor convolution. For the proposed scheme, referred to as Numerically Stable Coded Tensor Convolution (NSCTC) scheme, we also propose two new coded partitioning schemes: Adaptive-Padding Coded Partitioning (APCP) for input tensor and Kernel-Channel Coded Partitioning (KCCP) for filter tensor. These strategies enable linear decomposition of tensor convolutions and encoding them into CDC sub-tasks, combining model parallelism with coded redundancy for robust and efficient execution.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Hu, Lijun Zhang, Dejian Meng, Ye Han, Lisha Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we propose GITSR, an effective framework for Graph Interaction Transformer-based Scene Representation for multi-vehicle collaborative decision-making in intelligent transportation system. In the context of mixed traffic where Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Human Driving Vehicles (HDVs) coexist, in order to enhance the understanding of the environment by CAVs to improve decision-making capabilities, this framework focuses on efficient scene representation and the modeling of spatial interaction behaviors of traffic states. We first extract features of the driving environment based on the background of intelligent networking. Subsequently, the local scene representation, which is based on the agent-centric and dynamic occupation grid, is calculated by the Transformer module. Besides, feasible region of the map is captured through the multi-head attention mechanism to reduce the collision of vehicles. Notably, spatial interaction behaviors, based on motion information, are modeled as graph structures and extracted via Graph Neural Network (GNN). Ultimately, the collaborative decision-making among multiple vehicles is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), with driving actions output by Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Our algorithmic validation is executed within the extremely challenging scenario of highway off-ramp task, thereby substantiating the superiority of agent-centric approach to scene representation. Simulation results demonstrate that the GITSR method can not only effectively capture scene representation but also extract spatial interaction data, outperforming the baseline method across various comparative metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lutfi Eren Erdogan, Vijay Anand Raghava Kanakagiri, Kurt Keutzer, Zhen Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the major bottlenecks for efficient deployment of neural network based recommendation systems is the memory footprint of their embedding tables. Although many neural network based recommendation systems could benefit from the faster on-chip memory access and increased computational power of hardware accelerators, the large embedding tables in these models often cannot fit on the constrained memory of accelerators. Despite the pervasiveness of these models, prior methods in memory optimization and parallelism fail to address the memory and communication costs of large embedding tables on accelerators. As a result, the majority of models are trained on CPUs, while current implementations of accelerators are hindered by issues such as bottlenecks in inter-device communication and main memory lookups. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that analyses the communication costs of arbitrary distributed systems that use lookup tables. We use this framework to propose algorithms that maximize throughput subject to memory, computation, and communication constraints. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method achieves strong theoretical performance across dataset distributions and memory constraints, applicable to a wide range of use cases from mobile federated learning to warehouse-scale computation. We implement our framework and algorithms in PyTorch and achieve up to 6x increases in training throughput on GPU systems over baselines, on the Criteo Terabytes dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neel P. Bhatt, Yunhao Yang, Rohan Siva, Daniel Milan, Ufuk Topcu, Zhangyang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal foundation models offer a promising framework for robotic perception and planning by processing sensory inputs to generate actionable plans. However, addressing uncertainty in both perception (sensory interpretation) and decision-making (plan generation) remains a critical challenge for ensuring task reliability. We present a comprehensive framework to disentangle, quantify, and mitigate these two forms of uncertainty. We first introduce a framework for uncertainty disentanglement, isolating perception uncertainty arising from limitations in visual understanding and decision uncertainty relating to the robustness of generated plans.
  To quantify each type of uncertainty, we propose methods tailored to the unique properties of perception and decision-making: we use conformal prediction to calibrate perception uncertainty and introduce Formal-Methods-Driven Prediction (FMDP) to quantify decision uncertainty, leveraging formal verification techniques for theoretical guarantees. Building on this quantification, we implement two targeted intervention mechanisms: an active sensing process that dynamically re-observes high-uncertainty scenes to enhance visual input quality and an automated refinement procedure that fine-tunes the model on high-certainty data, improving its capability to meet task specifications. Empirical validation in real-world and simulated robotic tasks demonstrates that our uncertainty disentanglement framework reduces variability by up to 40% and enhances task success rates by 5% compared to baselines. These improvements are attributed to the combined effect of both interventions and highlight the importance of uncertainty disentanglement which facilitates targeted interventions that enhance the robustness and reliability of autonomous systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel method, called MamT$^4$, which is used for simultaneous analysis of four mammography images. A decision is made based on one image of a breast, with attention also devoted to three additional images: another view of the same breast and two images of the other breast. This approach enables the algorithm to closely replicate the practice of a radiologist who reviews the entire set of mammograms for a patient. Furthermore, this paper emphasizes the preprocessing of images, specifically proposing a cropping model (U-Net based on ResNet-34) to help the method remove image artifacts and focus on the breast region. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to achieve a ROC-AUC of 84.0 $\pm$ 1.7 and an F1 score of 56.0 $\pm$ 1.3 on an independent test dataset of Vietnam digital mammography (VinDr-Mammo), which is preprocessed with the cropping model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjiao Tian, Chengyue Huang, Zsolt Kira</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern optimizers such as AdamW, equipped with momentum and adaptive learning rate, are designed to escape local minima and explore the vast parameter space. This exploration is beneficial for finding good loss basins when training from scratch. It is not necessarily ideal when resuming from a powerful foundation model because it can lead to large deviations from the pre-trained initialization and, consequently, worse robustness and generalization. At the same time, strong regularization on all parameters can lead to under-fitting. We hypothesize that selectively regularizing the parameter space is the key to fitting and retraining the pre-trained knowledge. This paper proposes a new weight decay technique, Selective Projection Decay (SPD), that selectively imposes a strong penalty on certain layers while allowing others to change freely. Intuitively, SPD expands and contracts the parameter search space for layers with consistent and inconsistent loss reduction, respectively. Experimentally, when equipped with SPD, Adam consistently provides better in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution robustness performance on multiple popular vision and language benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dohyun Kim, Pedro Sandoval-Segura</p>
<p>Abstract: The construction of large datasets for deep learning has raised concerns regarding unauthorized use of online data, leading to increased interest in protecting data from third-parties who want to use it for training. The Convolution-based Unlearnable DAtaset (CUDA) method aims to make data unlearnable by applying class-wise blurs to every image in the dataset so that neural networks learn relations between blur kernels and labels, as opposed to informative features for classifying clean data. In this work, we evaluate whether CUDA data remains unlearnable after image sharpening and frequency filtering, finding that this combination of simple transforms improves the utility of CUDA data for training. In particular, we observe a substantial increase in test accuracy over adversarial training for models trained with CUDA unlearnable data from CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100. In training models to high accuracy using unlearnable data, we underscore the need for ongoing refinement in data poisoning techniques to ensure data privacy. Our method opens new avenues for enhancing the robustness of unlearnable datasets by highlighting that simple methods such as sharpening and frequency filtering are capable of breaking convolution-based unlearnable datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanya Gatsak, Kumar Abhishek, Hanene Ben Yedder, Saeid Asgari Taghanaki, Ghassan Hamarneh</p>
<p>Abstract: PET imaging is an invaluable tool in clinical settings as it captures the functional activity of both healthy anatomy and cancerous lesions. Developing automatic lesion segmentation methods for PET images is crucial since manual lesion segmentation is laborious and prone to inter- and intra-observer variability. We propose PET-Disentangler, a 3D disentanglement method that uses a 3D UNet-like encoder-decoder architecture to disentangle disease and normal healthy anatomical features with losses for segmentation, reconstruction, and healthy component plausibility. A critic network is used to encourage the healthy latent features to match the distribution of healthy samples and thus encourages these features to not contain any lesion-related features. Our quantitative results show that PET-Disentangler is less prone to incorrectly declaring healthy and high tracer uptake regions as cancerous lesions, since such uptake pattern would be assigned to the disentangled healthy component.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengjie Niu, Lifan Lin, Jian Huang, Chao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a robust framework for harnessing the potential of unannotated data. Traditionally, SSL mandates that all classes possess labeled instances. However, the emergence of open-world SSL (OwSSL) introduces a more practical challenge, wherein unlabeled data may encompass samples from unseen classes. This scenario leads to misclassification of unseen classes as known ones, consequently undermining classification accuracy. To overcome this challenge, this study revisits two methodologies from self-supervised and semi-supervised learning, self-labeling and consistency, tailoring them to address the OwSSL problem. Specifically, we propose an effective framework called OwMatch, combining conditional self-labeling and open-world hierarchical thresholding. Theoretically, we analyze the estimation of class distribution on unlabeled data through rigorous statistical analysis, thus demonstrating that OwMatch can ensure the unbiasedness of the self-label assignment estimator with reliability. Comprehensive empirical analyses demonstrate that our method yields substantial performance enhancements across both known and unknown classes in comparison to previous studies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Wang, Bocheng Guo, Yijie Li, Junyi Wang, Yuqian Chen, Jarrett Rushmore, Nikos Makris, Yogesh Rathi, Lauren J O'Donnell, Fan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Tractography fiber clustering using diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a crucial strategy for white matter (WM) parcellation. Current methods primarily use the geometric information of fibers (i.e., the spatial trajectories) to group similar fibers into clusters, overlooking the important functional signals present along the fiber tracts. There is increasing evidence that neural activity in the WM can be measured using functional MRI (fMRI), offering potentially valuable multimodal information for fiber clustering. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning fiber clustering framework, namely Deep Multi-view Fiber Clustering (DMVFC), that uses joint dMRI and fMRI data to enable functionally consistent WM parcellation. DMVFC can effectively integrate the geometric characteristics of the WM fibers with the fMRI BOLD signals along the fiber tracts. It includes two major components: 1) a multi-view pretraining module to compute embedding features from fiber geometric information and functional signals separately, and 2) a collaborative fine-tuning module to simultaneously refine the two kinds of embeddings. In the experiments, we compare DMVFC with two state-of-the-art fiber clustering methods and demonstrate superior performance in achieving functionally meaningful and consistent WM parcellation results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors plays a key role in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumor diseases. It serves as a critical technology for quantifying tumors and extracting their features. With the increasing application of deep learning methods, the computational burden has become progressively heavier. To achieve a lightweight model with good segmentation performance, this study proposes the MBDRes-U-Net model using the three-dimensional (3D) U-Net codec framework, which integrates multibranch residual blocks and fused attention into the model. The computational burden of the model is reduced by the branch strategy, which effectively uses the rich local features in multimodal images and enhances the segmentation performance of subtumor regions. Additionally, during encoding, an adaptive weighted expansion convolution layer is introduced into the multi-branch residual block, which enriches the feature expression and improves the segmentation accuracy of the model. Experiments on the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge 2018 and 2019 datasets show that the architecture could maintain a high precision of brain tumor segmentation while considerably reducing the calculation overhead.Our code is released at https://github.com/Huaibei-normal-university-cv-laboratory/mbdresunet</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen He, Chuyun Shen, Xiangfeng Wang, Bo Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) aims to learn from sequential data stream in the decentralized federated learning setting, while simultaneously mitigating the catastrophic forgetting issue in classical continual learning. Existing FCL methods usually employ typical rehearsal mechanisms, which could result in privacy violations or additional onerous storage and computational burdens. In this work, an efficient and non-IID robust federated continual learning framework, called Federated Prototype-Augmented Prompt Learning (FPPL), is proposed. The FPPL can collaboratively learn lightweight prompts augmented by prototypes without rehearsal. On the client side, a fusion function is employed to fully leverage the knowledge contained in task-specific prompts for alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, global prototypes aggregated from the server are used to obtain unified representation through contrastive learning, mitigating the impact of non-IID-derived data heterogeneity. On the server side, locally uploaded prototypes are utilized to perform debiasing on the classifier, further alleviating the performance degradation caused by both non-IID and catastrophic forgetting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of FPPL, achieving notable performance with an efficient design while remaining robust to diverse non-IID degrees.

Both the anisotropic diffusion and the RANSAC-based plane extraction processes are optimized for parallel processing on GPUs, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Our approach achieves real-time performance, processing single frames at rates exceeding $30~Hz$, which facilitates detailed plane extraction and map management swiftly and efficiently. Extensive testing underscores the algorithm's capabilities in real-time scenarios and demonstrates its practical application in humanoid robot gait planning, significantly improving its ability to navigate dynamic environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre-Antoine Comby (MIND, JOLIOT), Benjamin Lapostolle (MIND), Matthieu Terris (MIND), Philippe Ciuciu (MIND, JOLIOT)</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving high-quality Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction at accelerated acquisition rates remains challenging due to the inherent ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. Traditional Compressed Sensing (CS) methods, while robust across varying acquisition settings, struggle to maintain good reconstruction quality at high acceleration factors ($\ge$ 8). Recent advances in deep learning have improved reconstruction quality, but purely data-driven methods are prone to overfitting and hallucination effects, notably when the acquisition setting is varying. Plug-and-Play (PnP) approaches have been proposed to mitigate the pitfalls of both frameworks. In a nutshell, PnP algorithms amount to replacing suboptimal handcrafted CS priors with powerful denoising deep neural network (DNNs). However, in MRI reconstruction, existing PnP methods often yield suboptimal results due to instabilities in the proximal gradient descent (PGD) schemes and the lack of curated, noiseless datasets for training robust denoisers. In this work, we propose a fully unsupervised preprocessing pipeline to generate clean, noiseless complex MRI signals from multicoil data, enabling training of a high-performance denoising DNN. Furthermore, we introduce an annealed Half-Quadratic Splitting (HQS) algorithm to address the instability issues, leading to significant improvements over existing PnP algorithms. When combined with preconditioning techniques, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, providing a robust and efficient solution for high-quality MRI reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxin Zhu, Bocheng Li, Yifei Xin, Linli Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used method for converting continuous representations into discrete codes, which has become fundamental in unsupervised representation learning and latent generative models. However, VQ models are often hindered by the problem of representation collapse in the latent space, which leads to low codebook utilization and limits the scalability of the codebook for large-scale training. Existing methods designed to mitigate representation collapse typically reduce the dimensionality of latent space at the expense of model capacity, which do not fully resolve the core issue. In this study, we conduct a theoretical analysis of representation collapse in VQ models and identify its primary cause as the disjoint optimization of the codebook, where only a small subset of code vectors are updated through gradient descent. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{SimVQ}, a novel method which reparameterizes the code vectors through a linear transformation layer based on a learnable latent basis. This transformation optimizes the \textit{entire linear space} spanned by the codebook, rather than merely updating \textit{the code vector} selected by the nearest-neighbor search in vanilla VQ models. Although it is commonly understood that the multiplication of two linear matrices is equivalent to applying a single linear layer, our approach works surprisingly well in resolving the collapse issue in VQ models with just one linear layer. We validate the efficacy of SimVQ through extensive experiments across various modalities, including image and audio data with different model architectures.

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image Diffusion Models has led to their widespread public accessibility. However these models, trained on large internet datasets, can sometimes generate undesirable outputs. To mitigate this, approximate Machine Unlearning algorithms have been proposed to modify model weights to reduce the generation of specific types of images, characterized by samples from a ``forget distribution'', while preserving the model's ability to generate other images, characterized by samples from a ``retain distribution''. While these methods aim to minimize the influence of training data in the forget distribution without extensive additional computation, we point out that they can compromise the model's integrity by inadvertently affecting generation for images in the retain distribution. Recognizing the limitations of FID and CLIPScore in capturing these effects, we introduce a novel retention metric that directly assesses the perceptual difference between outputs generated by the original and the unlearned models. We then propose unlearning algorithms that demonstrate superior effectiveness in preserving model integrity compared to existing baselines. Given their straightforward implementation, these algorithms serve as valuable benchmarks for future advancements in approximate Machine Unlearning for Diffusion Models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Color-word associations play a fundamental role in human cognition and design applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely available and demonstrated intelligent behaviors in various benchmarks with natural conversation skills. However, their ability to replicate human color-word associations remains understudied. We compared multiple generations of LLMs (from GPT-3 to GPT- 4o) against human color-word associations using data collected from over 10,000 Japanese participants, involving 17 colors and words from eight categories in Japanese. Our findings reveal a clear progression in LLM performance across generations, with GPT-4o achieving the highest accuracy in predicting the best voted word for each color and category, particularly when using visual inputs rather than text-based color codes. However, the highest median performance was approximately 50% even for GPT4-o with visual inputs (chance level is 10%), and the performance levels varied significantly across word categories and colors, indicating a failure to fully replicate human color-word associations. On the other hand, color discrimination ability estimated from our color-word association data showed that LLMs demonstrated high correlation with human color discrimination patterns, similarly to previous studies. Our study highlights both the advancements in LLM capabilities and their persistent limitations, suggesting differences in semantic memory structures between humans and LLMs in representing color-word associations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linglan Zhao, Xuerui Zhang, Ke Yan, Shouhong Ding, Weiran Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning aims to incrementally acquire new concepts in data streams while resisting forgetting previous knowledge. With the rise of powerful pre-trained models (PTMs), there is a growing interest in training incremental learning systems using these foundation models, rather than learning from scratch. Existing works often view PTMs as a strong initial point and directly apply parameter-efficient tuning (PET) in the first session for adapting to downstream tasks. In the following sessions, most methods freeze model parameters for tackling forgetting issues. However, applying PET directly to downstream data cannot fully explore the inherent knowledge in PTMs. Additionally, freezing the parameters in incremental sessions hinders models' plasticity to novel concepts not covered in the first session. To solve the above issues, we propose a Slow And Fast parameter-Efficient tuning (SAFE) framework. In particular, to inherit general knowledge from foundation models, we include a transfer loss function by measuring the correlation between the PTM and the PET-applied model. After calibrating in the first session, the slow efficient tuning parameters can capture more informative features, improving generalization to incoming classes. Moreover, to further incorporate novel concepts, we strike a balance between stability and plasticity by fixing slow efficient tuning parameters and continuously updating the fast ones. Specifically, a cross-classification loss with feature alignment is proposed to circumvent catastrophic forgetting. During inference, we introduce an entropy-based aggregation strategy to dynamically utilize the complementarity in the slow and fast learners. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our method by significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p>Abstract: While overparameterization is known to benefit generalization, its impact on Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection is less understood. This paper investigates the influence of model complexity in OOD detection. We propose an expected OOD risk metric to evaluate classifiers confidence on both training and OOD samples. Leveraging Random Matrix Theory, we derive bounds for the expected OOD risk of binary least-squares classifiers applied to Gaussian data. We show that the OOD risk depicts an infinite peak, when the number of parameters is equal to the number of samples, which we associate with the double descent phenomenon. Our experimental study on different OOD detection methods across multiple neural architectures extends our theoretical insights and highlights a double descent curve. Our observations suggest that overparameterization does not necessarily lead to better OOD detection. Using the Neural Collapse framework, we provide insights to better understand this behavior. To facilitate reproducibility, our code will be made publicly available upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Brandon Graham-Knight, Jamil Fayyad, Nourhan Bayasi, Patricia Lasserre, Homayoun Najjaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Class imbalance and label noise are pervasive in large-scale datasets, yet much of machine learning research assumes well-labeled, balanced data, which rarely reflects real world conditions. Existing approaches typically address either label noise or class imbalance in isolation, leading to suboptimal results when both issues coexist. In this work, we propose Conformal-in-the-Loop (CitL), a novel training framework that addresses both challenges with a conformal prediction-based approach. CitL evaluates sample uncertainty to adjust weights and prune unreliable examples, enhancing model resilience and accuracy with minimal computational cost. Our extensive experiments include a detailed analysis showing how CitL effectively emphasizes impactful data in noisy, imbalanced datasets. Our results show that CitL consistently boosts model performance, achieving up to a 6.1% increase in classification accuracy and a 5.0 mIoU improvement in segmentation. Our code is publicly available: CitL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinkai Liu, Mahdi Boloursaz Mashhadi, Li Qiao, Yi Ma, Rahim Tafazolli, Mehdi Bennis</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have recently shown great success in synthesizing multimedia signals with high perceptual quality enabling highly efficient semantic communications in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop an intent-aware generative semantic multicasting framework utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. In the proposed framework, the transmitter decomposes the source signal to multiple semantic classes based on the multi-user intent, i.e. each user is assumed to be interested in details of only a subset of the semantic classes. The transmitter then sends to each user only its intended classes, and multicasts a highly compressed semantic map to all users over shared wireless resources that allows them to locally synthesize the other classes, i.e. non-intended classes, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. The signal retrieved at each user is thereby partially reconstructed and partially synthesized utilizing the received semantic map. This improves utilization of the wireless resources, with better preserving privacy of the non-intended classes. We design a communication/computation-aware scheme for per-class adaptation of the communication parameters, such as the transmission power and compression rate to minimize the total latency of retrieving signals at multiple receivers, tailored to the prevailing channel conditions as well as the users reconstruction/synthesis distortion/perception requirements. The simulation results demonstrate significantly reduced per-user latency compared with non-generative and intent-unaware multicasting benchmarks while maintaining high perceptual quality of the signals retrieved at the users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenliang Zhou, Alejandro Sztrajman, Gilles Rainer, Fangcheng Zhong, Fazilet Gokbudak, Zhilin Guo, Weihao Xia, Rafal Mantiuk, Cengiz Oztireli</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the physically based neural bidirectional reflectance distribution function (PBNBRDF), a novel, continuous representation for material appearance based on neural fields. Our model accurately reconstructs real-world materials while uniquely enforcing physical properties for realistic BRDFs, specifically Helmholtz reciprocity via reparametrization and energy passivity via efficient analytical integration. We conduct a systematic analysis demonstrating the benefits of adhering to these physical laws on the visual quality of reconstructed materials. Additionally, we enhance the color accuracy of neural BRDFs by introducing chromaticity enforcement supervising the norms of RGB channels. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments on multiple databases of measured real-world BRDFs, we show that adhering to these physical constraints enables neural fields to more faithfully and stably represent the original data and achieve higher rendering quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mirrors can degrade the performance of computer vision models, however to accurately detect mirrors in images remains challenging. YOLOv4 achieves phenomenal results both in object detection accuracy and speed, nevertheless the model often fails in detecting mirrors. In this paper, a novel mirror detection method `Mirror-YOLO' is proposed, which mainly targets on mirror detection. Based on YOLOv4, the proposed model embeds an attention mechanism for better feature acquisition, and a hypercolumn-stairstep approach for feature map fusion. Mirror-YOLO can also produce accurate bounding polygons for instance segmentation. The effectiveness of our proposed model is demonstrated by our experiments, compared to the existing mirror detection methods, the proposed Mirror-YOLO achieves better performance in detection accuracy on the mirror image dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziting Wen, Oscar Pizarro, Stefan Williams</p>
<p>Abstract: Training deep models with limited annotations poses a significant challenge when applied to diverse practical domains. Employing semi-supervised learning alongside the self-supervised model offers the potential to enhance label efficiency. However, this approach faces a bottleneck in reducing the need for labels. We observed that the semi-supervised model disrupts valuable information from self-supervised learning when only limited labels are available. To address this issue, this paper proposes a simple yet effective framework, active self-semi-supervised learning (AS3L). AS3L bootstraps semi-supervised models with prior pseudo-labels (PPL). These PPLs are obtained by label propagation over self-supervised features. Based on the observations the accuracy of PPL is not only affected by the quality of features but also by the selection of the labeled samples. We develop active learning and label propagation strategies to obtain accurate PPL. Consequently, our framework can significantly improve the performance of models in the case of limited annotations while demonstrating fast convergence. On the image classification tasks across four datasets, our method outperforms the baseline by an average of 5.4\%. Additionally, it achieves the same accuracy as the baseline method in about 1/3 of the training time.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14912">Impact of Strategic Sampling and Supervision Policies on Semi-supervised Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuvendu Roy, Ali Etemad</p>
<p>Abstract: In semi-supervised representation learning frameworks, when the number of labelled data is very scarce, the quality and representativeness of these samples become increasingly important. Existing literature on semi-supervised learning randomly sample a limited number of data points for labelling. All these labelled samples are then used along with the unlabelled data throughout the training process. In this work, we ask two important questions in this context: (1) does it matter which samples are selected for labelling? (2) does it matter how the labelled samples are used throughout the training process along with the unlabelled data? To answer the first question, we explore a number of unsupervised methods for selecting specific subsets of data to label (without prior knowledge of their labels), with the goal of maximizing representativeness w.r.t. the unlabelled set. Then, for our second line of inquiry, we define a variety of different label injection strategies in the training process. Extensive experiments on four popular datasets, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and STL-10, show that unsupervised selection of samples that are more representative of the entire data improves performance by up to ~2% over the existing semi-supervised frameworks such as MixMatch, ReMixMatch, FixMatch and others with random sample labelling. We show that this boost could even increase to 7.5% for very few-labelled scenarios. However, our study shows that gradually injecting the labels throughout the training procedure does not impact the performance considerably versus when all the existing labels are used throughout the entire training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehui Liao, Shishuai Hu, Yutong Xie, Yong Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Noise transition matrix (NTM) estimation is a promising approach for learning with label noise. It can infer clean posterior probabilities, known as Label Distribution (LD), based on noisy ones and reduce the impact of noisy labels. However, this estimation is challenging, since the ground truth labels are not always available. Most existing methods estimate a global NTM using either correctly labeled samples (anchor points) or detected reliable samples (pseudo anchor points). These methods heavily rely on the existence of anchor points or the quality of pseudo ones, and the global NTM can hardly provide accurate label transition information for each sample, since the label noise in real applications is mostly instance-dependent. To address these challenges, we propose an Instance-dependent Label Distribution Estimation (ILDE) method to learn from noisy labels for image classification. The method's workflow has three major steps. First, we estimate each sample's noisy posterior probability, supervised by noisy labels. Second, since mislabeling probability closely correlates with inter-class correlation, we compute the inter-class correlation matrix to estimate the NTM, bypassing the need for (pseudo) anchor points. Moreover, for a precise approximation of the instance-dependent NTM, we calculate the inter-class correlation matrix using only mini-batch samples rather than the entire training dataset. Third, we transform the noisy posterior probability into instance-dependent LD by multiplying it with the estimated NTM, using the resulting LD for enhanced supervision to prevent DCNNs from memorizing noisy labels. The proposed ILDE method has been evaluated against several state-of-the-art methods on two synthetic and three real-world noisy datasets. Our results indicate that the proposed ILDE method outperforms all competing methods, no matter whether the noise is synthetic or real noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saqib Javed, Chengkun Li, Andrew Price, Yinlin Hu, Mathieu Salzmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Edge applications, such as collaborative robotics and spacecraft rendezvous, demand efficient 6D object pose estimation on resource-constrained embedded platforms. Existing 6D pose estimation networks are often too large for such deployments, necessitating compression while maintaining reliable performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Modular Quantization-Aware Training (MQAT), an adaptive and mixed-precision quantization-aware training strategy that exploits the modular structure of modern 6D pose estimation architectures. MQAT guides a systematic gradated modular quantization sequence and determines module-specific bit precisions, leading to quantized models that outperform those produced by state-of-the-art uniform and mixed-precision quantization techniques. Our experiments showcase the generality of MQAT across datasets, architectures, and quantization algorithms. Remarkably, MQAT-trained quantized models achieve a significant accuracy boost (>7%) over the baseline full-precision network while reducing model size by a factor of 4x or more.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kegang Wang, Yantao Wei, Jiankai Tang, Yuntao Wang, Mingwen Tong, Jie Gao, Yujian Ma, Zhongjin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, due to the widespread use of internet videos, remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has gained more and more attention in the fields of affective computing. Restoring blood volume pulse (BVP) signals from facial videos is a challenging task that involves a series of preprocessing, image algorithms, and postprocessing to restore waveforms. Not only is the heart rate metric utilized for affective computing, but the heart rate variability (HRV) metric is even more significant. The challenge in obtaining HRV indices through rPPG lies in the necessity for algorithms to precisely predict the BVP peak positions. In this paper, we collected the Remote Learning Affect and Physiology (RLAP) dataset, which includes over 32 hours of highly synchronized video and labels from 58 subjects. This is a public dataset whose BVP labels have been meticulously designed to better suit the training of HRV models. Using the RLAP dataset, we trained a new model called Seq-rPPG, it is a model based on one-dimensional convolution, and experimental results reveal that this structure is more suitable for handling HRV tasks, which outperformed all other baselines in HRV performance and also demonstrated significant advantages in computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> De Cheng, Lingfeng He, Nannan Wang, Shizhou Zhang, Zhen Wang, Xinbo Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID) aims to match pedestrian images of the same identity from different modalities without annotations. Existing works mainly focus on alleviating the modality gap by aligning instance-level features of the unlabeled samples. However, the relationships between cross-modality clusters are not well explored. To this end, we propose a novel bilateral cluster matching-based learning framework to reduce the modality gap by matching cross-modality clusters. Specifically, we design a Many-to-many Bilateral Cross-Modality Cluster Matching (MBCCM) algorithm through optimizing the maximum matching problem in a bipartite graph. Then, the matched pairwise clusters utilize shared visible and infrared pseudo-labels during the model training. Under such a supervisory signal, a Modality-Specific and Modality-Agnostic (MSMA) contrastive learning framework is proposed to align features jointly at a cluster-level. Meanwhile, the cross-modality Consistency Constraint (CC) is proposed to explicitly reduce the large modality discrepancy. Extensive experiments on the public SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin of 8.76% mAP on average.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> De Cheng, Xiaojian Huang, Nannan Wang, Lingfeng He, Zhihui Li, Xinbo Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised learning visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID) aims at learning modality-invariant features from unlabeled cross-modality dataset, which is crucial for practical applications in video surveillance systems. The key to essentially address the USL-VI-ReID task is to solve the cross-modality data association problem for further heterogeneous joint learning. To address this issue, we propose a Dual Optimal Transport Label Assignment (DOTLA) framework to simultaneously assign the generated labels from one modality to its counterpart modality. The proposed DOTLA mechanism formulates a mutual reinforcement and efficient solution to cross-modality data association, which could effectively reduce the side-effects of some insufficient and noisy label associations. Besides, we further propose a cross-modality neighbor consistency guided label refinement and regularization module, to eliminate the negative effects brought by the inaccurate supervised signals, under the assumption that the prediction or label distribution of each example should be similar to its nearest neighbors. Extensive experimental results on the public SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing existing state-of-the-art approach by a large margin of 7.76% mAP on average, which even surpasses some supervised VI-ReID methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Luo, Siyang Song, Weicheng Xie, Micol Spitale, Zongyuan Ge, Linlin Shen, Hatice Gunes</p>
<p>Abstract: In dyadic interaction, predicting the listener's facial reactions is challenging as different reactions could be appropriate in response to the same speaker's behaviour. Previous approaches predominantly treated this task as an interpolation or fitting problem, emphasizing deterministic outcomes but ignoring the diversity and uncertainty of human facial reactions. Furthermore, these methods often failed to model short-range and long-range dependencies within the interaction context, leading to issues in the synchrony and appropriateness of the generated facial reactions. To address these limitations, this paper reformulates the task as an extrapolation or prediction problem, and proposes an novel framework (called ReactFace) to generate multiple different but appropriate facial reactions from a speaker behaviour rather than merely replicating the corresponding listener facial behaviours. Our ReactFace generates multiple different but appropriate photo-realistic human facial reactions by: (i) learning an appropriate facial reaction distribution representing multiple different but appropriate facial reactions; and (ii) synchronizing the generated facial reactions with the speaker verbal and non-verbal behaviours at each time stamp, resulting in realistic 2D facial reaction sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating multiple diverse, synchronized, and appropriate facial reactions from each speaker's behaviour. The quality of the generated facial reactions is intimately tied to the speaker's speech and facial expressions, achieved through our novel speaker-listener interaction modules.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Zhang, Kailun Yang, Jiacheng Lin, Jin Yuan, Zhiyong Li, Shutao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Integration of diverse visual prompts like clicks, scribbles, and boxes in interactive image segmentation significantly facilitates users' interaction as well as improves interaction efficiency. However, existing studies primarily encode the position or pixel regions of prompts without considering the contextual areas around them, resulting in insufficient prompt feedback, which is not conducive to performance acceleration. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a simple yet effective Probabilistic Visual Prompt Unified Transformer (PVPUFormer) for interactive image segmentation, which allows users to flexibly input diverse visual prompts with the probabilistic prompt encoding and feature post-processing to excavate sufficient and robust prompt features for performance boosting. Specifically, we first propose a Probabilistic Prompt-unified Encoder (PPuE) to generate a unified one-dimensional vector by exploring both prompt and non-prompt contextual information, offering richer feedback cues to accelerate performance improvement. On this basis, we further present a Prompt-to-Pixel Contrastive (P$^2$C) loss to accurately align both prompt and pixel features, bridging the representation gap between them to offer consistent feature representations for mask prediction. Moreover, our approach designs a Dual-cross Merging Attention (DMA) module to implement bidirectional feature interaction between image and prompt features, generating notable features for performance improvement. A comprehensive variety of experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrates that the proposed components achieve consistent improvements, yielding state-of-the-art interactive segmentation performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Garvita Allabadi, Ana Lucic, Siddarth Aananth, Tiffany Yang, Yu-Xiong Wang, Vikram Adve</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional semi-supervised object detection methods assume a fixed set of object classes (in-distribution or ID classes) during training and deployment, which limits performance in real-world scenarios where unseen classes (out-of-distribution or OOD classes) may appear. In such cases, OOD data is often misclassified as ID, thus harming the ID classes accuracy. Open-set methods address this limitation by filtering OOD data to improve ID performance, thereby limiting the learning process to ID classes. We extend this to a more natural open-world setting, where the OOD classes are not only detected but also incorporated into the learning process. Specifically, we explore two key questions: 1) how to accurately detect OOD samples, and, most importantly, 2) how to effectively learn from the OOD samples in a semi-supervised object detection pipeline without compromising ID accuracy. To address this, we introduce an ensemble-based OOD Explorer for detection and classification, and an adaptable semi-supervised object detection framework that integrates both ID and OOD data. Through extensive evaluation on different open-world scenarios, we demonstrate that our method performs competitively against state-of-the-art OOD detection algorithms and also significantly boosts the semi-supervised learning performance for both ID and OOD classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shervin Halat, Mohammad Rahmati, Ehsan Nazerfard</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, significant advancements in artificial intelligence have been attributed to the integration of self-supervised learning (SSL) scheme. While SSL has shown impressive achievements in natural language processing (NLP), its progress in computer vision has comparatively lagged behind. However, the incorporation of contrastive learning into existing visual SSL models has led to considerable progress, often surpassing supervised counterparts. Nonetheless, these improvements have been mostly limited to classification tasks. Moreover, few studies have evaluated visual SSL models in real-world scenarios, as most have focused on datasets with class-wise portrait images, notably ImageNet. Here, we focus on dense prediction tasks using security inspection x-ray images to evaluate our proposed model, Segment Localization (SegLoc). Based upon the Instance Localization (InsLoc) model, SegLoc addresses one of the key challenges of contrastive learning, i.e., false negative pairs of query embeddings. Our pre-training dataset is synthesized by cutting, transforming, and pasting labeled segments from an existing labeled dataset (PIDray) as foregrounds onto instances from an unlabeled dataset (SIXray) as backgrounds. Furthermore, we fully leverage the labeled data by incorporating the concept, one queue per class, into the MoCo-v2 memory bank, thereby avoiding false negative pairs. In our experiments, SegLoc outperformed random initialization by 3% to 6% while underperformed supervised initialization, in terms of AR and AP metrics across different IoU values over 20 to 30 pre-training epochs.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new multi-modal task, termed audio-visual instance segmentation (AVIS), which aims to simultaneously identify, segment and track individual sounding object instances in audible videos. To facilitate this research, we introduce a high-quality benchmark named AVISeg, containing over 90K instance masks from 26 semantic categories in 926 long videos. Additionally, we propose a strong baseline model for this task. Our model first localizes sound source within each frame, and condenses object-specific contexts into concise tokens. Then it builds long-range audio-visual dependencies between these tokens using window-based attention, and tracks sounding objects among the entire video sequences. Extensive experiments reveal that our method performs best on AVISeg, surpassing the existing methods from related tasks. We further conduct the evaluation on several multi-modal large models; however, they exhibits subpar performance on instance-level sound source localization and temporal perception. We expect that AVIS will inspire the community towards a more comprehensive multi-modal understanding. The dataset and code will soon be released on https://github.com/ruohaoguo/avis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgii Mikriukov, Gesina Schwalbe, Korinna Bade</p>
<p>Abstract: Insights into the learned latent representations are imperative for verifying deep neural networks (DNNs) in critical computer vision (CV) tasks. Therefore, state-of-the-art supervised Concept-based eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (C-XAI) methods associate user-defined concepts like ``car'' each with a single vector in the DNN latent space (concept embedding vector). In the case of concept segmentation, these linearly separate between activation map pixels belonging to a concept and those belonging to background. Existing methods for concept segmentation, however, fall short of capturing sub-concepts (e.g., ``proximate car'' and ``distant car''), and concept overlap (e.g., between ``bus'' and ``truck''). In other words, they do not capture the full distribution of concept representatives in latent space. For the first time, this work shows that these simplifications are frequently broken and that distribution information can be particularly useful for understanding DNN-learned notions of sub-concepts, concept confusion, and concept outliers. To allow exploration of learned concept distributions, we propose a novel local concept analysis framework. Instead of optimizing a single global concept vector on the complete dataset, it generates a local concept embedding (LoCE) vector for each individual sample. We use the distribution formed by LoCEs to explore the latent concept distribution by fitting Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), hierarchical clustering, and concept-level information retrieval and outlier detection. Despite its context sensitivity, our method's concept segmentation performance is competitive to global baselines. Analysis results are obtained on two datasets and five diverse vision DNN architectures, including vision transformers (ViTs).</p>

<p>Abstract: Current test-time adaptation (TTA) approaches aim to adapt a machine learning model to environments that change continuously. Yet, it is unclear whether TTA methods can maintain their adaptability over prolonged periods. To answer this question, we introduce a diagnostic setting - recurring TTA where environments not only change but also recur over time, creating an extensive data stream. This setting allows us to examine the error accumulation of TTA models, in the most basic scenario, when they are regularly exposed to previous testing environments. Furthermore, we simulate a TTA process on a simple yet representative $\epsilon$-perturbed Gaussian Mixture Model Classifier, deriving theoretical insights into the dataset- and algorithm-dependent factors contributing to gradual performance degradation. Our investigation leads us to propose persistent TTA (PeTTA), which senses when the model is diverging towards collapse and adjusts the adaptation strategy, striking a balance between the dual objectives of adaptation and model collapse prevention. The supreme stability of PeTTA over existing approaches, in the face of lifelong TTA scenarios, has been demonstrated over comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renan A. Rojas-Gomez, Karan Singhal, Ali Etemad, Alex Bijamov, Warren R. Morningstar, Philip Andrew Mansfield</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing data augmentation in self-supervised learning, while diverse, fails to preserve the inherent structure of natural images. This results in distorted augmented samples with compromised semantic information, ultimately impacting downstream performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose SASSL: Style Augmentations for Self Supervised Learning, a novel data augmentation technique based on Neural Style Transfer. SASSL decouples semantic and stylistic attributes in images and applies transformations exclusively to their style while preserving content, generating diverse samples that better retain semantic information. SASSL boosts top-1 image classification accuracy on ImageNet by up to 2 percentage points compared to established self-supervised methods like MoCo, SimCLR, and BYOL, while achieving superior transfer learning performance across various datasets. Because SASSL can be performed asynchronously as part of the data augmentation pipeline, these performance impacts can be obtained with no change in pretraining throughput.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Xu, Joseph G. Lambourne, Pradeep Kumar Jayaraman, Zhengqing Wang, Karl D. D. Willis, Yasutaka Furukawa</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents BrepGen, a diffusion-based generative approach that directly outputs a Boundary representation (B-rep) Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model. BrepGen represents a B-rep model as a novel structured latent geometry in a hierarchical tree. With the root node representing a whole CAD solid, each element of a B-rep model (i.e., a face, an edge, or a vertex) progressively turns into a child-node from top to bottom. B-rep geometry information goes into the nodes as the global bounding box of each primitive along with a latent code describing the local geometric shape. The B-rep topology information is implicitly represented by node duplication. When two faces share an edge, the edge curve will appear twice in the tree, and a T-junction vertex with three incident edges appears six times in the tree with identical node features. Starting from the root and progressing to the leaf, BrepGen employs Transformer-based diffusion models to sequentially denoise node features while duplicated nodes are detected and merged, recovering the B-Rep topology information. Extensive experiments show that BrepGen advances the task of CAD B-rep generation, surpassing existing methods on various benchmarks. Results on our newly collected furniture dataset further showcase its exceptional capability in generating complicated geometry. While previous methods were limited to generating simple prismatic shapes, BrepGen incorporates free-form and doubly-curved surfaces for the first time. Additional applications of BrepGen include CAD autocomplete and design interpolation. The code, pretrained models, and dataset are available at https://github.com/samxuxiang/BrepGen.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oryan Yehezkel, Alon Zolfi, Amit Baras, Yuval Elovici, Asaf Shabtai</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision transformers have contributed greatly to advancements in the computer vision domain, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in diverse tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection). However, their high computational requirements grow quadratically with the number of tokens used. Token sparsification mechanisms have been proposed to address this issue. These mechanisms employ an input-dependent strategy, in which uninformative tokens are discarded from the computation pipeline, improving the model's efficiency. However, their dynamism and average-case assumption makes them vulnerable to a new threat vector - carefully crafted adversarial examples capable of fooling the sparsification mechanism, resulting in worst-case performance. In this paper, we present DeSparsify, an attack targeting the availability of vision transformers that use token sparsification mechanisms. The attack aims to exhaust the operating system's resources, while maintaining its stealthiness. Our evaluation demonstrates the attack's effectiveness on three token sparsification mechanisms and examines the attack's transferability between them and its effect on the GPU resources. To mitigate the impact of the attack, we propose various countermeasures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Zhang, Daoping Zhang, Lok Ming Lui</p>
<p>Abstract: Image segmentation plays a crucial role in extracting important objects of interest from images, enabling various applications. While existing methods have shown success in segmenting clean images, they often struggle to produce accurate segmentation results when dealing with degraded images, such as those containing noise or occlusions. To address this challenge, interactive segmentation has emerged as a promising approach, allowing users to provide meaningful input to guide the segmentation process. However, an important problem in interactive segmentation lies in determining how to incorporate minimal yet meaningful user guidance into the segmentation model. In this paper, we propose the quasi-conformal interactive segmentation (QIS) model, which incorporates user input in the form of positive and negative clicks. Users mark a few pixels belonging to the object region as positive clicks, indicating that the segmentation model should include a region around these clicks. Conversely, negative clicks are provided on pixels belonging to the background, instructing the model to exclude the region near these clicks from the segmentation mask. Additionally, the segmentation mask is obtained by deforming a template mask with the same topology as the object of interest using an orientation-preserving quasiconformal mapping. This approach helps to avoid topological errors in the segmentation results. We provide a thorough analysis of the proposed model, including theoretical support for the ability of QIS to include or exclude regions of interest or disinterest based on the user's indication. To evaluate the performance of QIS, we conduct experiments on synthesized images, medical images, natural images and noisy natural images. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Unnervik, Hatef Otroshi Shahreza, Anjith George, S\'ebastien Marcel</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks allow an attacker to embed a specific vulnerability in a machine learning algorithm, activated when an attacker-chosen pattern is presented, causing a specific misprediction. The need to identify backdoors in biometric scenarios has led us to propose a novel technique with different trade-offs. In this paper we propose to use model pairs on open-set classification tasks for detecting backdoors. Using a simple linear operation to project embeddings from a probe model's embedding space to a reference model's embedding space, we can compare both embeddings and compute a similarity score. We show that this score, can be an indicator for the presence of a backdoor despite models being of different architectures, having been trained independently and on different datasets. This technique allows for the detection of backdoors on models designed for open-set classification tasks, which is little studied in the literature. Additionally, we show that backdoors can be detected even when both models are backdoored. The source code is made available for reproducibility purposes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Danish, SM Labib, Britta Ricker, Marco Helbich</p>
<p>Abstract: Street View Imagery (SVI) is a valuable data source for studies (e.g., environmental assessments, green space identification or land cover classification). While commercial SVI is available, such providers commonly restrict copying or reuse in ways necessary for research. Open SVI datasets are readily available from less restrictive sources, such as Mapillary, but due to the heterogeneity of the images, these require substantial preprocessing, filtering, and careful quality checks. We present an efficient method for automated downloading, processing, cropping, and filtering open SVI, to be used in a survey of human perceptions of the streets portrayed in these images. We demonstrate our open-source reusable SVI preparation and smartphone-friendly perception-survey software with Amsterdam (Netherlands) as the case study. Using a citizen science approach, we collected from 331 people 22,637 ratings about their perceptions for various criteria. We have published our software in a public repository for future re-use and reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajie Fan, Amal Trigui, Thomas B\"ack, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: A great interest has arisen in using Deep Generative Models (DGM) for generative design. When assessing the quality of the generated designs, human designers focus more on structural plausibility, e.g., no missing component, rather than visual artifacts, e.g., noises or blurriness. Meanwhile, commonly used metrics such as Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) may not evaluate accurately because they are sensitive to visual artifacts and tolerant to semantic errors. As such, FID might not be suitable to assess the performance of DGMs for a generative design task. In this work, we propose to encode the to-be-evaluated images with a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) and measure the distribution distance in the resulting latent space. Hereby, we design a novel metric Fr\'echet Denoised Distance (FDD). We experimentally test our FDD, FID and other state-of-the-art metrics on multiple datasets, e.g., BIKED, Seeing3DChairs, FFHQ and ImageNet. Our FDD can effectively detect implausible structures and is more consistent with structural inspections by human experts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu You, Yifei Min, Weicheng Dai, Jasjeet S. Sekhon, Lawrence Staib, James S. Duncan</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models, like CLIP, has yielded success on diverse downstream tasks. However, several pain points persist for this paradigm: (i) directly tuning entire pre-trained models becomes both time-intensive and computationally costly. Additionally, these tuned models tend to become highly specialized, limiting their practicality for real-world deployment; (ii) recent studies indicate that pre-trained vision-language classifiers may overly depend on spurious features -- patterns that correlate with the target in training data, but are not related to the true labeling function; and (iii) existing studies on mitigating the reliance on spurious features, largely based on the assumption that we can identify such features, does not provide definitive assurance for real-world applications. As a piloting study, this work focuses on exploring mitigating the reliance on spurious features for CLIP without using any group annotation. To this end, we systematically study the existence of spurious correlation on CLIP and CLIP+ERM. We first, following recent work on Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR), verify that last-layer retraining can greatly improve group robustness on pretrained CLIP. In view of them, we advocate a lightweight representation calibration method for fine-tuning CLIP, by first generating a calibration set using the pretrained CLIP, and then calibrating representations of samples within this set through contrastive learning, all without the need for group labels. Extensive experiments and in-depth visualizations on several benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our proposals, largely reducing reliance and significantly boosting the model generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Suk, Baris Imre, Jelmer M. Wolterink</p>
<p>Abstract: Many anatomical structures can be described by surface or volume meshes. Machine learning is a promising tool to extract information from these 3D models. However, high-fidelity meshes often contain hundreds of thousands of vertices, which creates unique challenges in building deep neural network architectures. Furthermore, patient-specific meshes may not be canonically aligned which limits the generalisation of machine learning algorithms. We propose LaB-GATr, a transfomer neural network with geometric tokenisation that can effectively learn with large-scale (bio-)medical surface and volume meshes through sequence compression and interpolation. Our method extends the recently proposed geometric algebra transformer (GATr) and thus respects all Euclidean symmetries, i.e. rotation, translation and reflection, effectively mitigating the problem of canonical alignment between patients. LaB-GATr achieves state-of-the-art results on three tasks in cardiovascular hemodynamics modelling and neurodevelopmental phenotype prediction, featuring meshes of up to 200,000 vertices. Our results demonstrate that LaB-GATr is a powerful architecture for learning with high-fidelity meshes which has the potential to enable interesting downstream applications. Our implementation is publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qizhou Wang, Yong Lin, Yongqiang Chen, Ludwig Schmidt, Bo Han, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision language models, such as CLIP, demonstrate impressive robustness to spurious features than single-modal models trained on ImageNet. However, existing test datasets are typically curated based on ImageNet-trained models, which aim to capture the spurious features inherited in ImageNet. Benchmarking CLIP models based on the ImageNet-oriented spurious features may not be sufficient to reflect the extent to which CLIP models are robust to spurious correlations within CLIP training data, e.g., LAION. To this end, we craft a new challenging dataset named CounterAnimal designed to reveal the reliance of CLIP models on realistic spurious features. Specifically, we split animal photos into groups according to the backgrounds, and then identify a pair of groups for each class where a CLIP model shows high-performance drops across the two groups. Our evaluations show that the spurious features captured by CounterAnimal are generically learned by CLIP models with different backbones and pre-train data, yet have limited influence for ImageNet models. We provide theoretical insights that the CLIP objective cannot offer additional robustness. Furthermore, we also re-evaluate strategies such as scaling up parameters and high-quality pre-trained data. We find that they still help mitigate the spurious features, providing a promising path for future developments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Li, Tzu-Chen Chiu, Hsiang-Wei Huang, Min-Te Sun, Wei-Shinn Ku</p>
<p>Abstract: In the dynamic and evolving field of computer vision, action recognition has become a key focus, especially with the advent of sophisticated methodologies like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Convolutional 3D, Transformer, and spatial-temporal feature fusion. These technologies have shown promising results on well-established benchmarks but face unique challenges in real-world applications, particularly in sports analysis, where the precise decomposition of activities and the distinction of subtly different actions are crucial. Existing datasets like UCF101, HMDB51, and Kinetics have offered a diverse range of video data for various scenarios. However, there's an increasing need for fine-grained video datasets that capture detailed categorizations and nuances within broader action categories. In this paper, we introduce the VideoBadminton dataset derived from high-quality badminton footage. Through an exhaustive evaluation of leading methodologies on this dataset, this study aims to advance the field of action recognition, particularly in badminton sports. The introduction of VideoBadminton could not only serve for badminton action recognition but also provide a dataset for recognizing fine-grained actions. The insights gained from these evaluations are expected to catalyze further research in action comprehension, especially within sports contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the dynamic field of digital content creation using generative models, state-of-the-art video editing models still do not offer the level of quality and control that users desire. Previous works on video editing either extended from image-based generative models in a zero-shot manner or necessitated extensive fine-tuning, which can hinder the production of fluid video edits. Furthermore, these methods frequently rely on textual input as the editing guidance, leading to ambiguities and limiting the types of edits they can perform. Recognizing these challenges, we introduce AnyV2V, a novel tuning-free paradigm designed to simplify video editing into two primary steps: (1) employing an off-the-shelf image editing model to modify the first frame, (2) utilizing an existing image-to-video generation model to generate the edited video through temporal feature injection. AnyV2V can leverage any existing image editing tools to support an extensive array of video editing tasks, including prompt-based editing, reference-based style transfer, subject-driven editing, and identity manipulation, which were unattainable by previous methods. AnyV2V can also support any video length. Our evaluation shows that AnyV2V achieved CLIP-scores comparable to other baseline methods. Furthermore, AnyV2V significantly outperformed these baselines in human evaluations, demonstrating notable improvements in visual consistency with the source video while producing high-quality edits across all editing tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiping Zhuang, Yuchen Liu, Run He, Kai Tong, Ziqian Zeng, Cen Chen, Yi Wang, Lap-Pui Chau</p>
<p>Abstract: Online Class Incremental Learning (OCIL) aims to train models incrementally, where data arrive in mini-batches, and previous data are not accessible. A major challenge in OCIL is Catastrophic Forgetting, i.e., the loss of previously learned knowledge. Among existing baselines, replay-based methods show competitive results but requires extra memory for storing exemplars, while exemplar-free (i.e., data need not be stored for replay in production) methods are resource-friendly but often lack accuracy. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-free approach--Forward-only Online Analytic Learning (F-OAL). Unlike traditional methods, F-OAL does not rely on back-propagation and is forward-only, significantly reducing memory usage and computational time. Cooperating with a pre-trained frozen encoder with Feature Fusion, F-OAL only needs to update a linear classifier by recursive least square. This approach simultaneously achieves high accuracy and low resource consumption. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate F-OAL's robust performance in OCIL scenarios.

To address these challenges, we collect and introduce the large-scale Visual CoT dataset comprising 438k question-answer pairs, annotated with intermediate bounding boxes highlighting key regions essential for answering the questions. Additionally, about 98k pairs of them are annotated with detailed reasoning steps. Importantly, we propose a multi-turn processing pipeline that dynamically focuses on visual inputs and provides interpretable thoughts. We also introduce the related benchmark to evaluate the MLLMs in scenarios requiring specific local region identification. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and shed light on better inference strategies.

<p>Abstract: We present SplatFace, a novel Gaussian splatting framework designed for 3D human face reconstruction without reliance on accurate pre-determined geometry. Our method is designed to simultaneously deliver both high-quality novel view rendering and accurate 3D mesh reconstructions. We incorporate a generic 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) to provide a surface geometric structure, making it possible to reconstruct faces with a limited set of input images. We introduce a joint optimization strategy that refines both the Gaussians and the morphable surface through a synergistic non-rigid alignment process. A novel distance metric, splat-to-surface, is proposed to improve alignment by considering both the Gaussian position and covariance. The surface information is also utilized to incorporate a world-space densification process, resulting in superior reconstruction quality. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed method is competitive with both other Gaussian splatting techniques in novel view synthesis and other 3D reconstruction methods in producing 3D face meshes with high geometric precision.</p>

<p>Abstract: Referring image segmentation is a challenging task that involves generating pixel-wise segmentation masks based on natural language descriptions. The complexity of this task increases with the intricacy of the sentences provided. Existing methods have relied mostly on visual features to generate the segmentation masks while treating text features as supporting components. However, this under-utilization of text understanding limits the model's capability to fully comprehend the given expressions. In this work, we propose a novel framework that specifically emphasizes object and context comprehension inspired by human cognitive processes through Vision-Aware Text Features. Firstly, we introduce a CLIP Prior module to localize the main object of interest and embed the object heatmap into the query initialization process. Secondly, we propose a combination of two components: Contextual Multimodal Decoder and Meaning Consistency Constraint, to further enhance the coherent and consistent interpretation of language cues with the contextual understanding obtained from the image. Our method achieves significant performance improvements on three benchmark datasets RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and G-Ref. Project page: \url{https://vatex.hkustvgd.com/}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have received widespread attention for advancing the interpretable self-driving. Existing evaluations of LVLMs primarily focus on multi-faceted capabilities in natural circumstances, lacking automated and quantifiable assessment for self-driving, let alone the severe road corner cases. In this work, we propose CODA-LM, the very first benchmark for the automatic evaluation of LVLMs for self-driving corner cases. We adopt a hierarchical data structure and prompt powerful LVLMs to analyze complex driving scenes and generate high-quality pre-annotations for the human annotators, while for LVLM evaluation, we show that using the text-only large language models (LLMs) as judges reveals even better alignment with human preferences than the LVLM judges. Moreover, with our CODA-LM, we build CODA-VLM, a new driving LVLM surpassing all open-sourced counterparts on CODA-LM. Our CODA-VLM performs comparably with GPT-4V, even surpassing GPT-4V by +21.42% on the regional perception task. We hope CODA-LM can become the catalyst to promote interpretable self-driving empowered by LVLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxi Ren, Xin Xia, Yanzuo Lu, Jiacheng Zhang, Jie Wu, Pan Xie, Xing Wang, Xuefeng Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, a series of diffusion-aware distillation algorithms have emerged to alleviate the computational overhead associated with the multi-step inference process of Diffusion Models (DMs). Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanbiao Ma, Licheng Jiao, Fang Liu, Lingling Li, Wenping Ma, Shuyuan Yang, Xu Liu, Puhua Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Building fair deep neural networks (DNNs) is a crucial step towards achieving trustworthy artificial intelligence. Delving into deeper factors that affect the fairness of DNNs is paramount and serves as the foundation for mitigating model biases. However, current methods are limited in accurately predicting DNN biases, relying solely on the number of training samples and lacking more precise measurement tools. Here, we establish a geometric perspective for analyzing the fairness of DNNs, comprehensively exploring how DNNs internally shape the intrinsic geometric characteristics of datasets-the intrinsic dimensions (IDs) of perceptual manifolds, and the impact of IDs on the fairness of DNNs. Based on multiple findings, we propose Intrinsic Dimension Regularization (IDR), which enhances the fairness and performance of models by promoting the learning of concise and ID-balanced class perceptual manifolds. In various image recognition benchmark tests, IDR significantly mitigates model bias while improving its performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generalist foundation models (GFMs) are renowned for their exceptional capability and flexibility in effectively generalizing across diverse tasks and modalities. In the field of medicine, while GFMs exhibit superior generalizability based on their extensive intrinsic knowledge as well as proficiency in instruction following and in-context learning, specialist models excel in precision due to their domain knowledge. In this work, for the first time, we explore the synergy between the GFM and specialist models, to enable precise medical image analysis on a broader scope. Specifically, we propose a cooperative framework, Generalist-Specialist Collaboration (GSCo), which consists of two stages, namely the construction of GFM and specialists, and collaborative inference on downstream tasks. In the construction stage, we develop MedDr, the largest open-source GFM tailored for medicine, showcasing exceptional instruction-following and in-context learning capabilities. Meanwhile, a series of lightweight specialists are crafted for downstream tasks with low computational cost. In the collaborative inference stage, we introduce two cooperative mechanisms, Mixture-of-Expert Diagnosis and Retrieval-Augmented Diagnosis, to harvest the generalist's in-context learning abilities alongside the specialists' domain expertise. For a comprehensive evaluation, we curate a large-scale benchmark featuring 28 datasets and about 250,000 images. Extensive results demonstrate that MedDr consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs on downstream datasets. Furthermore, GSCo exceeds both GFMs and specialists across all out-of-domain disease diagnosis datasets. These findings indicate a significant paradigm shift in the application of GFMs, transitioning from separate models for specific tasks to a collaborative approach between GFMs and specialists, thereby advancing the frontiers of generalizable AI in medicine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maoxun Yuan, Bo Cui, Tianyi Zhao, Jiayi Wang, Shan Fu, Xingxing Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic analysis on visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) images has gained attention for its ability to be more accurate and robust under low-illumination and complex weather conditions. Due to the lack of pre-trained foundation models on the large-scale infrared image datasets, existing methods prefer to design task-specific frameworks and directly fine-tune them with pre-trained foundation models on their RGB-IR semantic relevance datasets, which results in poor scalability and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a general and efficient framework called UniRGB-IR to unify RGB-IR semantic tasks, in which a novel adapter is developed to efficiently introduce richer RGB-IR features into the pre-trained RGB-based foundation model. Specifically, our framework consists of a RGB-based foundation model, a Multi-modal Feature Pool (MFP) module and a Supplementary Feature Injector (SFI) module. The MFP and SFI modules cooperate with each other as an adapter to effectively complement the RGB-based features with the rich RGB-IR features. During training process, we freeze the entire foundation model to inherit prior knowledge and only optimize the proposed adapter. Furthermore, to verify the effectiveness of our framework, we utilize the vanilla vision transformer (ViT-Base) as the pre-trained foundation model to perform extensive experiments. Experimental results on various RGB-IR downstream tasks demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changpeng Cai, Guinan Guo, Jiao Li, Junhao Su, Fei Shen, Chenghao He, Jing Xiao, Yuanxu Chen, Lei Dai, Feiyu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Most earlier researches on talking face generation have focused on the synchronization of lip motion and speech content. However, head pose and facial emotions are equally important characteristics of natural faces. While audio-driven talking face generation has seen notable advancements, existing methods either overlook facial emotions or are limited to specific individuals and cannot be applied to arbitrary subjects. In this paper, we propose a novel one-shot Talking Head Generation framework (SPEAK) that distinguishes itself from the general Talking Face Generation by enabling emotional and postural control. Specifically, we introduce Inter-Reconstructed Feature Disentanglement (IRFD) module to decouple facial features into three latent spaces. Then we design a face editing module that modifies speech content and facial latent codes into a single latent space. Subsequently, we present a novel generator that employs modified latent codes derived from the editing module to regulate emotional expression, head poses, and speech content in synthesizing facial animations. Extensive trials demonstrate that our method ensures lip synchronization with the audio while enabling decoupled control of facial features, it can generate realistic talking head with coordinated lip motions, authentic facial emotions, and smooth head movements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihwan Kim, Junoh Kang, Jinyoung Choi, Bohyung Han</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel inference technique based on a pretrained diffusion model for text-conditional video generation. Our approach, called FIFO-Diffusion, is conceptually capable of generating infinitely long videos without additional training. This is achieved by iteratively performing diagonal denoising, which simultaneously processes a series of consecutive frames with increasing noise levels in a queue; our method dequeues a fully denoised frame at the head while enqueuing a new random noise frame at the tail. However, diagonal denoising is a double-edged sword as the frames near the tail can take advantage of cleaner frames by forward reference but such a strategy induces the discrepancy between training and inference. Hence, we introduce latent partitioning to reduce the training-inference gap and lookahead denoising to leverage the benefit of forward referencing. Practically, FIFO-Diffusion consumes a constant amount of memory regardless of the target video length given a baseline model, while well-suited for parallel inference on multiple GPUs. We have demonstrated the promising results and effectiveness of the proposed methods on existing text-to-video generation baselines. Generated video examples and source codes are available at our project page.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiheng Xiong, Angela Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating 3D shapes from single RGB images is essential in various applications such as robotics. Current approaches typically target images containing clear and complete visual descriptions of the object, without considering common realistic cases where observations of objects that are largely occluded or truncated. We thus propose a transformer-based autoregressive model to generate the probabilistic distribution of 3D shapes conditioned on an RGB image containing potentially highly ambiguous observations of the object. To handle realistic scenarios such as occlusion or field-of-view truncation, we create simulated image-to-shape training pairs that enable improved fine-tuning for real-world scenarios. We then adopt cross-attention to effectively identify the most relevant region of interest from the input image for shape generation. This enables inference of sampled shapes with reasonable diversity and strong alignment with the input image. We train and test our model on our synthetic data then fine-tune and test it on real-world data. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state of the art in both scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Li, Hehe Fan, Yongkang Wong, Mohan Kankanhalli, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in image understanding have benefited from the extensive use of web image-text pairs. However, video understanding remains a challenge despite the availability of substantial web video-text data. This difficulty primarily arises from the inherent complexity of videos and the inefficient language supervision in recent web-collected video-text datasets. In this paper, we introduce Text-Only Pre-Alignment (TOPA), a novel approach to extend large language models (LLMs) for video understanding, without the need for pre-training on real video data. Specifically, we first employ an advanced LLM to automatically generate Textual Videos comprising continuous textual frames, along with corresponding annotations to simulate real video-text data. Then, these annotated textual videos are used to pre-align a language-only LLM with the video modality. To bridge the gap between textual and real videos, we employ the CLIP model as the feature extractor to align image and text modalities. During text-only pre-alignment, the continuous textual frames, encoded as a sequence of CLIP text features, are analogous to continuous CLIP image features, thus aligning the LLM with real video representation. Extensive experiments, including zero-shot evaluation and finetuning on various video understanding tasks, demonstrate that TOPA is an effective and efficient framework for aligning video content with LLMs. In particular, without training on any video data, the TOPA-Llama2-13B model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 51.0% on the challenging long-form video understanding benchmark, Egoschema. This performance surpasses previous video-text pre-training approaches and proves competitive with recent GPT-3.5-based video agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinran Nicole Han, Todd Zickler, Ko Nishino</p>
<p>Abstract: Models for inferring monocular shape of surfaces with diffuse reflection -- shape from shading -- ought to produce distributions of outputs, because there are fundamental mathematical ambiguities of both continuous (e.g., bas-relief) and discrete (e.g., convex/concave) types that are also experienced by humans. Yet, the outputs of current models are limited to point estimates or tight distributions around single modes, which prevent them from capturing these effects. We introduce a model that reconstructs a multimodal distribution of shapes from a single shading image, which aligns with the human experience of multistable perception. We train a small denoising diffusion process to generate surface normal fields from $16\times 16$ patches of synthetic images of everyday 3D objects. We deploy this model patch-wise at multiple scales, with guidance from inter-patch shape consistency constraints. Despite its relatively small parameter count and predominantly bottom-up structure, we show that multistable shape explanations emerge from this model for ambiguous test images that humans experience as being multistable. At the same time, the model produces veridical shape estimates for object-like images that include distinctive occluding contours and appear less ambiguous. This may inspire new architectures for stochastic 3D shape perception that are more efficient and better aligned with human experience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Yang, Mona Gandhi, Yufei Wang, Yifan Wu, Michael S. Yao, Chris Callison-Burch, James C. Gee, Mark Yatskar</p>
<p>Abstract: While deep networks have achieved broad success in analyzing natural images, when applied to medical scans, they often fail in unexcepted situations. We investigate this challenge and focus on model sensitivity to domain shifts, such as data sampled from different hospitals or data confounded by demographic variables such as sex, race, etc, in the context of chest X-rays and skin lesion images. A key finding we show empirically is that existing visual backbones lack an appropriate prior from the architecture for reliable generalization in these settings. Taking inspiration from medical training, we propose giving deep networks a prior grounded in explicit medical knowledge communicated in natural language. To this end, we introduce Knowledge-enhanced Bottlenecks (KnoBo), a class of concept bottleneck models that incorporates knowledge priors that constrain it to reason with clinically relevant factors found in medical textbooks or PubMed. KnoBo uses retrieval-augmented language models to design an appropriate concept space paired with an automatic training procedure for recognizing the concept. We evaluate different resources of knowledge and recognition architectures on a broad range of domain shifts across 20 datasets. In our comprehensive evaluation with two imaging modalities, KnoBo outperforms fine-tuned models on confounded datasets by 32.4% on average. Finally, evaluations reveal that PubMed is a promising resource for making medical models less sensitive to domain shift, outperforming other resources on both diversity of information and final prediction performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zander W. Blasingame, Chen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The optimization of the latents and parameters of diffusion models with respect to some differentiable metric defined on the output of the model is a challenging and complex problem. The sampling for diffusion models is done by solving either the probability flow ODE or diffusion SDE wherein a neural network approximates the score function allowing a numerical ODE/SDE solver to be used. However, naive backpropagation techniques are memory intensive, requiring the storage of all intermediate states, and face additional complexity in handling the injected noise from the diffusion term of the diffusion SDE. We propose a novel family of bespoke ODE solvers to the continuous adjoint equations for diffusion models, which we call AdjointDEIS. We exploit the unique construction of diffusion SDEs to further simplify the formulation of the continuous adjoint equations using exponential integrators. Moreover, we provide convergence order guarantees for our bespoke solvers. Significantly, we show that continuous adjoint equations for diffusion SDEs actually simplify to a simple ODE. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AdjointDEIS for guided generation with an adversarial attack in the form of the face morphing problem. Our code will be released on our project page https://zblasingame.github.io/AdjointDEIS/</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents M$^3$GPT, an advanced $\textbf{M}$ultimodal, $\textbf{M}$ultitask framework for $\textbf{M}$otion comprehension and generation. M$^3$GPT operates on three fundamental principles. The first focuses on creating a unified representation space for various motion-relevant modalities. We employ discrete vector quantization for multimodal conditional signals, such as text, music and motion/dance, enabling seamless integration into a large language model (LLM) with a single vocabulary. The second involves modeling motion generation directly in the raw motion space. This strategy circumvents the information loss associated with a discrete tokenizer, resulting in more detailed and comprehensive motion generation. Third, M$^3$GPT learns to model the connections and synergies among various motion-relevant tasks. Text, the most familiar and well-understood modality for LLMs, is utilized as a bridge to establish connections between different motion tasks, facilitating mutual reinforcement. To our knowledge, M$^3$GPT is the first model capable of comprehending and generating motions based on multiple signals. Extensive experiments highlight M$^3$GPT's superior performance across various motion-relevant tasks and its powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities for extremely challenging tasks.

<p>Abstract: In the realm of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), vision-language connector plays a crucial role to link the pre-trained vision encoders with Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its importance, the vision-language connector has been relatively less explored. In this study, we aim to propose a strong vision-language connector that enables MLLMs to achieve high accuracy while maintain low computation cost. We first reveal the existence of the visual anchors in Vision Transformer and propose a cost-effective search algorithm to extract them. Building on these findings, we introduce the Anchor Former (AcFormer), a novel vision-language connector designed to leverage the rich prior knowledge obtained from these visual anchors during pretraining, guiding the aggregation of information. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces computational costs by nearly two-thirds compared with baseline, while simultaneously outperforming baseline methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Farina, Gianni Franchi, Giovanni Iacca, Massimiliano Mancini, Elisa Ricci</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models seamlessly discriminate among arbitrary semantic categories, yet they still suffer from poor generalization when presented with challenging examples. For this reason, Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques to adapt VLMs in the presence of a single unlabeled image. The recent literature on TTA is dominated by the paradigm of prompt tuning by Marginal Entropy Minimization, which, relying on online backpropagation, inevitably slows down inference while increasing memory. In this work, we theoretically investigate the properties of this approach and unveil that a surprisingly strong TTA method lies dormant and hidden within it. We term this approach ZERO (TTA with "zero" temperature), whose design is both incredibly effective and frustratingly simple: augment N times, predict, retain the most confident predictions, and marginalize after setting the Softmax temperature to zero. Remarkably, ZERO requires a single batched forward pass through the vision encoder only and no backward passes. We thoroughly evaluate our approach following the experimental protocol established in the literature and show that ZERO largely surpasses or compares favorably w.r.t. the state-of-the-art while being almost 10x faster and 13x more memory-friendly than standard Test-Time Prompt Tuning. Thanks to its simplicity and comparatively negligible computation, ZERO can serve as a strong baseline for future work in this field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhui Zhang, Alyssa Unell, Xiaohan Wang, Dhruba Ghosh, Yuchang Su, Ludwig Schmidt, Serena Yeung-Levy</p>
<p>Abstract: Image classification is one of the most fundamental capabilities of machine vision intelligence. In this work, we revisit the image classification task using visually-grounded language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4V and LLaVA. We find that existing proprietary and public VLMs, despite often using CLIP as a vision encoder and having many more parameters, significantly underperform CLIP on standard image classification benchmarks like ImageNet. To understand the reason, we explore several hypotheses concerning the inference algorithms, training objectives, and data processing in VLMs. Our analysis reveals that the primary cause is data-related: critical information for image classification is encoded in the VLM's latent space but can only be effectively decoded with enough training data. Specifically, there is a strong correlation between the frequency of class exposure during VLM training and instruction-tuning and the VLM's performance in those classes; when trained with sufficient data, VLMs can match the accuracy of state-of-the-art classification models. Based on these findings, we enhance a VLM by integrating classification-focused datasets into its training, and demonstrate that the enhanced classification performance of the VLM transfers to its general capabilities, resulting in an improvement of 11.8% on the newly collected ImageWikiQA dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raman Dutt, Ondrej Bohdal, Pedro Sanchez, Sotirios A. Tsaftaris, Timothy Hospedales</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models excel in generating images that closely resemble their training data but are also susceptible to data memorization, raising privacy, ethical, and legal concerns, particularly in sensitive domains such as medical imaging. We hypothesize that this memorization stems from the overparameterization of deep models and propose that regularizing model capacity during fine-tuning can mitigate this issue. Firstly, we empirically show that regulating the model capacity via Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) mitigates memorization to some extent, however, it further requires the identification of the exact parameter subsets to be fine-tuned for high-quality generation. To identify these subsets, we introduce a bi-level optimization framework, MemControl, that automates parameter selection using memorization and generation quality metrics as rewards during fine-tuning. The parameter subsets discovered through MemControl achieve a superior tradeoff between generation quality and memorization. For the task of medical image generation, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art memorization mitigation strategies by fine-tuning as few as 0.019% of model parameters. Moreover, we demonstrate that the discovered parameter subsets are transferable to non-medical domains. Our framework is scalable to large datasets, agnostic to reward functions, and can be integrated with existing approaches for further memorization mitigation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to empirically evaluate memorization in medical images and propose a targeted yet universal mitigation strategy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingzhen Huang, Jialing Cai, Shan Jia, Vishnu Suresh Lokhande, Siwei Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-driven image synthesis has made significant advancements with the development of diffusion models, transforming how visual content is generated from text prompts. Despite these advances, text-driven image editing, a key area in computer graphics, faces unique challenges. A major challenge is making simultaneous edits across multiple objects or attributes. Applying these methods sequentially for multi-attribute edits increases computational demands and efficiency losses. In this paper, we address these challenges with significant contributions. Our main contribution is the development of ParallelEdits, a method that seamlessly manages simultaneous edits across multiple attributes. In contrast to previous approaches, ParallelEdits not only preserves the quality of single attribute edits but also significantly improves the performance of multitasking edits. This is achieved through innovative attention distribution mechanism and multi-branch design that operates across several processing heads. Additionally, we introduce the PIE-Bench++ dataset, an expansion of the original PIE-Bench dataset, to better support evaluating image-editing tasks involving multiple objects and attributes simultaneously. This dataset is a benchmark for evaluating text-driven image editing methods in multifaceted scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R. Kenny Jones, Renhao Zhang, Aditya Ganeshan, Daniel Ritchie</p>
<p>Abstract: We design a system that learns how to edit visual programs. Our edit network consumes a complete input program and a visual target. From this input, we task our network with predicting a local edit operation that could be applied to the input program to improve its similarity to the target. In order to apply this scheme for domains that lack program annotations, we develop a self-supervised learning approach that integrates this edit network into a bootstrapped finetuning loop along with a network that predicts entire programs in one-shot. Our joint finetuning scheme, when coupled with an inference procedure that initializes a population from the one-shot model and evolves members of this population with the edit network, helps to infer more accurate visual programs. Over multiple domains, we experimentally compare our method against the alternative of using only the one-shot model, and find that even under equal search-time budgets, our editing-based paradigm provides significant advantages.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is an important task in multimodal AI, and it is often used to test the ability of vision-language models to understand and reason on knowledge present in both visual and textual data. However, most of the current VQA models use datasets that are primarily focused on English and a few major world languages, with images that are typically Western-centric. While recent efforts have tried to increase the number of languages covered on VQA datasets, they still lack diversity in low-resource languages. More importantly, although these datasets often extend their linguistic range via translation or some other approaches, they usually keep images the same, resulting in narrow cultural representation. To address these limitations, we construct CVQA, a new Culturally-diverse multilingual Visual Question Answering benchmark, designed to cover a rich set of languages and cultures, where we engage native speakers and cultural experts in the data collection process. As a result, CVQA includes culturally-driven images and questions from across 30 countries on four continents, covering 31 languages with 13 scripts, providing a total of 10k questions. We then benchmark several Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on CVQA, and show that the dataset is challenging for the current state-of-the-art models. This benchmark can serve as a probing evaluation suite for assessing the cultural capability and bias of multimodal models and hopefully encourage more research efforts toward increasing cultural awareness and linguistic diversity in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoming Zhao, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Dor Verbin, Keunhong Park, Ricardo Martin Brualla, Philipp Henzler</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing methods for relightable view synthesis -- using a set of images of an object under unknown lighting to recover a 3D representation that can be rendered from novel viewpoints under a target illumination -- are based on inverse rendering, and attempt to disentangle the object geometry, materials, and lighting that explain the input images. Furthermore, this typically involves optimization through differentiable Monte Carlo rendering, which is brittle and computationally-expensive. In this work, we propose a simpler approach: we first relight each input image using an image diffusion model conditioned on target environment lighting and estimated object geometry. We then reconstruct a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) with these relit images, from which we render novel views under the target lighting. We demonstrate that this strategy is surprisingly competitive and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple relighting benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaochang Wu, Yapeng Zhang, Lan Deng, Jingxin Zhang, Tianyou Chai</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex industrial processes plays a pivotal role in ensuring efficient, stable, and secure operation. Existing anomaly detection methods primarily focus on analyzing dominant anomalies using the process variables (such as arc current) or constructing neural networks based on abnormal visual features, while overlooking the intrinsic correlation of cross-modal information. This paper proposes a cross-modal Transformer (dubbed FmFormer), designed to facilitate anomaly detection by exploring the correlation between visual features (video) and process variables (current) in the context of the fused magnesium smelting process. Our approach introduces a novel tokenization paradigm to effectively bridge the substantial dimensionality gap between the 3D video modality and the 1D current modality in a multiscale manner, enabling a hierarchical reconstruction of pixel-level anomaly detection. Subsequently, the FmFormer leverages self-attention to learn internal features within each modality and bidirectional cross-attention to capture correlations across modalities. By decoding the bidirectional correlation features, we obtain the final detection result and even locate the specific anomaly region. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we also present a pioneering cross-modal benchmark of the fused magnesium smelting process, featuring synchronously acquired video and current data for over 2.2 million samples. Leveraging cross-modal learning, the proposed FmFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting anomalies, particularly under extreme interferences such as current fluctuations and visual occlusion caused by heavy water mist. The presented methodology and benchmark may be applicable to other industrial applications with some amendments. The benchmark will be released at https://github.com/GaochangWu/FMF-Benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungwoo Yoo, Juil Koo, Kyeongmin Yeo, Minhyuk Sung</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel method for learning representations of poses for 3D deformable objects, which specializes in 1) disentangling pose information from the object's identity, 2) facilitating the learning of pose variations, and 3) transferring pose information to other object identities. Based on these properties, our method enables the generation of 3D deformable objects with diversity in both identities and poses, using variations of a single object. It does not require explicit shape parameterization such as skeletons or joints, point-level or shape-level correspondence supervision, or variations of the target object for pose transfer. To achieve pose disentanglement, compactness for generative models, and transferability, we first design the pose extractor to represent the pose as a keypoint-based hybrid representation and the pose applier to learn an implicit deformation field. To better distill pose information from the object's geometry, we propose the implicit pose applier to output an intrinsic mesh property, the face Jacobian. Once the extracted pose information is transferred to the target object, the pose applier is fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to better describe the target object's shapes with pose variations. The extracted poses are also used to train a cascaded diffusion model to enable the generation of novel poses. Our experiments with the DeformThings4D and Human datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in pose transfer and the ability to generate diverse deformed shapes with various objects and poses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Imanol Miranda, Ander Salaberria, Eneko Agirre, Gorka Azkune</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Compositionality (VLC) benchmarks like SugarCrepe are formulated as image-to-text retrieval problems, where, given an image, the models need to select between the correct textual description and a synthetic hard negative text. In this work, we present the Bidirectional Vision-Language Compositionality (BiVLC) dataset. The novelty of BiVLC is to add a synthetic hard negative image generated from the synthetic text, resulting in two image-to-text retrieval examples (one for each image) and, more importantly, two text-to-image retrieval examples (one for each text). Human annotators filter out ill-formed examples ensuring the validity of the benchmark. The experiments on BiVLC uncover a weakness of current multimodal models, as they perform poorly in the text-to-image direction. In fact, when considering both retrieval directions, the conclusions obtained in previous works change significantly. In addition to the benchmark, we show that a contrastive model trained using synthetic images and texts significantly improves over the base model in SugarCrepe and in BiVLC for both retrieval directions. The gap to human performance in BiVLC confirms that Vision-Language Compositionality is still a challenging problem.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eunji Hong, Minh Hieu Nguyen, Mikaela Angelina Uy, Minhyuk Sung</p>
<p>Abstract: We present MV2Cyl, a novel method for reconstructing 3D from 2D multi-view images, not merely as a field or raw geometry but as a sketch-extrude CAD model. Extracting extrusion cylinders from raw 3D geometry has been extensively researched in computer vision, while the processing of 3D data through neural networks has remained a bottleneck. Since 3D scans are generally accompanied by multi-view images, leveraging 2D convolutional neural networks allows these images to be exploited as a rich source for extracting extrusion cylinder information. However, we observe that extracting only the surface information of the extrudes and utilizing it results in suboptimal outcomes due to the challenges in the occlusion and surface segmentation. By synergizing with the extracted base curve information, we achieve the optimal reconstruction result with the best accuracy in 2D sketch and extrude parameter estimation. Our experiments, comparing our method with previous work that takes a raw 3D point cloud as input, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by taking advantage of multi-view images.</p>

By integrating the learneable non-linear activation functions presented in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into convolutions, we propose a new layer. Throughout the paper, we empirically validate the performance of Convolutional KANs against traditional architectures across Fashion-MNIST dataset, finding that, in some cases, this new approach maintains a similar level of accuracy while using half the number of parameters. This experiments show that KAN Convolutions seem to learn more per kernel, which opens up a new horizon of possibilities in deep learning for computer vision.</p>

<p>Abstract: While text-to-visual models now produce photo-realistic images and videos, they struggle with compositional text prompts involving attributes, relationships, and higher-order reasoning such as logic and comparison. In this work, we conduct an extensive human study on GenAI-Bench to evaluate the performance of leading image and video generation models in various aspects of compositional text-to-visual generation. We also compare automated evaluation metrics against our collected human ratings and find that VQAScore -- a metric measuring the likelihood that a VQA model views an image as accurately depicting the prompt -- significantly outperforms previous metrics such as CLIPScore. In addition, VQAScore can improve generation in a black-box manner (without finetuning) via simply ranking a few (3 to 9) candidate images. Ranking by VQAScore is 2x to 3x more effective than other scoring methods like PickScore, HPSv2, and ImageReward at improving human alignment ratings for DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion, especially on compositional prompts that require advanced visio-linguistic reasoning. We release a new GenAI-Rank benchmark with over 40,000 human ratings to evaluate scoring metrics on ranking images generated from the same prompt. Lastly, we discuss promising areas for improvement in VQAScore, such as addressing fine-grained visual details. We will release all human ratings (over 80,000) to facilitate scientific benchmarking of both generative models and automated metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Meng, Yu Dai, Zezheng Gong, Shaoxiong Guo, Minglong Tang, Tongquan Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly improve performance in image comprehension tasks, such as formatted charts and rich-content images. Yet, Graphical User Interface (GUI) pose a greater challenge due to their structured format and detailed textual information. Existing LVLMs often overly depend on internal knowledge and neglect image content, resulting in hallucinations and incorrect responses in GUI comprehension. To address these issues, we introduce VGA, a fine-tuned model designed for comprehensive GUI understanding. Our model aims to enhance the interpretation of visual data of GUI and reduce hallucinations. We first construct a Vision Question Answering (VQA) dataset of 63.8k high-quality examples with our propose Referent Method, which ensures the model's responses are highly depend on visual content within the image. We then design a two-stage fine-tuning method called Foundation and Advanced Comprehension (FAC) to enhance both the model's ability to extract information from image content and alignment with human intent. Experiments show that our approach enhances the model's ability to extract information from images and achieves state-of-the-art results in GUI understanding tasks. Our dataset and fine-tuning script will be released soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper scales object-level reconstruction to complex scenes, advancing interactive scene reconstruction. We introduce two datasets, OmniSim and InterReal, featuring 28 scenes with multiple interactive objects. To tackle the challenge of inaccurate interactive motion recovery in complex scenes, we propose LiveScene, a scene-level language-embedded interactive radiance field that efficiently reconstructs and controls multiple objects. By decomposing the interactive scene into local deformable fields, LiveScene enables separate reconstruction of individual object motions, reducing memory consumption. Additionally, our interaction-aware language embedding localizes individual interactive objects, allowing for arbitrary control using natural language. Our approach demonstrates significant superiority in novel view synthesis, interactive scene control, and language grounding performance through extensive experiments.

<p>Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables interrogating the molecular composition of tissue with ever-increasing resolution and sensitivity. However, costs, rapidly evolving technology, and lack of standards have constrained computational methods in ST to narrow tasks and small cohorts. In addition, the underlying tissue morphology, as reflected by H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs), encodes rich information often overlooked in ST studies. Here, we introduce HEST-1k, a collection of 1,229 spatial transcriptomic profiles, each linked to a WSI and extensive metadata. HEST-1k was assembled from 153 public and internal cohorts encompassing 26 organs, two species (Homo Sapiens and Mus Musculus), and 367 cancer samples from 25 cancer types. HEST-1k processing enabled the identification of 2.1 million expression--morphology pairs and over 76 million nuclei. To support its development, we additionally introduce the HEST-Library, a Python package designed to perform a range of actions with HEST samples. We test HEST-1k and Library on three use cases: (1) benchmarking foundation models for pathology (HEST-Benchmark), (2) biomarker exploration, and (3) multimodal representation learning.

Recent deep-based methods achieved accurate estimation by using complex network architectures that involve graphs, attention layers, and hard pruning steps.

Given a collection of point matches extracted from two images, our method identifies outlier point matches and models the displacement noise in inlier matches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucheng Chen, Lin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The unique complementarity of frame-based and event cameras for high frame rate object tracking has recently inspired some research attempts to develop multi-modal fusion approaches. However, these methods directly fuse both modalities and thus ignore the environmental attributes, e.g., motion blur, illumination variance, occlusion, scale variation, etc. Meanwhile, insufficient interaction between search and template features makes distinguishing target objects and backgrounds difficult. As a result, performance degradation is induced especially in challenging conditions. This paper proposes a novel and effective Transformer-based event-guided tracking framework, called eMoE-Tracker, which achieves new SOTA performance under various conditions. Our key idea is to disentangle the environment into several learnable attributes to dynamically learn the attribute-specific features and strengthen the target information by improving the interaction between the target template and search regions. To achieve the goal, we first propose an environmental Mix-of-Experts (eMoE) module that is built upon the environmental Attributes Disentanglement to learn attribute-specific features and environmental Attributes Assembling to assemble the attribute-specific features by the learnable attribute scores dynamically. The eMoE module is a subtle router that prompt-tunes the transformer backbone more efficiently. We then introduce a contrastive relation modeling (CRM) module to emphasize target information by leveraging a contrastive learning strategy between the target template and search regions. Extensive experiments on diverse event-based benchmark datasets showcase the superior performance of our eMoE-Tracker compared to the prior arts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erdong Hu, Longteng Guo, Tongtian Yue, Zijia Zhao, Shuning Xue, Jing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In computer vision, Image Difference Captioning (IDC) is crucial for accurately describing variations between closely related images. Traditional IDC methods often rely on specialist models, which restrict their applicability across varied contexts. This paper introduces the OneDiff model, a novel generalist approach that utilizes a robust vision-language model architecture, integrating a siamese image encoder with a Visual Delta Module. This innovative configuration allows for the precise detection and articulation of fine-grained differences between image pairs. OneDiff is trained through a dual-phase strategy, encompassing Coupled Sample Training and multi-task learning across a diverse array of data types, supported by our newly developed DiffCap Dataset. This dataset merges real-world and synthetic data, enhancing the training process and bolstering the model's robustness. Extensive testing on diverse IDC benchmarks, such as Spot-the-Diff, Image-Editing-Request, and Birds-to-Words, shows that OneDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in accuracy and adaptability, achieving improvements of up to 97% CIDEr points in average. By setting a new benchmark in IDC, OneDiff paves the way for more versatile and effective applications in detecting and describing visual differences. The code, models, and data will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: The mathematical capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remain under-explored with three areas to be improved: visual encoding of math diagrams, diagram-language alignment, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This draws forth an urgent demand for an effective training paradigm and a large-scale, comprehensive dataset with detailed CoT rationales, which is challenging to collect and costly to annotate manually. To tackle this issue, we propose MAVIS, a MAthematical VISual instruction tuning pipeline for MLLMs, featuring an automatic data engine to efficiently create mathematical visual datasets. We design the data generation process to be entirely independent of human intervention or GPT API usage, while ensuring the diagram-caption correspondence, question-answer correctness, and CoT reasoning quality. With this approach, we curate two datasets, MAVIS-Caption (558K diagram-caption pairs) and MAVIS-Instruct (834K visual math problems with CoT rationales), and propose four progressive stages for training MLLMs from scratch. First, we utilize MAVIS-Caption to fine-tune a math-specific vision encoder (CLIP-Math) through contrastive learning, tailored for improved diagram visual encoding. Second, we also leverage MAVIS-Caption to align the CLIP-Math with a large language model (LLM) by a projection layer, enhancing vision-language alignment in mathematical domains. Third, we adopt MAVIS-Instruct to perform the instruction tuning for robust problem-solving skills, and term the resulting model as MAVIS-7B. Fourth, we apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance the CoT capabilities of our model, further refining its step-wise reasoning performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanzhi Zhu, Jiawei Liu, Feiyu Gao, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang, Peng Wang, Fei Huang, Cong Yao, Zhibo Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, with the rapid advancements of generative models, the field of visual text generation has witnessed significant progress. However, it is still challenging to render high-quality text images in real-world scenarios, as three critical criteria should be satisfied: (1) Fidelity: the generated text images should be photo-realistic and the contents are expected to be the same as specified in the given conditions; (2) Reasonability: the regions and contents of the generated text should cohere with the scene; (3) Utility: the generated text images can facilitate related tasks (e.g., text detection and recognition). Upon investigation, we find that existing methods, either rendering-based or diffusion-based, can hardly meet all these aspects simultaneously, limiting their application range. Therefore, we propose in this paper a visual text generator (termed SceneVTG), which can produce high-quality text images in the wild. Following a two-stage paradigm, SceneVTG leverages a Multimodal Large Language Model to recommend reasonable text regions and contents across multiple scales and levels, which are used by a conditional diffusion model as conditions to generate text images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SceneVTG significantly outperforms traditional rendering-based methods and recent diffusion-based methods in terms of fidelity and reasonability. Besides, the generated images provide superior utility for tasks involving text detection and text recognition. Code and datasets are available at AdvancedLiterateMachinery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julia Hindel, Daniele Cattaneo, Abhinav Valada</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation models are typically trained on a fixed set of classes, limiting their applicability in open-world scenarios. Class-incremental semantic segmentation aims to update models with emerging new classes while preventing catastrophic forgetting of previously learned ones. However, existing methods impose strict rigidity on old classes, reducing their effectiveness in learning new incremental classes. In this work, we propose Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized Incremental-Class Segmentation (TOPICS) that learns feature embeddings in hyperbolic space following explicit taxonomy-tree structures. This supervision provides plasticity for old classes, updating ancestors based on new classes while integrating new classes at fitting positions. Additionally, we maintain implicit class relational constraints on the geometric basis of the Poincar\'e ball. This ensures that the latent space can continuously adapt to new constraints while maintaining a robust structure to combat catastrophic forgetting. We also establish eight realistic incremental learning protocols for autonomous driving scenarios, where novel classes can originate from known classes or the background. Extensive evaluations of TOPICS on the Cityscapes and Mapillary Vistas 2.0 benchmarks demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance. We make the code and trained models publicly available at http://topics.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengxuan Xiao, Qun Dai, Yiming Zhu, Kehua Guo, Huan Wang, Xiangbo Shu, Jian Yang, Yimian Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Infrared small target detection poses unique challenges due to the scarcity of intrinsic target features and the abundance of similar background distractors. We argue that background semantics play a pivotal role in distinguishing visually similar objects for this task. To address this, we introduce a new task--clustered infrared small target detection, and present DenseSIRST, a novel benchmark dataset that provides per-pixel semantic annotations for background regions, enabling the transition from sparse to dense target detection. Leveraging this dataset, we propose the Background-Aware Feature Exchange Network (BAFE-Net), which transforms the detection paradigm from a single task focused on the foreground to a multi-task architecture that jointly performs target detection and background semantic segmentation. BAFE-Net introduces a dynamic cross-task feature hard-exchange mechanism to embed target and background semantics between the two tasks. Furthermore, we propose the Background-Aware Gaussian Copy-Paste (BAG-CP) method, which selectively pastes small targets into sky regions during training, avoiding the creation of false alarm targets in complex non-sky backgrounds. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BAG-CP and BAFE-Net in improving target detection accuracy while reducing false alarms. The DenseSIRST dataset, code, and trained models are available at https://github.com/GrokCV/BAFE-Net.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Xie, Qian Qiao, Jun Gao, Tianxiang Wu, Jiaqing Fan, Yue Zhang, Jielei Zhang, Huyang Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: More and more end-to-end text spotting methods based on Transformer architecture have demonstrated superior performance. These methods utilize a bipartite graph matching algorithm to perform one-to-one optimal matching between predicted objects and actual objects. However, the instability of bipartite graph matching can lead to inconsistent optimization targets, thereby affecting the training performance of the model. Existing literature applies denoising training to solve the problem of bipartite graph matching instability in object detection tasks. Unfortunately, this denoising training method cannot be directly applied to text spotting tasks, as these tasks need to perform irregular shape detection tasks and more complex text recognition tasks than classification. To address this issue, we propose a novel denoising training method (DNTextSpotter) for arbitrary-shaped text spotting. Specifically, we decompose the queries of the denoising part into noised positional queries and noised content queries. We use the four Bezier control points of the Bezier center curve to generate the noised positional queries. For the noised content queries, considering that the output of the text in a fixed positional order is not conducive to aligning position with content, we employ a masked character sliding method to initialize noised content queries, thereby assisting in the alignment of text content and position. To improve the model's perception of the background, we further utilize an additional loss function for background characters classification in the denoising training part.Although DNTextSpotter is conceptually simple, it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks (Total-Text, SCUT-CTW1500, ICDAR15, and Inverse-Text), especially yielding an improvement of 11.3% against the best approach in Inverse-Text dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Endoscopic surgery relies on two-dimensional views, posing challenges for surgeons in depth perception and instrument manipulation. While Monocular Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (MVSLAM) has emerged as a promising solution, its implementation in endoscopic procedures faces significant challenges due to hardware limitations, such as the use of a monocular camera and the absence of odometry sensors. This study presents BodySLAM, a robust deep learning-based MVSLAM approach that addresses these challenges through three key components: CycleVO, a novel unsupervised monocular pose estimation module; the integration of the state-of-the-art Zoe architecture for monocular depth estimation; and a 3D reconstruction module creating a coherent surgical map. The approach is rigorously evaluated using three publicly available datasets (Hamlyn, EndoSLAM, and SCARED) spanning laparoscopy, gastroscopy, and colonoscopy scenarios, and benchmarked against four state-of-the-art methods. Results demonstrate that CycleVO exhibited competitive performance with the lowest inference time among pose estimation methods, while maintaining robust generalization capabilities, whereas Zoe significantly outperformed existing algorithms for depth estimation in endoscopy. BodySLAM's strong performance across diverse endoscopic scenarios demonstrates its potential as a viable MVSLAM solution for endoscopic applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: In high-risk railway construction, personal protective equipment monitoring is critical but challenging due to small and frequently obstructed targets. We propose YOLO-EA, an innovative model that enhances safety measure detection by integrating ECA into its backbone's convolutional layers, improving discernment of minuscule objects like hardhats. YOLO-EA further refines target recognition under occlusion by replacing GIoU with EIoU loss. YOLO-EA's effectiveness was empirically substantiated using a dataset derived from real-world railway construction site surveillance footage. It outperforms YOLOv5, achieving 98.9% precision and 94.7% recall, up 2.5% and 0.5% respectively, while maintaining real-time performance at 70.774 fps. This highly efficient and precise YOLO-EA holds great promise for practical application in intricate construction scenarios, enforcing stringent safety compliance during complex railway construction projects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Akib Jawad Karim, Muhammad Zawad Mahmud, Riasat Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Mosquito-related diseases pose a significant threat to global public health, necessitating efficient and accurate mosquito classification for effective surveillance and control. This work presents an innovative approach to mosquito classification by leveraging state-of-the-art vision transformers and open-set learning techniques. A novel framework has been introduced that integrates Transformer-based deep learning models with comprehensive data augmentation and preprocessing methods, enabling robust and precise identification of ten mosquito species. The Swin Transformer model achieves the best performance for traditional closed-set learning with 99.80% accuracy and 0.998 F1 score. The lightweight MobileViT technique attains an almost similar accuracy of 98.90% with significantly reduced parameters and model complexities. Next, the applied deep learning models' adaptability and generalizability in a static environment have been enhanced by using new classes of data samples during the inference stage that have not been included in the training set. The proposed framework's ability to handle unseen classes like insects similar to mosquitoes, even humans, through open-set learning further enhances its practical applicability by employing the OpenMax technique and Weibull distribution. The traditional CNN model, Xception, outperforms the latest transformer with higher accuracy and F1 score for open-set learning. The study's findings highlight the transformative potential of advanced deep-learning architectures in entomology, providing a strong groundwork for future research and development in mosquito surveillance and vector control. The implications of this work extend beyond mosquito classification, offering valuable insights for broader ecological and environmental monitoring applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Wu, Lu Xiao, Rui Peng, Kaiqiang Xiong, Ronggang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed substantial advancements in the field of 3D reconstruction from 2D images, particularly following the introduction of the neural radiance field (NeRF) technique. However, reconstructing a 3D high dynamic range (HDR) radiance field, which aligns more closely with real-world conditions, from 2D multi-exposure low dynamic range (LDR) images continues to pose significant challenges. Approaches to this issue fall into two categories: grid-based and implicit-based. Implicit methods, using multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), face inefficiencies, limited solvability, and overfitting risks. Conversely, grid-based methods require significant memory and struggle with image quality and long training times. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian Splatting-a recent, high-quality, real-time 3D reconstruction technique-into this domain. We further develop the High Dynamic Range Gaussian Splatting (HDR-GS) method, designed to address the aforementioned challenges. This method enhances color dimensionality by including luminance and uses an asymmetric grid for tone-mapping, swiftly and precisely converting pixel irradiance to color. Our approach improves HDR scene recovery accuracy and integrates a novel coarse-to-fine strategy to speed up model convergence, enhancing robustness against sparse viewpoints and exposure extremes, and preventing local optima. Extensive testing confirms that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques in both synthetic and real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenjie Cao, Chaohui Yu, Fan Wang, Xiangyang Xue, Yanwei Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) and 3D generation have recently achieved prominent improvements. However, these works mainly focus on confined categories or synthetic 3D assets, which are discouraged from generalizing to challenging in-the-wild scenes and fail to be employed with 2D synthesis directly. Moreover, these methods heavily depended on camera poses, limiting their real-world applications. To overcome these issues, we propose MVInpainter, re-formulating the 3D editing as a multi-view 2D inpainting task. Specifically, MVInpainter partially inpaints multi-view images with the reference guidance rather than intractably generating an entirely novel view from scratch, which largely simplifies the difficulty of in-the-wild NVS and leverages unmasked clues instead of explicit pose conditions. To ensure cross-view consistency, MVInpainter is enhanced by video priors from motion components and appearance guidance from concatenated reference key&value attention. Furthermore, MVInpainter incorporates slot attention to aggregate high-level optical flow features from unmasked regions to control the camera movement with pose-free training and inference. Sufficient scene-level experiments on both object-centric and forward-facing datasets verify the effectiveness of MVInpainter, including diverse tasks, such as multi-view object removal, synthesis, insertion, and replacement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandre Matov</p>
<p>Abstract: We are interested in developing an automated system for detection of organized movements in human crowds. Computer vision algorithms can extract information from videos of crowded scenes and automatically detect and track groups of individuals undergoing organized motion that represents an anomalous behavior in the context of conflict aversion. Our system can detect organized cohorts against the background of randomly moving objects and we can estimate the number of participants in an organized cohort, the speed and direction of motion in real time, within three to four video frames, which is less than one second from the onset of motion captured on a CCTV. We have performed preliminary analysis in this context in biological cell data containing up to four thousand objects per frame and will extend this numerically to a hundred-fold for public safety applications.
  We envisage using the existing infrastructure of video cameras for acquiring image datasets on-the-fly and deploying an easy-to-use data-driven software system for parsing of significant events by analyzing image sequences taken inside and outside of sports stadiums or other public venues. Other prospective users are organizers of political rallies, civic and wildlife organizations, security firms, and the military. We will optimize the performance of the software by implementing a classification method able to distinguish between activities posing a threat and those not posing a threat.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, text-to-image generative models have been misused to create unauthorized malicious images of individuals, posing a growing social problem. Previous solutions, such as Anti-DreamBooth, add adversarial noise to images to protect them from being used as training data for malicious generation. However, we found that the adversarial noise can be removed by adversarial purification methods such as DiffPure. Therefore, we propose a new adversarial attack method that adds strong perturbation on the high-frequency areas of images to make it more robust to adversarial purification. Our experiment showed that the adversarial images retained noise even after adversarial purification, hindering malicious image generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, driven by advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), Vision Language Action Models (VLAMs) are being proposed to achieve better performance in open-vocabulary scenarios for robotic manipulation tasks. Since manipulation tasks involve direct interaction with the physical world, ensuring robustness and safety during the execution of this task is always a very critical issue. In this paper, by synthesizing current safety research on MLLMs and the specific application scenarios of the manipulation task in the physical world, we comprehensively evaluate VLAMs in the face of potential physical threats. Specifically, we propose the Physical Vulnerability Evaluating Pipeline (PVEP) that can incorporate as many visual modal physical threats as possible for evaluating the physical robustness of VLAMs. The physical threats in PVEP specifically include Out-of-Distribution, Typography-based Visual Prompts, and Adversarial Patch Attacks. By comparing the performance fluctuations of VLAMs before and after being attacked, we provide generalizable Analyses of how VLAMs respond to different physical security threats.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Feinglass, Yezhou Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot inference, where pre-trained models perform tasks without specific training data, is an exciting emergent ability of large models like CLIP. Although there has been considerable exploration into enhancing zero-shot abilities in image captioning (IC) for popular datasets such as MSCOCO and Flickr8k, these approaches fall short with fine-grained datasets like CUB, FLO, UCM-Captions, and Sydney-Captions. These datasets require captions to discern between visually and semantically similar classes, focusing on detailed object parts and their attributes. To overcome this challenge, we introduce TRaining-Free Object-Part Enhancement (TROPE). TROPE enriches a base caption with additional object-part details using object detector proposals and Natural Language Processing techniques. It complements rather than alters the base caption, allowing seamless integration with other captioning methods and offering users enhanced flexibility. Our evaluations show that TROPE consistently boosts performance across all tested zero-shot IC approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained IC datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Remote sensing image plays an irreplaceable role in fields such as agriculture, water resources, military, and disaster relief. Pixel-level interpretation is a critical aspect of remote sensing image applications; however, a prevalent limitation remains the need for extensive manual annotation. For this, we try to introduce open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) into the remote sensing context. However, due to the sensitivity of remote sensing images to low-resolution features, distorted target shapes and ill-fitting boundaries are exhibited in the prediction mask. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple and general upsampler, SimFeatUp, to restore lost spatial information in deep features in a training-free style. Further, based on the observation of the abnormal response of local patch tokens to [CLS] token in CLIP, we propose to execute a straightforward subtraction operation to alleviate the global bias in patch tokens. Extensive experiments are conducted on 17 remote sensing datasets spanning semantic segmentation, building extraction, road detection, and flood detection tasks. Our method achieves an average of 5.8%, 8.2%, 4.0%, and 15.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods on 4 tasks. All codes are released. \url{https://earth-insights.github.io/SegEarth-OV}</p>

<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning has become a dominant approach in self-supervised visual representation learning. Hard negatives - samples closely resembling the anchor - are key to enhancing learned representations' discriminative power. However, efficiently leveraging hard negatives remains challenging. We introduce SynCo (Synthetic Negatives in Contrastive learning), a novel approach that improves model performance by generating synthetic hard negatives on the representation space. Building on the MoCo framework, SynCo introduces six strategies for creating diverse synthetic hard negatives on-the-fly with minimal computational overhead. SynCo achieves faster training and better representation learning, reaching 67.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 linear evaluation after 200 pretraining epochs, surpassing MoCo's 67.5% using the same ResNet-50 encoder. It also transfers more effectively to detection tasks: on PASCAL VOC, it outperforms both the supervised baseline and MoCo with 82.5% AP; on COCO, it sets new benchmarks with 40.9% AP for bounding box detection and 35.5% AP for instance segmentation. Our synthetic hard negative generation approach significantly enhances visual representations learned through self-supervised contrastive learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyao Zeng, Yangchao Wu, Hyoungseob Park, Daniel Wang, Fengyu Yang, Stefano Soatto, Dong Lao, Byung-Woo Hong, Alex Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a method for metric-scale monocular depth estimation. Inferring depth from a single image is an ill-posed problem due to the loss of scale from perspective projection during the image formation process. Any scale chosen is a bias, typically stemming from training on a dataset; hence, existing works have instead opted to use relative (normalized, inverse) depth. Our goal is to recover metric-scaled depth maps through a linear transformation. The crux of our method lies in the observation that certain objects (e.g., cars, trees, street signs) are typically found or associated with certain types of scenes (e.g., outdoor). We explore whether language descriptions can be used to transform relative depth predictions to those in metric scale. Our method, RSA, takes as input a text caption describing objects present in an image and outputs the parameters of a linear transformation which can be applied globally to a relative depth map to yield metric-scaled depth predictions. We demonstrate our method on recent general-purpose monocular depth models on indoors (NYUv2, VOID) and outdoors (KITTI). When trained on multiple datasets, RSA can serve as a general alignment module in zero-shot settings. Our method improves over common practices in aligning relative to metric depth and results in predictions that are comparable to an upper bound of fitting relative depth to ground truth via a linear transformation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Chang, Shuchen Weng, Huan Ouyang, Yu Li, Si Li, Boxin Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic video colorization is inherently an ill-posed problem because each monochrome frame has multiple optional color candidates. Previous exemplar-based video colorization methods restrict the user's imagination due to the elaborate retrieval process. Alternatively, conditional image colorization methods combined with post-processing algorithms still struggle to maintain temporal consistency. To address these issues, we present Language-based video Colorization for Creative and Consistent Colors (L-C4) to guide the colorization process using user-provided language descriptions. Our model is built upon a pre-trained cross-modality generative model, leveraging its comprehensive language understanding and robust color representation abilities. We introduce the cross-modality pre-fusion module to generate instance-aware text embeddings, enabling the application of creative colors. Additionally, we propose temporally deformable attention to prevent flickering or color shifts, and cross-clip fusion to maintain long-term color consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that L-C4 outperforms relevant methods, achieving semantically accurate colors, unrestricted creative correspondence, and temporally robust consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxin Guo, Jingyu Liu, Mingda Li, Xiaoying Tang, Qingbin Liu, Xi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) is a crucial capability for video understanding models and plays a vital role in downstream tasks such as video browsing and editing. To effectively handle various tasks simultaneously and enable zero-shot prediction, there is a growing trend in employing video LLMs for VTG tasks. However, current video LLM-based methods rely exclusively on natural language generation, lacking the ability to model the clear structure inherent in videos, which restricts their effectiveness in tackling VTG tasks. To address this issue, this paper first formally introduces causal event modeling framework, which represents videos as sequences of events, and predict the current event using previous events, video inputs, and textural instructions. Each event consists of three components: timestamps, salient scores, and textual captions. We then propose a novel task-interleaved video LLM called TRACE to effectively implement the causal event modeling framework in practice. The TRACE processes visual frames, timestamps, salient scores, and text as distinct tasks, employing various encoders and decoding heads for each. Task tokens are arranged in an interleaved sequence according to the causal event modeling framework's formulation. Extensive experiments on various VTG tasks and datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TRACE compared to state-of-the-art video LLMs. Our model and code are available at \url{https://github.com/gyxxyg/TRACE}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolaos Giakoumoglou, Tania Stathaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely used to transfer knowledge from large, accurate models (teachers) to smaller, efficient ones (students). Recent methods have explored enforcing consistency by incorporating causal interpretations to distill invariant representations. In this work, we extend this line of research by introducing a dual augmentation strategy to promote invariant feature learning in both teacher and student models. Our approach leverages different augmentations applied to both models during distillation, pushing the student to capture robust, transferable features. This dual augmentation strategy complements invariant causal distillation by ensuring that the learned representations remain stable across a wider range of data variations and transformations. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, achieving competitive results in same-architecture KD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingao Xiao, Yang He</p>
<p>Abstract: In ImageNet-condensation, the storage for auxiliary soft labels exceeds that of the condensed dataset by over 30 times. However, are large-scale soft labels necessary for large-scale dataset distillation? In this paper, we first discover that the high within-class similarity in condensed datasets necessitates the use of large-scale soft labels. This high within-class similarity can be attributed to the fact that previous methods use samples from different classes to construct a single batch for batch normalization (BN) matching. To reduce the within-class similarity, we introduce class-wise supervision during the image synthesizing process by batching the samples within classes, instead of across classes. As a result, we can increase within-class diversity and reduce the size of required soft labels. A key benefit of improved image diversity is that soft label compression can be achieved through simple random pruning, eliminating the need for complex rule-based strategies. Experiments validate our discoveries. For example, when condensing ImageNet-1K to 200 images per class, our approach compresses the required soft labels from 113 GB to 2.8 GB (40x compression) with a 2.6% performance gain.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen Wang, Qiuyu Wang, Kecheng Zheng, Hao Ouyang, Zhekai Chen, Biao Gong, Hao Chen, Yujun Shen, Chunhua Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Framer for interactive frame interpolation, which targets producing smoothly transitioning frames between two images as per user creativity. Concretely, besides taking the start and end frames as inputs, our approach supports customizing the transition process by tailoring the trajectory of some selected keypoints. Such a design enjoys two clear benefits. First, incorporating human interaction mitigates the issue arising from numerous possibilities of transforming one image to another, and in turn enables finer control of local motions. Second, as the most basic form of interaction, keypoints help establish the correspondence across frames, enhancing the model to handle challenging cases (e.g., objects on the start and end frames are of different shapes and styles). It is noteworthy that our system also offers an "autopilot" mode, where we introduce a module to estimate the keypoints and refine the trajectory automatically, to simplify the usage in practice. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the appealing performance of Framer on various applications, such as image morphing, time-lapse video generation, cartoon interpolation, etc. The code, the model, and the interface will be released to facilitate further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xupeng Chen, Zhixin Lai, Kangrui Ruan, Shichu Chen, Jiaxiang Liu, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made significant strides in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA), yet prevalent studies often interpret images holistically, overlooking the visual regions of interest that may contain crucial information, potentially aligning with a doctor's prior knowledge that can be incorporated with minimal annotations (e.g., bounding boxes). To address this gap, this paper introduces R-LLaVA, designed to enhance biomedical VQA understanding by integrating simple medical annotations as prior knowledge directly into the image space through CLIP. These annotated visual regions of interest are then fed into the LLaVA model during training, aiming to enrich the model's understanding of biomedical queries. Experimental evaluation on four standard Med-VQA datasets demonstrates R-LLaVA's superiority over existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods. Additionally, to verify the model's capability in visual comprehension, a novel multiple-choice medical visual understanding dataset is introduced, confirming the positive impact of focusing on visual regions of interest in advancing biomedical VQA understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyu Sun, Qiuhong Ke, Yongcai Wang, Wang Chen, Kang Yang, Deying Li, Jianfei Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the 3D domain generalization (3DDG) ability of large 3D models based on prevalent prompt learning. Recent works demonstrate the performances of 3D point cloud recognition can be boosted remarkably by parameter-efficient prompt tuning. However, we observe that the improvement on downstream tasks comes at the expense of a severe drop in 3D domain generalization. To resolve this challenge, we present a comprehensive regulation framework that allows the learnable prompts to actively interact with the well-learned general knowledge in large 3D models to maintain good generalization. Specifically, the proposed framework imposes multiple explicit constraints on the prompt learning trajectory by maximizing the mutual agreement between task-specific predictions and task-agnostic knowledge. We design the regulation framework as a plug-and-play module to embed into existing representative large 3D models. Surprisingly, our method not only realizes consistently increasing generalization ability but also enhances task-specific 3D recognition performances across various 3DDG benchmarks by a clear margin. Considering the lack of study and evaluation on 3DDG, we also create three new benchmarks, namely base-to-new, cross-dataset and few-shot generalization benchmarks, to enrich the field and inspire future research.

<p>Abstract: This paper puts forth an innovative approach that fuses deep learning, fractal analysis, and turbulence feature extraction techniques to create abstract artworks in the style of Pollock. The content and style characteristics of the image are extracted by the MindSpore deep learning framework and a pre-trained VGG19 model. An optimisation process is then employed to The method generates high-quality Pollock-style images by combining content loss, style loss and full variance loss to achieve accurate style migration. Furthermore, this paper implements a fractal dimension calculation method based on the difference box-counting method, which effectively estimates the fractal dimension of an image through edge extraction and fractal analysis. The method is based on a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform using a Haar wavelet to decompose the image in order to extract different frequency information. This is followed by the combination of multiple features to generate unique non-homogeneous token (NFT) labels for the authentication and protection of digital artwork. The experimental results demonstrate that the generated artworks exhibit The method demonstrates significant diversity and complexity in terms of fractal dimensions and turbulence features, while the generated NFT tags ensure the uniqueness and tamperability of each digital collection. The present method organically combines computer vision, digital signal processing and blockchain technology to provide a new solution for the creation and authentication of digital artworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajat Modi, Yogesh Singh Rawat</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose Asynchronous Perception Machine (APM), a computationally-efficient architecture for test-time-training (TTT). APM can process patches of an image one at a time in any order \textit{asymmetrically,} and \textit{still encode} semantic-awareness in the net. We demonstrate APM's ability to recognize out-of-distribution images \textit{without} dataset-specific pre-training, augmentation or any-pretext task. APM offers competitive performance over existing TTT approaches. To perform TTT, APM just distills test sample's representation \textit{once}. APM possesses a unique property: it can learn using just this single representation and starts predicting semantically-aware features.
  APM demostrates potential applications beyond test-time-training: APM can scale up to a dataset of 2D images and yield semantic-clusterings in a single forward pass. APM also provides first empirical evidence towards validating GLOM's insight, i.e. input percept is a field. Therefore, APM helps us converge towards an implementation which can do \textit{both} interpolation and perception on a \textit{shared}-connectionist hardware.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaopei Zeng, Yuanpu Cao, Bochuan Cao, Yurui Chang, Jinghui Chen, Lu Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly enhanced the quality of image synthesis, yet they have also introduced serious safety concerns, particularly the generation of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content. Previous research has demonstrated that adversarial prompts can be used to generate NSFW content. However, such adversarial text prompts are often easily detectable by text-based filters, limiting their efficacy. In this paper, we expose a previously overlooked vulnerability: adversarial image attacks targeting Image-to-Image (I2I) diffusion models. We propose AdvI2I, a novel framework that manipulates input images to induce diffusion models to generate NSFW content. By optimizing a generator to craft adversarial images, AdvI2I circumvents existing defense mechanisms, such as Safe Latent Diffusion (SLD), without altering the text prompts. Furthermore, we introduce AdvI2I-Adaptive, an enhanced version that adapts to potential countermeasures and minimizes the resemblance between adversarial images and NSFW concept embeddings, making the attack more resilient against defenses. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that both AdvI2I and AdvI2I-Adaptive can effectively bypass current safeguards, highlighting the urgent need for stronger security measures to address the misuse of I2I diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kendong Liu, Zhiyu Zhu, Chuanhao Li, Hui Liu, Huanqiang Zeng, Junhui Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we make the first attempt to align diffusion models for image inpainting with human aesthetic standards via a reinforcement learning framework, significantly improving the quality and visual appeal of inpainted images. Specifically, instead of directly measuring the divergence with paired images, we train a reward model with the dataset we construct, consisting of nearly 51,000 images annotated with human preferences. Then, we adopt a reinforcement learning process to fine-tune the distribution of a pre-trained diffusion model for image inpainting in the direction of higher reward. Moreover, we theoretically deduce the upper bound on the error of the reward model, which illustrates the potential confidence of reward estimation throughout the reinforcement alignment process, thereby facilitating accurate regularization. Extensive experiments on inpainting comparison and downstream tasks, such as image extension and 3D reconstruction, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing significant improvements in the alignment of inpainted images with human preference compared with state-of-the-art methods. This research not only advances the field of image inpainting but also provides a framework for incorporating human preference into the iterative refinement of generative models based on modeling reward accuracy, with broad implications for the design of visually driven AI applications.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21991">From Explicit Rules to Implicit Reasoning in an Interpretable Violence Monitoring System</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen-Dong Jiang, Chih-Yung Chang, Hsiang-Chuan Chang, Diptendu Sinha Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, research based on pre-trained models has demonstrated outstanding performance in violence surveillance tasks. However, these black-box systems face challenges regarding explainability during training and inference processes. An important question is how to incorporate explicit knowledge into these implicit models, thereby designing expert-driven and interpretable violence surveillance systems. This paper proposes a new paradigm for weakly supervised violence monitoring (WSVM) called Rule base Violence monitoring (RuleVM). The proposed RuleVM uses a dual-branch structure for different designs for images and text. One of the branches is called the implicit branch, which uses only visual features for coarse-grained binary classification. In this branch, image feature extraction is divided into two channels: one responsible for extracting scene frames and the other focusing on extracting actions. The other branch is called the explicit branch, which utilizes language-image alignment to perform fine-grained classification. For the language channel design in the explicit branch, the proposed RuleCLIP uses the state-of-the-art YOLO-World model to detect objects and actions in video frames, and association rules are identified through data mining methods as descriptions of the video. Leveraging the dual-branch architecture, RuleVM achieves interpretable coarse-grained and fine-grained violence surveillance. Extensive experiments were conducted on two commonly used benchmarks, and the results show that RuleCLIP achieved the best performance in both coarse-grained and fine-grained detection, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, interpretability experiments uncovered some interesting rules, such as the observation that as the number of people increases, the risk level of violent behavior also rises.</p>

Then, the cross-attention mechanism is introduced to model the intrinsic similarity relationships of multi-modal features. Finally, the multi-modal feature distribution adaptation is performed efficiently with feed-forward network, which is extended using the local maximum mean discrepancy loss. Experiments are carried out on two benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that our model can achieve excellent performance compared with existing ones.</p>

<p>Abstract: Brain imaging studies have demonstrated that diffusion MRI tractography geometric shape descriptors can inform the study of the brain's white matter pathways and their relationship to brain function. In this work, we investigate the possibility of utilizing a deep learning model to compute shape measures of the brain's white matter connections. We introduce a novel framework, TractShapeNet, that leverages a point cloud representation of tractography to compute five shape measures: length, span, volume, total surface area, and irregularity. We assess the performance of the method on a large dataset including 1065 healthy young adults. Experiments for shape measure computation demonstrate that our proposed TractShapeNet outperforms other point cloud-based neural network models in both the Pearson correlation coefficient and normalized error metrics. We compare the inference runtime results with the conventional shape computation tool DSI-Studio. Our results demonstrate that a deep learning approach enables faster and more efficient shape measure computation. We also conduct experiments on two downstream language cognition prediction tasks, showing that shape measures from TractShapeNet perform similarly to those computed by DSI-Studio.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaochong An, Guolei Sun, Yun Liu, Runjia Li, Min Wu, Ming-Ming Cheng, Ender Konukoglu, Serge Belongie</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation (FS-PCS) aims at generalizing models to segment novel categories with minimal annotated support samples. While existing FS-PCS methods have shown promise, they primarily focus on unimodal point cloud inputs, overlooking the potential benefits of leveraging multimodal information. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a cost-free multimodal FS-PCS setup, utilizing textual labels and the potentially available 2D image modality. Under this easy-to-achieve setup, we present the MultiModal Few-Shot SegNet (MM-FSS), a model effectively harnessing complementary information from multiple modalities. MM-FSS employs a shared backbone with two heads to extract intermodal and unimodal visual features, and a pretrained text encoder to generate text embeddings. To fully exploit the multimodal information, we propose a Multimodal Correlation Fusion (MCF) module to generate multimodal correlations, and a Multimodal Semantic Fusion (MSF) module to refine the correlations using text-aware semantic guidance. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective Test-time Adaptive Cross-modal Calibration (TACC) technique to mitigate training bias, further improving generalization. Experimental results on S3DIS and ScanNet datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements achieved by our method. The efficacy of our approach indicates the benefits of leveraging commonly-ignored free modalities for FS-PCS, providing valuable insights for future research.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship detection using deep learning have significantly improved accuracy and speed. However, detecting small targets against complex backgrounds remains a challenge. This letter introduces RSNet, a lightweight framework designed to enhance ship detection in SAR imagery. To ensure accuracy with fewer parameters, RSNet uses Waveletpool-ContextGuided (WCG) as its backbone, guiding global context understanding through multi-scale wavelet features for effective detection in complex scenes. Additionally, Waveletpool-StarFusion (WSF) is introduced as the neck, employing a residual wavelet element-wise multiplication structure to achieve higher-dimensional nonlinear features without increasing network width. The LS module is introduced as detect components to achieve efficient detection through lightweight shared convolutional structure and multi-format compatibility. Experiments on the SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) and High-Resolution SAR Image Dataset (HRSID) demonstrate that RSNet achieves a strong balance between lightweight design and detection performance, surpassing many state-of-the-art detectors, reaching 72.5% and 67.6% in \textbf{\(\mathbf{mAP_{.50:.95}}\) }respectively with 1.49M parameters.

<p>Abstract: Recent self-supervised clustering-based pre-training techniques like DINO and Cribo have shown impressive results for downstream detection and segmentation tasks. However, real-world applications such as autonomous driving face challenges with imbalanced object class and size distributions and complex scene geometries. In this paper, we propose S3PT a novel scene semantics and structure guided clustering to provide more scene-consistent objectives for self-supervised training. Specifically, our contributions are threefold: First, we incorporate semantic distribution consistent clustering to encourage better representation of rare classes such as motorcycles or animals. Second, we introduce object diversity consistent spatial clustering, to handle imbalanced and diverse object sizes, ranging from large background areas to small objects such as pedestrians and traffic signs. Third, we propose a depth-guided spatial clustering to regularize learning based on geometric information of the scene, thus further refining region separation on the feature level. Our learned representations significantly improve performance in downstream semantic segmentation and 3D object detection tasks on the nuScenes, nuImages, and Cityscapes datasets and show promising domain translation properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Wu, Tsz Ting Chung, Kai Chen, Dit-Yan Yeung</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance in vision-language reasoning, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) might generate hallucinated contents that do not exist in the given image. Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, in this paper we design a unified framework to measure object and relation hallucination in LVLMs simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to conduct hallucination evaluation on (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs' responses, and thus, could be easily generalized to different vision-language tasks. Based on our framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation hallucination at the same time. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE and observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple yet effective training-free approach to mitigate hallucinations for LVLMs, with which, we exceed all open-sourced counterparts on Tri-HE, achieving comparable performance with the powerful GPT-4V.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jyh-Jing Hwang, Runsheng Xu, Hubert Lin, Wei-Chih Hung, Jingwei Ji, Kristy Choi, Di Huang, Tong He, Paul Covington, Benjamin Sapp, Yin Zhou, James Guo, Dragomir Anguelov, Mingxing Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce EMMA, an End-to-end Multimodal Model for Autonomous driving. Built on a multi-modal large language model foundation, EMMA directly maps raw camera sensor data into various driving-specific outputs, including planner trajectories, perception objects, and road graph elements. EMMA maximizes the utility of world knowledge from the pre-trained large language models, by representing all non-sensor inputs (e.g. navigation instructions and ego vehicle status) and outputs (e.g. trajectories and 3D locations) as natural language text. This approach allows EMMA to jointly process various driving tasks in a unified language space, and generate the outputs for each task using task-specific prompts. Empirically, we demonstrate EMMA's effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art performance in motion planning on nuScenes as well as competitive results on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). EMMA also yields competitive results for camera-primary 3D object detection on the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). We show that co-training EMMA with planner trajectories, object detection, and road graph tasks yields improvements across all three domains, highlighting EMMA's potential as a generalist model for autonomous driving applications. However, EMMA also exhibits certain limitations: it can process only a small amount of image frames, does not incorporate accurate 3D sensing modalities like LiDAR or radar and is computationally expensive. We hope that our results will inspire further research to mitigate these issues and to further evolve the state of the art in autonomous driving model architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Zhang, Baoxin Li, Jae-sun Seo, Yu Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the long-range attention mechanism of vision transformers has driven significant performance breakthroughs across various computer vision tasks. However, the traditional self-attention mechanism, which processes both informative and non-informative tokens, suffers from inefficiency and inaccuracies. While sparse attention mechanisms have been introduced to mitigate these issues by pruning tokens involved in attention, they often lack context-awareness and intelligence. These mechanisms frequently apply a uniform token selection strategy across different inputs for batch training or optimize efficiency only for the inference stage. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm: Select and Pack Attention (SPA). SPA dynamically selects informative tokens using a low-cost gating layer supervised by selection labels and packs these tokens into new batches, enabling a variable number of tokens to be used in parallelized GPU batch training and inference. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and computer vision tasks demonstrate that SPA delivers superior performance and efficiency, including a 0.6 mAP improvement in object detection and a 16.4% reduction in computational costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johanna Karras, Yingwei Li, Nan Liu, Luyang Zhu, Innfarn Yoo, Andreas Lugmayr, Chris Lee, Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Fashion-VDM, a video diffusion model (VDM) for generating virtual try-on videos. Given an input garment image and person video, our method aims to generate a high-quality try-on video of the person wearing the given garment, while preserving the person's identity and motion. Image-based virtual try-on has shown impressive results; however, existing video virtual try-on (VVT) methods are still lacking garment details and temporal consistency. To address these issues, we propose a diffusion-based architecture for video virtual try-on, split classifier-free guidance for increased control over the conditioning inputs, and a progressive temporal training strategy for single-pass 64-frame, 512px video generation. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of joint image-video training for video try-on, especially when video data is limited. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our approach sets the new state-of-the-art for video virtual try-on.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jongmin Lee, Minsu Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Determining the 3D orientations of an object in an image, known as single-image pose estimation, is a crucial task in 3D vision applications. Existing methods typically learn 3D rotations parametrized in the spatial domain using Euler angles or quaternions, but these representations often introduce discontinuities and singularities. SO(3)-equivariant networks enable the structured capture of pose patterns with data-efficient learning, but the parametrizations in spatial domain are incompatible with their architecture, particularly spherical CNNs, which operate in the frequency domain to enhance computational efficiency. To overcome these issues, we propose a frequency-domain approach that directly predicts Wigner-D coefficients for 3D rotation regression, aligning with the operations of spherical CNNs. Our SO(3)-equivariant pose harmonics predictor overcomes the limitations of spatial parameterizations, ensuring consistent pose estimation under arbitrary rotations. Trained with a frequency-domain regression loss, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks such as ModelNet10-SO(3) and PASCAL3D+, with significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and data efficiency.</p>

Tenenbaum, Agus Sudjianto, Phuong Le, Arun Prakash R, Nengfeng Zhou, Joel Vaughan, Yaqun Wang, Anwesha Bhattacharyya, Kristjan Greenewald, David D. Cox, Dan Gutfreund</p>
<p>Abstract: Current autoencoder-based disentangled representation learning methods achieve disentanglement by penalizing the (aggregate) posterior to encourage statistical independence of the latent factors. This approach introduces a trade-off between disentangled representation learning and reconstruction quality since the model does not have enough capacity to learn correlated latent variables that capture detail information present in most image data. To overcome this trade-off, we present a novel multi-stage modeling approach where the disentangled factors are first learned using a penalty-based disentangled representation learning method; then, the low-quality reconstruction is improved with another deep generative model that is trained to model the missing correlated latent variables, adding detail information while maintaining conditioning on the previously learned disentangled factors. Taken together, our multi-stage modelling approach results in a single, coherent probabilistic model that is theoretically justified by the principal of D-separation and can be realized with a variety of model classes including likelihood-based models such as variational autoencoders, implicit models such as generative adversarial networks, and tractable models like normalizing flows or mixtures of Gaussians. We demonstrate that our multi-stage model has higher reconstruction quality than current state-of-the-art methods with equivalent disentanglement performance across multiple standard benchmarks. In addition, we apply the multi-stage model to generate synthetic tabular datasets, showcasing an enhanced performance over benchmark models across a variety of metrics. The interpretability analysis further indicates that the multi-stage model can effectively uncover distinct and meaningful features of variations from which the original distribution can be recovered.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarthak Mittal, Korbinian Abstreiter, Stefan Bauer, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf, Arash Mehrjou</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based methods represented as stochastic differential equations on a continuous-time domain have recently proven successful as a non-adversarial generative model. Training such models relies on denoising score matching, which can be seen as multi-scale denoising autoencoders. Here, we augment the denoising score matching framework to enable representation learning without any supervised signal. GANs and VAEs learn representations by directly transforming latent codes to data samples. In contrast, the introduced diffusion-based representation learning relies on a new formulation of the denoising score matching objective and thus encodes the information needed for denoising. We illustrate how this difference allows for manual control of the level of details encoded in the representation. Using the same approach, we propose to learn an infinite-dimensional latent code that achieves improvements of state-of-the-art models on semi-supervised image classification. We also compare the quality of learned representations of diffusion score matching with other methods like autoencoder and contrastively trained systems through their performances on downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Villarreal, Bibek Poudel, Ryan Wickman, Yu Shen, Weizi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing use of machine learning algorithms and ubiquitous sensors, many `perception-to-control' systems are being developed and deployed. To ensure their trustworthiness, improving their robustness through adversarial training is one potential approach. We propose a gradient-free adversarial training technique, named AutoJoin, to effectively and efficiently produce robust models for image-based maneuvering. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods with testing on over 5M images, AutoJoin achieves significant performance increases up to the 40% range against perturbations while improving on clean performance up to 300%. AutoJoin is also highly efficient, saving up to 86% time per training epoch and 90% training data over other state-of-the-art techniques. The core idea of AutoJoin is to use a decoder attachment to the original regression model creating a denoising autoencoder within the architecture. This architecture allows the tasks `maneuvering' and `denoising sensor input' to be jointly learnt and reinforce each other's performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning techniques have achieved superior performance in computer-aided medical image analysis, yet they are still vulnerable to imperceptible adversarial attacks, resulting in potential misdiagnosis in clinical practice. Oppositely, recent years have also witnessed remarkable progress in defense against these tailored adversarial examples in deep medical diagnosis systems. In this exposition, we present a comprehensive survey on recent advances in adversarial attacks and defenses for medical image analysis with a systematic taxonomy in terms of the application scenario. We also provide a unified framework for different types of adversarial attack and defense methods in the context of medical image analysis. For a fair comparison, we establish a new benchmark for adversarially robust medical diagnosis models obtained by adversarial training under various scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey paper that provides a thorough evaluation of adversarially robust medical diagnosis models. By analyzing qualitative and quantitative results, we conclude this survey with a detailed discussion of current challenges for adversarial attack and defense in medical image analysis systems to shed light on future research directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhijeet Nayak, Daniele Cattaneo, Abhinav Valada</p>
<p>Abstract: Localization is paramount for autonomous robots. While camera and LiDAR-based approaches have been extensively investigated, they are affected by adverse illumination and weather conditions. Therefore, radar sensors have recently gained attention due to their intrinsic robustness to such conditions. In this paper, we propose RaLF, a novel deep neural network-based approach for localizing radar scans in a LiDAR map of the environment, by jointly learning to address both place recognition and metric localization. RaLF is composed of radar and LiDAR feature encoders, a place recognition head that generates global descriptors, and a metric localization head that predicts the 3-DoF transformation between the radar scan and the map. We tackle the place recognition task by learning a shared embedding space between the two modalities via cross-modal metric learning. Additionally, we perform metric localization by predicting pixel-level flow vectors that align the query radar scan with the LiDAR map. We extensively evaluate our approach on multiple real-world driving datasets and show that RaLF achieves state-of-the-art performance for both place recognition and metric localization. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach can effectively generalize to different cities and sensor setups than the ones used during training. We make the code and trained models publicly available at http://ralf.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mathew Mithra Noel, Venkataraman Muthiah-Nakarajan</p>
<p>Abstract: Higher order artificial neurons whose outputs are computed by applying an activation function to a higher order multinomial function of the inputs have been considered in the past, but did not gain acceptance due to the extra parameters and computational cost. However, higher order neurons have significantly greater learning capabilities since the decision boundaries of higher order neurons can be complex surfaces instead of just hyperplanes. The boundary of a single quadratic neuron can be a general hyper-quadric surface allowing it to learn many nonlinearly separable datasets. Since quadratic forms can be represented by symmetric matrices, only $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ additional parameters are needed instead of $n^2$. A quadratic Logistic regression model is first presented. Solutions to the XOR problem with a single quadratic neuron are considered. The complete vectorized equations for both forward and backward propagation in feedforward networks composed of quadratic neurons are derived. A reduced parameter quadratic neural network model with just $ n $ additional parameters per neuron that provides a compromise between learning ability and computational cost is presented. Comparison on benchmark classification datasets are used to demonstrate that a final layer of quadratic neurons enables networks to achieve higher accuracy with significantly fewer hidden layer neurons. In particular this paper shows that any dataset composed of $\mathcal{C}$ bounded clusters can be separated with only a single layer of $\mathcal{C}$ quadratic neurons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Catherine Bouchard, Andr\'eanne Desch\^enes, Vincent Boulanger, Jean-Michel Bellavance, Julia Chabbert, Alexy Pelletier-Rioux, Flavie Lavoie-Cardinal, Christian Gagn\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of signal unmixing algorithms is essential for leveraging multimodal datasets acquired through a wide array of scientific imaging technologies, including hyperspectral or time-resolved acquisitions. In experimental physics, enhancing the spatio-temporal resolution or expanding the number of detection channels often leads to diminished sampling rate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), significantly affecting the efficacy of signal unmixing algorithms. We propose Latent Unmixing, a new approach which applies band-pass filters to the latent space of a multi-dimensional convolutional neural network to disentangle overlapping signal components. It enables better isolation and quantification of individual signal contributions, especially in the context of undersampled distributions. Using multi-dimensional convolution kernels to process all dimensions simultaneously enhances the network's ability to extract information from adjacent pixels, and time- or spectral-bins. This approach enables more effective separation of components in cases where individual pixels do not provide clear, well-resolved information. We showcase the method's practical use in experimental physics through two test cases that highlight the versatility of our approach: fluorescence lifetime microscopy and mode decomposition in optical fibers. The latent unmixing method extracts valuable information from complex signals that cannot be resolved by standard methods. It opens new possibilities in optics and photonics for multichannel separations at an increased sampling rate.</p>

<p>Abstract: MRI, a widespread non-invasive medical imaging modality, is highly sensitive to patient motion. Despite many attempts over the years, motion correction remains a difficult problem and there is no general method applicable to all situations. We propose a retrospective method for motion estimation and correction to tackle the problem of in-plane rigid-body motion, apt for classical 2D Spin-Echo scans of the brain, which are regularly used in clinical practice. Due to the sequential acquisition of k-space, motion artifacts are well localized. The method leverages the power of deep neural networks to estimate motion parameters in k-space and uses a model-based approach to restore degraded images to avoid ''hallucinations''. Notable advantages are its ability to estimate motion occurring in high spatial frequencies without the need of a motion-free reference. The proposed method operates on the whole k-space dynamic range and is moderately affected by the lower SNR of higher harmonics. As a proof of concept, we provide models trained using supervised learning on 600k motion simulations based on motion-free scans of 43 different subjects. Generalization performance was tested with simulations as well as in-vivo. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations are presented for motion parameter estimations and image reconstruction. Experimental results show that our approach is able to obtain good generalization performance on simulated data and in-vivo acquisitions.

<p>Abstract: As the capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs) continue to advance, evaluating the performance of LMMs emerges as an increasing need. Additionally, there is an even larger gap in evaluating the advanced knowledge and reasoning abilities of LMMs in non-English contexts such as Chinese. We introduce CMMMU, a new Chinese Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs on tasks demanding college-level subject knowledge and deliberate reasoning in a Chinese context. CMMMU is inspired by and strictly follows the annotation and analysis pattern of MMMU. CMMMU includes 12k manually collected multimodal questions from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks, covering six core disciplines: Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering, like its companion, MMMU. These questions span 30 subjects and comprise 39 highly heterogeneous image types, such as charts, diagrams, maps, tables, music sheets, and chemical structures. CMMMU focuses on complex perception and reasoning with domain-specific knowledge in the Chinese context. We evaluate 11 open-source LLMs and one proprietary GPT-4V(ision). Even GPT-4V only achieves accuracies of 42%, indicating a large space for improvement. CMMMU will boost the community to build the next-generation LMMs towards expert artificial intelligence and promote the democratization of LMMs by providing diverse language contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: CLIP embeddings have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of multimodal applications. However, these high-dimensional, dense vector representations are not easily interpretable, limiting our understanding of the rich structure of CLIP and its use in downstream applications that require transparency. In this work, we show that the semantic structure of CLIP's latent space can be leveraged to provide interpretability, allowing for the decomposition of representations into semantic concepts. We formulate this problem as one of sparse recovery and propose a novel method, Sparse Linear Concept Embeddings, for transforming CLIP representations into sparse linear combinations of human-interpretable concepts. Distinct from previous work, SpLiCE is task-agnostic and can be used, without training, to explain and even replace traditional dense CLIP representations, maintaining high downstream performance while significantly improving their interpretability. We also demonstrate significant use cases of SpLiCE representations including detecting spurious correlations and model editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyu Yan, Guanyu Huang, Fengyu Quan, Haoyao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Panoramic observation using fisheye cameras is significant in virtual reality (VR) and robot perception. However, panoramic images synthesized by traditional methods lack depth information and can only provide three degrees-of-freedom (3DoF) rotation rendering in VR applications. To fully preserve and exploit the parallax information within the original fisheye cameras, we introduce MSI-NeRF, which combines deep learning omnidirectional depth estimation and novel view synthesis. We construct a multi-sphere image as a cost volume through feature extraction and warping of the input images. We further build an implicit radiance field using spatial points and interpolated 3D feature vectors as input, which can simultaneously realize omnidirectional depth estimation and 6DoF view synthesis. Leveraging the knowledge from depth estimation task, our method can learn scene appearance by source view supervision only. It does not require novel target views and can be trained conveniently on existing panorama depth estimation datasets. Our network has the generalization ability to reconstruct unknown scenes efficiently using only four images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods in both depth estimation and novel view synthesis tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Yi, Yu-Hang He, De-Chuan Zhan, Han-Jia Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel in zero-shot image classification by pairing images with textual category names. The expanding variety of Pre-Trained VLMs enhances the likelihood of identifying a suitable VLM for specific tasks. To better reuse the VLM resource and fully leverage its potential on different zero-shot image classification tasks, a promising strategy is selecting appropriate Pre-Trained VLMs from the VLM Zoo, relying solely on the text data of the target dataset without access to the dataset's images. In this paper, we analyze two inherent challenges in assessing the ability of a VLM in this Language-Only VLM selection: the "Modality Gap" - the disparity in VLM's embeddings across two different modalities, making text a less reliable substitute for images; and the "Capability Gap" - the discrepancy between the VLM's overall ranking and its ranking for target dataset, hindering direct prediction of a model's dataset-specific performance from its general performance. We propose VLM Selection With gAp Bridging (SWAB) to mitigate the negative impact of two gaps. SWAB first adopts optimal transport to capture the relevance between open-source and target datasets with a transportation matrix. It then uses this matrix to transfer useful statistics of VLMs from open-source datasets to the target dataset for bridging two gaps. By bridging two gaps to obtain better substitutes for test images, SWAB can accurately predict the performance ranking of different VLMs on the target task without the need for the dataset's images. Experiments across various VLMs and image classification datasets validate SWAB's effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiping Zhuang, Yizhu Chen, Di Fang, Run He, Kai Tong, Hongxin Wei, Ziqian Zeng, Cen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) trains a network on sequential tasks with separated categories in each task but suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where models quickly lose previously learned knowledge when acquiring new tasks. The generalized CIL (GCIL) aims to address the CIL problem in a more real-world scenario, where incoming data have mixed data categories and unknown sample size distribution. Existing attempts for the GCIL either have poor performance or invade data privacy by saving exemplars. In this paper, we propose a new exemplar-free GCIL technique named generalized analytic continual learning (GACL). The GACL adopts analytic learning (a gradient-free training technique) and delivers an analytical (i.e., closed-form) solution to the GCIL scenario. This solution is derived via decomposing the incoming data into exposed and unexposed classes, thereby attaining a weight-invariant property, a rare yet valuable property supporting an equivalence between incremental learning and its joint training. Such an equivalence is crucial in GCIL settings as data distributions among different tasks no longer pose challenges to adopting our GACL. Theoretically, this equivalence property is validated through matrix analysis tools. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments where, compared with existing GCIL methods, our GACL exhibits a consistently leading performance across various datasets and GCIL settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghuan Liu, Zixuan Chen, Xuxin Cheng, Yandong Ji, Ri-Zhao Qiu, Ruihan Yang, Xiaolong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of mobile manipulation using legged robots equipped with an arm, namely legged loco-manipulation. The robot legs, while usually utilized for mobility, offer an opportunity to amplify the manipulation capabilities by conducting whole-body control. That is, the robot can control the legs and the arm at the same time to extend its workspace. We propose a framework that can conduct the whole-body control autonomously with visual observations. Our approach, namely Visual Whole-Body Control(VBC), is composed of a low-level policy using all degrees of freedom to track the body velocities along with the end-effector position, and a high-level policy proposing the velocities and end-effector position based on visual inputs. We train both levels of policies in simulation and perform Sim2Real transfer for real robot deployment. We perform extensive experiments and show significant improvements over baselines in picking up diverse objects in different configurations (heights, locations, orientations) and environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Ni, Piotr Koniusz</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) significantly advanced image generation but their performance heavily depends on abundant training data. In scenarios with limited data, GANs often struggle with discriminator overfitting and unstable training. Batch Normalization (BN), despite being known for enhancing generalization and training stability, has rarely been used in the discriminator of Data-Efficient GANs. Our work addresses this gap by identifying a critical flaw in BN: the tendency for gradient explosion during the centering and scaling steps. To tackle this issue, we present CHAIN (lipsCHitz continuity constrAIned Normalization), which replaces the conventional centering step with zero-mean regularization and integrates a Lipschitz continuity constraint in the scaling step. CHAIN further enhances GAN training by adaptively interpolating the normalized and unnormalized features, effectively avoiding discriminator overfitting. Our theoretical analyses firmly establishes CHAIN's effectiveness in reducing gradients in latent features and weights, improving stability and generalization in GAN training. Empirical evidence supports our theory. CHAIN achieves state-of-the-art results in data-limited scenarios on CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, five low-shot and seven high-resolution few-shot image datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taichi Sakaguchi, Akira Taniguchi, Yoshinobu Hagiwara, Lotfi El Hafi, Shoichi Hasegawa, Tadahiro Taniguchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Improving instance-specific image goal navigation (InstanceImageNav), which locates the identical object in a real-world environment from a query image, is essential for robotic systems to assist users in finding desired objects. The challenge lies in the domain gap between low-quality images observed by the moving robot, characterized by motion blur and low-resolution, and high-quality query images provided by the user. Such domain gaps could significantly reduce the task success rate but have not been the focus of previous work. To address this, we propose a novel method called Few-shot Cross-quality Instance-aware Adaptation (CrossIA), which employs contrastive learning with an instance classifier to align features between massive low- and few high-quality images. This approach effectively reduces the domain gap by bringing the latent representations of cross-quality images closer on an instance basis. Additionally, the system integrates an object image collection with a pre-trained deblurring model to enhance the observed image quality. Our method fine-tunes the SimSiam model, pre-trained on ImageNet, using CrossIA. We evaluated our method's effectiveness through an InstanceImageNav task with 20 different types of instances, where the robot identifies the same instance in a real-world environment as a high-quality query image. Our experiments showed that our method improves the task success rate by up to three times compared to the baseline, a conventional approach based on SuperGlue. These findings highlight the potential of leveraging contrastive learning and image enhancement techniques to bridge the domain gap and improve object localization in robotic applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Batuhan T\"omek\c{c}e, Mark Vero, Robin Staab, Martin Vechev</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous in our daily tasks and digital interactions, associated privacy risks are increasingly in focus. While LLM privacy research has primarily focused on the leakage of model training data, it has recently been shown that LLMs can make accurate privacy-infringing inferences from previously unseen texts. With the rise of vision-language models (VLMs), capable of understanding both images and text, a key question is whether this concern transfers to the previously unexplored domain of benign images posted online. To answer this question, we compile an image dataset with human-annotated labels of the image owner's personal attributes. In order to understand the privacy risks posed by VLMs beyond traditional human attribute recognition, our dataset consists of images where the inferable private attributes do not stem from direct depictions of humans. On this dataset, we evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs, finding that they can infer various personal attributes at up to 77.6% accuracy. Concerningly, we observe that accuracy scales with the general capabilities of the models, implying that future models can be misused as stronger inferential adversaries, establishing an imperative for the development of adequate defenses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dang Nguyen, Paymon Haddad, Eric Gan, Baharan Mirzasoleiman</p>
<p>Abstract: Can we modify the training data distribution to encourage the underlying optimization method toward finding solutions with superior generalization performance on in-distribution data? In this work, we approach this question for the first time by comparing the inductive bias of gradient descent (GD) with that of sharpness-aware minimization (SAM). By studying a two-layer CNN, we rigorously prove that SAM learns different features more uniformly, particularly in early epochs. That is, SAM is less susceptible to simplicity bias compared to GD. We also show that examples containing features that are learned early are separable from the rest based on the model's output. Based on this observation, we propose a method that (i) clusters examples based on the network output early in training, (ii) identifies a cluster of examples with similar network output, and (iii) upsamples the rest of examples only once to alleviate the simplicity bias. We show empirically that USEFUL effectively improves the generalization performance on the original data distribution when training with various gradient methods, including (S)GD and SAM. Notably, we demonstrate that our method can be combined with SAM variants and existing data augmentation strategies to achieve, to the best of our knowledge, state-of-the-art performance for training ResNet18 on CIFAR10, STL10, CINIC10, Tiny-ImageNet; ResNet34 on CIFAR100; and VGG19 and DenseNet121 on CIFAR10.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luciano Dyballa, Evan Gerritz, Steven W. Zucker</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalization to unseen data remains poorly understood for deep learning classification and foundation models, especially in the open set scenario. How can one assess the ability of networks to adapt to new or extended versions of their input space in the spirit of few-shot learning, out-of-distribution generalization, domain adaptation, and category discovery? Which layers of a network are likely to generalize best? We provide a new method for evaluating the capacity of networks to represent a sampled domain, regardless of whether the network has been trained on all classes in that domain. Our approach is the following: after fine-tuning state-of-the-art pre-trained models for visual classification on a particular domain, we assess their performance on data from related but distinct variations in that domain. Generalization power is quantified as a function of the latent embeddings of unseen data from intermediate layers for both unsupervised and supervised settings. Working throughout all stages of the network, we find that (i) high classification accuracy does not imply high generalizability; and (ii) deeper layers in a model do not always generalize the best, which has implications for pruning. Since the trends observed across datasets are largely consistent, we conclude that our approach reveals (a function of) the intrinsic capacity of the different layers of a model to generalize.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lennart Alexander Van der Goten, Jingyu Guo, Kevin Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: The presence of motion artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans poses a significant challenge, where even minor patient movements can lead to artifacts that may compromise the scan's utility.This paper introduces MAsked MOtion Correction (MAMOC), a novel method designed to address the issue of Retrospective Artifact Correction (RAC) in motion-affected MRI brain scans. MAMOC uses masked autoencoding self-supervision, transfer learning and test-time prediction to efficiently remove motion artifacts, producing high-fidelity, native-resolution scans. Until recently, realistic, openly available paired artifact presentations for training and evaluating retrospective motion correction methods did not exist, making it necessary to simulate motion artifacts. Leveraging the MR-ART dataset and bigger unlabeled datasets (ADNI, OASIS-3, IXI), this work is the first to evaluate motion correction in MRI scans using real motion data on a public dataset, showing that MAMOC achieves improved performance over existing motion correction methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyang Zhou, Zhiyuan Fan, Dongjie Cheng, Sihan Yang, Zhaorun Chen, Chenhang Cui, Xiyao Wang, Yun Li, Linjun Zhang, Huaxiu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress by integrating pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and vision models through instruction tuning. Despite these advancements, LVLMs often exhibit the hallucination phenomenon, where generated text responses appear linguistically plausible but contradict the input image, indicating a misalignment between image and text pairs. This misalignment arises because the model tends to prioritize textual information over visual input, even when both the language model and visual representations are of high quality. Existing methods leverage additional models or human annotations to curate preference data and enhance modality alignment through preference optimization. These approaches may not effectively reflect the target LVLM's preferences, making the curated preferences easily distinguishable. Our work addresses these challenges by proposing the Calibrated Self-Rewarding (CSR) approach, which enables the model to self-improve by iteratively generating candidate responses, evaluating the reward for each response, and curating preference data for fine-tuning. In the reward modeling, we employ a step-wise strategy and incorporate visual constraints into the self-rewarding process to place greater emphasis on visual input. Empirical results demonstrate that CSR enhances performance and reduces hallucinations across ten benchmarks and tasks, achieving substantial improvements over existing methods by 7.62%. Our empirical results are further supported by rigorous theoretical analysis, under mild assumptions, verifying the effectiveness of introducing visual constraints into the self-rewarding paradigm. Additionally, CSR shows compatibility with different vision-language models and the ability to incrementally improve performance through iterative fine-tuning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Metod Jazbec, Alexander Timans, Tin Had\v{z}i Veljkovi\'c, Kaspar Sakmann, Dan Zhang, Christian A. Naesseth, Eric Nalisnick</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling machine learning models significantly improves their performance. However, such gains come at the cost of inference being slow and resource-intensive. Early-exit neural networks (EENNs) offer a promising solution: they accelerate inference by allowing intermediate layers to exit and produce a prediction early. Yet a fundamental issue with EENNs is how to determine when to exit without severely degrading performance. In other words, when is it 'safe' for an EENN to go 'fast'? To address this issue, we investigate how to adapt frameworks of risk control to EENNs. Risk control offers a distribution-free, post-hoc solution that tunes the EENN's exiting mechanism so that exits only occur when the output is of sufficient quality. We empirically validate our insights on a range of vision and language tasks, demonstrating that risk control can produce substantial computational savings, all the while preserving user-specified performance goals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghao Yang, Linlin Gao, Pengyuan Li, Wenbo Li, Yihong Dong, Zhiying Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Current structured pruning methods often result in considerable accuracy drops due to abrupt network changes and loss of information from pruned structures. To address these issues, we introduce the Decay Pruning Method (DPM), a novel smooth pruning approach with a self-rectifying mechanism. DPM consists of two key components: (i) Smooth Pruning: It converts conventional single-step pruning into multi-step smooth pruning, gradually reducing redundant structures to zero over N steps with ongoing optimization. (ii) Self-Rectifying: This procedure further enhances the aforementioned process by rectifying sub-optimal pruning based on gradient information. Our approach demonstrates strong generalizability and can be easily integrated with various existing pruning methods. We validate the effectiveness of DPM by integrating it with three popular pruning methods: OTOv2, Depgraph, and Gate Decorator. Experimental results show consistent improvements in performance compared to the original pruning methods, along with further reductions of FLOPs in most scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is an effective and widely used approach for weakly supervised machine learning. In histopathology, MIL models have achieved remarkable success in tasks like tumor detection, biomarker prediction, and outcome prognostication. However, MIL explanation methods are still lagging behind, as they are limited to small bag sizes or disregard instance interactions. We revisit MIL through the lens of explainable AI (XAI) and introduce xMIL, a refined framework with more general assumptions. We demonstrate how to obtain improved MIL explanations using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and conduct extensive evaluation experiments on three toy settings and four real-world histopathology datasets. Our approach consistently outperforms previous explanation attempts with particularly improved faithfulness scores on challenging biomarker prediction tasks. Finally, we showcase how xMIL explanations enable pathologists to extract insights from MIL models, representing a significant advance for knowledge discovery and model debugging in digital histopathology.

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence has significantly impacted medical applications, particularly with the advent of Medical Large Vision Language Models (Med-LVLMs), sparking optimism for the future of automated and personalized healthcare. However, the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs remains unverified, posing significant risks for future model deployment. In this paper, we introduce CARES and aim to comprehensively evaluate the Trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across the medical domain. We assess the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across five dimensions, including trustfulness, fairness, safety, privacy, and robustness. CARES comprises about 41K question-answer pairs in both closed and open-ended formats, covering 16 medical image modalities and 27 anatomical regions. Our analysis reveals that the models consistently exhibit concerns regarding trustworthiness, often displaying factual inaccuracies and failing to maintain fairness across different demographic groups. Furthermore, they are vulnerable to attacks and demonstrate a lack of privacy awareness. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://cares-ai.github.io/.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to develop embodied agents that navigate based on human instructions. However, current VLN frameworks often rely on static environments and optimal expert supervision, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce Human-Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation (HA-VLN), extending traditional VLN by incorporating dynamic human activities and relaxing key assumptions. We propose the Human-Aware 3D (HA3D) simulator, which combines dynamic human activities with the Matterport3D dataset, and the Human-Aware Room-to-Room (HA-R2R) dataset, extending R2R with human activity descriptions. To tackle HA-VLN challenges, we present the Expert-Supervised Cross-Modal (VLN-CM) and Non-Expert-Supervised Decision Transformer (VLN-DT) agents, utilizing cross-modal fusion and diverse training strategies for effective navigation in dynamic human environments. A comprehensive evaluation, including metrics considering human activities, and systematic analysis of HA-VLN's unique challenges, underscores the need for further research to enhance HA-VLN agents' real-world robustness and adaptability. Ultimately, this work provides benchmarks and insights for future research on embodied AI and Sim2Real transfer, paving the way for more realistic and applicable VLN systems in human-populated environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Audio signals provide rich information for the robot interaction and object properties through contact. This information can surprisingly ease the learning of contact-rich robot manipulation skills, especially when the visual information alone is ambiguous or incomplete. However, the usage of audio data in robot manipulation has been constrained to teleoperated demonstrations collected by either attaching a microphone to the robot or object, which significantly limits its usage in robot learning pipelines. In this work, we introduce ManiWAV: an 'ear-in-hand' data collection device to collect in-the-wild human demonstrations with synchronous audio and visual feedback, and a corresponding policy interface to learn robot manipulation policy directly from the demonstrations. We demonstrate the capabilities of our system through four contact-rich manipulation tasks that require either passively sensing the contact events and modes, or actively sensing the object surface materials and states. In addition, we show that our system can generalize to unseen in-the-wild environments by learning from diverse in-the-wild human demonstrations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Given the ubiquity of charts as a data analysis, visualization, and decision-making tool across industries and sciences, there has been a growing interest in developing pre-trained foundation models as well as general purpose instruction-tuned models for chart understanding and reasoning. However, existing methods suffer crucial drawbacks across two critical axes affecting the performance of chart representation models: they are trained on data generated from underlying data tables of the charts, ignoring the visual trends and patterns in chart images, and use weakly aligned vision-language backbone models for domain-specific training, limiting their generalizability when encountering charts in the wild. We address these important drawbacks and introduce ChartGemma, a novel chart understanding and reasoning model developed over PaliGemma. Rather than relying on underlying data tables, ChartGemma is trained on instruction-tuning data generated directly from chart images, thus capturing both high-level trends and low-level visual information from a diverse set of charts. Our simple approach achieves state-of-the-art results across $5$ benchmarks spanning chart summarization, question answering, and fact-checking, and our elaborate qualitative studies on real-world charts show that ChartGemma generates more realistic and factually correct summaries compared to its contemporaries.

<p>Abstract: Pneumonia, a severe respiratory disease, poses significant diagnostic challenges, especially in underdeveloped regions. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as chest X-rays, suffer from variability in interpretation among radiologists, necessitating reliable automated tools. In this study, we propose a novel approach combining deep learning and transformer-based attention mechanisms to enhance pneumonia detection from chest X-rays. Our method begins with lung segmentation using a TransUNet model that integrates our specialized transformer module, which has fewer parameters compared to common transformers while maintaining performance. This model is trained on the "Chest Xray Masks and Labels" dataset and then applied to the Kermany and Cohen datasets to isolate lung regions, enhancing subsequent classification tasks. For classification, we employ pre-trained ResNet models (ResNet-50 and ResNet-101) to extract multi-scale feature maps, processed through our modified transformer module. By employing our specialized transformer, we attain superior results with significantly fewer parameters compared to common transformer models. Our approach achieves high accuracy rates of 92.79% on the Kermany dataset and 95.11% on the Cohen dataset, ensuring robust and efficient performance suitable for resource-constrained environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Wei, Yang Wang, Kuofeng Gao, Shuo Shao, Yiming Li, Zhibo Wang, Zhan Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, point clouds have been widely used in computer vision, whereas their collection is time-consuming and expensive. As such, point cloud datasets are the valuable intellectual property of their owners and deserve protection. To detect and prevent unauthorized use of these datasets, especially for commercial or open-sourced ones that cannot be sold again or used commercially without permission, we intend to identify whether a suspicious third-party model is trained on our protected dataset under the black-box setting. We achieve this goal by designing a scalable clean-label backdoor-based dataset watermark for point clouds that ensures both effectiveness and stealthiness. Unlike existing clean-label watermark schemes, which are susceptible to the number of categories, our method could watermark samples from all classes instead of only from the target one. Accordingly, it can still preserve high effectiveness even on large-scale datasets with many classes. Specifically, we perturb selected point clouds with non-target categories in both shape-wise and point-wise manners before inserting trigger patterns without changing their labels. The features of perturbed samples are similar to those of benign samples from the target class. As such, models trained on the watermarked dataset will have a distinctive yet stealthy backdoor behavior, i.e., misclassifying samples from the target class whenever triggers appear, since the trained DNNs will treat the inserted trigger pattern as a signal to deny predicting the target label. We also design a hypothesis-test-guided dataset ownership verification based on the proposed watermark. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted, verifying the effectiveness of our method and its resistance to potential removal methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning involves integrating information from various modalities to enhance learning and comprehension. We compare three modality fusion strategies in person identification and verification by processing two modalities: voice and face. In this paper, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network is employed for x-vector extraction from voice, while the pre-trained VGGFace2 network and transfer learning are utilized for face modality. In addition, gammatonegram is used as speech representation in engagement with the Darknet19 pre-trained network. The proposed systems are evaluated using the K-fold cross-validation technique on the 118 speakers of the test set of the VoxCeleb2 dataset. The comparative evaluations are done for single-modality and three proposed multimodal strategies in equal situations. Results demonstrate that the feature fusion strategy of gammatonegram and facial features achieves the highest performance, with an accuracy of 98.37% in the person identification task. However, concatenating facial features with the x-vector reaches 0.62% for EER in verification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichao Li, Aizier Abulaiti, Yaojie Lu, Xuanang Chen, Jia Zheng, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Le Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Document Structured Extraction (DSE) aims to extract structured content from raw documents. Despite the emergence of numerous DSE systems, their unified evaluation remains inadequate, significantly hindering the field's advancement. This problem is largely attributed to existing benchmark paradigms, which exhibit fragmented and localized characteristics. To address these limitations and offer a thorough evaluation of DSE systems, we introduce a novel benchmark named READoc, which defines DSE as a realistic task of converting unstructured PDFs into semantically rich Markdown. The READoc dataset is derived from 2,233 diverse and real-world documents from arXiv and GitHub. In addition, we develop a DSE Evaluation S$^3$uite comprising Standardization, Segmentation and Scoring modules, to conduct a unified evaluation of state-of-the-art DSE approaches. By evaluating a range of pipeline tools, expert visual models, and general VLMs, we identify the gap between current work and the unified, realistic DSE objective for the first time. We aspire that READoc will catalyze future research in DSE, fostering more comprehensive and practical solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cherie Ho, Seungchan Kim, Brady Moon, Aditya Parandekar, Narek Harutyunyan, Chen Wang, Katia Sycara, Graeme Best, Sebastian Scherer</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploration is a critical challenge in robotics, centered on understanding unknown environments. In this work, we focus on robots exploring structured indoor environments which are often predictable and composed of repeating patterns. Most existing approaches, such as conventional frontier approaches, have difficulty leveraging the predictability and explore with simple heuristics such as `closest first'. Recent works use deep learning techniques to predict unknown regions of the map, using these predictions for information gain calculation. However, these approaches are often sensitive to the predicted map quality or do not reason over sensor coverage. To overcome these issues, our key insight is to jointly reason over what the robot can observe and its uncertainty to calculate probabilistic information gain. We introduce MapEx, a new exploration framework that uses predicted maps to form probabilistic sensor model for information gain estimation. MapEx generates multiple predicted maps based on observed information, and takes into consideration both the computed variances of predicted maps and estimated visible area to estimate the information gain of a given viewpoint. Experiments on the real-world KTH dataset showed on average 12.4% improvement than representative map-prediction based exploration and 25.4% improvement than nearest frontier approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anjana Wijekoon, Adrito Das, Roxana R. Herrera, Danyal Z. Khan, John Hanrahan, Eleanor Carter, Valpuri Luoma, Danail Stoyanov, Hani J. Marcus, Sophia Bano</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate intra-operative Remaining Surgery Duration (RSD) predictions allow for anaesthetists to more accurately decide when to administer anaesthetic agents and drugs, as well as to notify hospital staff to send in the next patient. Therefore RSD plays an important role in improving patient care and minimising surgical theatre costs via efficient scheduling. In endoscopic pituitary surgery, it is uniquely challenging due to variable workflow sequences with a selection of optional steps contributing to high variability in surgery duration. This paper presents PitRSDNet for predicting RSD during pituitary surgery, a spatio-temporal neural network model that learns from historical data focusing on workflow sequences. PitRSDNet integrates workflow knowledge into RSD prediction in two forms: 1) multi-task learning for concurrently predicting step and RSD; and 2) incorporating prior steps as context in temporal learning and inference. PitRSDNet is trained and evaluated on a new endoscopic pituitary surgery dataset with 88 videos to show competitive performance improvements over previous statistical and machine learning methods. The findings also highlight how PitRSDNet improve RSD precision on outlier cases utilising the knowledge of prior steps.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17137">PACE: marrying generalization in PArameter-efficient fine-tuning with Consistency rEgularization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Ni, Shan Zhang, Piotr Koniusz</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) effectively adapts pre-trained vision transformers to downstream tasks. However, the optimization for tasks performance often comes at the cost of generalizability in fine-tuned models. To address this issue, we theoretically connect smaller weight gradient norms during training and larger datasets to the improved model generalization. Motivated by this connection, we propose reducing gradient norms for enhanced generalization and aligning fine-tuned model with the pre-trained counterpart to retain knowledge from large-scale pre-training data. Yet, naive alignment does not guarantee gradient reduction and can potentially cause gradient explosion, complicating efforts to manage gradients. To address such issues, we propose PACE, marrying generalization of PArameter-efficient fine-tuning with Consistency rEgularization. We perturb features learned from the adapter with the multiplicative noise and ensure the fine-tuned model remains consistent for same sample under different perturbations. Theoretical analysis shows that PACE not only implicitly regularizes gradients for enhanced generalization, but also implicitly aligns the fine-tuned and pre-trained models to retain knowledge. Experimental evidence supports our theories. PACE outperforms existing PEFT methods in four visual adaptation tasks: VTAB-1k, FGVC, few-shot learning and domain adaptation.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18783">DualDn: Dual-domain Denoising via Differentiable ISP</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruikang Li, Yujin Wang, Shiqi Chen, Fan Zhang, Jinwei Gu, Tianfan Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Image denoising is a critical component in a camera's Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline. There are two typical ways to inject a denoiser into the ISP pipeline: applying a denoiser directly to captured raw frames (raw domain) or to the ISP's output sRGB images (sRGB domain). However, both approaches have their limitations. Residual noise from raw-domain denoising can be amplified by the subsequent ISP processing, and the sRGB domain struggles to handle spatially varying noise since it only sees noise distorted by the ISP. Consequently, most raw or sRGB domain denoising works only for specific noise distributions and ISP configurations. To address these challenges, we propose DualDn, a novel learning-based dual-domain denoising. Unlike previous single-domain denoising, DualDn consists of two denoising networks: one in the raw domain and one in the sRGB domain. The raw domain denoising adapts to sensor-specific noise as well as spatially varying noise levels, while the sRGB domain denoising adapts to ISP variations and removes residual noise amplified by the ISP. Both denoising networks are connected with a differentiable ISP, which is trained end-to-end and discarded during the inference stage. With this design, DualDn achieves greater generalizability compared to most learning-based denoising methods, as it can adapt to different unseen noises, ISP parameters, and even novel ISP pipelines. Experiments show that DualDn achieves state-of-the-art performance and can adapt to different denoising architectures. Moreover, DualDn can be used as a plug-and-play denoising module with real cameras without retraining, and still demonstrate better performance than commercial on-camera denoising.

<p>Abstract: The salient multimodal capabilities and interactive experience of GPT-4o highlight its critical role in practical applications, yet it lacks a high-performing open-source counterpart. In this paper, we introduce Ocean-omni, the first open-source 7B Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adept at concurrently processing and analyzing modalities of image, video, audio, and text, while delivering an advanced multimodal interactive experience and strong performance. We propose an effective multimodal training schema starting with 7B model and proceeding through two stages of multimodal alignment and multitask fine-tuning across audio, image, video, and text modal. This approach equips the language model with the ability to handle visual and audio data effectively. Demonstrating strong performance across various omni-modal and multimodal benchmarks, we aim for this contribution to serve as a competitive baseline for the open-source community in advancing multimodal understanding and real-time interaction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Are Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) stochastic parrots? Do they genuinely understand? This paper aims to explore the core cognitive abilities that human intelligence builds upon to perceive, comprehend, and reason in MLLMs. To this end, we propose CogDevelop2K, a comprehensive benchmark that spans 12 sub-concepts from primitive knowledge like object permanence and boundary to more complex abilities like intentionality understanding, structured via the developmental trajectory of a human mind. We evaluate 46 MLLMs on our benchmarks. Surprisingly, we observe a reversed cognitive developmental trajectory compared to humans. Comprehensively, we further evaluate the influence of evaluation strategies and prompting techniques. Website with this $\href{https://growing-ai-like-a-child.github.io/}{link}$.</p>

This paper introduces a novel approach integrating Hybrid EfficientNet models with advanced attention mechanisms, including Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Self-Attention, and Deformable Attention, to enhance feature extraction and focus on critical image regions. We evaluate the performance of our models across multiple magnification scales using publicly available histopathological datasets. Our method achieves significant improvements, with accuracy reaching 98.42% at 400X magnification, surpassing several state-of-the-art models, including VGG and ResNet architectures. The results are validated using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall, demonstrating the clinical potential of our model in improving diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed method shows increased computational efficiency, making it suitable for integration into real-time diagnostic workflows.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24060">Understanding Generalizability of Diffusion Models Requires Rethinking the Hidden Gaussian Structure</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Li, Yixiang Dai, Qing Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we study the generalizability of diffusion models by looking into the hidden properties of the learned score functions, which are essentially a series of deep denoisers trained on various noise levels. We observe that as diffusion models transition from memorization to generalization, their corresponding nonlinear diffusion denoisers exhibit increasing linearity. This discovery leads us to investigate the linear counterparts of the nonlinear diffusion models, which are a series of linear models trained to match the function mappings of the nonlinear diffusion denoisers. Surprisingly, these linear denoisers are approximately the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset. This finding implies that diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing and utilizing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training dataset for data generation. We empirically demonstrate that this inductive bias is a unique property of diffusion models in the generalization regime, which becomes increasingly evident when the model's capacity is relatively small compared to the training dataset size. In the case that the model is highly overparameterized, this inductive bias emerges during the initial training phases before the model fully memorizes its training data. Our study provides crucial insights into understanding the notable strong generalization phenomenon recently observed in real-world diffusion models.</p>
