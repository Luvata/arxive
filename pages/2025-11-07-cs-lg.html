<p><b>Authors:</b> Oluwadurotimi Onibonoje, Vuong M. Ngo, Andrew McCarre, Elodie Ruelle, Bernadette O-Briend, Mark Roantree</p>
<p>Abstract: Grasslands, constituting the world's second-largest terrestrial carbon sink, play a crucial role in biodiversity and the regulation of the carbon cycle. Currently, the Irish dairy sector, a significant economic contributor, grapples with challenges related to profitability and sustainability. Presently, grass growth forecasting relies on impractical mechanistic models. In response, we propose deep learning models tailored for univariate datasets, presenting cost-effective alternatives. Notably, a temporal convolutional network designed for forecasting Perennial Ryegrass growth in Cork exhibits high performance, leveraging historical grass height data with RMSE of 2.74 and MAE of 3.46. Validation across a comprehensive dataset spanning 1,757 weeks over 34 years provides insights into optimal model configurations. This study enhances our understanding of model behavior, thereby improving reliability in grass growth forecasting and contributing to the advancement of sustainable dairy farming practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youssef Elmir, Yassine Himeur, Abbes Amira</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4, reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of 95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for IoT-based healthcare monitoring, supporting scalable and secure edge deployments in smart health systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Ouyang, Senan Wang, Bouzhou Wang, Siyuan Xiahou, Jinrong Zhou, Yuekang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Short-video platforms have become a central medium in the modern Internet landscape, where efficient information delivery and strong interactivity are reshaping user engagement and cultural dissemination. Among the various forms of user interaction, comments play a vital role in fostering community participation and enabling content re-creation. However, generating comments that are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting stylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge. We introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for controllable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video segmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt construction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones), rhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content extraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM directly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through explicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and evaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin (Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy skits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk shows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style conformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and 105 participants. Results show that LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on YouTube. This work presents a scalable and culturally adaptive framework for stylized comment generation on short-video platforms, offering a promising path to enhance user engagement and creative interaction.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03768">What&#x27;s in Common? Multimodal Models Hallucinate When Reasoning Across Scenes</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Candace Ross, Florian Bordes, Adina Williams, Polina Kirichenko, Mark Ibrahim</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal language models possess a remarkable ability to handle an open-vocabulary's worth of objects. Yet the best models still suffer from hallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap between their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks that are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap, we build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With more than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training data to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by cognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking "what's in common?". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models specifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that perceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning across scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning models. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best performing model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex, consisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously, we find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present in the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen during training. Among the models we evaluated, we found scale can provide modest improvements while models explicitly trained with multi-image inputs show bigger improvements, suggesting scaled multi-image training may offer promise. We make our benchmark publicly available to spur research into the challenge of hallucination when reasoning across scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaden Park, Mu Cai, Feng Yao, Jingbo Shang, Soochahn Lee, Yong Jae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous benchmark tasks. However, the use of internet-scale, often proprietary, pretraining corpora raises a critical concern for both practitioners and users: inflated performance due to test-set leakage. While prior works have proposed mitigation strategies such as decontamination of pretraining data and benchmark redesign for LLMs, the complementary direction of developing detection methods for contaminated VLMs remains underexplored. To address this gap, we deliberately contaminate open-source VLMs on popular benchmarks and show that existing detection approaches either fail outright or exhibit inconsistent behavior. We then propose a novel simple yet effective detection method based on multi-modal semantic perturbation, demonstrating that contaminated models fail to generalize under controlled perturbations. Finally, we validate our approach across multiple realistic contamination strategies, confirming its robustness and effectiveness. The code and perturbed dataset will be released publicly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linghui Zeng, Ruixuan Liu, Atiquer Rahman Sarkar, Xiaoqian Jiang, Joyce C. Ho, Li Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the privacy of sensitive training data is crucial in privacy-preserving machine learning. However, in practical scenarios, privacy protection may be required for only a subset of features. For instance, in ICU data, demographic attributes like age and gender pose higher privacy risks due to their re-identification potential, whereas raw lab results are generally less sensitive. Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features in one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility degradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model utility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages large foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive features, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates of sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model training. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models on both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of the original sensitive features. We evaluate FusionDP on two modalities: a sepsis prediction task on tabular data from PhysioNet and a clinical note classification task from MIMIC-III. By comparing against privacy-preserving baselines, our results show that FusionDP significantly improves model performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy, demonstrating the potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility trade-off for various modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shivogo John</p>
<p>Abstract: Evolving borrower behaviors, shifting economic conditions, and changing regulatory landscapes continuously reshape the data distributions underlying modern credit-scoring systems. Conventional explainability techniques, such as SHAP, assume static data and fixed background distributions, making their explanations unstable and potentially unfair when concept drift occurs. This study addresses that challenge by developing adaptive explanation frameworks that recalibrate interpretability and fairness in dynamically evolving credit models. Using a multi-year credit dataset, we integrate predictive modeling via XGBoost with three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice explanation reweighting that adjusts for feature distribution shifts, (B) drift-aware SHAP rebaselining with sliding-window background samples, and (C) online surrogate calibration using incremental Ridge regression. Each method is benchmarked against static SHAP explanations using metrics of predictive performance (AUC, F1), directional and rank stability (cosine, Kendall tau), and fairness (demographic parity and recalibration). Results show that adaptive methods, particularly rebaselined and surrogate-based explanations, substantially improve temporal stability and reduce disparate impact across demographic groups without degrading predictive accuracy. Robustness tests, including counterfactual perturbations, background sensitivity analysis, and proxy-variable detection, confirm the resilience of adaptive explanations under real-world drift conditions. These findings establish adaptive explainability as a practical mechanism for sustaining transparency, accountability, and ethical reliability in data-driven credit systems, and more broadly, in any domain where decision models evolve with population change.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reasoning language models perform well on complex tasks but are costly to deploy due to their size and long reasoning traces. We propose a routing approach that assigns each problem to the smallest model likely to solve it, reducing compute without sacrificing accuracy. Using intermediate representations from s1.1-32B, we train lightweight predictors of problem difficulty or model correctness to guide routing across a pool of reasoning models. On diverse math benchmarks, routing improves efficiency over random assignment and matches s1.1-32B's performance while using significantly less compute. Our results demonstrate that difficulty-aware routing is effective for cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03809">One Size Does Not Fit All: Architecture-Aware Adaptive Batch Scheduling with DEBA</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fran\c{c}ois Belias, Naser Ezzati-Jivan, Foutse Khomh</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptive batch size methods aim to accelerate neural network training, but existing approaches apply identical adaptation strategies across all architectures, assuming a one-size-fits-all solution. We introduce DEBA (Dynamic Efficient Batch Adaptation), an adaptive batch scheduler that monitors gradient variance, gradient norm variation and loss variation to guide batch size adaptations. Through systematic evaluation across six architectures (ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet-V3, ViT-B16) on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with five random seeds per configuration, we demonstrate that the architecture fundamentally determines adaptation efficacy. Our findings reveal that: (1) lightweight and medium-depth architectures (MobileNet-V3, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0) achieve a 45-62% training speedup with simultaneous accuracy improvements of 1-7%; (2) shallow residual networks (ResNet-18) show consistent gains of +2.4 - 4.0% in accuracy, 36 - 43% in speedup, while deep residual networks (ResNet-50) exhibit high variance and occasional degradation; (3) already-stable architectures (ViT-B16) show minimal speedup (6%) despite maintaining accuracy, indicating that adaptation benefits vary with baseline optimization characteristics. We introduce a baseline characterization framework using gradient stability metrics (stability score, gradient norm variation) that predicts which architectures will benefit from adaptive scheduling. Our ablation studies reveal critical design choices often overlooked in prior work: sliding window statistics (vs. full history) and sufficient cooldown periods (5+ epochs) between adaptations are essential for success. This work challenges the prevailing assumption that adaptive methods generalize across architectures and provides the first systematic evidence that batch size adaptation requires an architecture-aware design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryien Hosseini, Filippo Simini, Venkatram Vishwanath, Rebecca Willett, Henry Hoffmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks learn on graph-structured data by iteratively aggregating local neighborhood information. While this local message passing paradigm imparts a powerful inductive bias and exploits graph sparsity, it also yields three key challenges: (i) oversquashing of long-range information, (ii) oversmoothing of node representations, and (iii) limited expressive power. In this work we inject randomized global embeddings of node features, which we term \textit{Sketched Random Features}, into standard GNNs, enabling them to efficiently capture long-range dependencies. The embeddings are unique, distance-sensitive, and topology-agnostic -- properties which we analytically and empirically show alleviate the aforementioned limitations when injected into GNNs. Experimental results on real-world graph learning tasks confirm that this strategy consistently improves performance over baseline GNNs, offering both a standalone solution and a complementary enhancement to existing techniques such as graph positional encodings.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03828">From Static to Dynamic: Enhancing Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning via Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lipeng Zu, Hansong Zhou, Xiaonan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Transitioning from offline to online reinforcement learning (RL) poses critical challenges due to distributional shifts between the fixed behavior policy in the offline dataset and the evolving policy during online learning. Although this issue is widely recognized, few methods attempt to explicitly assess or utilize the distributional structure of the offline data itself, leaving a research gap in adapting learning strategies to different types of samples. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method, Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff), which facilitates smoother transitions in offline-to-online RL. StratDiff deploys a diffusion model to learn prior knowledge from the offline dataset. It then refines this knowledge through energy-based functions to improve policy imitation and generate offline-like actions during online fine-tuning. The KL divergence between the generated action and the corresponding sampled action is computed for each sample and used to stratify the training batch into offline-like and online-like subsets. Offline-like samples are updated using offline objectives, while online-like samples follow online learning strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of StratDiff by integrating it with off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL and IQL. Extensive empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show that StratDiff significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving enhanced adaptability and more stable performance across diverse RL settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Enouen, Yujia Zheng, Ignavier Ng, Yan Liu, Kun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal structure learning has long been the central task of inferring causal insights from data. Despite the abundance of real-world processes exhibiting higher-order mechanisms, however, an explicit treatment of interactions in causal discovery has received little attention. In this work, we focus on extending the causal additive model (CAM) to additive models with higher-order interactions. This second level of modularity we introduce to the structure learning problem is most easily represented by a directed acyclic hypergraph which extends the DAG. We introduce the necessary definitions and theoretical tools to handle the novel structure we introduce and then provide identifiability results for the hyper DAG, extending the typical Markov equivalence classes. We next provide insights into why learning the more complex hypergraph structure may actually lead to better empirical results. In particular, more restrictive assumptions like CAM correspond to easier-to-learn hyper DAGs and better finite sample complexity. We finally develop an extension of the greedy CAM algorithm which can handle the more complex hyper DAG search space and demonstrate its empirical usefulness in synthetic experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lipeng Zu, Hansong Zhou, Xiaonan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) estimate future returns by learning from transitions sampled from a replay buffer. However, the target updates in DQN often rely on next states generated by actions from past, potentially suboptimal, policy. As a result, these states may not provide informative learning signals, causing high variance into the update process. This issue is exacerbated when the sampled transitions are poorly aligned with the agent's current policy. To address this limitation, we propose the Successor-state Aggregation Deep Q-Network (SADQ), which explicitly models environment dynamics using a stochastic transition model. SADQ integrates successor-state distributions into the Q-value estimation process, enabling more stable and policy-aligned value updates. Additionally, it explores a more efficient action selection strategy with the modeled transition structure. We provide theoretical guarantees that SADQ maintains unbiased value estimates while reducing training variance. Our extensive empirical results across standard RL benchmarks and real-world vector-based control tasks demonstrate that SADQ consistently outperforms DQN variants in both stability and learning efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Social and collaborative platforms emit multivariate time-series traces in which early interactions-such as views, likes, or downloads-are followed, sometimes months or years later, by higher impact like citations, sales, or reviews. We formalize this setting as Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF): given an early usage channel (the lead), predict a correlated but temporally shifted outcome channel (the lag). Despite the ubiquity of such patterns, LLF has not been treated as a unified forecasting problem within the time-series community, largely due to the absence of standardized datasets. To anchor research in LLF, here we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations of 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and outline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including Wikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance), e-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views -> messages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by capturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of outcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling. We documented all technical details of data curation and cleaning, verified the presence of lead-lag dynamics through statistical and classification tests, and benchmarked parametric and non-parametric baselines for regression. Our study establishes LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm and lays an empirical foundation for its systematic exploration in social and usage data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanggeon Yun, Hyunwoo Oh, Ryozo Masukawa, Mohsen Imani</p>
<p>Abstract: Decomposition is a proven way to shrink deep networks without changing I/O. We bring this idea to hyperdimensional computing (HDC), where footprint cuts usually shrink the feature axis and erode concentration and robustness. Prior HDC decompositions decode via fixed atomic hypervectors, which are ill-suited for compressing learned class prototypes. We introduce DecoHD, which learns directly in a decomposed HDC parameterization: a small, shared set of per-layer channels with multiplicative binding across layers and bundling at the end, yielding a large representational space from compact factors. DecoHD compresses along the class axis via a lightweight bundling head while preserving native bind-bundle-score; training is end-to-end, and inference remains pure HDC, aligning with in/near-memory accelerators. In evaluation, DecoHD attains extreme memory savings with only minor accuracy degradation under tight deployment budgets. On average it stays within about 0.1-0.15% of a strong non-reduced HDC baseline (worst case 5.7%), is more robust to random bit-flip noise, reaches its accuracy plateau with up to ~97% fewer trainable parameters, and -- in hardware -- delivers roughly 277x/35x energy/speed gains over a CPU (AMD Ryzen 9 9950X), 13.5x/3.7x over a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090), and 2.0x/2.4x over a baseline HDC ASIC.</p>

We address these challenges from three angles. First, to improve predictive accuracy while retaining interpretability, we introduce a behaviorally grounded set of higher-order mobility descriptors based on directed mobility graphs. These features capture structured patterns in trip sequences, travel modes, and social co-travel, and significantly improve prediction of age, gender, income, and household structure over baselines features. Second, we introduce metrics and visual diagnostic tools that encourage evenness between model confidence and accuracy, enabling planners to quantify uncertainty. Third, to improve generalization and sample efficiency, we develop a multitask learning framework that jointly predicts multiple sociodemographic attributes from a shared representation. This approach outperforms single-task models, particularly when training data are limited or when applying models across different time periods (i.e., when the test set distribution differs from the training set).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arthur Chen, Victor Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce and formalize the Synthetic Dataset Quality Estimation (SynQuE) problem: ranking synthetic datasets by their expected real-world task performance using only limited unannotated real data. This addresses a critical and open challenge where data is scarce due to collection costs or privacy constraints. We establish the first comprehensive benchmarks for this problem by introducing and evaluating proxy metrics that choose synthetic data for training to maximize task performance on real data. We introduce the first proxy metrics for SynQuE by adapting distribution and diversity-based distance measures to our context via embedding models. To address the shortcomings of these metrics on complex planning tasks, we propose LENS, a novel proxy that leverages large language model reasoning. Our results show that SynQuE proxies correlate with real task performance across diverse tasks, including sentiment analysis, Text2SQL, web navigation, and image classification, with LENS consistently outperforming others on complex tasks by capturing nuanced characteristics. For instance, on text-to-SQL parsing, training on the top-3 synthetic datasets selected via SynQuE proxies can raise accuracy from 30.4% to 38.4 (+8.1)% on average compared to selecting data indiscriminately. This work establishes SynQuE as a practical framework for synthetic data selection under real-data scarcity and motivates future research on foundation model-based data characterization and fine-grained data selection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanggeon Yun, Hyunwoo Oh, Ryozo Masukawa, Pietro Mercati, Nathaniel D. Bastian, Mohsen Imani</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) suits memory, energy, and reliability-constrained systems, yet the standard "one prototype per class" design requires $O(CD)$ memory (with $C$ classes and dimensionality $D$). Prior compaction reduces $D$ (feature axis), improving storage/compute but weakening robustness. We introduce LogHD, a logarithmic class-axis reduction that replaces the $C$ per-class prototypes with $n\!\approx\!\lceil\log_k C\rceil$ bundle hypervectors (alphabet size $k$) and decodes in an $n$-dimensional activation space, cutting memory to $O(D\log_k C)$ while preserving $D$. LogHD uses a capacity-aware codebook and profile-based decoding, and composes with feature-axis sparsification. Across datasets and injected bit flips, LogHD attains competitive accuracy with smaller models and higher resilience at matched memory. Under equal memory, it sustains target accuracy at roughly $2.5$-$3.0\times$ higher bit-flip rates than feature-axis compression; an ASIC instantiation delivers $498\times$ energy efficiency and $62.6\times$ speedup over an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X and $24.3\times$/$6.58\times$ over an NVIDIA RTX 4090, and is $4.06\times$ more energy-efficient and $2.19\times$ faster than a feature-axis HDC ASIC baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wuxia Chen, Taposh Banerjee, Vahid Tarokh</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the problem of quickest change detection in Markov processes with unknown transition kernels. The key idea is to learn the conditional score $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$ directly from sample pairs $( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are high-dimensional data generated by the same transition kernel. In this way, we avoid explicit likelihood evaluation and provide a practical way to learn the transition dynamics. Based on this estimation, we develop a score-based CUSUM procedure that uses conditional Hyvarinen score differences to detect changes in the kernel. To ensure bounded increments, we propose a truncated version of the statistic. With Hoeffding's inequality for uniformly ergodic Markov processes, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mean time to false alarm. We also prove asymptotic upper bounds on detection delay. These results give both theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility for score-based detection in high-dimensional Markov models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingliang Hou, Yinuo Wang, Teng Guo, Zitao Liu, Wenzhou Dou, Jiaqi Zheng, Renqiang Luo, Mi Tian, Weiqi Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: The need to remove specific student data from cognitive diagnosis (CD) models has become a pressing requirement, driven by users' growing assertion of their "right to be forgotten". However, existing CD models are largely designed without privacy considerations and lack effective data unlearning mechanisms. Directly applying general purpose unlearning algorithms is suboptimal, as they struggle to balance unlearning completeness, model utility, and efficiency when confronted with the unique heterogeneous structure of CD models. To address this, our paper presents the first systematic study of the data unlearning problem for CD models, proposing a novel and efficient algorithm: hierarchical importanceguided forgetting (HIF). Our key insight is that parameter importance in CD models exhibits distinct layer wise characteristics. HIF leverages this via an innovative smoothing mechanism that combines individual and layer, level importance, enabling a more precise distinction of parameters associated with the data to be unlearned. Experiments on three real world datasets show that HIF significantly outperforms baselines on key metrics, offering the first effective solution for CD models to respond to user data removal requests and for deploying high-performance, privacy preserving AI systems</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Semih Cayci</p>
<p>Abstract: An important question in deep learning is how higher-order optimization methods affect generalization. In this work, we analyze a stochastic Gauss-Newton (SGN) method with Levenberg-Marquardt damping and mini-batch sampling for training overparameterized deep neural networks with smooth activations in a regression setting. Our theoretical contributions are twofold. First, we establish finite-time convergence bounds via a variable-metric analysis in parameter space, with explicit dependencies on the batch size, network width and depth. Second, we derive non-asymptotic generalization bounds for SGN using uniform stability in the overparameterized regime, characterizing the impact of curvature, batch size, and overparameterization on generalization performance. Our theoretical results identify a favorable generalization regime for SGN in which a larger minimum eigenvalue of the Gauss-Newton matrix along the optimization path yields tighter stability bounds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a rapid and unpredictable evolutionary trajectory, characterized by the continual emergence of immune-evasive variants. This poses persistent challenges to public health and vaccine development.
  While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have revolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to noisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce PETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based on evolutionary trajectories derived from phylogenetic trees rather than raw RNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures the hierarchical structure of viral evolution.
  With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and temporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future SARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide mutations and 17.10\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and 6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability to aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and 25A(LP.8.1). The code is open sourced on https://github.com/xz-keg/PETra</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiao Wang, Di Wu, Feng Liu, Zhimin Qiu, Chenrui Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a composable fine-tuning method that integrates graph structural priors with modular adapters to address the high computational cost and structural instability faced by large-scale pre-trained models in multi-task adaptation. The method introduces a relation matrix to model dependencies among tasks, explicitly encoding correlations between nodes and paths into graph structural priors, which provide unified structural constraints for adapter weight allocation and path selection. Modular adapters are embedded into different layers through low-rank mapping and a pluggable mechanism, enabling efficient cross-task composition and reuse under prior guidance. This mechanism not only improves parameter efficiency and training stability but also alleviates path conflicts and redundant computation in multi-task scenarios. Furthermore, experiments on hyperparameter sensitivity, environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity are conducted to systematically analyze key factors such as routing temperature, gating thresholds, and relation matrix regularization strength, verifying the consistency and superior performance of the method under structural constraints. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances task prediction accuracy, adapter weight allocation precision, and overall computational efficiency while maintaining model lightweight design, highlighting the synergistic advantages of graph priors and modular mechanisms in composable fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Menezes, Barbara Su, Xinze Feng, Yehya Farhat, Hamza Shili, Anastasios Kyrillidis</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce TwIST, a distributed training framework for efficient large language model (LLM) sparsification. TwIST trains multiple subnetworks in parallel, periodically aggregates their parameters, and resamples new subnetworks during training. This process identifies high-quality subnetworks ("golden tickets") without requiring post-training procedures such as calibration or Hessian-based recovery. As a result, TwIST enables zero-cost pruning at deployment time while achieving perplexity competitive with state-of-the-art post-training sparsification methods. The benefits are most pronounced under aggressive sparsity (e.g., 50%+), where TwIST significantly outperforms baseline methods; for example, reaching 23.14 PPL compared to 31.64 for the closest prior approach. Unlike unstructured pruning, TwIST produces structured, dense matrices that offer practical inference speedups and memory reductions on commodity hardware (e.g., CPUs) that do not support efficient sparse computation. TwIST provides an efficient training-time path to deployable sparse LLMs without additional fine-tuning or recovery overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed A. Metwally, Heyjun Park, Yue Wu, Tracey McLaughlin, Michael P. Snyder</p>
<p>Abstract: The classification of diabetes and prediabetes by static glucose thresholds obscures the pathophysiological dysglycemia heterogeneity, primarily driven by insulin resistance (IR), beta-cell dysfunction, and incretin deficiency. This review demonstrates that continuous glucose monitoring and wearable technologies enable a paradigm shift towards non-invasive, dynamic metabolic phenotyping. We show evidence that machine learning models can leverage high-resolution glucose data from at-home, CGM-enabled oral glucose tolerance tests to accurately predict gold-standard measures of muscle IR and beta-cell function. This personalized characterization extends to real-world nutrition, where an individual's unique postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to standardized meals, such as the relative glucose spike to potatoes versus grapes, could serve as a biomarker for their metabolic subtype. Moreover, integrating wearable data reveals that habitual diet, sleep, and physical activity patterns, particularly their timing, are uniquely associated with specific metabolic dysfunctions, informing precision lifestyle interventions. The efficacy of dietary mitigators in attenuating PPGR is also shown to be phenotype-dependent. Collectively, this evidence demonstrates that CGM can deconstruct the complexity of early dysglycemia into distinct, actionable subphenotypes. This approach moves beyond simple glycemic control, paving the way for targeted nutritional, behavioral, and pharmacological strategies tailored to an individual's core metabolic defects, thereby paving the way for a new era of precision diabetes prevention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berk Iskar, Michael Taynnan Barros</p>
<p>Abstract: Network anomaly detection systems encounter several challenges with traditional detectors trained offline. They become susceptible to concept drift and new threats such as zero-day or polymorphic attacks. To address this limitation, we propose a Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning framework that draws inspiration from astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in the brain, where rapid, context-sensitive adaptation enables robust information processing. Our approach couples a multicellular astrocyte dynamics simulator with a deep neural network (DNN). The simulator models astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics through three key mechanisms: IP$_3$-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release, SERCA pump uptake, and conductance-aware diffusion through gap junctions between cells. Evaluation of our proposed network on CTU-13 (Neris) network traffic data demonstrates the effectiveness of our biologically plausible approach. The Ca$^{2+}$-gated model outperforms a matched baseline DNN, achieving up to $\sim$98\% accuracy with reduced false positives and negatives across multiple train/test splits. Importantly, this improved performance comes with negligible runtime overhead once Ca$^{2+}$ trajectories are precomputed. While demonstrated here for cybersecurity applications, this Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning framework offers a generic solution for streaming detection tasks that require rapid, biologically grounded adaptation to evolving data patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyu Sung, Vikas Palakonda, Suhwan Im, Sunghwan Moon, Il-Min Kim, Sangseok Yun, Jae-Mo Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved near-human performance across diverse reasoning tasks, yet their deployment on resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices remains impractical due to massive parameter footprints and memory-intensive autoregressive decoding. While split computing offers a promising solution by partitioning model execution between edge devices and cloud servers, existing approaches fail to address the unique challenges of autoregressive inference, particularly the iterative token generation process and expanding key-value (KV) cache requirements. This work introduces the first autoregressive-aware split computing framework designed explicitly for LLM deployment on edge devices. Our approach makes three key contributions. First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a mixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by strategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with different precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate compression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise adaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations while dramatically reducing communication overhead. Third, we formulate a unified optimization framework that jointly selects optimal split points, quantization settings, and sequence lengths to satisfy strict memory and latency constraints. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware platforms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art quantization methods, including SmoothQuant, OmniQuant, and Atom. The framework achieves a 1.49 inference speedup and significant communication overhead reduction while maintaining or improving model accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal protein features play a crucial role in protein function prediction. However, these features encompass a wide range of information, ranging from structural data and sequence features to protein attributes and interaction networks, making it challenging to decipher their complex interconnections. In this work, we propose a multimodal protein function prediction method (DSRPGO) by utilizing dynamic selection and reconstructive pre-training mechanisms. To acquire complex protein information, we introduce reconstructive pre-training to mine more fine-grained information with low semantic levels. Moreover, we put forward the Bidirectional Interaction Module (BInM) to facilitate interactive learning among multimodal features. Additionally, to address the difficulty of hierarchical multi-label classification in this task, a Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) is designed to select the feature representation that is most conducive to current protein function prediction. Our proposed DSRPGO model improves significantly in BPO, MFO, and CCO on human datasets, thereby outperforming other benchmark models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuantian Shao, Yuanteng Chen, Peisong Wang, Jianlin Yu, Jing Lin, Yiwu Yao, Zhihui Wei, Jian Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization plays a crucial role in accelerating the inference of large-scale models, and rotational matrices have been shown to effectively improve quantization performance by smoothing outliers. However, end-to-end fine-tuning of rotational optimization algorithms incurs high computational costs and is prone to overfitting. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient distribution-aware rotational calibration method, DartQuant, which reduces the complexity of rotational optimization by constraining the distribution of the activations after rotation. This approach also effectively reduces reliance on task-specific losses, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, we introduce the QR-Orth optimization scheme, which replaces expensive alternating optimization with a more efficient solution. In a variety of model quantization experiments, DartQuant demonstrates superior performance. Compared to existing methods, it achieves 47$\times$ acceleration and 10$\times$ memory savings for rotational optimization on a 70B model. Furthermore, it is the first to successfully complete rotational calibration for a 70B model on a single 3090 GPU, making quantization of large language models feasible in resource-constrained environments.

<p>Abstract: Pediatric appendicitis remains one of the most common causes of acute abdominal pain in children, and its diagnosis continues to challenge clinicians due to overlapping symptoms and variable imaging quality. This study aims to develop and evaluate a deep learning model based on a pretrained ResNet architecture for automated detection of appendicitis from ultrasound images. We used the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset, which includes ultrasound scans, laboratory data, and clinical scores from pediatric patients admitted with abdominal pain to Children Hospital. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany. Each subject had 1 to 15 ultrasound views covering the right lower quadrant, appendix, lymph nodes, and related structures. For the image based classification task, ResNet was fine tuned to distinguish appendicitis from non-appendicitis cases. Images were preprocessed by normalization, resizing, and augmentation to enhance generalization. The proposed ResNet model achieved an overall accuracy of 93.44, precision of 91.53, and recall of 89.8, demonstrating strong performance in identifying appendicitis across heterogeneous ultrasound views. The model effectively learned discriminative spatial features, overcoming challenges posed by low contrast, speckle noise, and anatomical variability in pediatric imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fatemeh Hosseinabadi, Seyedhassan Sharifi</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left atrium (LA) from cardiac MRI is critical for guiding atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation and constructing biophysical cardiac models. Manual delineation is time-consuming, observer-dependent, and impractical for large-scale or time-sensitive clinical workflows. Deep learning methods, particularly convolutional architectures, have recently demonstrated superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks. In this study, we applied the nnU-Net framework, an automated, self-configuring deep learning segmentation architecture, to the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge 2013 dataset. The dataset consists of thirty MRI scans with corresponding expert-annotated masks. The nnU-Net model automatically adapted its preprocessing, network configuration, and training pipeline to the characteristics of the MRI data. Model performance was quantitatively evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and qualitative results were compared against expert segmentations. The proposed nnUNet model achieved a mean Dice score of 93.5, demonstrating high overlap with expert annotations and outperforming several traditional segmentation approaches reported in previous studies. The network exhibited robust generalization across variations in left atrial shape, contrast, and image quality, accurately delineating both the atrial body and proximal pulmonary veins.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ananya Sutradhar, Suryansh Gupta, Ravishankar Krishnaswamy, Haiyang Xu, Aseem Rastogi, Gopal Srinivasa</p>
<p>Abstract: Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search retrieves the closest vectors for a query vector from a dataset. It enforces that a specified set of discrete labels $S$ for the query must be included in the labels of each retrieved vector. Existing graph-based methods typically incorporate filter awareness by assigning fixed penalties or prioritizing nodes based on filter satisfaction. However, since these methods use fixed, data in- dependent penalties, they often fail to generalize across datasets with diverse label and vector distributions. In this work, we propose a principled alternative that learns the optimal trade-off between vector distance and filter match directly from the data, rather than relying on fixed penalties. We formulate this as a constrained linear optimization problem, deriving weights that better reflect the underlying filter distribution and more effectively address the filtered ANN search problem. These learned weights guide both the search process and index construction, leading to graph structures that more effectively capture the underlying filter distribution and filter semantics. Our experiments demonstrate that adapting the distance function to the data significantly im- proves accuracy by 5-10% over fixed-penalty methods, providing a more flexible and generalizable framework for the filtered ANN search problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingfeng Chen, Haojin Zeng, Jingyi Jie, Shichao Zhang, Debo Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of graph-structured data in critical domains, unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has become a pivotal task. UGAD seeks to identify entire graphs that deviate from normal behavioral patterns. However, most Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches implicitly assume that the training set is clean, containing only normal graphs, which is rarely true in practice. Even modest contamination by anomalous graphs can distort learned representations and sharply degrade performance. To address this challenge, we propose DeNoise, a robust UGAD framework explicitly designed for contaminated training data. It jointly optimizes a graph-level encoder, an attribute decoder, and a structure decoder via an adversarial objective to learn noise-resistant embeddings. Further, DeNoise introduces an encoder anchor-alignment denoising mechanism that fuses high-information node embeddings from normal graphs into all graph embeddings, improving representation quality while suppressing anomaly interference. A contrastive learning component then compacts normal graph embeddings and repels anomalous ones in the latent space. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that DeNoise consistently learns reliable graph-level representations under varying noise intensities and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art UGAD baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyungjong Na, Wonho Song, Seungyong Han, Donghyeon Jo, Sejin Myung, Hyungjoon Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces the Korean Tax Avoidance Panel (KoTaP), a long-term panel dataset of non-financial firms listed on KOSPI and KOSDAQ between 2011 and 2024. After excluding financial firms, firms with non-December fiscal year ends, capital impairment, and negative pre-tax income, the final dataset consists of 12,653 firm-year observations from 1,754 firms. KoTaP is designed to treat corporate tax avoidance as a predictor variable and link it to multiple domains, including earnings management (accrual- and activity-based), profitability (ROA, ROE, CFO, LOSS), stability (LEV, CUR, SIZE, PPE, AGE, INVREC), growth (GRW, MB, TQ), and governance (BIG4, FORN, OWN). Tax avoidance itself is measured using complementary indicators cash effective tax rate (CETR), GAAP effective tax rate (GETR), and book-tax difference measures (TSTA, TSDA) with adjustments to ensure interpretability. A key strength of KoTaP is its balanced panel structure with standardized variables and its consistency with international literature on the distribution and correlation of core indicators. At the same time, it reflects distinctive institutional features of Korean firms, such as concentrated ownership, high foreign shareholding, and elevated liquidity ratios, providing both international comparability and contextual uniqueness. KoTaP enables applications in benchmarking econometric and deep learning models, external validity checks, and explainable AI analyses. It further supports policy evaluation, audit planning, and investment analysis, making it a critical open resource for accounting, finance, and interdisciplinary research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giorgio Morales, John W. Sheppard</p>
<p>Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) models complex systems by discovering mathematical expressions that capture underlying relationships in observed data. However, most SR methods prioritize minimizing prediction error over identifying the governing equations, often producing overly complex or inaccurate expressions. To address this, we present a decomposable SR method that generates interpretable multivariate expressions leveraging transformer models, genetic algorithms (GAs), and genetic programming (GP). In particular, our explainable SR method distills a trained ``opaque'' regression model into mathematical expressions that serve as explanations of its computed function. Our method employs a Multi-Set Transformer to generate multiple univariate symbolic skeletons that characterize how each variable influences the opaque model's response. We then evaluate the generated skeletons' performance using a GA-based approach to select a subset of high-quality candidates before incrementally merging them via a GP-based cascade procedure that preserves their original skeleton structure. The final multivariate skeletons undergo coefficient optimization via a GA. We evaluated our method on problems with controlled and varying degrees of noise, demonstrating lower or comparable interpolation and extrapolation errors compared to two GP-based methods, three neural SR methods, and a hybrid approach. Unlike them, our approach consistently learned expressions that matched the original mathematical structure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongbin Zhang, Shihao Gao, Yang Liu, Mingjie Xing, Yanjun Wu, Chen Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end Large Language Model (LLM) technology has shown substantial advantages across various domains. As critical system software and infrastructure, compilers are responsible for transforming source code into target code. While LLMs have been leveraged to assist in compiler development and maintenance, their potential as an end-to-end compiler remains largely unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of LLM as a Compiler (LaaC) and its future directions. We designed the CompilerEval dataset and framework specifically to evaluate the capabilities of mainstream LLMs in source code comprehension and assembly code generation. In the evaluation, we analyzed various errors, explored multiple methods to improve LLM-generated code, and evaluated cross-platform compilation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit basic capabilities as compilers but currently achieve low compilation success rates. By optimizing prompts, scaling up the model, and incorporating reasoning methods, the quality of assembly code generated by LLMs can be significantly enhanced. Based on these findings, we maintain an optimistic outlook for LaaC and propose practical architectural designs and future research directions. We believe that with targeted training, knowledge-rich prompts, and specialized infrastructure, LaaC has the potential to generate high-quality assembly code and drive a paradigm shift in the field of compilation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Zhang, Yujie Yang, Haoning Wang, Liping Zhang, Shengbo Eben Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) aims to respect safety requirements while optimizing long-term performance. In many practical applications, however, the problem involves an infinite number of constraints, known as semi-infinite safe RL (SI-safe RL). Such constraints typically appear when safety conditions must be enforced across an entire continuous parameter space, such as ensuring adequate resource distribution at every spatial location. In this paper, we propose exchange policy optimization (EPO), an algorithmic framework that achieves optimal policy performance and deterministic bounded safety. EPO works by iteratively solving safe RL subproblems with finite constraint sets and adaptively adjusting the active set through constraint expansion and deletion. At each iteration, constraints with violations exceeding the predefined tolerance are added to refine the policy, while those with zero Lagrange multipliers are removed after the policy update. This exchange rule prevents uncontrolled growth of the working set and supports effective policy training. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, strategies trained via EPO achieve performance comparable to optimal solutions with global constraint violations strictly remaining within a prescribed bound.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olav Finne Praesteng Larsen, Massimiliano Ruocco, Michail Spitieris, Abdulmajid Murad, Martina Ragosta</p>
<p>Abstract: Access to trajectory data is a key requirement for developing and validating Air Traffic Management (ATM) solutions, yet many secondary and regional airports face severe data scarcity. This limits the applicability of machine learning methods and the ability to perform large-scale simulations or "what-if" analyses. In this paper, we investigate whether generative models trained on data-rich airports can be efficiently adapted to data-scarce airports using transfer learning. We adapt state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-matching-based architectures to the aviation domain and evaluate their transferability between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target) landing trajectory datasets. Models are pretrained on Zurich and fine-tuned on Dublin with varying amounts of local data, ranging from 0% to 100%. Results show that diffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% of the Dublin data and reach baseline-level performance around 20%, consistently outperforming models trained from scratch across metrics and visual inspections. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion models also benefit from pretraining, though with more variable gains, while flow matching models show weaker generalization. Despite challenges in capturing rare trajectory patterns, these findings demonstrate the potential of transfer learning to substantially reduce data requirements for trajectory generation in ATM, enabling realistic synthetic data generation even in environments with limited historical records.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anzhuo Xie, Wei-Chen Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proposes a Transformer-based longitudinal modeling method to address challenges in clinical risk classification with heterogeneous Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, including irregular temporal patterns, large modality differences, and complex semantic structures. The method takes multi-source medical features as input and employs a feature embedding layer to achieve a unified representation of structured and unstructured data. A learnable temporal encoding mechanism is introduced to capture dynamic evolution under uneven sampling intervals. The core model adopts a multi-head self-attention structure to perform global dependency modeling on longitudinal sequences, enabling the aggregation of long-term trends and short-term fluctuations across different temporal scales. To enhance semantic representation, a semantic-weighted pooling module is designed to assign adaptive importance to key medical events, improving the discriminative ability of risk-related features. Finally, a linear mapping layer generates individual-level risk scores. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms traditional machine learning and temporal deep learning models in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, achieving stable and precise risk identification in multi-source heterogeneous EHR environments and providing an efficient and reliable framework for clinical intelligent decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep ensembles are a powerful tool in machine learning, improving both model performance and uncertainty calibration. While ensembles are typically formed by training and tuning models individually, evidence suggests that jointly tuning the ensemble can lead to better performance. This paper investigates the impact of jointly tuning weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping on both predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we propose a partially overlapping holdout strategy as a practical compromise between enabling joint evaluation and maximizing the use of data for training. Our results demonstrate that jointly tuning the ensemble generally matches or improves performance, with significant variation in effect size across different tasks and metrics. We highlight the trade-offs between individual and joint optimization in deep ensemble training, with the overlapping holdout strategy offering an attractive practical solution. We believe our findings provide valuable insights and guidance for practitioners looking to optimize deep ensemble models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaokai Wang, Shaoyuan Huang, Yuting Li, Xiaofei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) form the cornerstone of modern AI services, supporting a wide range of applications, including autonomous driving, chatbots, and recommendation systems. As models increase in size and complexity, DNN workloads like training and inference tasks impose unprecedented demands on distributed computing resources, making the accurate prediction of runtime essential for optimizing development and resource allocation. Traditional methods rely on additive computational unit models, limiting their accuracy and generalizability. In contrast, graph-enhanced modeling improves performance but significantly increases data collection costs. Therefore, there is a critical need for a method that strikes a balance between accuracy, generalizability, and the costs of data collection. To address these challenges, we propose ScaleDL, a novel runtime prediction framework that combines nonlinear layer-wise modeling with graph neural network (GNN)-based cross-layer interaction mechanism, enabling accurate DNN runtime prediction and hierarchical generalizability across different network architectures. Additionally, we employ the D-optimal method to reduce data collection costs. Experiments on the workloads of five popular DNN models prove that ScaleDL enhances runtime prediction accuracy and generalizability, achieving 6$\times$ lower MRE and 5$\times$ lower RMSE compared to baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuantian Shao, Peisong Wang, Yuanteng Chen, Chang Xu, Zhihui Wei, Jian Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but their rapidly growing scale imposes prohibitive costs in memory, computation, and energy. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for efficient deployment, yet achieving accurate W4A4 quantization remains an open challenge. While most existing methods are designed for INT4 formats, the emergence of MXFP4 -- a new FP4 format with various hardware support (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)-- raises questions about the applicability of current techniques. In this work, we establish a comprehensive benchmark of PTQ methods under the MXFP4 format. Through systematic evaluation, we find that methods like GPTQ consistently deliver strong performance, whereas rotation-based approaches, which are almost used by all state-of-the-art approaches, suffer from severe incompatibility with MXFP4. We further provide the first in-depth analysis of this conflict, tracing its root to a fundamental mismatch between MXFP4's PoT (power-of-two) block scaling and the redistribution of outlier energy via global rotation. Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective block rotation strategy that adapts rotation-based methods to MXFP4, leading to substantial accuracy improvements across diverse LLMs. Our findings not only offer clear guidance for practitioners but also set a foundation for advancing PTQ research under emerging low-precision formats.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hikari Otsuka, Daiki Chijiwa, Yasuyuki Okoshi, Daichi Fujiki, Susumu Takeuchi, Masato Motomura</p>
<p>Abstract: The strong lottery ticket hypothesis (SLTH) conjectures that high-performing subnetworks, called strong lottery tickets (SLTs), are hidden in randomly initialized neural networks. Although recent theoretical studies have established the SLTH across various neural architectures, the SLTH for transformer architectures still lacks theoretical understanding. In particular, the current theory of the SLTH does not yet account for the multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism, a core component of transformers. To address this gap, we introduce a theoretical analysis of the existence of SLTs within MHAs. We prove that, if a randomly initialized MHA of $H$ heads and input dimension $d$ has the hidden dimension $O(d\log(Hd^{3/2}))$ for the key and value, it contains an SLT that approximates an arbitrary MHA with the same input dimension with high probability. Furthermore, by leveraging this theory for MHAs, we extend the SLTH to transformers without normalization layers. We empirically validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the approximation error between the SLT within a source model (MHA and transformer) and an approximate target counterpart decreases exponentially by increasing the hidden dimension of the source model.</p>

The library offers a number of embedding and property models for biological sequences, as well as diagnostics and visualization functions to inspect the results. seqme can be used to evaluate both one-shot and iterative computational design methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we propose a novel approach, STELLE (Signal Temporal logic Embedding for Logically-grounded Learning and Explanation), a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories into a space of temporal logic concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL formulae, our model jointly optimises accuracy and interpretability, as each prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that characterise it. This yields (i) local explanations as human-readable STL conditions justifying individual predictions, and (ii) global explanations as class-characterising formulae. Experiments demonstrate that STELLE achieves competitive accuracy while providing logically faithful explanations, validated on diverse real-world benchmarks.</p>

Yet, collecting such preference data is often costly and time-consuming, motivating the need for more efficient learning paradigms. Two established approaches offer complementary advantages: RLHF scales effectively to high-dimensional tasks such as LLM fine-tuning, while PBO achieves greater sample efficiency through active querying. We propose a hybrid framework that unifies RLHF's scalability with PBO's query efficiency by integrating an acquisition-driven module into the RLHF pipeline, thereby enabling active and sample-efficient preference gathering. We validate the proposed approach on two representative domains: (i) high-dimensional preference optimization and (ii) LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in both sample efficiency and overall performance across these tasks.</p>

However, existing approaches overlook a critical component of modern large language model (LLM) pipelines: the similarity search used to retrieve relevant context data. In this work, we introduce a DP framework for in-context learning that integrates nearest neighbor search of relevant examples in a privacy-aware manner. Our method outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving more favorable privacy-utility trade-offs. To achieve this, we employ nearest neighbor retrieval from a database of context data, combined with a privacy filter that tracks the cumulative privacy cost of selected samples to ensure adherence to a central differential privacy budget. Experimental results on text classification and document question answering show a clear advantage of the proposed method over existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Pirola, Fabio Stella, Marco Grzegorczyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are increasingly used in healthcare due to their ability to model complex temporal relationships in patient data while maintaining interpretability, an essential feature for clinical decision-making. However, existing approaches to handling missing data in longitudinal clinical datasets are largely derived from static Bayesian networks literature, failing to properly account for the temporal nature of the data. This gap limits the ability to quantify uncertainty over time, which is particularly critical in settings such as intensive care, where understanding the temporal dynamics is fundamental for model trustworthiness and applicability across diverse patient groups. Despite the potential of DBNs, a full Bayesian framework that integrates missing data handling remains underdeveloped. In this work, we propose a novel Gibbs sampling-based method for learning DBNs from incomplete data. Our method treats each missing value as an unknown parameter following a Gaussian distribution. At each iteration, the unobserved values are sampled from their full conditional distributions, allowing for principled imputation and uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our method on both simulated datasets and real-world intensive care data from critically ill patients. Compared to standard model-agnostic techniques such as MICE, our Bayesian approach demonstrates superior reconstruction accuracy and convergence properties. These results highlight the clinical relevance of incorporating full Bayesian inference in temporal models, providing more reliable imputations and offering deeper insight into model behavior. Our approach supports safer and more informed clinical decision-making, particularly in settings where missing data are frequent and potentially impactful.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subeen Park, Joowang Kim, Hakyung Lee, Sunjae Yoo, Kyungwoo Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance across various domains but often rely on spurious correlations, making them vulnerable to distribution shifts. This issue is particularly severe in subpopulation shift scenarios, where models struggle in underrepresented groups. While existing methods have made progress in mitigating this issue, their performance gains are still constrained. They lack a rigorous theoretical framework connecting the embedding space representations with worst-group error. To address this limitation, we propose Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for Worst-Group Robustness (SCER), a novel approach that directly regularizes feature representations to suppress spurious cues. We show theoretically that worst-group error is influenced by how strongly the classifier relies on spurious versus core directions, identified from differences in group-wise mean embeddings across domains and classes. By imposing theoretical constraints at the embedding level, SCER encourages models to focus on core features while reducing sensitivity to spurious patterns. Through systematic evaluation on multiple vision and language, we show that SCER outperforms prior state-of-the-art studies in worst-group accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Tomov, Dominik Fuchsgruber, Tom Wollschl\"ager, Stephan G\"unnemann</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for trustworthy deployment. While real-world language is inherently ambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically benchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that while current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive assumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on ambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first ambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer distributions estimated from factual co-occurrence. We find this performance deterioration to be consistent across different estimation paradigms: using the predictive distribution itself, internal representations throughout the model, and an ensemble of models. We show that this phenomenon can be theoretically explained, revealing that predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators are fundamentally limited under ambiguity. Overall, our study reveals a key shortcoming of current UQ methods for LLMs and motivates a rethinking of current modeling paradigms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Jayadeva, Naman Dwivedi, Hari Krishnan, N. M. Anoop Krishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: A formal link between regression and classification has been tenuous. Even though the margin maximization term $\|w\|$ is used in support vector regression, it has at best been justified as a regularizer. We show that a regression problem with $M$ samples lying on a hyperplane has a one-to-one equivalence with a linearly separable classification task with $2M$ samples. We show that margin maximization on the equivalent classification task leads to a different regression formulation than traditionally used. Using the equivalence, we demonstrate a ``regressability'' measure, that can be used to estimate the difficulty of regressing a dataset, without needing to first learn a model for it. We use the equivalence to train neural networks to learn a linearizing map, that transforms input variables into a space where a linear regressor is adequate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syeda Sitara Wishal Fatima, Afshin Rahimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across domains from finance to supply chain management. This paper introduces ForecastGAN, a novel decomposition based adversarial framework addressing limitations in existing approaches for multi-horizon predictions. Although transformer models excel in long-term forecasting, they often underperform in short-term scenarios and typically ignore categorical features. ForecastGAN operates through three integrated modules: a Decomposition Module that extracts seasonality and trend components; a Model Selection Module that identifies optimal neural network configurations based on forecasting horizon; and an Adversarial Training Module that enhances prediction robustness through Conditional Generative Adversarial Network training. Unlike conventional approaches, ForecastGAN effectively integrates both numerical and categorical features. We validate our framework on eleven benchmark multivariate time series datasets that span various forecasting horizons. The results show that ForecastGAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art transformer models for short-term forecasting while remaining competitive for long-term horizons. This research establishes a more generalizable approach to time series forecasting that adapts to specific contexts while maintaining strong performance across diverse data characteristics without extensive hyperparameter tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinwen Zhang, Hongchang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Heavy-tailed noise has attracted growing attention in nonconvex stochastic optimization, as numerous empirical studies suggest it offers a more realistic assumption than standard bounded variance assumption. In this work, we investigate nonconvex-PL minimax optimization under heavy-tailed gradient noise in federated learning. We propose two novel algorithms: Fed-NSGDA-M, which integrates normalized gradients, and FedMuon-DA, which leverages the Muon optimizer for local updates. Both algorithms are designed to effectively address heavy-tailed noise in federated minimax optimization, under a milder condition. We theoretically establish that both algorithms achieve a convergence rate of $O({1}/{(TNp)^{\frac{s-1}{2s}}})$. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first federated minimax optimization algorithms with rigorous theoretical guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Extensive experiments further validate their effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dennis Thumm, Luis Ontaneda Mijares</p>
<p>Abstract: Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal mechanisms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval of information from graph-structured knowledge bases represents a promising direction for improving the factuality of LLMs. While various solutions have been proposed, a comparison of methods is difficult due to the lack of challenging QA datasets with ground-truth targets for graph retrieval. We present SynthKGQA, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic Knowledge Graph Question Answering datasets from any Knowledge Graph, providing the full set of ground-truth facts in the KG to reason over each question. We show how, in addition to enabling more informative benchmarking of KG retrievers, the data produced with SynthKGQA also allows us to train better models. We apply SynthKGQA to Wikidata to generate GTSQA, a new dataset designed to test zero-shot generalization abilities of KG retrievers with respect to unseen graph structures and relation types, and benchmark popular solutions for KG-augmented LLMs on it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ipsita Ghosh, Ethan Nguyen, Christian K\"ummerle</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient training, based on low-rank optimization, has become a highly successful tool for fine-tuning large deep-learning models. However, these methods fail at low-rank pre-training tasks where maintaining the low-rank structure and the objective remains a challenging task. We propose the Quadratic Reweighted Rank Regularizer dubbed Q3R, which leads to a novel low-rank inducing training strategy inspired by the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) framework. Q3R is based on a quadratic regularizer term which majorizes a smoothed log determinant serving as rank surrogate objective. Unlike other low-rank training techniques, Q3R is able to train weight matrices with prescribed, low target ranks of models that achieve comparable predictive performance as dense models, with small computational overhead, while remaining fully compatible with existing architectures. For example, we demonstrated one experiment where we are able to truncate $60\%$ and $80\%$ of the parameters of a ViT-Tiny model with $~1.3\%$ and $~4\%$ accuracy drop in CIFAR-10 performance respectively. The efficacy of Q3R is confirmed on Transformers across both image and language tasks, including for low-rank fine-tuning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04494">Distribution-Aware Tensor Decomposition for Compression of Convolutional Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alper Kalle, Theo Rudkiewicz, Mohamed-Oumar Ouerfelli, Mohamed Tamaazousti</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks are widely used for image-related tasks but typically demand considerable computing power. Once a network has been trained, however, its memory- and compute-footprint can be reduced by compression. In this work, we focus on compression through tensorization and low-rank representations. Whereas classical approaches search for a low-rank approximation by minimizing an isotropic norm such as the Frobenius norm in weight-space, we use data-informed norms that measure the error in function space. Concretely, we minimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed as $\lVert (W - \widetilde{W}) \Sigma^{1/2}\rVert_F$ where $\Sigma^{1/2}$ is the square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$, $\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights. We propose new alternating least square algorithms for the two most common tensor decompositions (Tucker-2 and CPD) that directly optimize the new norm. Unlike conventional compression pipelines, which almost always require post-compression fine-tuning, our data-informed approach often achieves competitive accuracy without any fine-tuning. We further show that the same covariance-based norm can be transferred from one dataset to another with only a minor accuracy drop, enabling compression even when the original training dataset is unavailable. Experiments on several CNN architectures (ResNet-18/50, and GoogLeNet) and datasets (ImageNet, FGVC-Aircraft, Cifar10, and Cifar100) confirm the advantages of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaolong Wu, James Blume, Geshi Yeung</p>
<p>Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has grown rapidly as a research area, yet key concepts remain unsettled, especially in criminal justice. We review group, individual, and process fairness and map the conditions under which they conflict. We then develop a simple modification to standard group fairness. Rather than exact parity across protected groups, we minimize a weighted error loss while keeping differences in false negative rates within a small tolerance. This makes solutions easier to find, can raise predictive accuracy, and surfaces the ethical choice of error costs. We situate this proposal within three classes of critique: biased and incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and the explosion of subgroup constraints. Finally, we offer a practical framework for deployment in public decision systems built on three pillars: need-based decisions, Transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions and solutions. Together, these elements link technical design to legitimacy and provide actionable guidance for agencies that use risk assessment and related tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> C. Hepburn, T. Zielke, A. P. Raulf</p>
<p>Abstract: The phenomenon of linear mode connectivity (LMC) links several aspects of deep learning, including training stability under noisy stochastic gradients, the smoothness and generalization of local minima (basins), the similarity and functional diversity of sampled models, and architectural effects on data processing. In this work, we experimentally study LMC under data shifts and identify conditions that mitigate their impact. We interpret data shifts as an additional source of stochastic gradient noise, which can be reduced through small learning rates and large batch sizes. These parameters influence whether models converge to the same local minimum or to regions of the loss landscape with varying smoothness and generalization. Although models sampled via LMC tend to make similar errors more frequently than those converging to different basins, the benefit of LMC lies in balancing training efficiency against the gains achieved from larger, more diverse ensembles.

<p>Abstract: We present a new benchmarking study comparing a boundary-constrained Ehrenpreis--Palamodov Gaussian Process (B-EPGP) surrogate with a classical finite element method combined with Crank--Nicolson time stepping (CN-FEM) for solving the two-dimensional wave equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The B-EPGP construction leverages exponential-polynomial bases derived from the characteristic variety to enforce the PDE and boundary conditions exactly and employs penalized least squares to estimate the coefficients. To ensure fairness across paradigms, we introduce a degrees-of-freedom (DoF) matching protocol. Under matched DoF, B-EPGP consistently attains lower space-time $L^2$-error and maximum-in-time $L^{2}$-error in space than CN-FEM, improving accuracy by roughly two orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>Abstract: With our recently proposed method based on reinforcement learning (Mayfrank et al. (2024), Comput. Chem. Eng. 190), Koopman surrogate models can be trained for optimal performance in specific (economic) nonlinear model predictive control ((e)NMPC) applications. So far, our method has exclusively been demonstrated on a small-scale case study. Herein, we show that our method scales well to a more challenging demand response case study built on a large-scale model of a single-product (nitrogen) air separation unit. Across all numerical experiments, we assume observability of only a few realistically measurable plant variables. Compared to a purely system identification-based Koopman eNMPC, which generates small economic savings but frequently violates constraints, our method delivers similar economic performance while avoiding constraint violations.</p>

Existing approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure. Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics, reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty across the ROM pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divyansha Lachi, Mahmoud Mohammadi, Joe Meyer, Vinam Arora, Tom Palczewski, Eva L. Dyer</p>
<p>Abstract: In domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, the temporal dynamics of relational data emerge from complex interactions-such as those between patients and providers, or users and products across diverse categories. To be broadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range spatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also supporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for relational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal information merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather than a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction. To address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances global context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture temporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning that leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently integrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent bottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common latent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire relational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder that supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a single model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers state-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for relational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: 1. A hard stop for the implementation of rigorous conservation initiatives is our lack of key species data, especially occurrence data. Furthermore, researchers have to contend with an accelerated speed at which new information must be collected and processed due to anthropogenic activity. Publications ranging from scientific papers to gray literature contain this crucial information but their data are often not machine-readable, requiring extensive human work to be retrieved. 2. We present the ARETE R package, an open-source software aiming to automate data extraction of species occurrences powered by large language models, namely using the chatGPT Application Programming Interface. This R package integrates all steps of the data extraction and validation process, from Optical Character Recognition to detection of outliers and output in tabular format. Furthermore, we validate ARETE through systematic comparison between what is modelled and the work of human annotators. 3. We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by comparing range maps produced using GBIF data and with those automatically extracted for 100 species of spiders. Newly extracted data allowed to expand the known Extent of Occurrence by a mean three orders of magnitude, revealing new areas where the species were found in the past, which mayhave important implications for spatial conservation planning and extinction risk assessments. 4. ARETE allows faster access to hitherto untapped occurrence data, a potential game changer in projects requiring such data. Researchers will be able to better prioritize resources, manually verifying selected species while maintaining automated extraction for the majority. This workflow also allows predicting available bibliographic data during project planning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Complexity as Advantage (CAA), a framework that defines the complexity of a system relative to a family of observers. Instead of measuring complexity as an intrinsic property, we evaluate how much predictive regret a system induces for different observers attempting to model it. A system is complex when it is easy for some observers and hard for others, creating an information advantage. We show that this formulation unifies several notions of emergent behavior, including multiscale entropy, predictive information, and observer-dependent structure. The framework suggests that "interesting" systems are those positioned to create differentiated regret across observers, providing a quantitative grounding for why complexity can be functionally valuable. We demonstrate the idea through simple dynamical models and discuss implications for learning, evolution, and artificial agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Utkarsh U. Chavan, Prashant Trivedi, Nandyala Hemachandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are central to applications such as swarm robotics and traffic routing, where agents must coordinate in a decentralized manner to achieve a common objective. Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems provide a natural framework for modeling decentralized control in such settings. While the problem of learning in SSP has been extensively studied in single-agent settings, the decentralized multi-agent variant remains largely unexplored. In this work, we take a step towards addressing that gap. We study decentralized multi-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the transition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models. Applying novel symmetry-based arguments, we identify the structure of optimal policies. Our main contribution is the first regret lower bound for this setting based on the construction of hard-to-learn instances for any number of agents, $n$. Our regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{K})$, over $K$ episodes, highlights the inherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs. These insights clarify the learning complexity of decentralized control and can further guide the design of efficient learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hampus {\AA}str\"om, Elin Anna Topp, Jacek Malec</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we study how transforming regular reinforcement learning environments into goal-conditioned environments can let agents learn to solve tasks autonomously and reward-free. We show that an agent can learn to solve tasks by selecting its own goals in an environment-agnostic way, at training times comparable to externally guided reinforcement learning. Our method is independent of the underlying off-policy learning algorithm. Since our method is environment-agnostic, the agent does not value any goals higher than others, leading to instability in performance for individual goals. However, in our experiments, we show that the average goal success rate improves and stabilizes. An agent trained with this method can be instructed to seek any observations made in the environment, enabling generic training of agents prior to specific use cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satchel Grant, Simon Jerome Han, Alexa Tartaglini, Christopher Potts</p>
<p>Abstract: A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate empirically that common causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a theoretical analysis of two classes of such divergences: `harmless' divergences that occur in the null-space of the weights and from covariance within behavioral decision boundaries, and `pernicious' divergences that activate hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an effort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we modify the Counterfactual Latent (CL) loss from Grant (2025) that regularizes interventions to remain closer to the natural distributions, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while preserving the interpretive power of interventions. Together, these results highlight a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sitan Chen, Kevin Cong, Jerry Li</p>
<p>Abstract: A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that their inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and costly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of language models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion model (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens out-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However, there is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling these models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling performance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but these are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we give a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true distribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any unmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory of univariate function approximation.
  By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and upper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation in principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show that it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori knowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we also demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of well-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely, its total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some natural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss in performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinlu Zhang, Yansha Deng, Toktam Mahmoodi</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers new opportunities in machine learning, particularly in addressing data privacy concerns. In contrast to conventional event-based federated learning, time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed), as a general form of both asynchronous and synchronous FL, clusters users into different tiers based on fixed time intervals. However, the FL network consists of a growing number of user devices with limited wireless bandwidth, consequently magnifying issues such as stragglers and communication overhead. In this paper, we introduce adaptive model pruning to wireless TT-Fed systems and study the problem of jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and bandwidth allocation to minimize the training loss while ensuring minimal learning latency. To answer this question, we perform convergence analysis on the gradient l_2 norm of the TT-Fed model based on model pruning. Based on the obtained convergence upper bound, a joint optimization problem of pruning ratio and wireless bandwidth is formulated to minimize the model training loss under a given delay threshold. Then, we derive closed-form solutions for wireless bandwidth and pruning ratio using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions. The simulation results show that model pruning could reduce the communication cost by 40% while maintaining the model performance at the same level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huaguan Chen, Wei Han, Haofei Sun, Ning Lin, Xingtao Song, Yunfan Yang, Jie Tian, Yang Liu, Ji-Rong Wen, Xiaoye Zhang, Xueshun Shen, Hao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Extreme precipitation nowcasting demands high spatiotemporal fidelity and extended lead times, yet existing approaches remain limited. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and its deep-learning emulations are too slow and coarse for rapidly evolving convection, while extrapolation and purely data-driven models suffer from error accumulation and excessive smoothing. Hybrid 2D radar-based methods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate reconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully three-dimensional nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar reflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with datadriven learning. The model learns vertically varying 3D advection fields under a conservative advection operator, parameterizes spatially varying diffusion, and introduces a Brownian-motion--inspired stochastic term to represent unresolved motions. A residual branch captures small-scale convective initiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic module estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up to three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\% of cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists. By restoring full 3D dynamics with physical consistency, it offers a scalable and robust pathway for skillful and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Sanati, Thomas L. Lee, Trevor McInroe, Aidan Scannell, Nikolay Malkin, David Abel, Amos Storkey</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental challenge in developing general learning algorithms is their tendency to forget past knowledge when adapting to new data. Addressing this problem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades of study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the underlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic theory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a learner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a loss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure of an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a comprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression, generative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate how forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant role in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a principled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and improving the information retention capabilities of general learning algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian D. Allagan, Dasia A. Singleton, Shanae N. Perry, Gabrielle C. Morgan, Essence A. Morgan</p>
<p>Abstract: This study evaluates a 40-item mathematics placement examination administered to 198 students using a multi-method framework combining Classical Test Theory, machine learning, and unsupervised clustering. Classical Test Theory analysis reveals that 55\% of items achieve excellent discrimination ($D \geq 0.40$) while 30\% demonstrate poor discrimination ($D < 0.20$) requiring replacement. Question 6 (Graph Interpretation) emerges as the examination's most powerful discriminator, achieving perfect discrimination ($D = 1.000$), highest ANOVA F-statistic ($F = 4609.1$), and maximum Random Forest feature importance (0.206), accounting for 20.6\% of predictive power. Machine learning algorithms demonstrate exceptional performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting achieving 97.5\% and 96.0\% cross-validation accuracy. K-means clustering identifies a natural binary competency structure with a boundary at 42.5\%, diverging from the institutional threshold of 55\% and suggesting potential overclassification into remedial categories. The two-cluster solution exhibits exceptional stability (bootstrap ARI = 0.855) with perfect lower-cluster purity. Convergent evidence across methods supports specific refinements: replace poorly discriminating items, implement a two-stage assessment, and integrate Random Forest predictions with transparency mechanisms. These findings demonstrate that multi-method integration provides a robust empirical foundation for evidence-based mathematics placement optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atena Khoshkonesh, Mohsen Mohammadagha, Navid Ebrahimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Persistent cost and schedule deviations remain a major challenge in the U.S. construction industry, revealing the limitations of deterministic CPM and static document-based estimating. This study presents an integrated 4D/5D digital-twin framework that couples Building Information Modeling (BIM) with natural-language processing (NLP)-based cost mapping, computer-vision (CV)-driven progress measurement, Bayesian probabilistic CPM updating, and deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) resource-leveling. A nine-month case implementation on a Dallas-Fort Worth mid-rise project demonstrated measurable gains in accuracy and efficiency: 43% reduction in estimating labor, 6% reduction in overtime, and 30% project-buffer utilization, while maintaining an on-time finish at 128 days within P50-P80 confidence bounds. The digital-twin sandbox also enabled real-time "what-if" forecasting and traceable cost-schedule alignment through a 5D knowledge graph. Findings confirm that integrating AI-based analytics with probabilistic CPM and DRL enhances forecasting precision, transparency, and control resilience. The validated workflow establishes a practical pathway toward predictive, adaptive, and auditable construction management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valentin Mouton, Adrien M\'elot</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing frictional interfaces to exhibit prescribed macroscopic behavior is a challenging inverse problem, made difficult by the non-uniqueness of solutions and the computational cost of contact simulations. Traditional approaches rely on heuristic search over low-dimensional parameterizations, which limits their applicability to more complex or nonlinear friction laws. We introduce a generative modeling framework using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to infer surface topographies from target friction laws. Trained on a synthetic dataset composed of 200 million samples constructed from a parameterized contact mechanics model, the proposed method enables efficient, simulation-free generation of candidate topographies. We examine the potential and limitations of generative modeling for this inverse design task, focusing on balancing accuracy, throughput, and diversity in the generated solutions. Our results highlight trade-offs and outline practical considerations when balancing these objectives. This approach paves the way for near-real-time control of frictional behavior through tailored surface topographies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marios Impraimakis</p>
<p>Abstract: The response-only model class selection capability of a novel deep convolutional neural network method is examined herein in a simple, yet effective, manner. Specifically, the responses from a unique degree of freedom along with their class information train and validate a one-dimensional convolutional neural network. In doing so, the network selects the model class of new and unlabeled signals without the need of the system input information, or full system identification. An optional physics-based algorithm enhancement is also examined using the Kalman filter to fuse the system response signals using the kinematics constraints of the acceleration and displacement data. Importantly, the method is shown to select the model class in slight signal variations attributed to the damping behavior or hysteresis behavior on both linear and nonlinear dynamic systems, as well as on a 3D building finite element model, providing a powerful tool for structural health monitoring applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guang An Ooi, Otavio Bertozzi, Mohd Asim Aftab, Charalambos Konstantinou, Shehab Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources exhibit complex dynamic behaviors that challenge the scalability and generalizability of traditional stability assessment methods. This paper presents a dynamic recurrent adjacency memory network (DRAMN) that combines physics-informed analysis with deep learning for real-time power system stability forecasting. The framework employs sliding-window dynamic mode decomposition to construct time-varying, multi-layer adjacency matrices from phasor measurement unit and sensor data to capture system dynamics such as modal participation factors, coupling strengths, phase relationships, and spectral energy distributions. As opposed to processing spatial and temporal dependencies separately, DRAMN integrates graph convolution operations directly within recurrent gating mechanisms, enabling simultaneous modeling of evolving dynamics and temporal dependencies. Extensive validations on modified IEEE 9-bus, 39-bus, and a multi-terminal HVDC network demonstrate high performance, achieving 99.85\%, 99.90\%, and 99.69\% average accuracies, respectively, surpassing all tested benchmarks, including classical machine learning algorithms and recent graph-based models. The framework identifies optimal combinations of measurements that reduce feature dimensionality by 82\% without performance degradation. Correlation analysis between dominant measurements for small-signal and transient stability events validates generalizability across different stability phenomena. DRAMN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing enhanced interpretability for power system operators, making it suitable for real-time deployment in modern control centers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniket Jivani, Cosmin Safta, Beckett Y. Zhou, Xun Huan</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a bifidelity Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion (KLE) surrogate model for field-valued quantities of interest (QoIs) under uncertain inputs. The approach combines the spectral efficiency of the KLE with polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) to preserve an explicit mapping between input uncertainties and output fields. By coupling inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) simulations that capture dominant response trends with a limited number of high-fidelity (HF) simulations that correct for systematic bias, the proposed method enables accurate and computationally affordable surrogate construction. To further improve surrogate accuracy, we form an active learning strategy that adaptively selects new HF evaluations based on the surrogate's generalization error, estimated via cross-validation and modeled using Gaussian process regression. New HF samples are then acquired by maximizing an expected improvement criterion, targeting regions of high surrogate error. The resulting BF-KLE-AL framework is demonstrated on three examples of increasing complexity: a one-dimensional analytical benchmark, a two-dimensional convection-diffusion system, and a three-dimensional turbulent round jet simulation based on Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) and enhanced delayed detached-eddy simulations (EDDES). Across these cases, the method achieves consistent improvements in predictive accuracy and sample efficiency relative to single-fidelity and random-sampling approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parthiban Loganathan, Elias Zea, Ricardo Vinuesa, Evelyn Otero</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid changes and increasing climatic variability across the widely varied Koppen-Geiger regions of northern Europe generate significant needs for adaptation. Regional planning needs high-resolution projected temperatures. This work presents an integrative downscaling framework that incorporates Vision Transformer (ViT), Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), and Geospatial Spatiotemporal Transformer with Attention and Imbalance-Aware Network (GeoStaNet) models. The framework is evaluated with a multicriteria decision system, Deep Learning-TOPSIS (DL-TOPSIS), for ten strategically chosen meteorological stations encompassing the temperate oceanic (Cfb), subpolar oceanic (Cfc), warm-summer continental (Dfb), and subarctic (Dfc) climate regions. Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM2-LM) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) outputs were bias-corrected during the 1951-2014 period and subsequently validated against earlier observations of day-to-day temperature metrics and diurnal range statistics. The ViT showed improved performance (Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1.01 degrees C; R^2: 0.92), allowing for production of credible downscaled projections. Under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, the Dfc and Dfb climate zones are projected to warm by 4.8 degrees C and 3.9 degrees C, respectively, by 2100, with expansion in the diurnal temperature range by more than 1.5 degrees C. The Time of Emergence signal first appears in subarctic winter seasons (Dfc: approximately 2032), signifying an urgent need for adaptation measures. The presented framework offers station-based, high-resolution estimates of uncertainties and extremes, with direct uses for adaptation policy over high-latitude regions with fast environmental change.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03771">Climbing the label tree: Hierarchy-preserving contrastive learning for medical imaging</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alif Elham Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image labels are often organized by taxonomies (e.g., organ - tissue - subtype), yet standard self-supervised learning (SSL) ignores this structure. We present a hierarchy-preserving contrastive framework that makes the label tree a first-class training signal and an evaluation target. Our approach introduces two plug-in objectives: Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC), which scales positive/negative pair strengths by shared ancestors to promote within-parent coherence, and Level-Aware Margin (LAM), a prototype margin that separates ancestor groups across levels. The formulation is geometry-agnostic and applies to Euclidean and hyperbolic embeddings without architectural changes. Across several benchmarks, including breast histopathology, the proposed objectives consistently improve representation quality over strong SSL baselines while better respecting the taxonomy. We evaluate with metrics tailored to hierarchy faithfulness: HF1 (hierarchical F1), H-Acc (tree-distance-weighted accuracy), and parent-distance violation rate. We also report top-1 accuracy for completeness. Ablations show that HWC and LAM are effective even without curvature, and combining them yields the most taxonomy-aligned representations. Taken together, these results provide a simple, general recipe for learning medical image representations that respect the label tree and advance both performance and interpretability in hierarchy-rich domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: We bring a control perspective to the problem of identifying paths of measures for sampling via dynamic measure transport (DMT). We highlight the fact that commonly used paths may be poor choices for DMT and connect existing methods for learning alternate paths to mean-field games. Based on these connections we pose a flexible family of optimization problems for identifying tilted paths of measures for DMT and advocate for the use of objective terms which encourage smoothness of the corresponding velocities. We present a numerical algorithm for solving these problems based on recent Gaussian process methods for solution of partial differential equations and demonstrate the ability of our method to recover more efficient and smooth transport models compared to those which use an untilted reference path.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Mostafa, Raisul Arefin Nahid, Samuel Mulder</p>
<p>Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models, systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics. Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis, contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model (NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phuc Nguyen, Josiah Couch, Rahul Bansal, Alexandra Morgan, Chris Tam, Miao Li, Rima Arnaout, Ramy Arnaout</p>
<p>Abstract: A canonical step in quantifying a system is to measure its entropy. Shannon entropy and other traditional entropy measures capture only the information encoded in the frequencies of a system's elements. Recently, Leinster, Cobbold, and Reeve (LCR) introduced a method that also captures the rich information encoded in the similarities and differences among elements, yielding similarity-sensitive entropy. More recently, the Vendi score (VS) was introduced as an alternative, raising the question of how LCR and VS compare, and which is preferable. Here we address these questions conceptually, analytically, and experimentally, using 53 machine-learning datasets. We show that LCR and VS can differ by orders of magnitude and can capture complementary information about a system, except in limiting cases. We demonstrate that both LCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of ``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an upper bound on LCR for several values of the R\'enyi-Hill order parameter and conjecture that this bound holds for all values. We conclude that VS is preferable only when interpreting elements as linear combinations of a more fundamental set of ``ur-elements'' or when the system or dataset possesses a quantum-mechanical character. In the broader circumstance where one seeks simply to capture the rich information encoded by similarity, LCR is favored; nevertheless, for certain half-distances the two methods can complement each other.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly accelerated progress in code translation, enabling more accurate and efficient transformation across programming languages. While originally developed for natural language processing, LLMs have shown strong capabilities in modeling programming language syntax and semantics, outperforming traditional rule-based systems in both accuracy and flexibility. These models have streamlined cross-language conversion, reduced development overhead, and accelerated legacy code migration. In this paper, we introduce OMPILOT, a novel domain-specific encoder-decoder transformer tailored for translating C++ code into OpenMP, enabling effective shared-memory parallelization. OMPILOT leverages custom pre-training objectives that incorporate the semantics of parallel constructs and combines both unsupervised and supervised learning strategies to improve code translation robustness. Unlike previous work that focused primarily on loop-level transformations, OMPILOT operates at the function level to capture a wider semantic context. To evaluate our approach, we propose OMPBLEU, a novel composite metric specifically crafted to assess the correctness and quality of OpenMP parallel constructs, addressing limitations in conventional translation metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyuxuan Guo, Gurnoor Singh Khurana, Alejandro Gonzalo Grande, Juan C. del Alamo, Francisco Contijoch</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Non-invasive imaging-based assessment of blood flow plays a critical role in evaluating heart function and structure. Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely-used imaging modality that can robustly evaluate cardiovascular anatomy and function, but direct methods to estimate blood flow velocity from movies of contrast evolution have not been developed.
  Purpose: This study evaluates the impact of CT imaging on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)-based flow estimation and proposes an improved framework, SinoFlow, which uses sinogram data directly to estimate blood flow.
  Methods: We generated pulsatile flow fields in an idealized 2D vessel bifurcation using computational fluid dynamics and simulated CT scans with varying gantry rotation speeds, tube currents, and pulse mode imaging settings. We compared the performance of PINN-based flow estimation using reconstructed images (ImageFlow) to SinoFlow.
  Results: SinoFlow significantly improved flow estimation performance by avoiding propagating errors introduced by filtered backprojection. SinoFlow was robust across all tested gantry rotation speeds and consistently produced lower mean squared error and velocity errors than ImageFlow. Additionally, SinoFlow was compatible with pulsed-mode imaging and maintained higher accuracy with shorter pulse widths.
  Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of SinoFlow for CT-based flow estimation, providing a more promising approach for non-invasive blood flow assessment. The findings aim to inform future applications of PINNs to CT images and provide a solution for image-based estimation, with reasonable acquisition parameters yielding accurate flow estimates.</p>

<p>Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic intra-operative spinal navigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdulmumin Sa'ad, Sulaimon Oyeniyi Adebayo, Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui</p>
<p>Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient, and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned, lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT) and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset, we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linchen Qian, Jiasong Chen, Ruonan Gong, Wei Sun, Minliang Liu, Liang Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate geometric modeling of the aortic valve from 3D CT images is essential for biomechanical analysis and patient-specific simulations to assess valve health or make a preoperative plan. However, it remains challenging to generate aortic valve meshes with both high-quality and consistency across different patients. Traditional approaches often produce triangular meshes with irregular topologies, which can result in poorly shaped elements and inconsistent correspondence due to inter-patient anatomical variation. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a template-fitting pipeline with deep neural networks to generate structured quad (i.e., quadrilateral) meshes from 3D CT images to represent aortic valve geometries. By remeshing aortic valves of all patients with a common quad mesh template, we ensure a uniform mesh topology with consistent node-to-node and element-to-element correspondence across patients. This consistency enables us to simplify the learning objective of the deep neural networks, by employing a loss function with only two terms (i.e., a geometry reconstruction term and a smoothness regularization term), which is sufficient to preserve mesh smoothness and element quality. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach produces high-quality aortic valve surface meshes with improved smoothness and shape quality, while requiring fewer explicit regularization terms compared to the traditional methods. These results highlight that using structured quad meshes for the template and neural network training not only ensures mesh correspondence and quality but also simplifies the training process, thus enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of aortic valve modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chiraag Kaushik, Justin Romberg, Vidya Muthukumar</p>
<p>Abstract: We present simple, user-friendly bounds for the expected operator norm of a random kernel matrix under general conditions on the kernel function $k(\cdot,\cdot)$. Our approach uses decoupling results for U-statistics and the non-commutative Khintchine inequality to obtain upper and lower bounds depending only on scalar statistics of the kernel function and a ``correlation kernel'' matrix corresponding to $k(\cdot,\cdot)$. We then apply our method to provide new, tighter approximations for inner-product kernel matrices on general high-dimensional data, where the sample size and data dimension are polynomially related. Our method obtains simplified proofs of existing results that rely on the moment method and combinatorial arguments while also providing novel approximation results for the case of anisotropic Gaussian data. Finally, using similar techniques to our approximation result, we show a tighter lower bound on the bias of kernel regression with anisotropic Gaussian data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manh Nguyen, Sunil Gupta, Dai Do, Hung Le</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination mitigation remains a persistent challenge for large language models (LLMs), even as model scales grow. Existing approaches often rely on external knowledge sources, such as structured databases or knowledge graphs, accessed through prompting or retrieval. However, prompt-based grounding is fragile and domain-sensitive, while symbolic knowledge integration incurs heavy retrieval and formatting costs. Motivated by knowledge graphs, we introduce Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD), a decoding-time method that grounds generation in corpus-derived evidence without retraining. GRAD constructs a sparse token transition graph by accumulating next-token logits across a small retrieved corpus in a single forward pass. During decoding, graph-retrieved logits are max-normalized and adaptively fused with model logits to favor high-evidence continuations while preserving fluency. Across three models and a range of question-answering benchmarks spanning intrinsic, extrinsic hallucination, and factuality tasks, GRAD consistently surpasses baselines, achieving up to 9.7$\%$ higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6$\%$ lower hallucination rates, and 6.9$\%$ greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, while attaining the highest truth--informativeness product score among all methods. GRAD offers a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding and knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from corpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more truthful and verifiable outputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The weighted Euler characteristic transform (WECT) and Euler characteristic function (ECF) have proven to be useful tools in a variety of applications. However, current methods for computing these functions are neither optimized for speed nor do they scale to higher-dimensional settings. In this work, we present a vectorized framework for computing such topological transforms using tensor operations, which is highly optimized for GPU architectures and works in full generality across geometric simplicial complexes (or cubical complexes) of arbitrary dimension. Experimentally, the framework demonstrates significant speedups (up to $180 \times$) over existing methods when computing the WECT and ECF across a variety of image datasets. Computation of these transforms is implemented in a publicly available Python package called pyECT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aukosh Jagannath, Taj Jones-McCormick, Varnan Sarangian</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop a high-dimensional scaling limit for Stochastic Gradient Descent with Polyak Momentum (SGD-M) and adaptive step-sizes. This provides a framework to rigourously compare online SGD with some of its popular variants. We show that the scaling limits of SGD-M coincide with those of online SGD after an appropriate time rescaling and a specific choice of step-size. However, if the step-size is kept the same between the two algorithms, SGD-M will amplify high-dimensional effects, potentially degrading performance relative to online SGD. We demonstrate our framework on two popular learning problems: Spiked Tensor PCA and Single Index Models. In both cases, we also examine online SGD with an adaptive step-size based on normalized gradients. In the high-dimensional regime, this algorithm yields multiple benefits: its dynamics admit fixed points closer to the population minimum and widens the range of admissible step-sizes for which the iterates converge to such solutions. These examples provide a rigorous account, aligning with empirical motivation, of how early preconditioners can stabilize and improve dynamics in settings where online SGD fails.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shinto Eguchi</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a density-power weighted variant for the Stein operator, called the $\gamma$-Stein operator. This is a novel class of operators derived from the $\gamma$-divergence, designed to build robust inference methods for unnormalized probability models. The operator's construction (weighting by the model density raised to a positive power $\gamma$ inherently down-weights the influence of outliers, providing a principled mechanism for robustness. Applying this operator yields a robust generalization of score matching that retains the crucial property of being independent of the model's normalizing constant. We extend this framework to develop two key applications: the $\gamma$-kernelized Stein discrepancy for robust goodness-of-fit testing, and $\gamma$-Stein variational gradient descent for robust Bayesian posterior approximation. Empirical results on contaminated Gaussian and quartic potential models show our methods significantly outperform standard baselines in both robustness and statistical efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moses Charikar, Chirag Pabbaraju, Ambuj Tewari</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of language identification in the limit, where given a sequence of examples from a target language, the goal of the learner is to output a sequence of guesses for the target language such that all the guesses beyond some finite time are correct. Classical results of Gold showed that language identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any interesting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise characterization of language collections for which this task is possible. Motivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language generation, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the setting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of $k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite time, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.
  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be $k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's characterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This further leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language collection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the collection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which can be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our characterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical setting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution supported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a collection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be $k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the other hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it cannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Badu Yakubu, Lesther Santana, Mohamed Rahouti, Yufeng Xin, Abdellah Chehri, Mohammed Aledhari</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing frequency and sophistication of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, it has become critical to develop more efficient and interpretable detection methods. Traditional detection systems often struggle with scalability and transparency, hindering real-time response and understanding of attack vectors. This paper presents an automated framework for detecting and interpreting DDoS attacks using machine learning (ML). The proposed method leverages the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) to automate the selection and optimization of ML models and features, reducing the need for manual experimentation. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is incorporated to enhance model interpretability, providing detailed insights into the contribution of individual features to the detection process. By combining TPOT's automated pipeline selection with SHAP interpretability, this approach improves the accuracy and transparency of DDoS detection. Experimental results demonstrate that key features such as mean backward packet length and minimum forward packet header length are critical in detecting DDoS attacks, offering a scalable and explainable cybersecurity solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liran Cohen, Yaniv Nemcovesky, Avi Mendelson</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data from a model without requiring full retraining. This capability is crucial for ensuring privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance. Therefore, verifying whether a model has truly forgotten target data is essential for maintaining reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing evaluation methods often assess forgetting at the level of individual inputs. This approach may overlook residual influence present in semantically similar examples. Such influence can compromise privacy and lead to indirect information leakage. We propose REMIND (Residual Memorization In Neighborhood Dynamics), a novel evaluation method aiming to detect the subtle remaining influence of unlearned data and classify whether the data has been effectively forgotten. REMIND analyzes the model's loss over small input variations and reveals patterns unnoticed by single-point evaluations. We show that unlearned data yield flatter, less steep loss landscapes, while retained or unrelated data exhibit sharper, more volatile patterns. REMIND requires only query-based access, outperforms existing methods under similar constraints, and demonstrates robustness across different models, datasets, and paraphrased inputs, making it practical for real-world deployment. By providing a more sensitive and interpretable measure of unlearning effectiveness, REMIND provides a reliable framework to assess unlearning in language models. As a result, REMIND offers a novel perspective on memorization and unlearning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valter Uotila, V\"ain\"o Mehtola, Ilmo Salmenper\"a, Bo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging data symmetries has been a key driver of performance gains in geometric deep learning and geometric and equivariant quantum machine learning. While symmetrization appears to be a promising method, its practical overhead, such as additional gates, reduced expressibility, and other factors, is not well understood in quantum machine learning. In this work, we develop an automated pipeline to measure various characteristics of quantum machine learning ansatzes with respect to symmetries that can appear in the learning task. We define the degree of symmetry in the learning problem as the size of the subgroup it admits. Subgroups define partial symmetries, which have not been extensively studied in previous research, which has focused on symmetries defined by whole groups. Symmetrizing the 19 common ansatzes with respect to these varying-sized subgroup representations, we compute three classes of metrics that describe how the common ansatz structures behave under varying amounts of symmetries. The first metric is based on the norm of the difference between the original and symmetrized generators, while the second metric counts depth, size, and other characteristics from the symmetrized circuits. The third class of metrics includes expressibility and entangling capability. The results demonstrate varying gate overhead across the studied ansatzes and confirm that increased symmetry reduces expressibility of the circuits. In most cases, increased symmetry increases entanglement capability. These results help select sufficiently expressible and computationally efficient ansatze patterns for geometric quantum machine learning applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models, inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models, achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81% improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR). To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving 2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungbin Jun, Ilsang Ohn</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction has emerged as a powerful framework for constructing distribution-free prediction sets with guaranteed coverage assuming only the exchangeability assumption. However, this assumption is often violated in online environments where data distributions evolve over time. Several recent approaches have been proposed to address this limitation, but, typically, they slowly adapt to distribution shifts because they update predictions only in a forward manner, that is, they generate a prediction for a newly observed data point while previously computed predictions are not updated. In this paper, we propose a novel online conformal inference method with retrospective adjustment, which is designed to achieve faster adaptation to distributional shifts. Our method leverages regression approaches with efficient leave-one-out update formulas to retroactively adjust past predictions when new data arrive, thereby aligning the entire set of predictions with the most recent data distribution. Through extensive numerical studies performed on both synthetic and real-world data sets, we show that the proposed approach achieves faster coverage recalibration and improved statistical efficiency compared to existing online conformal prediction methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: SRAM Processing-in-Memory (PIM) has emerged as the most promising implementation for high-performance PIM, delivering superior computing density, energy efficiency, and computational precision. However, the pursuit of higher performance necessitates more complex circuit designs and increased operating frequencies, which exacerbate IR-drop issues. Severe IR-drop can significantly degrade chip performance and even threaten reliability. Conventional circuit-level IR-drop mitigation methods, such as back-end optimizations, are resource-intensive and often compromise power, performance, and area (PPA). To address these challenges, we propose AIM, comprehensive software and hardware co-design for architecture-level IR-drop mitigation in high-performance PIM. Initially, leveraging the bit-serial and in-situ dataflow processing properties of PIM, we introduce Rtog and HR, which establish a direct correlation between PIM workloads and IR-drop. Building on this foundation, we propose LHR and WDS, enabling extensive exploration of architecture-level IR-drop mitigation while maintaining computational accuracy through software optimization. Subsequently, we develop IR-Booster, a dynamic adjustment mechanism that integrates software-level HR information with hardware-based IR-drop monitoring to adapt the V-f pairs of the PIM macro, achieving enhanced energy efficiency and performance. Finally, we propose the HR-aware task mapping method, bridging software and hardware designs to achieve optimal improvement. Post-layout simulation results on a 7nm 256-TOPS PIM chip demonstrate that AIM achieves up to 69.2% IR-drop mitigation, resulting in 2.29x energy efficiency improvement and 1.152x speedup.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sa\'ul Alonso-Monsalve, Leigh H. Whitehead, Adam Aurisano, Lorena Escudero Sanchez</p>
<p>Abstract: The accurate delineation of tumours in radiological images like Computed Tomography is a very specialised and time-consuming task, and currently a bottleneck preventing quantitative analyses to be performed routinely in the clinical setting. For this reason, developing methods for the automated segmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has driven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the impracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed, usually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when applying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem, in this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages, voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks. This method allows segmentations to be performed with high-resolution inputs and a native 3D model architecture, obtaining state-of-the-art accuracies while significantly reducing the computational resources needed in terms of GPU memory and time. We studied the deployment of this methodology in the context of Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients from the KiTS23 challenge, and our method achieved results competitive with the challenge winners, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7% for tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone. Crucially, our method also offers significant computational improvements, achieving up to a 60% reduction in inference time and up to a 75\% reduction in VRAM usage compared to an equivalent dense architecture, across both CPU and various GPU cards tested.</p>

Benchmarks and leaderboards are increasingly popular, offering quantitative rankings of LLMs. However, they provide limited insight into the tasks that LLMs consistently fail to solve - information that is crucial for understanding current limitations and guiding the development of more capable models. To address this gap, we examined code generation tasks across four popular benchmarks, identifying those that major LLMs are most likely to fail. To understand the causes of these failures, we investigated whether the static complexity of solution code contributes to them, followed by a systematic inspection of 114 tasks that LLMs consistently struggled with. Our analysis revealed four recurring patterns of weaknesses in LLMs, as well as common complications within benchmark tasks that most often lead to failure.</p>

Current approaches model electricity prices without explicit causal interpretation or counterfactual reasoning capabilities. We introduce Augmented Time Series Causal Models (ATSCM) for energy markets, extending counterfactual reasoning frameworks to multivariate temporal data with learned causal structure. Our approach models energy systems through interpretable factors (weather, generation mix, demand patterns), rich grid dynamics, and observable market variables. We integrate neural causal discovery to learn time-varying causal graphs without requiring ground truth DAGs. Applied to real-world electricity price data, ATSCM enables novel counterfactual queries such as "What would prices be under different renewable generation scenarios?".</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara P\'erez-Vieites, Sahel Iqbal, Simo S\"arkk\"a, Dominik Baumann</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled framework for optimizing data collection, but existing approaches do not apply to crucial real-world settings such as dynamical systems with partial observability, where only noisy and incomplete observations are available. These systems are naturally modeled as state-space models (SSMs), where latent states mediate the link between parameters and data, making the likelihood -- and thus information-theoretic objectives like the expected information gain (EIG) -- intractable. In addition, the dynamical nature of the system requires online algorithms that update posterior distributions and select designs sequentially in a computationally efficient manner. We address these challenges by deriving new estimators of the EIG and its gradient that explicitly marginalize latent states, enabling scalable stochastic optimization in nonlinear SSMs. Our approach leverages nested particle filters (NPFs) for efficient online inference with convergence guarantees. Applications to realistic models, such as the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and a moving source location task, show that our framework successfully handles both partial observability and online computation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrik Val\'abek, Michaela Horv\'athov\'a, Martin Klau\v{c}o</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a deep Koopman-based Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) for efficient operation of a laboratory-scale pasteurization unit (PU). The method uses Koopman operator theory to transform the complex, nonlinear system dynamics into a linear representation, enabling the application of convex optimization while representing the complex PU accurately. The deep Koopman model utilizes neural networks to learn the linear dynamics from experimental data, achieving a 45% improvement in open-loop prediction accuracy over conventional N4SID subspace identification. Both analyzed models were employed in the EMPC formulation that includes interpretable economic costs, such as energy consumption, material losses due to inadequate pasteurization, and actuator wear. The feasibility of EMPC is ensured using slack variables. The deep Koopman EMPC and N4SID EMPC are numerically validated on a nonlinear model of multivariable PU under external disturbance. The disturbances include feed pump fail-to-close scenario and the introduction of a cold batch to be pastuerized. These results demonstrate that the deep Koopmand EMPC achieves a 32% reduction in total economic cost compared to the N4SID baseline. This improvement is mainly due to the reductions in material losses and energy consumption. Furthermore, the steady-state operation via Koopman-based EMPC requires 10.2% less electrical energy. The results highlight the practical advantages of integrating deep Koopman representations with economic optimization to achieve resource-efficient control of thermal-intensive plants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anisha Garg, Ganesh Venkatesh</p>
<p>Abstract: Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit, GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.
  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.
  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning. We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback - progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to denser, per-step supervision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrik Val\'abek, Marek Wadinger, Michal Kvasnica, Martin Klau\v{c}o</p>
<p>Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with input delays pose significant challenges for prediction, estimation, and control due to their inherent complexity and the impact of delays on system behavior. Traditional linear control techniques often fail in these contexts, necessitating innovative approaches. This paper introduces a novel approach to approximate the Koopman operator using an LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model, enabling linear representations of nonlinear systems with time delays. By incorporating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, the proposed framework captures historical dependencies and efficiently encodes time-delayed system dynamics into a latent space. Unlike traditional extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) approaches that rely on predefined dictionaries, the LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model is dictionary-free, which mitigates the problems with the underlying dynamics being known and incorporated into the dictionary. Quantitative comparisons with extended eDMD on a simulated system demonstrate highly significant performance gains in prediction accuracy in cases where the true nonlinear dynamics are unknown and achieve comparable results to eDMD with known dynamics of a system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Zhu, Jasper Hoffmann, Baohe Zhang, Joschka Boedecker</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of fitting a reinforcement learning (RL) model to some given behavioral data under a multi-armed bandit environment. These models have received much attention in recent years for characterizing human and animal decision making behavior. We provide a generic mathematical optimization problem formulation for the fitting problem of a wide range of RL models that appear frequently in scientific research applications, followed by a detailed theoretical analysis of its convexity properties. Based on the theoretical results, we introduce a novel solution method for the fitting problem of RL models based on convex relaxation and optimization. Our method is then evaluated in several simulated bandit environments to compare with some benchmark methods that appear in the literature. Numerical results indicate that our method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, while significantly reducing computation time. We also provide an open-source Python package for our proposed method to empower researchers to apply it in the analysis of their datasets directly, without prior knowledge of convex optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giorgio Palma, Andrea Serani, Matteo Diez</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we present and validate an ensemble-based Hankel Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (HDMDc) for uncertainty-aware seakeeping predictions of a high-speed catamaran, namely the Delft 372 model. Experimental measurements (time histories) of wave elevation at the longitudinal center of gravity, heave, pitch, notional flight-deck velocity, notional bridge acceleration, and total resistance were collected from irregular wave basin tests on a 1:33.3 scale replica of the Delft 372 model under sea state 5 conditions at Fr = 0.425, and organized into training, validation, and test sets. The HDMDc algorithm constructs an equation-free linear reduced-order model of the seakeeping vessel by augmenting states and inputs with their time-lagged copies to capture nonlinear and memory effects. Two ensembling strategies, namely Bayesian HDMDc (BHDMDc), which samples hyperparameters considered stochastic variables with prior distribution to produce posterior mean forecasts with confidence intervals, and Frequentist HDMDc (FHDMDc), which aggregates multiple model obtained over data subsets, are compared in providing seakeeping prediction and uncertainty quantification. The FHDMDc approach is found to improve the accuracy of the predictions compared to the deterministic counterpart, also providing robust uncertainty estimation; whereas the application of BHDMDc to the present test case is not found beneficial in comparison to the deterministic model. FHDMDc-derived probability density functions for the motions closely match both experimental data and URANS results, demonstrating reliable and computationally efficient seakeeping prediction for design and operational support.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study a model of subscription-based platforms where users pay a fixed fee for unlimited access to content, and creators receive a share of the revenue. Existing approaches to detecting fraud predominantly rely on machine learning methods, engaging in an ongoing arms race with bad actors. We explore revenue division mechanisms that inherently disincentivize manipulation. We formalize three types of manipulation-resistance axioms and examine which existing rules satisfy these. We show that a mechanism widely used by streaming platforms, not only fails to prevent fraud, but also makes detecting manipulation computationally intractable. We also introduce a novel rule, ScaledUserProp, that satisfies all three manipulation-resistance axioms. Finally, experiments with both real-world and synthetic streaming data support ScaledUserProp as a fairer alternative compared to existing rules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tsubasa Harada, Yasushi Kawase, Hanna Sumita</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the repeated optimal stopping problem, which generalizes the classical optimal stopping problem with an unknown distribution to a setting where the same problem is solved repeatedly over $T$ rounds. In this framework, we aim to design algorithms that guarantee a competitive ratio in each round while also achieving sublinear regret across all rounds.
  Our primary contribution is a general algorithmic framework that achieves these objectives simultaneously for a wide array of repeated optimal stopping problems. The core idea is to dynamically select an algorithm for each round, choosing between two candidates: (1) an empirically optimal algorithm derived from the history of observations, and (2) a sample-based algorithm with a proven competitive ratio guarantee. Based on this approach, we design an algorithm that performs no worse than the baseline sample-based algorithm in every round, while ensuring that the total regret is bounded by $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$.
  We demonstrate the broad applicability of our framework to canonical problems, including the prophet inequality, the secretary problem, and their variants under adversarial, random, and i.i.d. input models. For example, for the repeated prophet inequality problem, our method achieves a $1/2$-competitive ratio from the second round on and an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Furthermore, we establish a regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ even in the i.i.d. model, confirming that our algorithm's performance is almost optimal with respect to the number of rounds.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from 2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records) and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies. RUST-BENCH establishes a challenging new testbed for advancing tabular reasoning research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Functional brain graphs are often characterized with separate graph-theoretic or spectral descriptors, overlooking how these properties covary and partially overlap across brains and conditions. We anticipate that dense, weighted functional connectivity graphs occupy a low-dimensional latent geometry along which both topological and spectral structures display graded variations. Here, we estimated this unified graph representation and enabled generation of dense functional brain graphs through a graph transformer autoencoder with latent diffusion, with spectral geometry providing an inductive bias to guide learning. This geometry-aware latent representation, although unsupervised, meaningfully separated working-memory states and decoded visual stimuli, with performance further enhanced by incorporating neural dynamics. From the diffusion modeled distribution, we were able to sample biologically plausible and structurally grounded synthetic dense graphs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growth of cloud computing has revolutionized data processing and storage capacities to another levels of scalability and flexibility. But in the process, it has created a huge challenge of security, especially in terms of safeguarding sensitive data. Classical security practices, including encryption at rest and during transit, fail to protect data in use and expose it to various possible breaches. In response to this problem , Confidential Computing has been a tool ,seeking to secure data in processing by usage of hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). TEEs, including Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and ARM's TrustZone, offers protected contexts within the processor, where data is kept confidential ,intact and secure , even with malicious software or compromised operating systems. In this research, we have explored the architecture and security features of TEEs like Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone, and their effectiveness in improving cloud data security. From a thorough literature survey ,we have analyzed the deployment strategies, performance indicators, and practical uses of these TEEs for the same purpose. In addition, we have discussed the issues regarding deployment, possible weaknesses, scalability issues, and integration issues. Our results focuses on the central position of TEEs in strengthening and advancing cloud security infrastructures, pointing towards their ability to create a secure foundation for Confidential Computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoh-ichi Mototake, Makoto Sasaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) integrates partial differential equations (PDEs) into machine learning models to solve inverse problems, such as estimating coefficient functions (e.g., the Hamiltonian function) that characterize physical systems. This framework enables data-driven understanding and prediction of complex physical phenomena. While coefficient functions in PIML are typically estimated on the basis of predictive performance, physics as a discipline does not rely solely on prediction accuracy to evaluate models. For example, Kepler's heliocentric model was favored owing to small discrepancies in planetary motion, despite its similar predictive accuracy to the geocentric model. This highlights the inherent uncertainties in data-driven model inference and the scientific importance of selecting physically meaningful solutions. In this paper, we propose a framework to quantify and analyze such uncertainties in the estimation of coefficient functions in PIML. We apply our framework to reduced model of magnetohydrodynamics and our framework shows that there are uncertainties, and unique identification is possible with geometric constraints. Finally, we confirm that we can estimate the reduced model uniquely by incorporating these constraints.</p>

<p>Abstract: Constructing reduced models for turbulent transport is essential for accelerating profile predictions and enabling many-query tasks such as uncertainty quantification, parameter scans, and design optimization. This paper presents machine-learning-driven reduced models for Electron Temperature Gradient (ETG) turbulence in the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator. Each model predicts the ETG heat flux as a function of three plasma parameters: the normalized electron temperature radial gradient ($\omega_{T_e}$), the ratio of normalized electron temperature and density radial gradients ($\eta_e$), and the electron-to-ion temperature ratio ($\tau$). We first construct models across seven radial locations using regression and an active machine-learning-based procedure. This process initializes models using low-cardinality sparse-grid training data and then iteratively refines their training sets by selecting the most informative points from a pre-existing simulation database. We evaluate the prediction capabilities of our models using out-of-sample datasets with over $393$ points per location, and $95\%$ prediction intervals are estimated via bootstrapping to assess prediction uncertainty. We then investigate the construction of generalized reduced models, including a generic, position-independent model, and assess their heat flux prediction capabilities at three additional locations. Our models demonstrate robust performance and predictive accuracy comparable to the original reference simulations, even when applied beyond the training domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masahiro Kato</p>
<p>Abstract: Riesz regression has garnered attention as a tool in debiased machine learning for causal and structural parameter estimation (Chernozhukov et al., 2021). This study shows that Riesz regression is closely related to direct density-ratio estimation (DRE) in important cases, including average treat- ment effect (ATE) estimation. Specifically, the idea and objective in Riesz regression coincide with the one in least-squares importance fitting (LSIF, Kanamori et al., 2009) in direct density-ratio estimation. While Riesz regression is general in the sense that it can be applied to Riesz representer estimation in a wide class of problems, the equivalence with DRE allows us to directly import exist- ing results in specific cases, including convergence-rate analyses, the selection of loss functions via Bregman-divergence minimization, and regularization techniques for flexible models, such as neural networks. Conversely, insights about the Riesz representer in debiased machine learning broaden the applications of direct density-ratio estimation methods. This paper consolidates our prior results in Kato (2025a) and Kato (2025b).</p>

<p>Abstract: PDEs arise ubiquitously in science and engineering, where solutions depend on parameters (physical properties, boundary conditions, geometry). Traditional numerical methods require re-solving the PDE for each parameter, making parameter space exploration prohibitively expensive. Recent machine learning advances, particularly physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators, have revolutionized parametric PDE solving by learning solution operators that generalize across parameter spaces. We critically analyze two main paradigms: (1) PINNs, which embed physical laws as soft constraints and excel at inverse problems with sparse data, and (2) neural operators (e.g., DeepONet, Fourier Neural Operator), which learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces and achieve unprecedented generalization. Through comparisons across fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetics, we show neural operators can achieve computational speedups of $10^3$ to $10^5$ times faster than traditional solvers for multi-query scenarios, while maintaining comparable accuracy. We provide practical guidance for method selection, discuss theoretical foundations (universal approximation, convergence), and identify critical open challenges: high-dimensional parameters, complex geometries, and out-of-distribution generalization. This work establishes a unified framework for understanding parametric PDE solvers via operator learning, offering a comprehensive, incrementally updated resource for this rapidly evolving field</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the current capabilities and risks of AI Scientist systems is essential for ensuring trustworthy and sustainable AI-driven scientific progress while preserving the integrity of the academic ecosystem. To this end, we develop Jr. AI Scientist, a state-of-the-art autonomous AI scientist system that mimics the core research workflow of a novice student researcher: Given the baseline paper from the human mentor, it analyzes its limitations, formulates novel hypotheses for improvement, validates them through rigorous experimentation, and writes a paper with the results. Unlike previous approaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI Scientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding agents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically valuable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments using AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science, a venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings demonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review scores than existing fully automated systems. Nevertheless, we identify important limitations from both the author evaluation and the Agents4Science reviews, indicating the potential risks of directly applying current AI Scientist systems and key challenges for future research. Finally, we comprehensively report various risks identified during development. We hope these insights will deepen understanding of current progress and risks in AI Scientist development.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents evomap, a Python package for dynamic mapping. Mapping methods are widely used across disciplines to visualize relationships among objects as spatial representations, or maps. However, most existing statistical software supports only static mapping, which captures objects' relationships at a single point in time and lacks tools to analyze how these relationships evolve. evomap fills this gap by implementing the dynamic mapping framework EvoMap, originally proposed by Matthe, Ringel, and Skiera (2023), which adapts traditional static mapping methods for dynamic analyses. The package supports multiple mapping techniques, including variants of Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), Sammon Mapping, and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). It also includes utilities for data preprocessing, exploration, and result evaluation, offering a comprehensive toolkit for dynamic mapping applications. This paper outlines the foundations of static and dynamic mapping, describes the architecture and functionality of evomap, and illustrates its application through an extensive usage example.</p>

<p>Abstract: The application of causal discovery to diseases like Alzheimer's (AD) is limited by the static graph assumptions of most methods; such models cannot account for an evolving pathophysiology, modulated by a latent disease pseudotime. We propose to apply an existing latent variable model to real-world AD data, inferring a pseudotime that orders patients along a data-driven disease trajectory independent of chronological age, then learning how causal relationships evolve. Pseudotime outperformed age in predicting diagnosis (AUC 0.82 vs 0.59). Incorporating minimal, disease-agnostic background knowledge substantially improved graph accuracy and orientation. Our framework reveals dynamic interactions between novel (NfL, GFAP) and established AD markers, enabling practical causal discovery despite violated assumptions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Adam optimizer is currently presumably the most popular optimization method in deep learning. In this article we develop an ODE based method to study the Adam optimizer in a fast-slow scaling regime. For fixed momentum parameters and vanishing step-sizes, we show that the Adam algorithm is an asymptotic pseudo-trajectory of the flow of a particular vector field, which is referred to as the Adam vector field. Leveraging properties of asymptotic pseudo-trajectories, we establish convergence results for the Adam algorithm. In particular, in a very general setting we show that if the Adam algorithm converges, then the limit must be a zero of the Adam vector field, rather than a local minimizer or critical point of the objective function.
  In contrast, in the overparametrized empirical risk minimization setting, the Adam algorithm is able to locally find the set of minima. Specifically, we show that in a neighborhood of the global minima, the objective function serves as a Lyapunov function for the flow induced by the Adam vector field. As a consequence, if the Adam algorithm enters a neighborhood of the global minima infinitely often, it converges to the set of global minima.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Narjes Nourzad, Hanqing Yang, Shiyu Chen, Carlee Joe-Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act. By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient collaboration strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaifeng Zhang, Shuo Sha, Hanxiao Jiang, Matthew Loper, Hyunjong Song, Guangyan Cai, Zhuo Xu, Xiaochen Hu, Changxi Zheng, Yunzhu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies are advancing rapidly, but their direct evaluation in the real world remains costly, time-consuming, and difficult to reproduce, particularly for tasks involving deformable objects. Simulation provides a scalable and systematic alternative, yet existing simulators often fail to capture the coupled visual and physical complexity of soft-body interactions. We present a real-to-sim policy evaluation framework that constructs soft-body digital twins from real-world videos and renders robots, objects, and environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian Splatting. We validate our approach on representative deformable manipulation tasks, including plush toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing, demonstrating that simulated rollouts correlate strongly with real-world execution performance and reveal key behavioral patterns of learned policies. Our results suggest that combining physics-informed reconstruction with high-quality rendering enables reproducible, scalable, and accurate evaluation of robotic manipulation policies.

<p>Abstract: Data-driven approaches using deep learning are emerging as powerful techniques to extract non-Gaussian information from cosmological large-scale structure. This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI) pipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for a forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model based on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one million self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level. Leveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural networks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn low-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with target parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation of the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter space spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias parameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear bias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference pipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic contaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs. Our forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter constraints, achieving $2-3\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\Omega_m - S_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and effectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These results demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for upcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Resnick, Yuqing Kong, Grant Schoenebeck, Tim Weninger</p>
<p>Abstract: In many decision settings, the definitive ground truth is either non-existent or inaccessible. We introduce a framework for evaluating classifiers based solely on human judgments. In such cases, it is helpful to compare automated classifiers to human judgment. We quantify a classifier's performance by its rater equivalence: the smallest number of human raters whose combined judgment matches the classifier's performance. Our framework uses human-generated labels both to construct benchmark panels and to evaluate performance. We distinguish between two models of utility: one based on agreement with the assumed but inaccessible ground truth, and one based on matching individual human judgments. Using case studies and formal analysis, we demonstrate how this framework can inform the evaluation and deployment of AI systems in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubhajit Roy, Shrutimoy Das, Binita Maity, Anant Kumar, Anirban Dasgupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Subgraph counting is a fundamental task for analyzing structural patterns in graph-structured data, with important applications in domains such as computational biology and social network analysis, where recurring motifs reveal functional and organizational properties. In this paper, we propose localized versions of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithms to improve both expressivity and computational efficiency for this task. We introduce Local $k$-WL, which we prove to be more expressive than $k$-WL and at most as expressive as $(k+1)$-WL, and provide a characterization of patterns whose subgraph and induced subgraph counts are invariant under Local $k$-WL equivalence. To enhance scalability, we present two variants -- Layer $k$-WL and Recursive $k$-WL -- that achieve greater time and space efficiency compared to applying $k$-WL on the entire graph. Additionally, we propose a novel fragmentation technique that decomposes complex subgraphs into simpler subpatterns, enabling the exact count of all induced subgraphs of size at most $4$ using only $1$-WL, with extensions possible for larger patterns when $k>1$. Building on these ideas, we develop a three-stage differentiable learning framework that combines subpattern counts to compute counts of more complex motifs, bridging combinatorial algorithm design with machine learning approaches. We also compare the expressive power of Local $k$-WL with existing GNN hierarchies and demonstrate that, under bounded time complexity, our methods are more expressive than prior approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shao-Qun Zhang, Zong-Yi Chen, Yong-Ming Tian, Xun Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Past decades have witnessed a great interest in the distinction and connection between neural network learning and kernel learning. Recent advancements have made theoretical progress in connecting infinite-wide neural networks and Gaussian processes. Two predominant approaches have emerged: the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) and the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). The former, rooted in Bayesian inference, represents a zero-order kernel, while the latter, grounded in the tangent space of gradient descents, is a first-order kernel. In this paper, we present the Unified Neural Kernel (UNK), which {is induced by the inner product of produced variables and characterizes the learning dynamics of neural networks with gradient descents and parameter initialization.} The proposed UNK kernel maintains the limiting properties of both NNGP and NTK, exhibiting behaviors akin to NTK with a finite learning step and converging to NNGP as the learning step approaches infinity. Besides, we also theoretically characterize the uniform tightness and learning convergence of the UNK kernel, providing comprehensive insights into this unified kernel. Experimental results underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuansan Liu, Sudanthi Wijewickrema, Dongting Hu, Christofer Bester, Stephen O'Leary, James Bailey</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent innovations in diffusion probabilistic models have paved the way for significant progress in image, text and audio generation, leading to their applications in generative time series forecasting. However, leveraging such abilities to model highly stochastic time series data remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel Stochastic Diffusion (StochDiff) model which learns data-driven prior knowledge at each time step by utilizing the representational power of the stochastic latent spaces to model the variability of the multivariate time series data. The learnt prior knowledge helps the model to capture complex temporal dynamics and the inherent uncertainty of the data. This improves its ability to model highly stochastic time series data. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model on stochastic time series forecasting. Additionally, we showcase an application of our model for real-world surgical guidance, highlighting its potential to benefit the medical community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufei He, Zhenyu Hou, Yukuo Cen, Jun Hu, Feng He, Xu Cheng, Jie Tang, Bryan Hooi</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph pre-training has been concentrated on graph-level tasks involving small graphs (e.g., molecular graphs) or learning node representations on a fixed graph. Extending graph pre-trained models to web-scale graphs with billions of nodes in industrial scenarios, while avoiding negative transfer across graphs or tasks, remains a challenge. We aim to develop a general graph pre-trained model with inductive ability that can make predictions for unseen new nodes and even new graphs. In this work, we introduce a scalable transformer-based graph pre-training framework called PGT (Pre-trained Graph Transformer). Based on the masked autoencoder architecture, we design two pre-training tasks: one for reconstructing node features and the other for reconstructing local structures. Unlike the original autoencoder architecture where the pre-trained decoder is discarded, we propose a novel strategy that utilizes the decoder for feature augmentation. Our framework, tested on the publicly available ogbn-papers100M dataset with 111 million nodes and 1.6 billion edges, achieves state-of-the-art performance, showcasing scalability and efficiency. We have deployed our framework on Tencent's online game data, confirming its capability to pre-train on real-world graphs with over 540 million nodes and 12 billion edges and to generalize effectively across diverse static and dynamic downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessio Mora, Lorenzo Valerio, Paolo Bellavista, Andrea Passarella</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) systems enable the collaborative training of machine learning models without requiring centralized collection of individual data. FL participants should have the ability to exercise their right to be forgotten, ensuring their past contributions can be removed from the learned model upon request. In this paper, we propose FedQUIT, a novel algorithm that uses knowledge distillation to scrub the contribution of the data to forget from an FL global model while preserving its generalization ability. FedQUIT directly works on client devices that request to leave the federation, and leverages a teacher-student framework. The FL global model acts as the teacher, and the local model works as the student. To induce forgetting, FedQUIT tailors the teacher's output on local data (the data to forget) penalizing the prediction score of the true class. Unlike previous work, our method does not require hardly viable assumptions for cross-device settings, such as storing historical updates of participants or requiring access to proxy datasets. Experimental results on various datasets and model architectures demonstrate that (i) FedQUIT outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in forgetting data, (ii) has the exact computational requirements as a regular FedAvg round, and (iii) reduces the cumulative communication costs by up to 117.6$\times$ compared to retraining from scratch to restore the initial generalization performance after unlearning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sergei Kholkin, Grigoriy Ksenofontov, David Li, Nikita Kornilov, Nikita Gushchin, Alexandra Suvorikova, Alexey Kroshnin, Evgeny Burnaev, Alexander Korotin</p>
<p>Abstract: The Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure, which iteratively projects onto the space of Markov processes and the reciprocal class, successfully solves the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem. However, an efficient practical implementation requires a heuristic modification -- alternating between fitting forward and backward time diffusion at each iteration. This modification is crucial for stabilizing training and achieving reliable results in applications such as unpaired domain translation. Our work reveals a close connection between the modified version of IMF and the Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure -- a foundational method for the SB problem, also known as Sinkhorn's algorithm. Specifically, we demonstrate that the heuristic modification of the IMF effectively integrates both IMF and IPF procedures. We refer to this combined approach as the Iterative Proportional Markovian Fitting (IPMF) procedure. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we establish the convergence of the IPMF procedure under various settings, contributing to developing a unified framework for solving SB problems. Moreover, from a practical standpoint, the IPMF procedure enables a flexible trade-off between image similarity and generation quality, offering a new mechanism for tailoring models to specific tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Staats, Matthias Thamm, Bernd Rosenow</p>
<p>Abstract: This work analyzes singular-value spectra of weight matrices in pretrained transformer models to understand how information is stored at both ends of the spectrum. Using Random Matrix Theory (RMT) as a zero information hypothesis, we associate agreement with RMT as evidence of randomness and deviations as evidence for learning. Surprisingly, we observe pronounced departures from RMT not only among the largest singular values -- the usual outliers -- but also among the smallest ones. A comparison of the associated singular vectors with the eigenvectors of the activation covariance matrices shows that there is considerable overlap wherever RMT is violated. Thus, significant directions in the data are captured by small singular values and their vectors as well as by the large ones. We confirm this empirically: zeroing out the singular values that deviate from RMT raises language-model perplexity far more than removing values from the bulk, and after fine-tuning the smallest decile can be the third most influential part of the spectrum. To explain how vectors linked to small singular values can carry more information than those linked to larger values, we propose a linear random-matrix model. Our findings highlight the overlooked importance of the low end of the spectrum and provide theoretical and practical guidance for SVD-based pruning and compression of large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nithin Somasekharan, Shaowu Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyue H. Zhang, Lucas Maes, Alan Milligan, Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau, Ioannis Mitliagkas, Damien Scieur, Simon Lacoste-Julien, Charles Guille-Escuret</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite its widespread adoption, Adam's advantage over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) lacks a comprehensive theoretical explanation. This paper investigates Adam's sensitivity to rotations of the parameter space. We observe that Adam's performance in training transformers degrades under random rotations of the parameter space, indicating a crucial sensitivity to the choice of basis in practice. This reveals that conventional rotation-invariant assumptions are insufficient to capture Adam's advantages theoretically. To better understand the rotation-dependent properties that benefit Adam, we also identify structured rotations that preserve or even enhance its empirical performance. We then examine the rotation-dependent assumptions in the literature and find that they fall short in explaining Adam's behaviour across various rotation types. In contrast, we verify the orthogonality of the update as a promising indicator of Adam's basis sensitivity, suggesting it may be the key quantity for developing rotation-dependent theoretical frameworks that better explain its empirical success.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenda Li, Huijie Zhang, Qing Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of AI-generated content from diffusion models has raised significant concerns regarding misinformation and copyright infringement. Watermarking is a crucial technique for identifying these AI-generated images and preventing their misuse. In this paper, we introduce Shallow Diffuse, a new watermarking technique that embeds robust and invisible watermarks into diffusion model outputs. Unlike existing approaches that integrate watermarking throughout the entire diffusion sampling process, Shallow Diffuse decouples these steps by leveraging the presence of a low-dimensional subspace in the image generation process. This method ensures that a substantial portion of the watermark lies in the null space of this subspace, effectively separating it from the image generation process. Our theoretical and empirical analyses show that this decoupling strategy greatly enhances the consistency of data generation and the detectability of the watermark. Extensive experiments further validate that our Shallow Diffuse outperforms existing watermarking methods in terms of robustness and consistency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdulkadir Gokce, Martin Schrimpf</p>
<p>Abstract: When trained on large-scale object classification datasets, certain artificial neural network models begin to approximate core object recognition behaviors and neural response patterns in the primate brain. While recent machine learning advances suggest that scaling compute, model size, and dataset size improves task performance, the impact of scaling on brain alignment remains unclear. In this study, we explore scaling laws for modeling the primate visual ventral stream by systematically evaluating over 600 models trained under controlled conditions on benchmarks spanning V1, V2, V4, IT and behavior. We find that while behavioral alignment continues to scale with larger models, neural alignment saturates. This observation remains true across model architectures and training datasets, even though models with stronger inductive biases and datasets with higher-quality images are more compute-efficient. Increased scaling is especially beneficial for higher-level visual areas, where small models trained on few samples exhibit only poor alignment. Our results suggest that while scaling current architectures and datasets might suffice for alignment with human core object recognition behavior, it will not yield improved models of the brain's visual ventral stream, highlighting the need for novel strategies in building brain models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aixa X. Andrade, Son Nguyen, Austin Marckx, Albert Montillo</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing enables high-resolution analysis of cellular heterogeneity, yet disentangling biological signal from batch effects remains a major challenge. Existing batch-correction algorithms suppress or discard batch-related variation rather than modeling it. We propose scMEDAL, single-cell Mixed Effects Deep Autoencoder Learning, a framework that separately models batch-invariant and batch-specific effects using two complementary subnetworks. The principal innovation, scMEDAL-RE, is a random-effects Bayesian autoencoder that learns batch-specific representations while preserving biologically meaningful information confounded with batch effects signal often lost under standard correction. Complementing it, the fixed-effects subnetwork, scMEDAL-FE, trained via adversarial learning provides a default batch-correction component. Evaluations across diverse conditions (autism, leukemia, cardiovascular), cell types, and technical and biological effects show that scMEDAL-RE produces interpretable, batch-specific embeddings that complement both scMEDAL-FE and established correction methods (scVI, Scanorama, Harmony, SAUCIE), yielding more accurate prediction of disease status, donor group, and tissue. scMEDAL also provides generative visualizations, including counterfactual reconstructions of a cell's expression as if acquired in another batch. The framework allows substitution of the fixed-effects component with other correction methods, while retaining scMEDAL-RE's enhanced predictive power and visualization. Overall, scMEDAL is a versatile, interpretable framework that complements existing correction, providing enhanced insight into cellular heterogeneity and data acquisition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yachao Yuan, Yu Huang, Yingwen Wu, Jin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised Learning plays a crucial role in network anomaly detection applications, however, learning anomaly patterns with limited labeled samples is not easy. Additionally, the lack of interpretability creates key barriers to the adoption of semi-supervised frameworks in practice. Most existing interpretation methods are developed for supervised/unsupervised frameworks or non-security domains and fail to provide reliable interpretations. In this paper, we propose AnomalyAID, a general framework aiming to (1) make the anomaly detection process interpretable and improve the reliability of interpretation results, and (2) assign high-confidence pseudo labels to unlabeled samples for improving the performance of anomaly detection systems with limited supervised data. For (1), we propose a novel interpretation approach that leverages global and local interpreters to provide reliable explanations, while for (2), we design a new two-stage semi-supervised learning framework for network anomaly detection by aligning both stages' model predictions with special constraints. We apply AnomalyAID over two representative network anomaly detection tasks and extensively evaluate AnomalyAID with representative prior works. Experimental results demonstrate that AnomalyAID can provide accurate detection results with reliable interpretations for semi-supervised network anomaly detection systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Advik Raj Basani, Xiao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs have shown impressive capabilities across various natural language processing tasks, yet remain vulnerable to input prompts, known as jailbreak attacks, carefully designed to bypass safety guardrails and elicit harmful responses. Traditional methods rely on manual heuristics but suffer from limited generalizability. Despite being automatic, optimization-based attacks often produce unnatural prompts that can be easily detected by safety filters or require high computational costs due to discrete token optimization. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Suffix Prompter (GASP), a novel automated framework that can efficiently generate human-readable jailbreak prompts in a fully black-box setting. In particular, GASP leverages latent Bayesian optimization to craft adversarial suffixes by efficiently exploring continuous latent embedding spaces, gradually optimizing the suffix prompter to improve attack efficacy while balancing prompt coherence via a targeted iterative refinement procedure. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that GASP can produce natural adversarial prompts, significantly improving jailbreak success over baselines, reducing training times, and accelerating inference speed, thus making it an efficient and scalable solution for red-teaming LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyao Wang, Bowei Tian, Yexiao He, Zheyu Shen, Guoheng Sun, Yuhan Liu, Luyang Liu, Meng Liu, Ang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent advancement of foundation models (FMs) has increased the demand for fine-tuning these models on large-scale cross-domain datasets. To address this, federated fine-tuning has emerged, allowing FMs to be fine-tuned on distributed datasets across multiple devices while ensuring data privacy. However, the substantial parameter size and the multi-round communication in federated learning algorithms result in prohibitively high communication costs, challenging the practicality of federated fine-tuning. In this paper, we identify and analyze, both theoretically and empirically, that the traditional multi-round aggregation algorithms may not be necessary for federated fine-tuning large FMs. Our experiments reveal that a single round of aggregation (i.e., one-shot federated fine-tuning) yields a global model performance comparable to that achieved through multiple rounds of aggregation. Through rigorous mathematical and empirical analyses, we demonstrate that large FMs, due to their extensive parameter sizes and pre-training on general tasks, achieve significantly lower training loss in one-shot federated fine-tuning compared to smaller models. Our extensive experiments show that one-shot federated fine-tuning significantly reduces communication costs. It also has the potential to enable asynchronous aggregation, enhances privacy, and maintains performance consistency with multi-round federated fine-tuning on both text generation and text-to-image generation tasks. Our findings provide insights to revolutionize federated fine-tuning in practice, enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and expanding accessibility for FMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matias D. Cattaneo, Boris Shigida</p>
<p>Abstract: In modern optimization methods used in deep learning, each update depends on the history of previous iterations, often referred to as memory, and this dependence decays fast as the iterates go further into the past. For example, gradient descent with momentum has exponentially decaying memory through exponentially averaged past gradients. We introduce a general technique for identifying a memoryless algorithm that approximates an optimization algorithm with memory. It is obtained by replacing all past iterates in the update by the current one, and then adding a correction term arising from memory (also a function of the current iterate). This correction term can be interpreted as a perturbation of the loss, and the nature of this perturbation can inform how memory implicitly (anti-)regularizes the optimization dynamics. As an application of our theory, we find that Lion does not have the kind of implicit anti-regularization induced by memory that AdamW does, providing a theory-based explanation for Lion's better generalization performance recently documented.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Merrill, Ashish Sabharwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent theoretical results show transformers cannot express sequential reasoning problems over long inputs, intuitively because their computational depth is bounded. However, prior work treats the depth as a constant, leaving it unclear to what degree bounded depth may suffice for solving problems over short inputs, or how increasing the transformer's depth affects its expressive power. We address these questions by analyzing transformers whose depth can grow minimally with context length $n$. We show even highly uniform transformers with depth $\Theta(\log n)$ can express two important problems: recognizing regular languages, which captures state tracking abilities and was known to be expressible only by an unconventional, non-uniform model of transformers, and graph connectivity, which underlies multi-step reasoning. Notably, both of these problems cannot be expressed by fixed-depth transformers under standard complexity conjectures, demonstrating the expressivity benefit of growing depth. Moreover, our theory quantitatively predicts how depth must grow with input length to express these problems, showing that depth scaling is more efficient than scaling width or chain-of-thought steps. Empirically, our detailed experiments designed to bridge the expressivity vs. learnability gap reveal that our theoretical depth requirements for regular language recognition closely match the practical depth requirements for successfully training transformers. Thus, our results clarify how depth affects a transformer's reasoning capabilities, and provide practical guidance for effective depth selection for sequential reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hung-Yueh Chiang, Chi-Chih Chang, Natalia Frumkin, Kai-Chiang Wu, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah, Diana Marculescu</p>
<p>Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) are emerging as a compelling alternative to Transformers because of their consistent memory usage and high performance. Despite this, scaling up SSMs on cloud services or limited-resource devices is challenging due to their storage requirements and computational power. To overcome this, quantizing SSMs with low bit-width data formats can reduce model size and benefit from hardware acceleration. As SSMs are prone to quantization-induced errors, recent efforts have focused on optimizing a particular model or bit-width for efficiency without sacrificing performance. However, distinct bit-width configurations are essential for different scenarios, like W4A8 for boosting large-batch decoding speed, and W4A16 for enhancing generation speed in short prompt applications for a single user. To this end, we present Quamba2, compatible with W8A8, W4A8, and W4A16 for both Mamba1 and Mamba2 backbones, addressing the growing demand for SSM deployment on various platforms. Based on the channel order preserving and activation persistence of SSMs, we propose an offline approach to quantize inputs of a linear recurrence in 8-bit by sorting and clustering for input $x$, combined with a per-state-group quantization for input-dependent parameters $B$ and $C$. To ensure compute-invariance in the SSM output, we rearrange weights offline according to the clustering sequence. The experiments show that Quamba2-8B outperforms two state-of-the-art SSM quantization methods and delivers 1.3$\times$ and 3$\times$ speed-ups in the pre-filling and generation stages, respectively, while offering 4$\times$ memory reduction with only a $1.6\%$ average accuracy drop. The evaluation on MMLU shows the generalizability and robustness of our framework. The code and quantized models will be released at: https://github.com/enyac-group/Quamba.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simone Piaggesi, Riccardo Guidotti, Fosca Giannotti, Dino Pedreschi</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-hoc explainability is essential for understanding black-box machine learning models. Surrogate-based techniques are widely used for local and global model-agnostic explanations but have significant limitations. Local surrogates capture non-linearities but are computationally expensive and sensitive to parameters, while global surrogates are more efficient but struggle with complex local behaviors. In this paper, we present ILLUME, a flexible and interpretable framework grounded in representation learning, that can be integrated with various surrogate models to provide explanations for any black-box classifier. Specifically, our approach combines a globally trained surrogate with instance-specific linear transformations learned with a meta-encoder to generate both local and global explanations. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ILLUME in producing feature attributions and decision rules that are not only accurate but also robust and faithful to the black-box, thus providing a unified explanation framework that effectively addresses the limitations of traditional surrogate methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steven Song, Morgan Borjigin-Wang, Irene Madejski, Robert L. Grossman</p>
<p>Abstract: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has enabled novel discoveries and served as a large-scale reference dataset in cancer through its harmonized genomics, clinical, and imaging data. Numerous prior studies have developed bespoke deep learning models over TCGA for tasks such as cancer survival prediction. A modern paradigm in biomedical deep learning is the development of foundation models (FMs) to derive feature embeddings agnostic to a specific modeling task. Biomedical text especially has seen growing development of FMs. While TCGA contains free-text data as pathology reports, these have been historically underutilized. Here, we investigate the ability to train classical machine learning models over multimodal, zero-shot FM embeddings of cancer data. We demonstrate the ease and additive effect of multimodal fusion, outperforming unimodal models. Further, we show the benefit of including pathology report text and rigorously evaluate the effect of model-based text summarization and hallucination. Overall, we propose an embedding-centric approach to multimodal cancer modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoav Ger, Omri Barak</p>
<p>Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on neuroscience-inspired tasks offer powerful models of brain computation. However, typical training paradigms rely on open-loop, supervised settings, whereas real-world learning unfolds in closed-loop environments. Here, we develop a mathematical theory describing the learning dynamics of linear RNNs trained in closed-loop contexts. We first demonstrate that two otherwise identical RNNs, trained in either closed- or open-loop modes, follow markedly different learning trajectories. To probe this divergence, we analytically characterize the closed-loop case, revealing distinct stages aligned with the evolution of the training loss. Specifically, we show that the learning dynamics of closed-loop RNNs, in contrast to open-loop ones, are governed by an interplay between two competing objectives: short-term policy improvement and long-term stability of the agent-environment interaction. Finally, we apply our framework to a realistic motor control task, highlighting its broader applicability. Taken together, our results underscore the importance of modeling closed-loop dynamics in a biologically plausible setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper examines the performance of ridge regression in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces in the presence of noise that exhibits a finite number of higher moments. We establish excess risk bounds consisting of subgaussian and polynomial terms based on the well known integral operator framework. The dominant subgaussian component allows to achieve convergence rates that have previously only been derived under subexponential noise - a prevalent assumption in related work from the last two decades. These rates are optimal under standard eigenvalue decay conditions, demonstrating the asymptotic robustness of regularized least squares against heavy-tailed noise.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17760">But what is your honest answer? Aiding LLM-judges with honest alternatives using steering vectors</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Leon Eshuijs, Archie Chaudhury, Alan McBeth, Ethan Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting subtle forms of dishonesty like sycophancy and manipulation in Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging for both humans and automated evaluators, as these behaviors often appear through small biases rather than clear false statements. We introduce Judge Using Safety-Steered Alternatives (JUSSA), a novel framework that employs steering vectors not to improve model behavior directly, but to enhance LLM judges' evaluation capabilities. JUSSA applies steering vectors during inference to generate more honest alternatives, providing judges with contrastive examples that make subtle dishonest patterns easier to detect. While existing evaluation methods rely on black-box evaluation, JUSSA leverages model internals to create targeted comparisons from single examples. We evaluate our method on sycophancy detection and introduce a new manipulation dataset covering multiple types of manipulation. Our results demonstrate that JUSSA effectively improves detection accuracy over single-response evaluation in various cases. Analysis across judge models reveals that JUSSA helps weaker judges on easier dishonesty detection tasks, and stronger judges on harder tasks. Layer-wise experiments show how dishonest prompts cause representations to diverge from honest ones in middle layers, revealing where steering interventions are most effective for generating contrastive examples. By demonstrating that steering vectors can enhance safety evaluation rather than just modify behavior, our work opens new directions for scalable model auditing as systems become increasingly sophisticated.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18948">Exact Expressive Power of Transformers with Padding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> William Merrill, Ashish Sabharwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain of thought is a natural inference-time method for increasing the computational power of transformer-based large language models (LLMs), but comes at the cost of sequential decoding. Are there more efficient alternatives to expand a transformer's expressive power without adding parameters? We consider transformers with padding tokens as a form of parallelizable test-time compute. We show that averaging-hard-attention, masked-pre-norm transformers with polynomial padding recognize precisely the class $\mathsf{FO}$-uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ of extremely parallelizable problems. While the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ upper bound was known, proving a matching lower bound had been elusive. Further, our novel analysis reveals the precise expanded power of padded transformers when coupled with another form of inference-time compute, namely dynamically increasing depth via looping. Our core technical contribution is to show how padding helps bring the notions of complete problems and reductions, which have been a cornerstone of classical complexity theory, to the formal study of transformers. Armed with this new tool, we prove that padded transformers with $O(\log^d n)$ looping on inputs of length $n$ recognize exactly the class $\mathsf{FO}$-uniform $\mathsf{TC}^d$ of moderately parallelizable problems. Thus, padding and looping together systematically expand transformers' expressive power: with polylogarithmic looping, polynomially padded transformers recognize precisely the class $\mathsf{FO}$-uniform $\mathsf{NC}$, the best that could be expected without losing parallelism (unless $\mathsf{NC} = \mathsf{P}$). Our results thus motivate further exploration of padding and looping as parallelizable alternatives to chain of thought for test-time compute.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minkyu Kim, Kiyoung Seong, Dongyeop Woo, Sungsoo Ahn, Minsu Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the challenge of training diffusion models to sample from unnormalized energy distributions in the absence of data, the so-called diffusion samplers. Although these approaches have shown promise, they struggle to scale in more demanding scenarios where energy evaluations are expensive and the sampling space is high-dimensional. To address this limitation, we propose a scalable and sample-efficient framework that properly harmonizes the powerful classical sampling method and the diffusion sampler. Specifically, we utilize Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) samplers with a novelty-based auxiliary energy as a Searcher to collect off-policy samples, using an auxiliary energy function to compensate for exploring modes the diffusion sampler rarely visits. These off-policy samples are then combined with on-policy data to train the diffusion sampler, thereby expanding its coverage of the energy landscape. Furthermore, we identify primacy bias, i.e., the preference of samplers for early experience during training, as the main cause of mode collapse during training, and introduce a periodic re-initialization trick to resolve this issue. Our method significantly improves sample efficiency on standard benchmarks for diffusion samplers and also excels at higher-dimensional problems and real-world molecular conformer generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghyeon Joo, Helya Hosseini, Ramyad Hadidi, Bahar Asgari</p>
<p>Abstract: We demonstrate that unstructured sparsity significantly improves KV cache compression for LLMs, enabling sparsity levels up to 70% without compromising accuracy or requiring fine-tuning. We conduct a systematic exploration of pruning strategies and find per-token magnitude-based pruning as highly effective for both Key and Value caches under unstructured sparsity, surpassing prior structured pruning schemes. The Key cache benefits from prominent outlier elements, while the Value cache surprisingly benefits from a simple magnitude-based pruning despite its uniform distribution. KV cache size is the major bottleneck in decode performance due to high memory overhead for large context lengths. To address this, we use a bitmap-based sparse format and a custom attention kernel capable of compressing and directly computing over compressed caches pruned to arbitrary sparsity patterns, significantly accelerating memory-bound operations in decode computations and thereby compensating for the overhead of runtime pruning and compression. Our custom attention kernel coupled with the bitmap-based format delivers substantial compression of KV cache upto 45% of dense inference and thereby enables longer context length and increased tokens/sec throughput of upto 2.23x compared to dense inference. Our pruning mechanism and sparse attention kernel is available at https://github.com/dhjoo98/mustafar.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingkai Kong, Haichuan Wang, Tonghan Wang, Guojun Xiong, Milind Tambe</p>
<p>Abstract: Incorporating pre-collected offline data from a source environment can significantly improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), but this benefit is often challenged by discrepancies between the transition dynamics of the source and target environments. Existing methods typically address this issue by penalizing or filtering out source transitions in high dynamics-gap regions. However, their estimation of the dynamics gap often relies on KL divergence or mutual information, which can be ill-defined when the source and target dynamics have disjoint support. To overcome these limitations, we propose CompFlow, a method grounded in the theoretical connection between flow matching and optimal transport. Specifically, we model the target dynamics as a conditional flow built upon the output distribution of the source-domain flow, rather than learning it directly from a Gaussian prior. This composite structure offers two key advantages: (1) improved generalization for learning target dynamics, and (2) a principled estimation of the dynamics gap via the Wasserstein distance between source and target transitions. Leveraging our principled estimation of the dynamics gap, we further introduce an optimistic active data collection strategy that prioritizes exploration in regions of high dynamics gap, and theoretically prove that it reduces the performance disparity with the optimal policy. Empirically, CompFlow outperforms strong baselines across several RL benchmarks with shifted dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaran Ye, Zijun Yao, Zhidian Huang, Liangming Pan, Jinxin Liu, Yushi Bai, Amy Xin, Weichuan Liu, Xiaoyin Che, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can perform multi-hop reasoning implicitly -- producing correct answers without explicitly verbalizing intermediate steps -- but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this paper, we study how such implicit reasoning emerges by training transformers from scratch in a controlled symbolic environment. Our analysis reveals a three-stage developmental trajectory: early memorization, followed by in-distribution generalization, and eventually cross-distribution generalization. We find that training with atomic triples is not necessary but accelerates learning, and that second-hop generalization relies on query-level exposure to specific compositional structures. To interpret these behaviors, we introduce two diagnostic tools: cross-query semantic patching, which identifies semantically reusable intermediate representations, and a cosine-based representational lens, which reveals that successful reasoning correlates with the cosine-base clustering in hidden space. This clustering phenomenon in turn provides a coherent explanation for the behavioral dynamics observed across training, linking representational structure to reasoning capability. These findings provide new insights into the interpretability of implicit multi-hop reasoning in LLMs, helping to clarify how complex reasoning processes unfold internally and offering pathways to enhance the transparency of such models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Merrill, Shane Arora, Dirk Groeneveld, Hannaneh Hajishirzi</p>
<p>Abstract: The right batch size is important when training language models at scale: a large batch size is necessary for fast training, but a batch size that is too large will harm token efficiency. To navigate this tradeoff, McCandlish et al. (2018) suggest that a critical batch size (CBS), below which training will not substantially degrade loss, can be estimated based on the gradient noise scale during training. While their method has been adopted in practice, e.g., when training GPT-3, strong assumptions are required to justify gradient noise as a proxy for the CBS, which makes it unclear whether their approach should be trusted in practice, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we introduce a simple, empirical approach to directly measure the CBS and show how the CBS evolves over training. Applying our approach to the OLMo models, we find that CBS is near 0 at initialization, increases rapidly at first, and then plateaus as training progresses. Furthermore, we find that this trend holds across different model sizes (1B and 7B), suggesting CBS from small training runs can inform larger-scale training runs. Our findings about how the CBS changes over training motivate batch size warmup as a natural way to reliably train language models at large batch size: start the batch size small and increase it as the CBS grows. To validate this claim, we use batch size warmup to train OLMo 1B to slightly better loss than the original training run with 43% fewer gradient steps. This shows how our framework can be applied to reliably train language models at larger batch sizes, increasing data parallelism without compromising performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neil He, Rishabh Anand, Hiren Madhu, Ali Maatouk, Smita Krishnaswamy, Leandros Tassiulas, Menglin Yang, Rex Ying</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in text modeling tasks across domains. However, natural language exhibits inherent semantic hierarchies and nuanced geometric structure, which current LLMs do not capture completely owing to their reliance on Euclidean operations. Recent studies have also shown that not respecting the geometry of token embeddings leads to training instabilities and degradation of generative capabilities. These findings suggest that shifting to non-Euclidean geometries can better align language models with the underlying geometry of text. We thus propose to operate fully in Hyperbolic space, known for its expansive, scale-free, and low-distortion properties. We thus introduce HELM, a family of HypErbolic Large Language Models, offering a geometric rethinking of the Transformer-based LLM that addresses the representational inflexibility, missing set of necessary operations, and poor scalability of existing hyperbolic LMs. We additionally introduce a Mixture-of-Curvature Experts model, HELM-MICE, where each expert operates in a distinct curvature space to encode more fine-grained geometric structure from text, as well as a dense model, HELM-D. For HELM-MICE, we further develop hyperbolic Multi-Head Latent Attention (HMLA) for efficient, reduced-KV-cache training and inference. For both models, we develop essential hyperbolic equivalents of rotary positional encodings and RMS normalization. We are the first to train fully hyperbolic LLMs at billion-parameter scale, and evaluate them on well-known benchmarks such as MMLU and ARC, spanning STEM problem-solving, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our results show consistent gains from our HELM architectures -- up to 4% -- over popular Euclidean architectures used in LLaMA and DeepSeek, highlighting the efficacy and enhanced reasoning afforded by hyperbolic geometry in large-scale LM pretraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiansheng Cai, Sihan Hu, Tao Wang, Yuan Huang, Pan Zhang, Youjin Deng, Kun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Fundamental physics often confronts complex symbolic problems with few guiding exemplars or established principles. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise, its typical need for vast datasets to learn from hinders its use in these information-scarce frontiers. We introduce learning at criticality (LaC), a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to a sharp learning transition, addressing this information scarcity. At this transition, LLMs achieve peak generalization from minimal data, exemplified by 7-digit base-7 addition -- a test of nontrivial arithmetic reasoning. To elucidate this peak, we analyze a minimal concept-network model (CoNet) designed to capture the essence of how LLMs might link tokens. Trained on a single exemplar, this model also undergoes a sharp learning transition. This transition exhibits hallmarks of a second-order phase transition, notably power-law distributed solution path lengths. At this critical point, the system maximizes a ``critical thinking pattern" crucial for generalization, enabled by the underlying scale-free exploration. This suggests LLMs reach peak performance by operating at criticality, where such explorative dynamics enable the extraction of underlying operational rules. We demonstrate LaC in quantum field theory: an 8B-parameter LLM, tuned to its critical point by LaC using a few exemplars of symbolic Matsubara sums, solves unseen, higher-order problems, significantly outperforming far larger models. LaC thus leverages critical phenomena, a physical principle, to empower AI for complex, data-sparse challenges in fundamental physics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jos\'e Manuel de Frutos, Manuel A. V\'azquez, Pablo M. Olmos, Joaqu\'in M\'iguez</p>
<p>Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL), have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i) continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii) convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q = p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections, defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density approximation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Yuan, Yukun Liu, Chonghua Han, Jie Feng, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized fields such as natural language processing and computer vision by enabling general-purpose learning across diverse tasks and datasets. However, building analogous models for human mobility remains challenging due to the privacy-sensitive nature of mobility data and the resulting data silos across institutions. To bridge this gap, we propose MoveGCL, a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for training mobility foundation models via generative continual learning. Without sharing raw data, MoveGCL enables decentralized and progressive model evolution by replaying synthetic trajectories generated from a frozen teacher model, and reinforces knowledge retention through a tailored distillation strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. To address the heterogeneity of mobility patterns, MoveGCL incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts Transformer with a mobility-aware expert routing mechanism, and employs a layer-wise progressive adaptation strategy to stabilize continual updates. Experiments on six real-world urban datasets demonstrate that MoveGCL achieves performance comparable to joint training and significantly outperforms federated learning baselines, while offering strong privacy protection. MoveGCL marks a crucial step toward unlocking foundation models for mobility, offering a practical blueprint for open, scalable, and privacy-preserving model development in the era of foundation models. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we have released the code and models at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoveGCL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanming Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Industrial carbon emissions are a major driver of climate change, yet modeling these emissions is challenging due to multicollinearity among factors and complex interdependencies across sectors and time. We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework DGL to analyze and forecast industrial CO_2 emissions, addressing high feature correlation and capturing industrial-temporal interdependencies. Unlike traditional regression or clustering methods, our approach leverages a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with attention mechanisms to model relationships between industries (or regions) and a temporal transformer to learn long-range patterns. We evaluate our framework on public global industry emissions dataset derived from EDGAR v8.0, spanning multiple countries and sectors. The proposed model achieves superior predictive performance - reducing error by over 15% compared to baseline deep models - while maintaining interpretability via attention weights and causal analysis. We believe that we are the first Graph-Temporal architecture that resolves multicollinearity by structurally encoding feature relationships, along with integration of causal inference to identify true drivers of emissions, improving transparency and fairness. We also stand a demonstration of policy relevance, showing how model insights can guide sector-specific decarbonization strategies aligned with sustainable development goals. Based on the above, we show high-emission "hotspots" and suggest equitable intervention plans, illustrating the potential of state-of-the-art AI graph learning to advance climate action, offering a powerful tool for policymakers and industry stakeholders to achieve carbon reduction targets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxence Bouvier, Ryan Amaudruz, Felix Arnold, Renzo Andri, Lukas Cavigelli</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI workloads proliferate, optimizing arithmetic units is becoming increasingly important for reducing the footprint of digital systems. Conventional design flows, which often rely on manual or heuristic-based optimization, are limited in their ability to thoroughly explore the vast design space. In this paper, we introduce GENIAL, a machine learning-based framework for the automatic generation and optimization of arithmetic units, with a focus on multipliers.
  At the core of GENIAL is a Transformer-based surrogate model trained in two stages, involving self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised finetuning, to robustly forecast key hardware metrics such as power and area from abstracted design representations. By inverting the surrogate model, GENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize power consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions. Extensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently more sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards optimized designs. This enables deployment of a high-effort logic synthesis optimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model. Notably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18% switching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads compared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the versatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite State Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of logic functions. Together, these advances mark a significant step toward automated Quality-of-Results-optimized combinational circuit generation for digital systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Sarfi, Benjamin Th\'erien, Joel Lidin, Eugene Belilovsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across datacenters and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization is often applied to reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages error feedback with Top-k sparsification and 2-bit quantization to reach extreme sparsity as low as 1-3% while outperforming full-precision DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally approximated by an error feedback accumulator combined with aggressive sparsity, and that sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trusting Inekwe, Winnie Mkandawire, Emmanuel Agu, Andres Colubri</p>
<p>Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare systems worldwide, disproportionately impacting individuals with chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). These disruptions -- through delayed care and behavioral changes, affected key CVD biomarkers, including LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), HbA1c, BMI, and systolic blood pressure (SysBP). Accurate modeling of these changes is crucial for predicting disease progression and guiding preventive care. However, prior work has not addressed multi-target prediction of CVD biomarker from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using machine learning (ML), while jointly capturing biomarker interdependencies, temporal patterns, and predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose MBT-CB, a Multi-target Bayesian Transformer (MBT) with pre-trained BERT-based transformer framework to jointly predict LDL-C, HbA1c, BMI and SysBP CVD biomarkers from EHR data. The model leverages Bayesian Variational Inference to estimate uncertainties, embeddings to capture temporal relationships and a DeepMTR model to capture biomarker inter-relationships. We evaluate MBT-CT on retrospective EHR data from 3,390 CVD patient records (304 unique patients) in Central Massachusetts during the Covid-19 pandemic. MBT-CB outperformed a comprehensive set of baselines including other BERT-based ML models, achieving an MAE of 0.00887, RMSE of 0.0135 and MSE of 0.00027, while effectively capturing data and model uncertainty, patient biomarker inter-relationships, and temporal dynamics via its attention and embedding mechanisms. MBT-CB's superior performance highlights its potential to improve CVD biomarker prediction and support clinical decision-making during pandemics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akaash Kolluri, Shengguang Wu, Joon Sung Park, Michael S. Bernstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a powerful opportunity to simulate the results of social science experiments. In this work, we demonstrate that finetuning LLMs directly on individual-level responses from past experiments meaningfully improves the accuracy of such simulations across diverse social science domains. We construct SocSci210 via an automatic pipeline, a dataset comprising 2.9 million responses from 400,491 participants in 210 open-source social science experiments. Through finetuning, we achieve multiple levels of generalization. In completely unseen studies, our strongest model, Socrates-Qwen-14B, produces predictions that are 26% more aligned with distributions of human responses to diverse outcome questions under varying conditions relative to its base model (Qwen2.5-14B), outperforming GPT-4o by 13%. By finetuning on a subset of conditions in a study, generalization to new unseen conditions is particularly robust, improving by 71%. Since SocSci210 contains rich demographic information, we reduce demographic parity difference, a measure of bias, by 10.6% through finetuning. Because social sciences routinely generate rich, topic-specific datasets, our findings indicate that finetuning on such data could enable more accurate simulations for experimental hypothesis screening. We release our data, models and finetuning code at stanfordhci.github.io/socrates.</p>

<p>Abstract: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based guidelines for cancer treatment. Translating complex patient presentations into guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model (LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold. First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories, each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation (Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks. Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability, and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikita Rajaneesh, Thomas Zollo, Richard Zemel</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold great promise for advanced reasoning at the intersection of text and images, yet they have not fully realized this potential. MLLMs typically integrate an LLM, a vision encoder, and a connector that maps the vision encoder's embeddings into the LLM's text embedding space. Although each component is pretrained on massive datasets with billions of samples, the entire multimodal model is typically trained on only thousands (or a few million) samples, which can result in weak performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these shortcomings, instead of relying on extensive labeled datasets for fine-tuning, we propose a Test-Time Warmup method that adapts the MLLM per test instance by leveraging data from weakly supervised auxiliary tasks. With our approach, we observe a relative performance improvement of 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA on the Llama-Vision-Instruct model. Our method demonstrates that 'warming up' before inference can enhance MLLMs' robustness across diverse reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baptiste Schubnel, Jelena Simeunovi\'c, Corentin Tissier, Pierre-Jean Alet, Rafael E. Carrillo</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate day-ahead forecasts of solar irradiance are required for the large-scale integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems into the power grid. However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather prediction service.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Kyle Lampinen, Martin Engelcke, Yuxuan Li, Arslan Chaudhry, James L. McClelland</p>
<p>Abstract: When do machine learning systems fail to generalize, and what mechanisms could improve their generalization? Here, we draw inspiration from cognitive science to argue that one weakness of parametric machine learning systems is their failure to exhibit latent learning -- learning information that is not relevant to the task at hand, but that might be useful in a future task. We show how this perspective links failures ranging from the reversal curse in language modeling to new findings on agent-based navigation. We then highlight how cognitive science points to episodic memory as a potential part of the solution to these issues. Correspondingly, we show that a system with an oracle retrieval mechanism can use learning experiences more flexibly to generalize better across many of these challenges. We also identify some of the essential components for effectively using retrieval, including the importance of within-example in-context learning for acquiring the ability to use information across retrieved examples. In summary, our results illustrate one possible contributor to the relative data inefficiency of current machine learning systems compared to natural intelligence, and help to understand how retrieval methods can complement parametric learning to improve generalization. We close by discussing some of the links between these findings and prior results in cognitive science and neuroscience, and the broader implications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Wong, Ravi Shankar, Beth Albert, Gabriel Davis Jones</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) and large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising generalization across diverse domains for time-series analysis, yet their potential for electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) and cardiotocography (CTG) analysis remains underexplored. Most existing CTG studies relied on domain-specific models and lack systematic comparisons with modern foundation or language models, limiting our understanding of whether these models can outperform specialized systems in fetal health assessment. In this study, we present the first comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art architectures for automated antepartum CTG classification. Over 2,500 20-minutes recordings were used to evaluate over 15 models spanning domain-specific, time-series, foundation, and language-model categories under a unified framework. Fine-tuned LLMs consistently outperformed both foundation and domain-specific models across data-availability scenarios, except when uterine-activity signals were absent, where domain-specific models showed greater robustness. These performance gains, however, required substantially higher computational resources. Our results highlight that while fine-tuned LLMs achieved state-of-the-art performance for CTG classification, practical deployment must balance performance with computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abel Gurung, Joseph Campbell</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models excel across diverse tasks, but adapting them to specialized applications often requires fine-tuning, an approach that is memory and compute-intensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate this by updating only a small subset of weights. In this paper, we introduce HyperAdapt, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods like LoRA. Specifically, HyperAdapt adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by applying row- and column-wise scaling through diagonal matrices, thereby inducing a high-rank update while requiring only $n+m$ trainable parameters for an $n \times m$ matrix. Theoretically, we establish an upper bound on the rank of HyperAdapt's updates, and empirically, we confirm that it consistently induces high-rank transformations across model layers. Experiments on GLUE, arithmetic reasoning, and commonsense reasoning benchmarks with models up to 14B parameters demonstrate that HyperAdapt matches or nearly matches the performance of full fine-tuning and state-of-the-art PEFT methods while using orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jincheng Liu, Sijun He, Jingjing Wu, Xiangsen Wang, Yang Chen, Zhaoqi Kuang, Siqi Bao, Yuan Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities. However, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning skills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling at sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address this question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic reasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension, and multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard. The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random player that selects moves arbitrarily. We also present a strong baseline to the testbed: our fine-tuned Qwen3-8B substantially improved performance, approaching much larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rizal Fathony, Igor Melnyk, Owen Reinert, Nam H. Nguyen, Daniele Rosa, C. Bayan Bruss</p>
<p>Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance, cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this direction.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass filtering to deep neural network features to improve model generalizability. Our method is motivated by our hypothesis that neural networks encode task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features. By subtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, our approach isolates generalizable representations while preserving architectural integrity. Experimental results across diverse domains such as Vision, Text, 3D, and Audio demonstrate consistent performance improvements regardless of model architecture and data modality. Analysis reveals that our method induces feature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components, providing empirical validation of our core hypothesis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenwei Tang, Jingyu Xing, Xinyu Liu, Wei Ju, Jiancheng Lv, Fan Zhang, Deng Xiong, Ziyue Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving remarkable performance in complex reasoning domains such as mathematics and code generation. However, current RL methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision. Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward (DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward (DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to learn from continuous experience.</p>

<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is effective but brittle under annotator noise and distribution shift because it operates on hard, pairwise labels and only regularizes log-probability differences. We introduce Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO), a framework that extends preference learning to soft listwise supervision via reference anchoring. ADPO minimizes KL(q || softmax((s - s_ref) / tau_anc)), which (i) recovers supervised fine-tuning, knowledge distillation, maximum-entropy reinforcement learning, and DPO as special cases through suitable choices of target q, anchor policy, and temperature; (ii) induces an implicit trust region governed by the softmax Fisher metric, independent of the anchor; and (iii) supports stable dynamic-anchor updates. Empirically, we observe a task-dependent tradeoff: dynamic anchors improve online exploration under noise, while fixed anchors excel at offline distillation, achieving up to 170 to 5000 times reduction in student-teacher KL on our benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), most existing work follows an English-centric design process, limiting their effectiveness in multilingual settings. In this work, we provide a comprehensive empirical study analyzing the impact of several multilingual design choices, such as training data composition, encoder selection, and text backbones. The result is TowerVision, a family of open multilingual VLMs for both image-text and video-text tasks, built upon the multilingual text-only model Tower+. TowerVision achieves competitive performance on multiple multimodal multilingual benchmarks and shows particular strength in culturally grounded tasks and multimodal translation. By incorporating visual and cultural context during fine-tuning, our models surpass existing approaches trained on substantially larger datasets, as demonstrated on ALM-Bench and Multi30K (image tasks) and ViMUL-Bench (video tasks). Alongside the models, we release VisionBlocks, a high-quality, curated vision-language dataset. Our findings highlight that multilingual vision-language training data substantially improves cross-lingual generalization -- both from high-resource to underrepresented languages and vice versa -- and that instruction-tuned LLMs are not always the optimal initialization point. To support further research, we publicly release all models, data, and training recipes.</p>

This framework captures both the heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior distribution. This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques, highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation across multi-bandits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youssef Attia El Hili, Albert Thomas, Malik Tiomoko, Abdelhakim Benechehab, Corentin L\'eger, Corinne Ancourt, Bal\'azs K\'egl</p>
<p>Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and hyperparameter optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar, Nicol\`o Michelusi</p>
<p>Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming \emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous} wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured, time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bozhi You, Irene Wang, Zelal Su Mustafaoglu, Abhinav Jangda, Ang\'elica Moreira, Roshan Dathathri, Divya Mahajan, Keshav Pingali</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention is a fundamental building block of large language models (LLMs), so there have been many efforts to implement it efficiently. For example, FlashAttention leverages tiling and kernel fusion to optimize attention. Recently, a number of variants of attention have been introduced to enhance model quality or efficiency. Supporting them efficiently remains difficult since they usually require specialized kernels or hand-tuned implementations. FlexAttention recently addressed part of this gap by using static programming templates to support FlashAttention-like kernels for a subset of attention variants.
  In this paper, we introduce Flashlight, a compiler-native framework within the PyTorch ecosystem that automatically generates fused, FlashAttention-style kernels for arbitrary attention-based programs, without relying on static templates or predefined kernel specializations. Flashlight leverages PyTorch's compilation workflow to fuse and tile attention computations transparently, enabling efficient execution for diverse attention patterns. Not only does it support all variants expressible in the FlexAttention model but it also handles more general, data-dependent attention formulations that are beyond the capabilities of FlexAttention.
  Our results show that Flashlight produces kernels with competitive or superior performance to FlexAttention, while offering the flexibility of native PyTorch code, enabling developers to rapidly explore new attention models without sacrificing performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Munib Mesinovic, Max Buhlan, Tingting Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiedong Jiang, Wanyi He, Yuefeng Wang, Guoxiong Gao, Yongle Hu, Jingting Wang, Nailing Guan, Peihao Wu, Chunbo Dai, Liang Xiao, Bin Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in formal theorem proving, particularly on contest-based mathematical benchmarks like the IMO. However, these contests do not reflect the depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new benchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced mathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each with 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a difficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD qualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both PhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a stark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3% (pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals that models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their ability to formalize this reasoning. We systematically classify the common errors that arise during this formalization process. Furthermore, a comparative study shows that a specialized prover can exhibit less effective reflection than general-purpose models, reducing its accuracy at the natural-language stage. We believe FATE provides a robust and challenging benchmark that establishes essential checkpoints on the path toward research-level formal mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henrik Hose, Johannes K\"ohler, Melanie N. Zeilinger, Sebastian Trimpe</p>
<p>Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) achieves stability and constraint satisfaction for general nonlinear systems, but requires computationally expensive online optimization. This paper studies approximations of such MPC controllers via neural networks (NNs) to achieve fast online evaluation. We propose safety augmentation that yields deterministic guarantees for convergence and constraint satisfaction despite approximation inaccuracies. We approximate the entire input sequence of the MPC with NNs, which allows us to verify online if it is a feasible solution to the MPC problem. We replace the NN solution by a safe candidate based on standard MPC techniques whenever it is infeasible or has worse cost. Our method requires a single evaluation of the NN and forward integration of the input sequence online, which is fast to compute on resource-constrained systems. The proposed control framework is illustrated using two numerical non-linear MPC benchmarks of different complexity, demonstrating computational speedups that are orders of magnitude higher than online optimization. In the examples, we achieve deterministic safety through the safety-augmented NNs, where a naive NN implementation fails.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengbei Liu, Chong Wang, Yuanhong Chen, Yuyuan Liu, Gustavo Carneiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Although noisy-label learning is often approached with discriminative methods for simplicity and speed, generative modeling offers a principled alternative by capturing the joint mechanism that produces features, clean labels, and corrupted observations. However, prior work typically (i) introduces extra latent variables and heavy image generators that bias training toward reconstruction, (ii) fixes a single data-generating direction (\(Y\rightarrow\!X\) or \(X\rightarrow\!Y\)), limiting adaptability, and (iii) assumes a uniform prior over clean labels, ignoring instance-level uncertainty. We propose a single-stage, EM-style framework for generative noisy-label learning that is \emph{direction-agnostic} and avoids explicit image synthesis. First, we derive a single Expectation-Maximization (EM) objective whose E-step specializes to either causal orientation without changing the overall optimization. Second, we replace the intractable \(p(X\mid Y)\) with a dataset-normalized discriminative proxy computed using a discriminative classifier on the finite training set, retaining the structural benefits of generative modeling at much lower cost. Third, we introduce \emph{Partial-Label Supervision} (PLS), an instance-specific prior over clean labels that balances coverage and uncertainty, improving data-dependent regularization. Across standard vision and natural language processing (NLP) noisy-label benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, lower transition-matrix estimation error, and substantially less training compute than current generative and discriminative baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cyrus Zhou, Pedro Savarese, Zack Hassman, Vaughn Richard, Michael DiBrino, Michael Maire, Yanjing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultra-low-precision inference can sharply reduce memory and latency but often degrades accuracy and relies on specialized hardware. We present SONIQ, a system-optimized, noise-injected quantization framework that learns per-channel mixed precision for both weights and activations while training under the same rules used at inference. By injecting hardware-calibrated quantization noise during training, SONIQ steers models toward the discrete arithmetic used at deployment -- without bespoke runtimes. Across CNNs and Transformers, SONIQ achieves up to 16x and 7x compression, respectively, while matching or exceeding full-precision accuracy. Measured end-to-end, SONIQ delivers up to 7.3x CPU speedup over strong INT8 baselines and up to 6.3x (vector units) / 2.8x (tensor cores) GPU speedup relative to FP16. A practical outcome is that two per-channel precision levels -- one in the 1--4-bit range and one in the 4--8-bit range -- suffice in practice; at inference, each channel selects one of the two, keeping kernels simple and fast. To our knowledge, SONIQ is the first framework to reach or surpass full-precision accuracy under ultra-low (1--4 bits per parameter) regimes while remaining deployable on commodity hardware, narrowing the gap between quantization theory and practical, high-throughput inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity of advanced machine learning models requires innovative approaches to manage computational resources effectively. One such method is the Early Exit strategy, which allows for adaptive computation by providing a mechanism to shorten the processing path for simpler data instances. In this paper, we propose EERO, a new methodology to translate the problem of early exiting to a problem of using multiple classifiers with reject option in order to better select the exiting head for each instance. We calibrate the probabilities of exiting at the different heads using aggregation with exponential weights to guarantee a fixed budget .We consider factors such as Bayesian risk, budget constraints, and head-specific budget consumption. Experimental results, conducted using a ResNet-18 model and a ConvNext architecture on Cifar and ImageNet datasets, demonstrate that our method not only effectively manages budget allocation but also enhances accuracy in overthinking scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Ding, Rui Tuo, Lu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a flexible, nonparametric framework for probabilistic modeling, yet remains computationally demanding in large-scale applications. For one-dimensional data, state space (SS) models achieve linear-time inference by reformulating GPs as stochastic differential equations (SDEs). However, SS approaches are confined to gridded inputs and cannot handle multi-dimensional scattered data. We propose a new framework based on kernel packet (KP), which overcomes these limitations while retaining exactness and scalability. A KP is a compactly supported function defined as a linear combination of the GP covariance functions. In this article, we prove that KPs can be identified via the forward and backward SS representations. We also show that the KP approach enables exact inference with linear-time training and logarithmic or constant-time prediction, and extends naturally to multi-dimensional gridded or scattered data without low-rank approximations. Numerical experiments on large-scale additive and product-form GPs with millions of samples demonstrate that KPs achieve exact, memory-efficient inference where SDE-based and low-rank GP methods fail.</p>

<p>Abstract: While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on many tasks, there has been extensive research on undesirable model behavior such as hallucinations and bias. In this work, we investigate how the quality of LLM responses changes in terms of information accuracy, truthfulness, and refusals depending on three user traits: English proficiency, education level, and country of origin. We present extensive experimentation on three state-of-the-art LLMs and two different datasets targeting truthfulness and factuality. Our findings suggest that undesirable behaviors in state-of-the-art LLMs occur disproportionately more for users with lower English proficiency, of lower education status, and originating from outside the US, rendering these models unreliable sources of information towards their most vulnerable users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonah Botvinick-Greenhouse, Maria Oprea, Romit Maulik, Yunan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The celebrated Takens' embedding theorem provides a theoretical foundation for reconstructing the full state of a dynamical system from partial observations. However, the classical theorem assumes that the underlying system is deterministic and that observations are noise-free, limiting its applicability in real-world scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we formulate a measure-theoretic generalization that adopts an Eulerian description of the dynamics and recasts the embedding as a pushforward map between spaces of probability measures. Our mathematical results leverage recent advances in optimal transport. Building on the proposed measure-theoretic time-delay embedding theory, we develop a computational procedure that aims to reconstruct the full state of a dynamical system from time-lagged partial observations, engineered with robustness to handle sparse and noisy data. We evaluate our measure-based approach across several numerical examples, ranging from the classic Lorenz-63 system to real-world applications such as NOAA sea surface temperature reconstruction and ERA5 wind field reconstruction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite their immense success, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be difficult to optimize and costly to train due to hundreds of layers within the network depth. Conventional convolutional operations are fundamentally limited by their linear nature along with fixed activations, where many layers are needed to learn meaningful patterns in data. Because of the sheer size of these networks, this approach is simply computationally inefficient, and poses overfitting or gradient explosion risks, especially in small datasets. As a result, we introduce a "plug-in" module, called Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (RKAN). Our module is highly compact, so it can be easily added into any stage (level) of traditional deep networks, where it learns to integrate supportive polynomial feature transformations to existing convolutional frameworks. RKAN offers consistent improvements over baseline models in different vision tasks and widely tested benchmarks, accomplishing cutting-edge performance on them.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging field recognized for the significant speedup it offers over classical computing through quantum algorithms. However, designing and implementing quantum algorithms pose challenges due to the complex nature of quantum mechanics and the necessity for precise control over quantum states. Despite the significant advancements in AI, there has been a lack of datasets specifically tailored for this purpose. In this work, we introduce QCircuitBench, the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate AI's capability in designing and implementing quantum algorithms using quantum programming languages. Unlike using AI for writing traditional codes, this task is fundamentally more complicated due to highly flexible design space. Our key contributions include: 1. A general framework which formulates the key features of quantum algorithm design for Large Language Models. 2. Implementations for quantum algorithms from basic primitives to advanced applications, spanning 3 task suites, 25 algorithms, and 120,290 data points. 3. Automatic validation and verification functions, allowing for iterative evaluation and interactive reasoning without human inspection. 4. Promising potential as a training dataset through preliminary fine-tuning results. We observed several interesting experimental phenomena: LLMs tend to exhibit consistent error patterns, and fine-tuning does not always outperform few-shot learning. In all, QCircuitBench is a comprehensive benchmark for LLM-driven quantum algorithm design, and it reveals limitations of LLMs in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Esha Saha, Oscar Wang, Amit K. Chakraborty, Pablo Venegas Garcia, Russell Milne, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Bitumen extraction for the production of synthetic crude oil in Canada's Athabasca Oil Sands industry has recently come under spotlight for being a significant source of greenhouse gas emission. A major cause of concern is methane, a greenhouse gas produced by the anaerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons in oil sands residues, or tailings, stored in settle basins commonly known as oil sands tailing ponds. In order to determine the methane emitting potential of these tailing ponds and have future methane projections, we use real-time weather data, mechanistic models developed from laboratory controlled experiments, and industrial reports to train a physics constrained machine learning model. Our trained model can successfully identify the directions of active ponds and estimate their emission levels, which are generally hard to obtain due to data sampling restrictions. We found that each active oil sands tailing pond could emit between 950 to 1500 tonnes of methane per year, whose environmental impact is equivalent to carbon dioxide emissions from at least 6000 gasoline powered vehicles. Although abandoned ponds are often presumed to have insignificant emissions, our findings indicate that these ponds could become active over time and potentially emit up to 1000 tonnes of methane each year. Taking an average over all datasets that was used in model training, we estimate that emissions around major oil sands regions would need to be reduced by approximately 12% over a year, to reduce the average methane concentrations to 2005 levels.</p>

<p>Abstract: 5G and beyond cellular systems embrace the disaggregation of Radio Access Network (RAN) components, exemplified by the evolution of the fronthaul (FH) connection between cellular baseband and radio unit equipment. Crucially, synchronization over the FH is pivotal for reliable 5G services. In recent years, there has been a push to move these links to an Ethernet-based packet network topology, leveraging existing standards and ongoing research for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). However, TSN standards, such as Precision Time Protocol (PTP), focus on performance with little to no concern for security. This increases the exposure of the open FH to security risks. Attacks targeting synchronization mechanisms pose significant threats, potentially disrupting 5G networks and impairing connectivity.
  In this paper, we demonstrate the impact of successful spoofing and replay attacks against PTP synchronization. We show how a spoofing attack is able to cause a production-ready O-RAN and 5G-compliant private cellular base station to catastrophically fail within 2 seconds of the attack, necessitating manual intervention to restore full network operations. To counter this, we design a Machine Learning (ML)-based monitoring solution capable of detecting various malicious attacks with over 97.5% accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction provides a framework for uncertainty quantification, specifically in the forms of prediction intervals and sets with distribution-free guaranteed coverage. While recent cross-conformal techniques such as CV+ and Jackknife+-after-bootstrap achieve better data efficiency than traditional split conformal methods, they incur substantial computational costs due to required pairwise comparisons between training and test samples' out-of-bag scores. Observing that these methods naturally extend from ensemble models, particularly random forests, we leverage existing optimized random forest implementations to enable efficient cross-conformal predictions.
  We present coverforest, a Python package that implements efficient conformal prediction methods specifically optimized for random forests. coverforest supports both regression and classification tasks through various conformal prediction methods, including split conformal, CV+, Jackknife+-after-bootstrap, and adaptive prediction sets. Our package leverages parallel computing and Cython optimizations to speed up out-of-bag calculations. Our experiments demonstrate that coverforest's predictions achieve the desired level of coverage. In addition, its training and prediction times can be faster than an existing implementation by 2--9 times.

<p>Abstract: Recent interest in building foundation models for KGs has highlighted a fundamental challenge: knowledge-graph data is relatively scarce. The best-known KGs are primarily human-labeled, created by pattern-matching, or extracted using early NLP techniques. While human-generated KGs are in short supply, automatically extracted KGs are of questionable quality. We present a solution to this data scarcity problem in the form of a text-to-KG generator (KGGen), a package that uses language models to create high-quality graphs from plaintext. Unlike other KG extractors, KGGen clusters related entities to reduce sparsity in extracted KGs. KGGen is available as a Python library (\texttt{pip install kg-gen}), making it accessible to everyone. Along with KGGen, we release the first benchmark, Measure of of Information in Nodes and Edges (MINE), that tests an extractor's ability to produce a useful KG from plain text. We benchmark our new tool against existing extractors and demonstrate far superior performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Fang, Hadi Pouransari, Matt Jordan, Alexander Toshev, Vaishaal Shankar, Ludwig Schmidt, Tom Gunter</p>
<p>Abstract: Data filtering has become a powerful tool for improving model performance while reducing computational cost. However, as large language model compute budgets continue to grow, the limited data volume provided by heavily filtered and deduplicated datasets will become a practical constraint. In efforts to better understand how to proceed, we study model performance at various compute budgets and across multiple pre-training datasets created through data filtering and deduplication. We find that, given appropriate modifications to the training recipe, repeating existing aggressively filtered datasets for up to ten epochs can outperform training on the ten times larger superset for a single epoch across multiple compute budget orders of magnitude. While this finding relies on repeating the dataset for many epochs, we also investigate repeats within these datasets at the document level. We find that not all documents within a dataset are equal, and we can create better datasets relative to a token budget by explicitly manipulating the counts of individual documents. We conclude by arguing that even as large language models scale, data filtering remains an important direction of research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pin-Jie Lin, Rishab Balasubramanian, Fengyuan Liu, Nikhil Kandpal, Tu Vu</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern LLMs struggle with efficient updates, as each new pretrained model version requires repeating expensive alignment processes. This challenge also applies to domain- or languagespecific models, where fine-tuning on specialized data must be redone for every new base model release. In this paper, we explore the transfer of fine-tuning updates between model versions. Specifically, we derive the diff vector (representing the weight changes from finetuning) from one source model version and apply it to the base model of a different target version. Through empirical evaluations on various open-weight model versions, we show that transferring diff vectors can significantly improve the performance of the target base model. For example, transferring the fine-tuning updates from Llama 3.0 8B improves Llama 3.1 8B by 46.9% on IFEval and 15.7% on LiveCodeBench without additional training, even surpassing Llama 3.1 8B Instruct. Furthermore, we demonstrate performance gains on multilingual tasks, with 4.7% and 15.5% improvements on Global MMLU for Malagasy and Turkish, respectively. We observe that these merged models provide stronger initializations for further fine-tuning. Lastly, our controlled experiments suggest that fine-tuning transfer is most effective when source and target models lie in a linearly connected region of parameter space, and we provide a theoretical analysis of our method. Taken together, fine-tuning transfer offers a cost-efficient and practical strategy for continuous LLM development. Our code is available at github.com/pjlintw/finetuning-transfer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubham Kumar Nigam, Balaramamahanthi Deepak Patnaik, Shivam Mishra, Noel Shallum, Kripabandhu Ghosh, Arnab Bhattacharya</p>
<p>Abstract: In the landscape of Fact-based Judgment Prediction and Explanation (FJPE), reliance on factual data is essential for developing robust and realistic AI-driven decision-making tools. This paper introduces TathyaNyaya, the largest annotated dataset for FJPE tailored to the Indian legal context, encompassing judgments from the Supreme Court of India and various High Courts. Derived from the Hindi terms "Tathya" (fact) and "Nyaya" (justice), the TathyaNyaya dataset is uniquely designed to focus on factual statements rather than complete legal texts, reflecting real-world judicial processes where factual data drives outcomes. Complementing this dataset, we present FactLegalLlama, an instruction-tuned variant of the LLaMa-3-8B Large Language Model (LLM), optimized for generating high-quality explanations in FJPE tasks. Finetuned on the factual data in TathyaNyaya, FactLegalLlama integrates predictive accuracy with coherent, contextually relevant explanations, addressing the critical need for transparency and interpretability in AI-assisted legal systems. Our methodology combines transformers for binary judgment prediction with FactLegalLlama for explanation generation, creating a robust framework for advancing FJPE in the Indian legal domain. TathyaNyaya not only surpasses existing datasets in scale and diversity but also establishes a benchmark for building explainable AI systems in legal analysis. The findings underscore the importance of factual precision and domain-specific tuning in enhancing predictive performance and interpretability, positioning TathyaNyaya and FactLegalLlama as foundational resources for AI-assisted legal decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omkar Gurjar, Kin Sum Liu, Praveen Kolli, Utsaw Kumar, Mandar Rahurkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the success of vision-language models in various generative tasks, obtaining high-quality semantic representations for products and user intents is still challenging due to the inability of off-the-shelf models to capture nuanced relationships between the entities. In this paper, we introduce a joint training framework for product and user queries by aligning uni-modal and multi-modal encoders through contrastive learning on image-text data. Our novel approach trains a query encoder with an LLM-curated relevance dataset, eliminating the reliance on engagement history. These embeddings demonstrate strong generalization capabilities and improve performance across applications, including product categorization and relevance prediction. For personalized ads recommendation, a significant uplift in the click-through rate and conversion rate after the deployment further confirms the impact on key business metrics. We believe that the flexibility of our framework makes it a promising solution toward enriching the user experience across the e-commerce landscape.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonggwon Park, Byungmu Yoon, Soobum Kim, Kyoyun Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal models have significantly improved vision-language (VL) alignment in radiology. However, existing approaches struggle to effectively utilize complex radiology reports for learning and offer limited interpretability through attention probability visualizations. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textbf{RadZero}$, a novel framework for VL alignment in chest X-ray with zero-shot multi-task capability. A key component of our approach is $\textbf{VL-CABS}$ ($\textbf{V}$ision-$\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{A}$ttention $\textbf{B}$ased on $\textbf{S}$imilarity), which aligns text embeddings with local image features for interpretable, fine-grained VL reasoning. RadZero leverages large language models to extract concise semantic sentences from radiology reports and employs multi-positive contrastive training to effectively capture relationships between images and multiple relevant textual descriptions. It uses a pre-trained vision encoder with additional trainable Transformer layers, allowing efficient high-resolution image processing. By computing similarity between text embeddings and local image patch features, VL-CABS enables zero-shot inference with similarity probability for classification, and pixel-level VL similarity maps for grounding and segmentation. Experimental results on public chest radiograph benchmarks show that RadZero outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification, grounding, and segmentation. Furthermore, VL similarity map analysis highlights the potential of VL-CABS for improving explainability in VL alignment. Additionally, qualitative evaluation demonstrates RadZero's capability for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness in medical imaging.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charles Hong, Sahil Bhatia, Alvin Cheung, Yakun Sophia Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Hardware accelerators, especially those designed for tensor processing, have become ubiquitous in today's computing landscape. However, even with significant efforts in building compilers, programming these tensor accelerators remains challenging, leaving much of their potential underutilized. Recently, large language models (LLMs), trained on large amounts of code, have shown significant promise in code generation and optimization tasks, but generating low-resource languages, such as specialized tensor accelerator code still poses a significant challenge. We tackle this challenge with Autocomp, an approach that empowers accelerator programmers to leverage domain knowledge and hardware feedback to optimize code via an automated LLM-driven search. We accomplish this by: 1) formulating each optimization pass as a structured two-phase prompt, divided into planning and code generation phases, 2) inserting domain knowledge during planning via a concise and adaptable optimization menu, and 3) integrating correctness and performance metrics from hardware as feedback at each search iteration. Across three distinct hardware platforms, we demonstrate that Autocomp-optimized code runs 5.6x faster than the vendor-provided library (Gemmini), outperforms expert-level hand-tuned code by 1.9x (AWS Trainium), and achieves 3.8x higher performance than a machine learning-based cost model for GPUs (NVIDIA L40S). Additionally, we demonstrate that optimization schedules generated from Autocomp can be reused across similar tensor operations, improving speedups by up to 24% under a fixed sample budget.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising cornerstone for the development of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). However, ensuring the robustness of LLMs remains a critical challenge. To address these challenges and advance the field, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of current studies in this area. First, we systematically examine the nature of robustness in LLMs, including its conceptual foundations, the importance of consistent performance across diverse inputs, and the implications of failure modes in real-world applications. Next, we analyze the sources of non-robustness, categorizing intrinsic model limitations, data-driven vulnerabilities, and external adversarial factors that compromise reliability. Following this, we review state-of-the-art mitigation strategies, and then we discuss widely adopted benchmarks, emerging metrics, and persistent gaps in assessing real-world reliability. Finally, we synthesize findings from existing surveys and interdisciplinary studies to highlight trends, unresolved issues, and pathways for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Futoshi Futami, Masahiro Fujisawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent variables (LVs) play a crucial role in encoder-decoder models by enabling effective data compression, prediction, and generation. Although their theoretical properties, such as generalization, have been extensively studied in supervised learning, similar analyses for unsupervised models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) remain insufficiently underexplored. In this work, we extend information-theoretic generalization analysis to vector-quantized (VQ) VAEs with discrete latent spaces, introducing a novel data-dependent prior to rigorously analyze the relationship among LVs, generalization, and data generation. We derive a novel generalization error bound of the reconstruction loss of VQ-VAEs, which depends solely on the complexity of LVs and the encoder, independent of the decoder. Additionally, we provide the upper bound of the 2-Wasserstein distance between the distributions of the true data and the generated data, explaining how the regularization of the LVs contributes to the data generation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R\'ois\'in Luo, James McDermott, Colm O'Riordan</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for deriving the general $n$-th order Fr\'echet derivatives of singular values in real rectangular matrices, by leveraging reduced resolvent operators from Kato's analytic perturbation theory for self-adjoint operators. Deriving closed-form expressions for higher-order derivatives of singular values is notoriously challenging through standard matrix-analysis techniques. To overcome this, we treat a real rectangular matrix as a compact operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, and embed the rectangular matrix into a block self-adjoint operator so that non-symmetric perturbations are captured. Applying Kato's asymptotic eigenvalue expansion to this construction, we obtain a general, closed-form expression for the infinitesimal $n$-th order spectral variations. Specializing to $n=2$ and deploying on a Kronecker-product representation with matrix convention yield the Hessian of a singular value, not found in literature. By bridging abstract operator-theoretic perturbation theory with matrices, our framework equips researchers with a practical toolkit for higher-order spectral sensitivity studies in random matrix applications (e.g., adversarial perturbation in deep learning).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaifeng Zhang, Baoyu Li, Kris Hauser, Yunzhu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes, while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators, particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anamika Lochab, Lu Yan, Patrick Pynadath, Xiangyu Zhang, Ruqi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of API-only access to state-of-the-art LLMs highlights the need for effective black-box jailbreak methods to identify model vulnerabilities in real-world settings. Without a principled objective for gradient-based optimization, most existing approaches rely on genetic algorithms, which are limited by their initialization and dependence on manually curated prompt pools. Furthermore, these methods require individual optimization for each prompt, failing to provide a comprehensive characterization of model vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VERA: Variational infErence fRamework for jAilbreaking. VERA casts black-box jailbreak prompting as a variational inference problem, training a small attacker LLM to approximate the target LLM's posterior over adversarial prompts. Once trained, the attacker can generate diverse, fluent jailbreak prompts for a target query without re-optimization. Experimental results show that VERA achieves strong performance across a range of target LLMs, highlighting the value of probabilistic inference for adversarial prompt generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingting Yao, Qinghao Hu, Fei Zhou, Tielong Liu, Gang Li, Peisong Wang, Jian Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets, including the static CIFAR and ImageNet datasets and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS, DVS-GESTURE, and SHD datasets, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69% accuracy gain and 4.16x lower bit budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be open-sourced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Windisch, Thomas K\"ohler, Lukas Radl, Michael Steiner, Dieter Schmalstieg, Markus Steinberger</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a high-performance technique for novel view synthesis, enabling real-time rendering and high-quality reconstruction of small scenes. However, scaling to larger environments has so far relied on partitioning the scene into chunks -- a strategy that introduces artifacts at chunk boundaries, complicates training across varying scales, and is poorly suited to unstructured scenarios such as city-scale flyovers combined with street-level views. Moreover, rendering remains fundamentally limited by GPU memory, as all visible chunks must reside in VRAM simultaneously. We introduce A LoD of Gaussians, a framework for training and rendering ultra-large-scale Gaussian scenes on a single consumer-grade GPU -- without partitioning. Our method stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a Level-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the relevant Gaussians. A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with Sequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a lightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to support real-time streaming and rendering. Together, these innovations enable seamless multi-scale reconstruction and interactive visualization of complex scenes -- from broad aerial views to fine-grained ground-level details.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binh Huy Nguyen, Matti Schneider</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving cell problems in homogenization is hard, and available deep-learning frameworks fail to match the speed and generality of traditional computational frameworks. More to the point, it is generally unclear what to expect of machine-learning approaches, let alone single out which approaches are promising. In the work at hand, we advocate Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for micromechanics, empowering them by insights from computational micromechanics methods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We construct an FNO surrogate mimicking the basic scheme foundational for FFT-based methods and show that the resulting operator predicts solutions to cell problems with arbitrary stiffness distribution only subject to a material-contrast constraint up to a desired accuracy. In particular, there are no restrictions on the material symmetry like isotropy, on the number of phases and on the geometry of the interfaces between materials. Also, the provided fidelity is sharp and uniform, providing explicit guarantees leveraging our physical empowerment of FNOs. To show the desired universal approximation property, we construct an FNO explicitly that requires no training to begin with. Still, the obtained neural operator complies with the same memory requirements as the basic scheme and comes with runtimes proportional to classical FFT solvers. In particular, large-scale problems with more than 100 million voxels are readily handled. The goal of this work is to underline the potential of FNOs for solving micromechanical problems, linking FFT-based methods to FNOs. This connection is expected to provide a fruitful exchange between both worlds.</p>

<p>Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) has emerged as a key area in AI for law, aiming to automate judicial outcome forecasting and enhance interpretability in legal reasoning. While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on internal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook a core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions and judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic courtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions, relevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases. NyayaRAG evaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in predicting court decisions and generating legal explanations using a domain-specific pipeline tailored to the Indian legal system. We assess performance across various input configurations using both standard lexical and semantic metrics as well as LLM-based evaluators such as G-Eval. Our results show that augmenting factual inputs with structured legal knowledge significantly improves both predictive accuracy and explanation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kang-Hyun Lee, Faez Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: A major obstacle to establishing reliable structure-property (SP) linkages in materials engineering is the scarcity of diverse 3D microstructure datasets. Limited dataset availability and insufficient control over the analysis and design space restrict the variety of achievable microstructure morphologies, hindering progress in solving the inverse (property-to-structure) design problem. To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion framework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D data. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion sampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and coherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original data. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion (2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data, effective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the generation process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad integrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable score loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment terms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent space, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation. Consequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D microstructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural descriptors and material properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafa{\l} Osadnik, Pablo G\'omez, Eleni Bohacek, Rickbir Bahia</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents a new dataset for the Martian digital elevation model prediction task, ready for machine learning applications called MCTED. The dataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a dataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very diverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity of the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts and missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to solve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training and validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to avoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical image patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were originally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the dataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide statistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial distribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and more. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and compare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model, DepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction. We find that even a very small architecture trained on this dataset specifically, beats a zero-shot performance of a depth estimation foundation model like DepthAnythingV2. We make the dataset and code used for its generation completely open source in public repositories.</p>

FLOWR:root achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional 3D molecule generation and pocket-conditional ligand design, producing geometrically realistic, low-strain structures. The integrated affinity prediction module demonstrates superior accuracy on the SPINDR test set and outperforms recent models on the Schrodinger FEP+/OpenFE benchmark with substantial speed advantages. As a foundation model, FLOWR:root requires finetuning on project-specific datasets to account for unseen structure-activity landscapes, yielding strong correlation with experimental data. Joint generation and affinity prediction enable inference-time scaling through importance sampling, steering molecular design toward higher-affinity compounds. Case studies validate this: selective CK2$\alpha$ ligand generation against CLK3 shows significant correlation between predicted and quantum-mechanical binding energies, while ER$\alpha$, TYK2 and BACE1 scaffold elaboration demonstrates strong agreement with QM calculations. By integrating structure-aware generation, affinity estimation, and property-guided sampling, FLOWR:root provides a comprehensive foundation for structure-based drug design spanning hit identification through lead optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Jia, Xiao Wang, Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan</p>
<p>Abstract: Although LLMs have demonstrated improved performance by scaling parallel test-time compute, doing so relies on generating reasoning paths that are both diverse and accurate. For challenging problems, the forking tokens that trigger diverse yet correct reasoning modes are typically deep in the sampling tree. Consequently, common strategies to encourage diversity, such as temperature scaling, encounter a worsened trade-off between diversity and accuracy. Motivated by this challenge, we treat parallel reasoning as a set-of-next-token-prediction problem, and incorporate a set-based global loss into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using self-supervised bipartite matching between our global forking tokens and unique reasoning traces. We observe that, while naive fine-tuning with multiple reasoning traces collapses these unique reasoning modes, our proposed method, Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT), preserves these modes and produces emergent global forking tokens. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our SSFT consistently outperforms SFT under both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erjia Xiao, Lingfeng Zhang, Yingbo Tang, Hao Cheng, Renjing Xu, Wenbo Ding, Lei Zhou, Long Chen, Hangjun Ye, Xiaoshuai Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Social Navigation Track. This track focuses on developing RGBD-based perception and navigation systems that enable autonomous agents to navigate safely, efficiently, and socially compliantly in dynamic human-populated indoor environments. The challenge requires agents to operate from an egocentric perspective using only onboard sensors including RGB-D observations and odometry, without access to global maps or privileged information, while maintaining social norm compliance such as safe distances and collision avoidance. Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive collision avoidance behaviors. The evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark demonstrates that our method improves the agent's ability to maintain personal space compliance while navigating toward goals in crowded indoor scenes with dynamic human agents, achieving 2nd place among 16 participating teams in the challenge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emilio Estevan, Mar\'ia Sierra-Torralba, Eduardo L\'opez-Larraz, Luis Montesano</p>
<p>Abstract: Wearable EEG devices have emerged as a promising alternative to polysomnography (PSG). As affordable and scalable solutions, their widespread adoption results in the collection of massive volumes of unlabeled data that cannot be analyzed by clinicians at scale. Meanwhile, the recent success of deep learning for sleep scoring has relied on large annotated datasets. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers an opportunity to bridge this gap, leveraging unlabeled signals to address label scarcity and reduce annotation effort. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of SSL for sleep staging using wearable EEG. We investigate a range of well-established SSL methods and evaluate them on two sleep databases acquired with the Ikon Sleep wearable EEG headband: BOAS, a high-quality benchmark containing PSG and wearable EEG recordings with consensus labels, and HOGAR, a large collection of home-based, self-recorded, and unlabeled recordings. Three evaluation scenarios are defined to study label efficiency, representation quality, and cross-dataset generalization. Results show that SSL consistently improves classification performance by up to 10% over supervised baselines, with gains particularly evident when labeled data is scarce. SSL achieves clinical-grade accuracy above 80% leveraging only 5% to 10% of labeled data, while the supervised approach requires twice the labels. Additionally, SSL representations prove robust to variations in population characteristics, recording environments, and signal quality. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SSL to enable label-efficient sleep staging with wearable EEG, reducing reliance on manual annotations and advancing the development of affordable sleep monitoring systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hieu Le Duc, Leo Liberti</p>
<p>Abstract: During 2024 and 2025 the discussion about the theorem-proving capabilities of large language models started reporting interesting success stories, mostly to do with difficult exercises (such as problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad), but also with conjectures [Feldman & Karbasi, arXiv:2509.18383v1] formulated for the purpose of verifying whether the artificial intelligence could prove it. In this paper we report a theorem proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology is by no means complete or exact. It was nonetheless able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close about a third of the sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences, 2025].</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anjie Liu, Jianhong Wang, Samuel Kaski, Jun Wang, Mengyue Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Steering cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) towards desired outcomes is challenging, particularly when the global guidance from a human on the whole multi-agent system is impractical in a large-scale MARL. On the other hand, designing external mechanisms (e.g., intrinsic rewards and human feedback) to coordinate agents mostly relies on empirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the above issues. First, we introduce the concept of MARL interaction paradigms (orthogonal to MARL learning paradigms), using MAIDs to analyze and visualize both unguided self-organization and global guidance mechanisms in MARL. Then, we design a new MARL interaction paradigm, referred to as the targeted intervention paradigm that is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance can be mitigated. In implementation, we introduce a causal inference technique, referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI), to realize the targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning paradigm is workable under the design of an MARL interaction paradigm. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiyu Luo, Haodong Li, Xinxing Cheng, He Zhao, Yang Hu, Xuan Song, Tianyang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-to-image translation models have achieved notable success in converting images across visual domains and are increasingly used for medical tasks such as predicting post-operative outcomes and modeling disease progression. However, most existing methods primarily aim to match the target distribution and often neglect spatial correspondences between the source and translated images. This limitation can lead to structural inconsistencies and hallucinations, undermining the reliability and interpretability of the predictions. These challenges are accentuated in clinical applications by the stringent requirement for anatomical accuracy. In this work, we present TraceTrans, a novel deformable image translation model designed for post-operative prediction that generates images aligned with the target distribution while explicitly revealing spatial correspondences with the pre-operative input. The framework employs an encoder for feature extraction and dual decoders for predicting spatial deformations and synthesizing the translated image. The predicted deformation field imposes spatial constraints on the generated output, ensuring anatomical consistency with the source. Extensive experiments on medical cosmetology and brain MRI datasets demonstrate that TraceTrans delivers accurate and interpretable post-operative predictions, highlighting its potential for reliable clinical deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Chen, Jayesh Gajbhar, Gregory Dusek, Rob Redmon, Patrick Hogan, Paul Liu, DelWayne Bohnenstiehl, Dongkuan Xu, Ruoying He</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming the sciences, yet general conversational AI systems often generate unverified "hallucinations" undermining scientific rigor. We present OceanAI, a conversational platform that integrates the natural-language fluency of open-source large language models (LLMs) with real-time, parameterized access to authoritative oceanographic data streams hosted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Each query such as "What was Boston Harbor's highest water level in 2024?" triggers real-time API calls that identify, parse, and synthesize relevant datasets into reproducible natural-language responses and data visualizations. In a blind comparison with three widely used AI chat-interface products, only OceanAI produced NOAA-sourced values with original data references; others either declined to answer or provided unsupported results. Designed for extensibility, OceanAI connects to multiple NOAA data products and variables, supporting applications in marine hazard forecasting, ecosystem assessment, and water-quality monitoring. By grounding outputs and verifiable observations, OceanAI advances transparency, reproducibility, and trust, offering a scalable framework for AI-enabled decision support within the oceans.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinliang Liu, Tong Mao, Jinchao Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present an estimation of the condition numbers of the \emph{mass} and \emph{stiffness} matrices arising from shallow ReLU$^k$ neural networks defined on the unit sphere~$\mathbb{S}^d$. In particular, when $\{\theta_j^*\}_{j=1}^n \subset \mathbb{S}^d$ is \emph{antipodally quasi-uniform}, the condition number is sharp. Indeed, in this case, we obtain sharp asymptotic estimates for the full spectrum of eigenvalues and characterize the structure of the corresponding eigenspaces, showing that the smallest eigenvalues are associated with an eigenbasis of low-degree polynomials while the largest eigenvalues are linked to high-degree polynomials. This spectral analysis establishes a precise correspondence between the approximation power of the network and its numerical stability.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02818">Orion-MSP: Multi-Scale Sparse Attention for Tabular In-Context Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Bouadi, Pratinav Seth, Aditya Tanna, Vinay Kumar Sankarapu</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular data remain the predominant format for real-world applications. Yet, developing effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to heterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple scales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN and TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However, current architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature processing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with quadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component processing that prevents iterative representation refinement and cross-component communication. To address these challenges, we introduce Orion-MSP, a tabular ICL architecture featuring three key innovations: (1) multi-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2) block-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for scalable efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style memory enabling safe bidirectional information flow across components. Across diverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new standard for efficient tabular in-context learning. The model is publicly available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/Orion-MSP .</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03179">Toward Autonomous Engineering Design: A Knowledge-Guided Multi-Agent Framework</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Varun Kumar, George Em Karniadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains, leading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements. Traditional methods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this, we formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework that integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces specialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine design candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the aerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of three key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems Engineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to construct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature. The Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical requirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer leverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose candidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and provides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge graph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the manager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics such as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how collaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gonzalo Mena, Arun Kumar Kuchibhotla, Larry Wasserman</p>
<p>Abstract: Rectified flow (Liu et al., 2022; Liu, 2022; Wu et al., 2023) is a method for defining a transport map between two distributions, and enjoys popularity in machine learning, although theoretical results supporting the validity of these methods are scant. The rectified flow can be regarded as an approximation to optimal transport, but in contrast to other transport methods that require optimization over a function space, computing the rectified flow only requires standard statistical tools such as regression or density estimation. Because of this, one can leverage standard data analysis tools for regression and density estimation to develop empirical versions of transport maps. We study some structural properties of the rectified flow, including existence, uniqueness, and regularity, as well as the related statistical properties, such as rates of convergence and central limit theorems, for some selected estimators. To do so, we analyze separately the bounded and unbounded cases as each presents unique challenges. In both cases, we are able to establish convergence at faster rates than the ones for the usual nonparametric regression and density estimation.</p>
