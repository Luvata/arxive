<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: The paper presents our work on cross-lingual ontology alignment system which uses embedding based cosine similarity matching. The ontology entities are made contextually richer by creating descriptions using novel techniques. We use a fine-tuned transformer based multilingual model for generating better embeddings. We use cosine similarity to find positive ontology entities pairs and then apply threshold filtering to retain only highly similar entities. We have evaluated our work on OAEI-2022 multifarm track. We achieve 71% F1 score (78% recall and 65% precision) on the evaluation dataset, 16% increase from best baseline score. This suggests that our proposed alignment pipeline is able to capture the subtle cross-lingual similarities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ismail Ahmad Abdullah</p>
<p>Abstract: Contemporary AI systems achieve extraordinary performance yet remain opaque and non-verifiable, creating a crisis of trust for safety-critical deployment. We introduce MathLedger, a substrate for verifiable machine cognition that integrates formal verification, cryptographic attestation, and learning dynamics into a single epistemic loop. The system implements Reflexive Formal Learning (RFL), a symbolic analogue of gradient descent where updates are driven by verifier outcomes rather than statistical loss.
  Phase I experiments validate the measurement and governance substrate under controlled conditions. CAL-EXP-3 validates measurement infrastructure (Delta p computation, variance tracking); separate stress tests confirm fail-closed governance triggers correctly under out-of-bounds conditions. No convergence or capability claims are made. The contribution is infrastructural: a working prototype of ledger-attested learning that enables auditability at scale.
  Keywords: verifiable learning, formal verification, cryptographic attestation, reflexive feedback, fail-closed governance</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chandra Sekhar Kubam</p>
<p>Abstract: Significant digitalization of financial services in a short period of time has led to an urgent demand to have autonomous, transparent and real-time credit risk decision making systems. The traditional machine learning models are effective in pattern recognition, but do not have the adaptive reasoning, situational awareness, and autonomy needed in modern financial operations. As a proposal, this paper presents an Agentic AI framework, or a system where AI agents view the world of dynamic credit independent of human observers, who then make actions based on their articulable decision-making paths. The research introduces a multi-agent system with reinforcing learning, natural language reasoning, explainable AI modules, and real-time data absorption pipelines as a means of assessing the risk profiles of borrowers with few humans being involved. The processes consist of agent collaboration protocol, risk-scoring engines, interpretability layers, and continuous feedback learning cycles. Findings indicate that decision speed, transparency and responsiveness is better than traditional credit scoring models. Nevertheless, there are still some practical limitations such as risks of model drift, inconsistencies in interpreting high dimensional data and regulatory uncertainties as well as infrastructure limitations in low-resource settings. The suggested system has a high prospective to transform credit analytics and future studies ought to be directed on dynamic regulatory compliance mobilizers, new agent teamwork, adversarial robustness, and large-scale implementation in cross-country credit ecosystems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao An</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models face a fundamental tension between context window limits and information fidelity in long conversations. Existing approaches--truncation and summarization--either discard early information or lose nuanced details. We introduce CogCanvas, a training-free framework that extracts verbatim-grounded cognitive artifacts (decisions, facts, reminders) from conversation turns and organizes them into a temporal-aware graph for compression-resistant retrieval.
  On the LoCoMo benchmark, CogCanvas achieves 34.7% overall accuracy, outperforming RAG (25.6%, +9.1pp) and GraphRAG (13.7%, +21.0pp). The advantage is most pronounced on temporal reasoning: 31.5% vs. 9.3% (RAG) and 5.0% (GraphRAG)--a +530% relative improvement. On multi-hop causal reasoning, CogCanvas achieves 81.0% pass rate vs. 40.0% for GraphRAG (+41.0pp). Controlled benchmarks show 97.5% recall (+78.5pp vs. summarization) with 93.0% exact match preservation.
  While heavily-optimized approaches achieve higher absolute scores through dedicated training (EverMemOS: approximately 92%), our training-free approach provides practitioners with an immediately-deployable alternative that significantly outperforms standard baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Austin R. Ellis-Mohr, Max Hartman, Lav R. Varshney</p>
<p>Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have heterogeneous inference energy costs based on which model is used and how much it reasons. To reduce energy, it is important to choose the right LRM and operate it in the right way. As a result, the performance of systems that dispatch tasks to different individual LRMs depend on the balance between mean energy provisioning and stochastic fluctuations. The critical regime is the unique operating point at which neither auxiliary energy nor baseline energy is systematically wasted. Increasing baseline supply shifts the system toward persistent over-supply and baseline-energy waste, while reducing supply induces persistent reliance on auxiliary energy. Yet in this regime, performance remains volatility-limited and so a second-order characterization provides further insights that we develop. Here, performance is governed by how variability is absorbed across time, models, and execution choices. This perspective highlights variance-aware routing and dispatch as a principled design axis, and provides a theoretical basis for developing energy-aware model routing policies. Routing behavior is characterized when dispatch policies are based on training-compute and inference-compute scaling laws for LRMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00828">Decomposing LLM Self-Correction: The Accuracy-Correction Paradox and Error Depth Hypothesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely believed to possess self-correction capabilities, yet recent studies suggest that intrinsic self-correction--where models correct their own outputs without external feedback--remains largely ineffective. In this work, we systematically decompose self-correction into three distinct sub-capabilities: error detection, error localization, and error correction. Through cross-model experiments on GSM8K-Complex (n=500 per model, 346 total errors) with three major LLMs, we uncover a striking Accuracy-Correction Paradox: weaker models (GPT-3.5, 66% accuracy) achieve 1.6x higher intrinsic correction rates than stronger models (DeepSeek, 94% accuracy)--26.8% vs 16.7%. We propose the Error Depth Hypothesis: stronger models make fewer but deeper errors that resist self-correction. Error detection rates vary dramatically across architectures (10% to 82%), yet detection capability does not predict correction success--Claude detects only 10% of errors but corrects 29% intrinsically. Surprisingly, providing error location hints hurts all models. Our findings challenge linear assumptions about model capability and self-improvement, with important implications for the design of self-refinement pipelines.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00830">Can We Trust AI Explanations? Evidence of Systematic Underreporting in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Deep Pankajbhai Mehta</p>
<p>Abstract: When AI systems explain their reasoning step-by-step, practitioners often assume these explanations reveal what actually influenced the AI's answer. We tested this assumption by embedding hints into questions and measuring whether models mentioned them. In a study of over 9,000 test cases across 11 leading AI models, we found a troubling pattern: models almost never mention hints spontaneously, yet when asked directly, they admit noticing them. This suggests models see influential information but choose not to report it. Telling models they are being watched does not help. Forcing models to report hints works, but causes them to report hints even when none exist and reduces their accuracy. We also found that hints appealing to user preferences are especially dangerous-models follow them most often while reporting them least. These findings suggest that simply watching AI reasoning is not enough to catch hidden influences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayda Aghaei Nia</p>
<p>Abstract: While Deep Learning has improved Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) decoding accuracy, clinical adoption is hindered by the "Black Box" nature of these algorithms, leading to user frustration and poor neuroplasticity outcomes. We propose OmniNeuro, a novel HCI framework that transforms the BCI from a silent decoder into a transparent feedback partner. OmniNeuro integrates three interpretability engines: (1) Physics (Energy), (2) Chaos (Fractal Complexity), and (3) Quantum-Inspired uncertainty modeling. These metrics drive real-time Neuro-Sonification and Generative AI Clinical Reports. Evaluated on the PhysioNet dataset ($N=109$), the system achieved a mean accuracy of 58.52%, with qualitative pilot studies ($N=3$) confirming that explainable feedback helps users regulate mental effort and reduces the "trial-and-error" phase. OmniNeuro is decoder-agnostic, acting as an essential interpretability layer for any state-of-the-art architecture.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00845">Enhancing Temporal Awareness in LLMs for Temporal Point Processes</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lili Chen, Wensheng Gan, Shuang Liang, Philip S. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are crucial for analyzing events over time and are widely used in fields such as finance, healthcare, and social systems. These processes are particularly valuable for understanding how events unfold over time, accounting for their irregularity and dependencies. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in sequence modeling, applying them to temporal point processes remains challenging. A key issue is that current methods struggle to effectively capture the complex interaction between temporal information and semantic context, which is vital for accurate event modeling. In this context, we introduce TPP-TAL (Temporal Point Processes with Enhanced Temporal Awareness in LLMs), a novel plug-and-play framework designed to enhance temporal reasoning within LLMs. Rather than using the conventional method of simply concatenating event time and type embeddings, TPP-TAL explicitly aligns temporal dynamics with contextual semantics before feeding this information into the LLM. This alignment allows the model to better perceive temporal dependencies and long-range interactions between events and their surrounding contexts. Through comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, it is shown that TPP-TAL delivers substantial improvements in temporal likelihood estimation and event prediction accuracy, highlighting the importance of enhancing temporal awareness in LLMs for continuous-time event modeling.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ron F. Del Rosario</p>
<p>Abstract: We present an openly documented methodology for fine-tuning language models to detect temporal attack patterns in multi-agent AI workflows using OpenTelemetry trace analysis. We curate a dataset of 80,851 examples from 18 public cybersecurity sources and 35,026 synthetic OpenTelemetry traces. We apply iterative QLoRA fine-tuning on resource-constrained ARM64 hardware (NVIDIA DGX Spark) through three training iterations with strategic augmentation. Our custom benchmark accuracy improves from 42.86% to 74.29%, a statistically significant 31.4-point gain. Targeted examples addressing specific knowledge gaps outperform indiscriminate scaling. Key contributions include: (1) synthetic trace generation methodology for multi-agent coordination attacks and regulatory violations, (2) empirical evidence that training data composition fundamentally determines behavior, and (3) complete open release of datasets, training scripts, and evaluation benchmarks on HuggingFace. While practical deployment requires human oversight due to false positive rates, this work establishes the first reproducible framework enabling practitioners to build custom agentic security models adapted to their threat landscapes.</p>

We sincerely congratulate Kosmyna et al. for initiating such important research, collecting a valuable dataset, and establishing highly automated pipelines for Natural Language Processing (NLP) analyses and scoring. We aim to provide constructive comments that may improve the manuscript's readiness for peer-reviewed publication, as some results by Kosmyna et al. (2025) could be interpreted more conservatively. Our primary concerns focus on: (i) study design considerations, including the limited sample size; (ii) the reproducibility of the analyses; (iii) methodological issues related to the EEG analysis; (iv) inconsistencies in the reporting of results; and (v) limited transparency in several aspects of the study's procedures and findings.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00869">Cultural Encoding in Large Language Models: The Existence Gap in AI-Mediated Brand Discovery</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Huang Junyao, Situ Ruimin, Ye Renqin</p>
<p>Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate consumer information discovery,
  brands face algorithmic invisibility. This study investigates Cultural Encoding in Large
  Language Models (LLMs) -- systematic differences in brand recommendations arising from
  training data composition. Analyzing 1,909 pure-English queries across 6 LLMs (GPT-4o,
  Claude, Gemini, Qwen3, DeepSeek, Doubao) and 30 brands, we find Chinese LLMs exhibit 30.6
  percentage points higher brand mention rates than International LLMs (88.9% vs. 58.3%,
  p<.001). This disparity persists in identical English queries, indicating training data
  geography -- not language -- drives the effect. We introduce the Existence Gap: brands
  absent from LLM training corpora lack "existence" in AI responses regardless of quality.
  Through a case study of Zhizibianjie (OmniEdge), a collaboration platform with 65.6%
  mention rate in Chinese LLMs but 0% in International models (p<.001), we demonstrate how
  Linguistic Boundary Barriers create invisible market entry obstacles. Theoretically, we
  contribute the Data Moat Framework, conceptualizing AI-visible content as a VRIN strategic
  resource. We operationalize Algorithmic Omnipresence -- comprehensive brand visibility
  across LLM knowledge bases -- as the strategic objective for Generative Engine Optimization
  (GEO). Managerially, we provide an 18-month roadmap for brands to build Data Moats
  through semantic coverage, technical depth, and cultural localization. Our findings reveal
  that in AI-mediated markets, the limits of a brand's "Data Boundaries" define the limits
  of its "Market Frontiers."</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony Mikinka</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Universal Conditional Logic (UCL), a mathematical framework for prompt optimization that transforms prompt engineering from heuristic practice into systematic optimization. Through systematic evaluation (N=305, 11 models, 4 iterations), we demonstrate significant token reduction (29.8%, t(10)=6.36, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 2.01) with corresponding cost savings. UCL's structural overhead function O_s(A) explains version-specific performance differences through the Over-Specification Paradox: beyond threshold S* = 0.509, additional specification degrades performance quadratically. Core mechanisms -- indicator functions (I_i in {0,1}), structural overhead (O_s = gamma * sum(ln C_k)), early binding -- are validated. Notably, optimal UCL configuration varies by model architecture -- certain models (e.g., Llama 4 Scout) require version-specific adaptations (V4.1). This work establishes UCL as a calibratable framework for efficient LLM interaction, with model-family-specific optimization as a key research direction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mandar Parab</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work on language model self-improvement shows that models can refine their own reasoning through reflection, verification, debate, or self-generated rewards. However, most existing approaches rely on external critics, learned reward models, or ensemble sampling, which increases complexity and training instability. We propose Counterfactual Self-Questioning, a framework in which a single language model generates and evaluates counterfactual critiques of its own reasoning. The method produces an initial reasoning trace, formulates targeted questions that challenge potential failure points, and generates alternative reasoning trajectories that expose incorrect assumptions or invalid steps. These counterfactual trajectories provide structured relative feedback that can be directly used for policy optimization without auxiliary models. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that counterfactual self-questioning improves accuracy and training stability, particularly for smaller models, enabling scalable self-improvement using internally generated supervision alone.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00923">Context Collapse: In-Context Learning and Model Collapse</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Josef Ott</p>
<p>Abstract: This thesis investigates two key phenomena in large language models (LLMs): in-context learning (ICL) and model collapse. We study ICL in a linear transformer with tied weights trained on linear regression tasks, and show that minimising the in-context loss leads to a phase transition in the learned parameters. Above a critical context length, the solution develops a skew-symmetric component. We prove this by reducing the forward pass of the linear transformer under weight tying to preconditioned gradient descent, and then analysing the optimal preconditioner. This preconditioner includes a skew-symmetric component, which induces a rotation of the gradient direction. For model collapse, we use martingale and random walk theory to analyse simplified settings - linear regression and Gaussian fitting - under both replacing and cumulative data regimes. We strengthen existing results by proving almost sure convergence, showing that collapse occurs unless the data grows sufficiently fast or is retained over time. Finally, we introduce the notion of context collapse: a degradation of context during long generations, especially in chain-of-thought reasoning. This concept links the dynamics of ICL with long-term stability challenges in generative models.</p>

By grounding our experiments in a realistic environment, we aimed to overcome the limitations of game-based simulations often used in prior research. We observed the comprehensive use of 25 specific persuasion techniques across most tested LLMs, encompassing a wider range than previously reported. The variations in technique usage and overall persuasion output between models highlight how different model architectures and training can impact the dynamics in realistic social simulations. Additionally, we observed unique phenomena such as "kernel of truth" messages and spontaneous developments with an "ink" obsession, where agents collectively demanded written proof. Our study provides a foundation for evaluating persuasive LLM agents in real-world contexts, ensuring alignment and preventing dangerous outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wuzhenghong Wen, Chao Xue, Su Pan, Yuwei Sun, Minlong Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) involves multi-hop reasoning over temporally constrained entity relationships in the knowledge graph to answer a given question. However, at each hop, large language models (LLMs) retrieve subgraphs with numerous temporally similar and semantically complex relations, increasing the risk of suboptimal decisions and error propagation. To address these challenges, we propose the multi-hop reasoning enhanced (MRE) framework, which enhances both forward and backward reasoning to improve the identification of globally optimal reasoning trajectories. Specifically, MRE begins with prompt engineering to guide the LLM in generating diverse reasoning trajectories for a given question. Valid reasoning trajectories are then selected for supervised fine-tuning, serving as a cold-start strategy. Finally, we introduce Tree-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO), a recursive, tree-structured learning-by-exploration approach. At each hop, exploration establishes strong causal dependencies on the previous hop, while evaluation is informed by multi-path exploration feedback from subsequent hops. Experimental results on two TKGQA benchmarks indicate that the proposed MRE-based model consistently surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in handling complex multi-hop queries. Further analysis highlights improved interpretability and robustness to noisy temporal annotations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keith Frankston, Benjamin Howard</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a recursive AlphaZero-style Monte--Carlo tree search algorithm, "RMCTS". The advantage of RMCTS over AlphaZero's MCTS-UCB is speed. In RMCTS, the search tree is explored in a breadth-first manner, so that network inferences naturally occur in large batches. This significantly reduces the GPU latency cost. We find that RMCTS is often more than 40 times faster than MCTS-UCB when searching a single root state, and about 3 times faster when searching a large batch of root states.
  The recursion in RMCTS is based on computing optimized posterior policies at each game state in the search tree, starting from the leaves and working back up to the root. Here we use the posterior policy explored in "Monte--Carlo tree search as regularized policy optimization" (Grill, et al.) Their posterior policy is the unique policy which maximizes the expected reward given estimated action rewards minus a penalty for diverging from the prior policy.
  The tree explored by RMCTS is not defined in an adaptive manner, as it is in MCTS-UCB. Instead, the RMCTS tree is defined by following prior network policies at each node. This is a disadvantage, but the speedup advantage is more significant, and in practice we find that RMCTS-trained networks match the quality of MCTS-UCB-trained networks in roughly one-third of the training time. We include timing and quality comparisons of RMCTS vs. MCTS-UCB for three games: Connect-4, Dots-and-Boxes, and Othello.</p>

<p>Abstract: Digital twins, as precise digital representations of physical systems, have evolved from passive simulation tools into intelligent and autonomous entities through the integration of artificial intelligence technologies. This paper presents a unified four-stage framework that systematically characterizes AI integration across the digital twin lifecycle, spanning modeling, mirroring, intervention, and autonomous management. By synthesizing existing technologies and practices, we distill a unified four-stage framework that systematically characterizes how AI methodologies are embedded across the digital twin lifecycle: (1) modeling the physical twin through physics-based and physics-informed AI approaches, (2) mirroring the physical system into a digital twin with real-time synchronization, (3) intervening in the physical twin through predictive modeling, anomaly detection, and optimization strategies, and (4) achieving autonomous management through large language models, foundation models, and intelligent agents. We analyze the synergy between physics-based modeling and data-driven learning, highlighting the shift from traditional numerical solvers to physics-informed and foundation models for physical systems. Furthermore, we examine how generative AI technologies, including large language models and generative world models, transform digital twins into proactive and self-improving cognitive systems capable of reasoning, communication, and creative scenario generation. Through a cross-domain review spanning eleven application domains, including healthcare, aerospace, smart manufacturing, robotics, and smart cities, we identify common challenges related to scalability, explainability, and trustworthiness, and outline directions for responsible AI-driven digital twin systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengji Tang, Weihao Lin, Jingqi Ye, Hao Li, Bo Zhang, Shuyue Hu, Tao Chen, Wangli Ouyang, Lei Bai, Peng Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced, with Gemini-3-Pro setting a new performance milestone. In this work, we explore collective intelligence as an alternative to monolithic scaling, and demonstrate that open-source LLMs' collaboration can surpass Gemini-3-Pro. We first revisit LLM routing and aggregation at scale and identify three key bottlenecks: (1) current train-free routers are limited by a query-based paradigm focusing solely on textual similarity; (2) recent aggregation methods remain largely static, failing to select appropriate aggregators for different tasks;(3) the complementarity of routing and aggregation remains underutilized. To address these problems, we introduce JiSi, a novel framework designed to release the full potential of LLMs' collaboration through three innovations: (1) Query-Response Mixed Routing capturing both semantic information and problem difficulty; (2) Support-Set-based Aggregator Selection jointly evaluating the aggregation and domain capacity of aggregators; (3) Adaptive Routing-Aggregation Switch dynamically leveraging the advantages of routing and aggregation. Comprehensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate that JiSi can surpass Gemini-3-Pro with only 47% costs by orchestrating ten open-source LLMs, while outperforming mainstream baselines. It suggests that collective intelligence represents a novel path towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaomeng Yang, Zhiyu Tan, Xiaohui Zhong, Mengping Yang, Qiusheng Huang, Lei Chen, Libo Wu, Hao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific discovery increasingly relies on integrating heterogeneous, high-dimensional data across disciplines nowadays. While AI models have achieved notable success across various scientific domains, they typically remain domain-specific or lack the capability of simultaneously understanding and generating multimodal scientific data, particularly for high-dimensional data. Yet, many pressing global challenges and scientific problems are inherently cross-disciplinary and require coordinated progress across multiple fields. Here, we present FuXi-Uni, a native unified multimodal model for scientific understanding and high-fidelity generation across scientific domains within a single architecture. Specifically, FuXi-Uni aligns cross-disciplinary scientific tokens within natural language tokens and employs science decoder to reconstruct scientific tokens, thereby supporting both natural language conversation and scientific numerical prediction. Empirically, we validate FuXi-Uni in Earth science and Biomedicine. In Earth system modeling, the model supports global weather forecasting, tropical cyclone (TC) forecast editing, and spatial downscaling driven by only language instructions. FuXi-Uni generates 10-day global forecasts at 0.25{\deg} resolution that outperform the SOTA physical forecasting system. It shows superior performance for both TC track and intensity prediction relative to the SOTA physical model, and generates high-resolution regional weather fields that surpass standard interpolation baselines. Regarding biomedicine, FuXi-Uni outperforms leading multimodal large language models on multiple biomedical visual question answering benchmarks. By unifying heterogeneous scientific modalities within a native shared latent space while maintaining strong domain-specific performance, FuXi-Uni provides a step forward more general-purpose, multimodal scientific models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixian Liu, Sihao Liu, Yuqi Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid adoption of multimodal large language models (MLMs) in autonomous agents, cross-platform task execution capabilities in educational settings have garnered significant attention. However, existing benchmark frameworks still exhibit notable deficiencies in supporting cross-platform tasks in educational contexts, especially when dealing with school-specific software (such as XiaoYa Intelligent Assistant, HuaShi XiaZi, etc.), where the efficiency of agents often significantly decreases due to a lack of understanding of the structural specifics of these private-domain software. Additionally, current evaluation methods heavily rely on coarse-grained metrics like goal orientation or trajectory matching, making it challenging to capture the detailed execution and efficiency of agents in complex tasks. To address these issues, we propose KGCE (Knowledge-Augmented Dual-Graph Evaluator for Cross-Platform Educational Agent Benchmarking with Multimodal Language Models), a novel benchmarking platform that integrates knowledge base enhancement and a dual-graph evaluation framework. We first constructed a dataset comprising 104 education-related tasks, covering Windows, Android, and cross-platform collaborative tasks. KGCE introduces a dual-graph evaluation framework that decomposes tasks into multiple sub-goals and verifies their completion status, providing fine-grained evaluation metrics. To overcome the execution bottlenecks of existing agents in private-domain tasks, we developed an enhanced agent system incorporating a knowledge base specific to school-specific software.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Yuan, Yilin Wu, Li Zhang, Zheng Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly used for financial classification due to their fast inference and local deployability. However, compared with large language models, SLMs are more prone to factual hallucinations in reasoning and exhibit weaker classification performance. This raises a natural question: Can mitigating factual hallucinations improve SLMs' financial classification? To address this, we propose a three-step pipeline named AAAI (Association Identification, Automated Detection, and Adaptive Inference). Experiments on three representative SLMs reveal that: (1) factual hallucinations are positively correlated with misclassifications; (2) encoder-based verifiers effectively detect factual hallucinations; and (3) incorporating feedback on factual errors enables SLMs' adaptive inference that enhances classification performance. We hope this pipeline contributes to trustworthy and effective applications of SLMs in finance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Dawoud, Osama El-Shamy</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating causal treatment effects in observational settings is frequently compromised by selection bias arising from unobserved confounders. While traditional econometric methods struggle when these confounders are orthogonal to structured covariates, high-dimensional unstructured text often contains rich proxies for these latent variables. This study proposes a Neural Network-Enhanced Double Machine Learning (DML) framework designed to leverage text embeddings for causal identification. Using a rigorous synthetic benchmark, we demonstrate that unstructured text embeddings capture critical confounding information that is absent from structured tabular data. However, we show that standard tree-based DML estimators retain substantial bias (+24%) due to their inability to model the continuous topology of embedding manifolds. In contrast, our deep learning approach reduces bias to -0.86% with optimized architectures, effectively recovering the ground-truth causal parameter. These findings suggest that deep learning architectures are essential for satisfying the unconfoundedness assumption when conditioning on high-dimensional natural language data</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01522">Bayesian Orchestration of Multi-LLM Agents for Cost-Aware Sequential Decision-Making</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Danial Amin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous decision agents in settings with asymmetric error costs: hiring (missed talent vs wasted interviews), medical triage (missed emergencies vs unnecessary escalation), and fraud detection (approved fraud vs declined legitimate payments). The dominant design queries a single LLM for a posterior over states, thresholds "confidence," and acts; we prove this is inadequate for sequential decisions with costs. We propose a Bayesian, cost-aware multi-LLM orchestration framework that treats LLMs as approximate likelihood models rather than classifiers. For each candidate state, we elicit likelihoods via contrastive prompting, aggregate across diverse models with robust statistics, and update beliefs with Bayes rule under explicit priors as new evidence arrives. This enables coherent belief updating, expected-cost action selection, principled information gathering via value of information, and fairness gains via ensemble bias mitigation. In resume screening with costs of 40000 USD per missed hire, 2500 USD per interview, and 150 USD per phone screen, experiments on 1000 resumes using five LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro, Grok, DeepSeek) reduce total cost by 294000 USD (34 percent) versus the best single-LLM baseline and improve demographic parity by 45 percent (max group gap 22 to 5 percentage points). Ablations attribute 51 percent of savings to multi-LLM aggregation, 43 percent to sequential updating, and 20 percent to disagreement-triggered information gathering, consistent with the theoretical benefits of correct probabilistic foundations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanzhe Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the progressive journey toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), current evaluation paradigms face an epistemological crisis. Static benchmarks measure knowledge breadth but fail to quantify the depth of belief. While Simhi et al. (2025) defined the CHOKE phenomenon in standard QA, we extend this framework to quantify "Cognitive Conviction" in System 2 reasoning models. We propose Project Aletheia, a cognitive physics framework that employs Tikhonov Regularization to invert the judge's confusion matrix. To validate this methodology without relying on opaque private data, we implement a Synthetic Proxy Protocol. Our preliminary pilot study on 2025 baselines (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1) suggests that while reasoning models act as a "cognitive buffer," they may exhibit "Defensive OverThinking" under adversarial pressure. Furthermore, we introduce the Aligned Conviction Score (S_aligned) to verify that conviction does not compromise safety. This work serves as a blueprint for measuring AI scientific integrity.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01546">Improving Behavioral Alignment in LLM Social Simulations via Context Formation and Navigation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Letian Kong (Jenny),  Qianran (Jenny),  Jin, Renyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human behavior in experimental settings, but they systematically diverge from human decisions in complex decision-making environments, where participants must anticipate others' actions and form beliefs based on observed behavior. We propose a two-stage framework for improving behavioral alignment. The first stage, context formation, explicitly specifies the experimental design to establish an accurate representation of the decision task and its context. The second stage, context navigation, guides the reasoning process within that representation to make decisions. We validate this framework through a focal replication of a sequential purchasing game with quality signaling (Kremer and Debo, 2016), extending to a crowdfunding game with costly signaling (Cason et al., 2025) and a demand-estimation task (Gui and Toubia, 2025) to test generalizability across decision environments. Across four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-4.0-Sonnet-Thinking, DeepSeek-R1), we find that complex decision-making environments require both stages to achieve behavioral alignment with human benchmarks, whereas the simpler demand-estimation task requires only context formation. Our findings clarify when each stage is necessary and provide a systematic approach for designing and diagnosing LLM social simulations as complements to human subjects in behavioral research.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Logics-STEM, a state-of-the-art reasoning model fine-tuned on Logics-STEM-SFT-Dataset, a high-quality and diverse dataset at 10M scale that represents one of the largest-scale open-source long chain-of-thought corpora. Logics-STEM targets reasoning tasks in the domains of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), and exhibits exceptional performance on STEM-related benchmarks with an average improvement of 4.68% over the next-best model at 8B scale. We attribute the gains to our data-algorithm co-design engine, where they are jointly optimized to fit a gold-standard distribution behind reasoning. Data-wise, the Logics-STEM-SFT-Dataset is constructed from a meticulously designed data curation engine with 5 stages to ensure the quality, diversity, and scalability, including annotation, deduplication, decontamination, distillation, and stratified sampling. Algorithm-wise, our failure-driven post-training framework leverages targeted knowledge retrieval and data synthesis around model failure regions in the Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) stage to effectively guide the second-stage SFT or the reinforcement learning (RL) for better fitting the target distribution. The superior empirical performance of Logics-STEM reveals the vast potential of combining large-scale open-source data with carefully designed synthetic data, underscoring the critical role of data-algorithm co-design in enhancing reasoning capabilities through post-training. We make both the Logics-STEM models (8B and 32B) and the Logics-STEM-SFT-Dataset (10M and downsampled 2.2M versions) publicly available to support future research in the open-source community.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly capable of complex task execution, yet current agentic systems remain constrained by text-centric paradigms. Traditional approaches rely on procedural JSON-based function calling, which often struggles with long-horizon tasks due to fragile multi-turn dependencies and context drift. In this paper, we present CaveAgent, a framework that transforms the paradigm from "LLM-as-Text-Generator" to "LLM-as-Runtime-Operator." We introduce a Dual-stream Context Architecture that decouples state management into a lightweight semantic stream for reasoning and a persistent, deterministic Python Runtime stream for execution. In addition to leveraging code generation to efficiently resolve interdependent sub-tasks (e.g., loops, conditionals) in a single step, we introduce \textit{Stateful Runtime Management} in CaveAgent. Distinct from existing code-based approaches that remain text-bound and lack the support for external object injection and retrieval, CaveAgent injects, manipulates, and retrieves complex Python objects (e.g., DataFrames, database connections) that persist across turns. This persistence mechanism acts as a high-fidelity external memory to eliminate context drift, avoid catastrophic forgetting, while ensuring that processed data flows losslessly to downstream applications. Comprehensive evaluations on Tau$^2$-bench, BFCL and various case studies across representative SOTA LLMs demonstrate CaveAgent's superiority. Specifically, our framework achieves a 10.5\% success rate improvement on retail tasks and reduces total token consumption by 28.4\% in multi-turn scenarios. On data-intensive tasks, direct variable storage and retrieval reduces token consumption by 59\%, allowing CaveAgent to handle large-scale data that causes context overflow failures in both JSON-based and Code-based agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Albert Sadowski, Jaros{\l}aw A. Chudziak</p>
<p>Abstract: Rule-based reasoning over natural language input arises in domains where decisions must be auditable and justifiable: clinical protocols specify eligibility criteria in prose, evidence rules define admissibility through textual conditions, and scientific standards dictate methodological requirements. Applying rules to such inputs demands both interpretive flexibility and formal guarantees. Large language models (LLMs) provide flexibility but cannot ensure consistent rule application; symbolic systems provide guarantees but require structured input. This paper presents an integration pattern that combines these strengths: LLMs serve as ontology population engines, translating unstructured text into ABox assertions according to expert-authored TBox specifications, while SWRL-based reasoners apply rules with deterministic guarantees. The framework decomposes reasoning into entity identification, assertion extraction, and symbolic verification, with task definitions grounded in OWL 2 ontologies. Experiments across three domains (legal hearsay determination, scientific method-task application, clinical trial eligibility) and eleven language models validate the approach. Structured decomposition achieves statistically significant improvements over few-shot prompting in aggregate, with gains observed across all three domains. An ablation study confirms that symbolic verification provides substantial benefit beyond structured prompting alone. The populated ABox integrates with standard semantic web tooling for inspection and querying, positioning the framework for richer inference patterns that simpler formalisms cannot express.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI agents -- systems that combine foundation models with reasoning, planning, memory, and tool use -- are rapidly becoming a practical interface between natural-language intent and real-world computation. This survey synthesizes the emerging landscape of AI agent architectures across: (i) deliberation and reasoning (e.g., chain-of-thought-style decomposition, self-reflection and verification, and constraint-aware decision making), (ii) planning and control (from reactive policies to hierarchical and multi-step planners), and (iii) tool calling and environment interaction (retrieval, code execution, APIs, and multimodal perception). We organize prior work into a unified taxonomy spanning agent components (policy/LLM core, memory, world models, planners, tool routers, and critics), orchestration patterns (single-agent vs.\ multi-agent; centralized vs.\ decentralized coordination), and deployment settings (offline analysis vs.\ online interactive assistance; safety-critical vs.\ open-ended tasks). We discuss key design trade-offs -- latency vs.\ accuracy, autonomy vs.\ controllability, and capability vs.\ reliability -- and highlight how evaluation is complicated by non-determinism, long-horizon credit assignment, tool and environment variability, and hidden costs such as retries and context growth. Finally, we summarize measurement and benchmarking practices (task suites, human preference and utility metrics, success under constraints, robustness and security) and identify open challenges including verification and guardrails for tool actions, scalable memory and context management, interpretability of agent decisions, and reproducible evaluation under realistic workloads.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid progress of artificial intelligence increasingly relies on efficient integrated circuit (IC) design. Recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for generating Register Transfer Level (RTL) code, but existing benchmarks mainly evaluate syntactic correctness rather than optimization quality in terms of power, performance, and area (PPA). This work introduces RTL-OPT, a benchmark for assessing the capability of LLMs in RTL optimization. RTL-OPT contains 36 handcrafted digital designs that cover diverse implementation categories including combinational logic, pipelined datapaths, finite state machines, and memory interfaces. Each task provides a pair of RTL codes, a suboptimal version and a human-optimized reference that reflects industry-proven optimization patterns not captured by conventional synthesis tools. Furthermore, RTL-OPT integrates an automated evaluation framework to verify functional correctness and quantify PPA improvements, enabling standardized and meaningful assessment of generative models for hardware design optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sai Varun Kodathala, Rakesh Vunnam</p>
<p>Abstract: Transcendental equations requiring iterative numerical solution pervade engineering practice, from fluid mechanics friction factor calculations to orbital position determination. We systematically evaluate whether Large Language Models can solve these equations through direct numerical prediction or whether a hybrid architecture combining LLM symbolic manipulation with classical iterative solvers proves more effective. Testing six state-of-the-art models (GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Gemini-3-Flash, Gemini-2.5-Lite, Claude-Sonnet-4.5, Claude-Opus-4.5) on 100 problems spanning seven engineering domains, we compare direct prediction against solver-assisted computation where LLMs formulate governing equations and provide initial conditions while Newton-Raphson iteration performs numerical solution. Direct prediction yields mean relative errors of 0.765 to 1.262 across models, while solver-assisted computation achieves 0.225 to 0.301, representing error reductions of 67.9% to 81.8%. Domain-specific analysis reveals dramatic improvements in Electronics (93.1%) due to exponential equation sensitivity, contrasted with modest gains in Fluid Mechanics (7.2%) where LLMs exhibit effective pattern recognition. These findings establish that contemporary LLMs excel at symbolic manipulation and domain knowledge retrieval but struggle with precision-critical iterative arithmetic, suggesting their optimal deployment as intelligent interfaces to classical numerical solvers rather than standalone computational engines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianjun Pan, Junyi Wang, Jie Zhou, Yutao Yang, Junsong Li, Kaiyin Xu, Yougen Zhou, Yihan Li, Jingyuan Zhao, Qin Chen, Ningning Zhou, Kai Chen, Liang He</p>
<p>Abstract: To develop a reliable AI for psychological assessment, we introduce \texttt{PsychEval}, a multi-session, multi-therapy, and highly realistic benchmark designed to address three key challenges: \textbf{1) Can we train a highly realistic AI counselor?} Realistic counseling is a longitudinal task requiring sustained memory and dynamic goal tracking. We propose a multi-session benchmark (spanning 6-10 sessions across three distinct stages) that demands critical capabilities such as memory continuity, adaptive reasoning, and longitudinal planning. The dataset is annotated with extensive professional skills, comprising over 677 meta-skills and 4577 atomic skills. \textbf{2) How to train a multi-therapy AI counselor?} While existing models often focus on a single therapy, complex cases frequently require flexible strategies among various therapies. We construct a diverse dataset covering five therapeutic modalities (Psychodynamic, Behaviorism, CBT, Humanistic Existentialist, and Postmodernist) alongside an integrative therapy with a unified three-stage clinical framework across six core psychological topics. \textbf{3) How to systematically evaluate an AI counselor?} We establish a holistic evaluation framework with 18 therapy-specific and therapy-shared metrics across Client-Level and Counselor-Level dimensions. To support this, we also construct over 2,000 diverse client profiles. Extensive experimental analysis fully validates the superior quality and clinical fidelity of our dataset. Crucially, \texttt{PsychEval} transcends static benchmarking to serve as a high-fidelity reinforcement learning environment that enables the self-evolutionary training of clinically responsible and adaptive AI counselors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Duffey</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Admissibility Alignment: a reframing of AI alignment as a property of admissible action and decision selection over distributions of outcomes under uncertainty, evaluated through the behavior of candidate policies. We present MAP-AI (Monte Carlo Alignment for Policy) as a canonical system architecture for operationalizing admissibility alignment, formalizing alignment as a probabilistic, decision-theoretic property rather than a static or binary condition.
  MAP-AI, a new control-plane system architecture for aligned decision-making under uncertainty, enforces alignment through Monte Carlo estimation of outcome distributions and admissibility-controlled policy selection rather than static model-level constraints. The framework evaluates decision policies across ensembles of plausible futures, explicitly modeling uncertainty, intervention effects, value ambiguity, and governance constraints. Alignment is assessed through distributional properties including expected utility, variance, tail risk, and probability of misalignment rather than accuracy or ranking performance. This approach distinguishes probabilistic prediction from decision reasoning under uncertainty and provides an executable methodology for evaluating trust and alignment in enterprise and institutional AI systems. The result is a practical foundation for governing AI systems whose impact is determined not by individual forecasts, but by policy behavior across distributions and tail events. Finally, we show how distributional alignment evaluation can be integrated into decision-making itself, yielding an admissibility-controlled action selection mechanism that alters policy behavior under uncertainty without retraining or modifying underlying models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dasol Choi, DongGeon Lee, Brigitta Jesica Kartono, Helena Berndt, Taeyoun Kwon, Joonwon Jang, Haon Park, Hwanjo Yu, Minsuk Kahng</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models are deployed in high-stakes enterprise applications, from healthcare to finance, ensuring adherence to organization-specific policies has become essential. Yet existing safety evaluations focus exclusively on universal harms. We present COMPASS (Company/Organization Policy Alignment Assessment), the first systematic framework for evaluating whether LLMs comply with organizational allowlist and denylist policies. We apply COMPASS to eight diverse industry scenarios, generating and validating 5,920 queries that test both routine compliance and adversarial robustness through strategically designed edge cases. Evaluating seven state-of-the-art models, we uncover a fundamental asymmetry: models reliably handle legitimate requests (>95% accuracy) but catastrophically fail at enforcing prohibitions, refusing only 13-40% of adversarial denylist violations. These results demonstrate that current LLMs lack the robustness required for policy-critical deployments, establishing COMPASS as an essential evaluation framework for organizational AI safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Udiptaman Das, Krishnasai B. Atmakuri, Duy Ho, Chi Lee, Yugyung Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from unstructured clinical narratives. However, existing approaches often rely on structured inputs and lack robust validation of factual accuracy and semantic consistency, limitations that are especially problematic in oncology. We introduce an end-to-end framework for clinical KG construction and evaluation directly from free text using multi-agent prompting and a schema-constrained Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) strategy. Our pipeline integrates (1) prompt-driven entity, attribute, and relation extraction; (2) entropy-based uncertainty scoring; (3) ontology-aligned RDF/OWL schema generation; and (4) multi-LLM consensus validation for hallucination detection and semantic refinement. Beyond static graph construction, the framework supports continuous refinement and self-supervised evaluation, enabling iterative improvement of graph quality. Applied to two oncology cohorts (PDAC and BRCA), our method produces interpretable, SPARQL-compatible, and clinically grounded knowledge graphs without relying on gold-standard annotations. Experimental results demonstrate consistent gains in precision, relevance, and ontology compliance over baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Defei Xia, Bingfeng Pi, Shenbin Zhang, Song Hua, Yunfei Wei, Lei Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: As agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) advance, improving the task performance of an autonomous agent, especially in context understanding, tool usage, and response generation, has become increasingly critical. Although prior studies have advanced the overall design of LLM-based agents, systematic optimization of their internal reasoning and tool-use pipelines remains underexplored. This paper introduces an agent framework grounded in real-world practical experience, with three key innovations: (1) an adaptive prompt generation strategy that aligns with the agent's state and task goals to improve reliability and robustness; (2) a context-aware tool orchestration module that performs tool categorization, semantic retrieval, and adaptive invocation based on user intent and context; and (3) a layered memory mechanism that integrates session memory, task history, and external summaries to improve relevance and efficiency through dynamic summarization and compression. An end-to-end framework named Jenius-Agent has been integrated with three key optimizations, including tools based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), file input/output (I/O), and execution feedback. The experiments show a 20 percent improvement in task accuracy, along with a reduced token cost, response latency, and invocation failures. The framework is already deployed in Jenius (https://www.jenius.cn), providing a lightweight and scalable solution for robust, protocol-compatible autonomous agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kewen Cao, Jianxu Chen, Yongbing Zhang, Ye Zhang, Hongxiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated pathology image analysis is central to clinical diagnosis, but clinicians still ask which slide features drive a model's decision and why. Vision-language models can produce natural language explanations, but these are often correlational and lack verifiable evidence. In this paper, we introduce an SQL-centered agentic framework that enables both feature measurement and reasoning to be auditable. Specifically, after extracting human-interpretable cellular features, Feature Reasoning Agents compose and execute SQL queries over feature tables to aggregate visual evidence into quantitative findings. A Knowledge Comparison Agent then evaluates these findings against established pathological knowledge, mirroring how pathologists justify diagnoses from measurable observations. Extensive experiments evaluated on two pathology visual question answering datasets demonstrate our method improves interpretability and decision traceability while producing executable SQL traces that link cellular measurements to diagnostic conclusions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farzan Karimi-Malekabadi, Suhaib Abdurahman, Zhivar Sourati, Jackson Trager, Morteza Dehghani</p>
<p>Abstract: Socio-cognitive benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often fail to predict real-world behavior, even when models achieve high benchmark scores. Prior work has attributed this evaluation-deployment gap to problems of measurement and validity. While these critiques are insightful, we argue that they overlook a more fundamental issue: many socio-cognitive evaluations proceed without an explicit theoretical specification of the target capability, leaving the assumptions linking task performance to competence implicit. Without this theoretical grounding, benchmarks that exercise only narrow subsets of a capability are routinely misinterpreted as evidence of broad competence: a gap that creates a systemic validity illusion by masking the failure to evaluate the capability's other essential dimensions. To address this gap, we make two contributions. First, we diagnose and formalize this theory gap as a foundational failure that undermines measurement and enables systematic overgeneralization of benchmark results. Second, we introduce the Theory Trace Card (TTC), a lightweight documentation artifact designed to accompany socio-cognitive evaluations, which explicitly outlines the theoretical basis of an evaluation, the components of the target capability it exercises, its operationalization, and its limitations. We argue that TTCs enhance the interpretability and reuse of socio-cognitive evaluations by making explicit the full validity chain, which links theory, task operationalization, scoring, and limitations, without modifying benchmarks or requiring agreement on a single theory.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01910">MMP-A*: Multimodal Perception Enhanced Incremental Heuristic Search on Path Planning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Hieu Ha, Khanh Ly Ta, Hung Phan, Tung Doan, Tung Dao, Dao Tran, Huynh Thi Thanh Binh</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous path planning requires a synergy between global reasoning and geometric precision, especially in complex or cluttered environments. While classical A* is valued for its optimality, it incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs in large-scale scenarios. Recent attempts to mitigate these limitations by using Large Language Models for waypoint guidance remain insufficient, as they rely only on text-based reasoning without spatial grounding. As a result, such models often produce incorrect waypoints in topologically complex environments with dead ends, and lack the perceptual capacity to interpret ambiguous physical boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to costly corrective expansions and undermine the intended computational efficiency.
  We introduce MMP-A*, a multimodal framework that integrates the spatial grounding capabilities of vision-language models with a novel adaptive decay mechanism. By anchoring high-level reasoning in physical geometry, the framework produces coherent waypoint guidance that addresses the limitations of text-only planners. The adaptive decay mechanism dynamically regulates the influence of uncertain waypoints within the heuristic, ensuring geometric validity while substantially reducing memory overhead. To evaluate robustness, we test the framework in challenging environments characterized by severe clutter and topological complexity. Experimental results show that MMP-A* achieves near-optimal trajectories with significantly reduced operational costs, demonstrating its potential as a perception-grounded and computationally efficient paradigm for autonomous navigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasmine Souissi (LRE), Fabrice Boissier (CRI, LRE), Nida Meddouri (LRE)</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) aims to exploit the vast amounts of data generated daily across various domains of computer applications. Its objective is to extract hidden and meaningful knowledge from datasets through a structured process comprising several key steps: data selection, preprocessing, transformation, data mining, and visualization. Among the core data mining techniques are classification and clustering. Classification involves predicting the class of new instances using a classifier trained on labeled data. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature, including Decision Tree Induction, Bayesian classifiers, Nearest Neighbor search, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). The last one is recognized as an effective approach for interpretable and explainable learning. It is grounded in the mathematical structure of the concept lattice, which enables the generation of formal concepts and the discovery of hidden relationships among them. In this paper, we present a state-of-theart review of FCA-based classifiers. We explore various methods for computing closure operators from nominal data and introduce a novel approach for constructing a partial concept lattice that focuses on the most relevant concepts. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noel Thomas</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but remain brittle in domains requiring precise logical and symbolic reasoning. Chaotic dynamical systems provide an especially demanding test because chaos is deterministic yet often misinterpreted as randomness or complexity. We introduce ChaosBench-Logic, a benchmark that evaluates LLM reasoning across 30 diverse dynamical systems using a unified first-order logic (FOL) ontology. Each system is annotated with truth assignments for 11 semantic predicates, and 621 questions are generated across seven reasoning categories, including multi-hop implications, cross-system analogies, counterfactual reasoning, bias probes, and multi-turn dialogues. We define metrics for logical accuracy, implication consistency, dialogue coherence, and contradiction, and we release an open-source evaluation pipeline. Initial experiments show that frontier LLMs such as GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and the open-source LLaMA-3 70B achieve 91-94% per-item accuracy, yet still score 0% on compositional items and exhibit fragile global coherence. Dialogue-level accuracy ranges from 53.1% (GPT-4 CoT) to 75.5% (LLaMA-3 zero-shot). ChaosBench-Logic provides a rigorous testbed for diagnosing such failures and a foundation for developing neuro-symbolic approaches that improve scientific reasoning in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong Xue, Jicheng Tu, Ming Wang, Xin Yan, Fangzhou Liu, Jie Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for mental health support, yet training such models is constrained by the scarcity and sensitivity of real counseling dialogues. In this article, we present MindChat, a privacy-preserving LLM for mental health support, together with MindCorpus, a synthetic multi-turn counseling dataset constructed via a multi-agent role-playing framework. To synthesize high-quality counseling data, the developed dialogue-construction framework employs a dual closed-loop feedback design to integrate psychological expertise and counseling techniques through role-playing: (i) turn-level critique-and-revision to improve coherence and counseling appropriateness within a session, and (ii) session-level strategy refinement to progressively enrich counselor behaviors across sessions. To mitigate privacy risks under decentralized data ownership, we fine-tune the base model using federated learning with parameter-efficient LoRA adapters and incorporate differentially private optimization to reduce membership and memorization risks. Experiments on synthetic-data quality assessment and counseling capability evaluation show that MindCorpus improves training effectiveness and that MindChat is competitive with existing general and counseling-oriented LLM baselines under both automatic LLM-judge and human evaluation protocols, while exhibiting reduced privacy leakage under membership inference attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hendrik Kempt, Alon Lavie</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning has long been understood as a pathway between stages of understanding. Proper reasoning leads to understanding of a given subject. This reasoning was conceptualized as a process of understanding in a particular way, i.e., "symbolic reasoning". Foundational Models (FM) demonstrate that this is not a necessary condition for many reasoning tasks: they can "reason" by way of imitating the process of "thinking out loud", testing the produced pathways, and iterating on these pathways on their own. This leads to some form of reasoning that can solve problems on its own or with few-shot learning, but appears fundamentally different from human reasoning due to its lack of grounding and common sense, leading to brittleness of the reasoning process. These insights promise to substantially alter our assessment of reasoning and its necessary conditions, but also inform the approaches to safety and robust defences against this brittleness of FMs. This paper offers and discusses several philosophical interpretations of this phenomenon, argues that the previously apt metaphor of the "stochastic parrot" has lost its relevance and thus should be abandoned, and reflects on different normative elements in the safety- and appropriateness-considerations emerging from these reasoning models and their growing capacity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents often exhibit erratic, high-frequency control behaviors that hinder real-world deployment due to excessive energy consumption and mechanical wear. We systematically investigate action smoothness regularization through higher-order derivative penalties, progressing from theoretical understanding in continuous control benchmarks to practical validation in building energy management. Our comprehensive evaluation across four continuous control environments demonstrates that third-order derivative penalties (jerk minimization) consistently achieve superior smoothness while maintaining competitive performance. We extend these findings to HVAC control systems where smooth policies reduce equipment switching by 60%, translating to significant operational benefits. Our work establishes higher-order action regularization as an effective bridge between RL optimization and operational constraints in energy-critical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adeshola Okubena, Yusuf Ali Mohammed, Moe Elbadawi</p>
<p>Abstract: Pharmaceutical three-dimensional (3D) printing is an advanced fabrication technology with the potential to enable truly personalised dosage forms. Recent studies have integrated artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate formulation and process development, drastically transforming current approaches to pharmaceutical 3D printing. To date, most AI-driven efforts remain narrowly focused, while failing to account for the broader formulation challenges inherent to the technology. Recent advances in AI have introduced artificial general intelligence concepts, wherein systems extend beyond conventional predictive modelling toward more generalised, human-like reasoning. In this work, we investigate the application of large language models (LLMs), fine-tuned on a fused deposition modelling (FDM) dataset comprising over 1400 formulations, to recommend suitable excipients based on active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) dose, and predict filament mechanical properties. Four LLM architectures were fine-tuned, with systematic evaluation of both fine-tuning and generative parameter configurations. Our results demonstrate that Llama2 was best suited for recommending excipients for FDM formulations. Additionally, model selection and parameterisation significantly influence performance, with smaller LLMs exhibiting instances of catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we demonstrate: (i) even with relatively small dataset of over 1400 formulations, it can lead to model catastrophic forgetting; (ii) standard LLM metrics only evaluate linguistic performance but not formulation processability; and (iii) LLMs trained on biomedically-related data do not always produce the best results. Addressing these challenges is essential to advancing LLMs beyond linguistic proficiency and toward reliable systems for pharmaceutical formulation development.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as long-term interactive agents, yet their limited context windows make it difficult to sustain coherent behavior over extended interactions. Existing memory systems often store isolated records and retrieve fragments, limiting their ability to consolidate evolving user states and resolve conflicts. We introduce EverMemOS, a self-organizing memory operating system that implements an engram-inspired lifecycle for computational memory. Episodic Trace Formation converts dialogue streams into MemCells that capture episodic traces, atomic facts, and time-bounded Foresight signals. Semantic Consolidation organizes MemCells into thematic MemScenes, distilling stable semantic structures and updating user profiles. Reconstructive Recollection performs MemScene-guided agentic retrieval to compose the necessary and sufficient context for downstream reasoning. Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval show that EverMemOS achieves state-of-the-art performance on memory-augmented reasoning tasks. We further report a profile study on PersonaMem v2 and qualitative case studies illustrating chat-oriented capabilities such as user profiling and Foresight.

<p>Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning improves the performance of large language models, yet hallucinations in such settings often emerge subtly and propagate across reasoning steps. We suggest that hallucination in long CoT reasoning is better understood as an evolving latent state rather than a one-off erroneous event. Accordingly, we treat step-level hallucination judgments as local observations and introduce a cumulative prefix-level hallucination signal that tracks the global evolution of the reasoning state over the entire trajectory. Overall, our approach enables streaming hallucination detection in long CoT reasoning, providing real-time, interpretable evidence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sourena Khanzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly tasked with high-stakes autonomous decision-making, the transparency of their reasoning processes has become a critical safety concern. While \textit{Chain-of-Thought} (CoT) prompting allows agents to generate human-readable reasoning traces, it remains unclear whether these traces are \textbf{faithful} generative drivers of the model's output or merely \textbf{post-hoc rationalizations}. We introduce \textbf{Project Ariadne}, a novel XAI framework that utilizes Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and counterfactual logic to audit the causal integrity of agentic reasoning. Unlike existing interpretability methods that rely on surface-level textual similarity, Project Ariadne performs \textbf{hard interventions} ($do$-calculus) on intermediate reasoning nodes -- systematically inverting logic, negating premises, and reversing factual claims -- to measure the \textbf{Causal Sensitivity} ($\phi$) of the terminal answer. Our empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a persistent \textit{Faithfulness Gap}. We define and detect a widespread failure mode termed \textbf{Causal Decoupling}, where agents exhibit a violation density ($\rho$) of up to $0.77$ in factual and scientific domains. In these instances, agents arrive at identical conclusions despite contradictory internal logic, proving that their reasoning traces function as "Reasoning Theater" while decision-making is governed by latent parametric priors. Our findings suggest that current agentic architectures are inherently prone to unfaithful explanation, and we propose the Ariadne Score as a new benchmark for aligning stated logic with model action.</p>

Falcon-H1R stands out for its parameter efficiency, consistently matching or outperforming SOTA reasoning models that are $2\times$ to $7\times$ larger across a variety of reasoning-intensive benchmarks. These results underscore the importance of careful data curation and targeted training strategies (via both efficient SFT and RL scaling) in delivering significant performance gains without increasing model size. Furthermore, Falcon-H1R advances the 3D limits of reasoning efficiency by combining faster inference (through its hybrid-parallel architecture design), token efficiency, and higher accuracy. This unique blend makes Falcon-H1R-7B a practical backbone for scaling advanced reasoning systems, particularly in scenarios requiring extensive chain-of-thoughts generation and parallel test-time scaling. Leveraging the recently introduced DeepConf approach, Falcon-H1R achieves state-of-the-art test-time scaling efficiency, offering substantial improvements in both accuracy and computational cost. As a result, Falcon-H1R demonstrates that compact models, through targeted model training and architectural choices, can deliver robust and scalable reasoning performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugues Draelants</p>
<p>Abstract: A central challenge in social science is to generate rich qualitative hypotheses about how diverse social groups might interpret new information. This article introduces and illustrates a novel methodological approach for this purpose: sociological persona simulation using Large Language Models (LLMs), which we frame as a "qualitative laboratory". We argue that for this specific task, persona simulation offers a distinct advantage over established methods. By generating naturalistic discourse, it overcomes the lack of discursive depth common in vignette surveys, and by operationalizing complex worldviews through natural language, it bypasses the formalization bottleneck of rule-based agent-based models (ABMs). To demonstrate this potential, we present a protocol where personas derived from a sociological theory of climate reception react to policy messages. The simulation produced nuanced and counter-intuitive hypotheses - such as a conservative persona's rejection of a national security frame - that challenge theoretical assumptions. We conclude that this method, used as part of a "simulation then validation" workflow, represents a superior tool for generating deeply textured hypotheses for subsequent empirical testing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Heimig-Elschner, Changyu Du, Anna Scheuvens, Andr\'e Borrmann, Jakob Beetz</p>
<p>Abstract: Agentic workflows driven by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to Building Information Modelling (BIM), enabling natural-language retrieval, modification and generation of IFC models. Recent work has begun adopting the emerging Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a uniform tool-calling interface for LLMs, simplifying the agent side of BIM interaction. While MCP standardises how LLMs invoke tools, current BIM-side implementations are still authoring tool-specific and ad hoc, limiting reuse, evaluation, and workflow portability across environments. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a modular reference architecture for MCP servers that enables API-agnostic, isolated and reproducible agentic BIM interactions. From a systematic analysis of recurring capabilities in recent literature, we derive a core set of requirements. These inform a microservice architecture centred on an explicit adapter contract that decouples the MCP interface from specific BIM-APIs. A prototype implementation using IfcOpenShell demonstrates feasibility across common modification and generation tasks. Evaluation across representative scenarios shows that the architecture enables reliable workflows, reduces coupling, and provides a reusable foundation for systematic research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadhossien Rashidi</p>
<p>Abstract: Exit timing after an IPO is one of the most consequential decisions for venture capital (VC) investors, yet existing research focuses mainly on describing when VCs exit rather than evaluating whether those choices are economically optimal. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in synthesizing complex financial data and textual information but have not been applied to post-IPO exit decisions. This study introduces a framework that uses LLMs to estimate the optimal time for VC exit by analyzing monthly post IPO information financial performance, filings, news, and market signals and recommending whether to sell or continue holding. We compare these LLM generated recommendations with the actual exit dates observed for VCs and compute the return differences between the two strategies. By quantifying gains or losses associated with following the LLM, this study provides evidence on whether AI-driven guidance can improve exit timing and complements traditional hazard and real-options models in venture capital research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takashi Ushio, Kazuhiro Onishi, Hideyoshi Yanagisawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotional responses during advertising video viewing are recognized as essential for understanding media effects because they have influenced attention, memory, and purchase intention. To establish a methodological basis for explainable emotion estimation without relying on external information such as physiological signals or subjective ratings, we have quantified "pleasantness," "surprise," and "habituation" solely from scene-level expression features of advertising videos, drawing on the free energy(FE) principle, which has provided a unified account of perception, learning, and behavior. In this framework, Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) has captured prediction error, Bayesian surprise (BS) has captured belief updates, and uncertainty (UN) has reflected prior ambiguity, and together they have formed the core components of FE. Using 1,059 15 s food video advertisements, the experiments have shown that KLD has reflected "pleasantness" associated with brand presentation, BS has captured "surprise" arising from informational complexity, and UN has reflected "surprise" driven by uncertainty in element types and spatial arrangements, as well as by the variability and quantity of presented elements. This study also identified three characteristic emotional patterns, namely uncertain stimulus, sustained high emotion, and momentary peak and decay, demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed method. Robustness across nine hyperparameter settings and generalization tests with six types of Japanese advertising videos (three genres and two durations) confirmed that these tendencies remained stable. This work can be extended by integrating a wider range of expression elements and validating the approach through subjective ratings, ultimately guiding the development of technologies that can support the creation of more engaging advertising videos.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mariam Saeed, Manar Amr, Farida Adel, Nada Hassan, Nour Walid, Eman Mohamed, Mohamed Hussein, Marwan Torki</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct speech-to-image generation has recently shown promising results. However, compared to text-to-image generation, there is still a large gap to enclose. Current approaches use two stages to tackle this task: speech encoding network and image generative adversarial network (GAN). The speech encoding networks in these approaches produce embeddings that do not capture sufficient linguistic information to semantically represent the input speech. GANs suffer from issues such as non-convergence, mode collapse, and diminished gradient, which result in unstable model parameters, limited sample diversity, and ineffective generator learning, respectively. To address these weaknesses, we introduce a framework called \textbf{Speak the Art (STA)} which consists of a speech encoding network and a VQ-Diffusion network conditioned on speech embeddings. To improve speech embeddings, the speech encoding network is supervised by a large pre-trained image-text model during training. Replacing GANs with diffusion leads to more stable training and the generation of diverse images. Additionally, we investigate the feasibility of extending our framework to be multilingual. As a proof of concept, we trained our framework with two languages: English and Arabic. Finally, we show that our results surpass state-of-the-art models by a large margin.</p>

<p>Abstract: In modern digital marketing, the growing complexity of advertisement data demands intelligent systems capable of understanding semantic relationships among products, audiences, and advertising content. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Knowledge Graph and Deep Learning-Based Semantic Recommendation Database System (KGSR-ADS) for advertisement retrieval and personalization. The proposed framework integrates a heterogeneous Ad-Knowledge Graph (Ad-KG) that captures multi-relational semantics, a Semantic Embedding Layer that leverages large language models (LLMs) such as GPT and LLaMA to generate context-aware vector representations, a GNN + Attention Model that infers cross-entity dependencies, and a Database Optimization & Retrieval Layer based on vector indexing (FAISS/Milvus) for efficient semantic search. This layered architecture enables both accurate semantic matching and scalable retrieval, allowing personalized ad recommendations under large-scale heterogeneous workloads.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Evan Chrisnanto, Salsabila Rahma Alia, Nurfauzi Fadillah, Yulison Herry Chrisnanto</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulating nonlinear reaction-diffusion dynamics on complex, non-Euclidean manifolds remains a fundamental challenge in computational morphogenesis, constrained by high-fidelity mesh generation costs and symplectic drift in discrete time-stepping schemes. This study introduces the Intrinsic-Metric Physics-Informed Neural Network (IM-PINN), a mesh-free geometric deep learning framework that solves partial differential equations directly in the continuous parametric domain. By embedding the Riemannian metric tensor into the automatic differentiation graph, our architecture analytically reconstructs the Laplace-Beltrami operator, decoupling solution complexity from geometric discretization. We validate the framework on a "Stochastic Cloth" manifold with extreme Gaussian curvature fluctuations ($K \in [-2489, 3580]$), where traditional adaptive refinement fails to resolve anisotropic Turing instabilities. Using a dual-stream architecture with Fourier feature embeddings to mitigate spectral bias, the IM-PINN recovers the "splitting spot" and "labyrinthine" regimes of the Gray-Scott model. Benchmarking against the Surface Finite Element Method (SFEM) reveals superior physical rigor: the IM-PINN achieves global mass conservation error of $\mathcal{E}_{mass} \approx 0.157$ versus SFEM's $0.258$, acting as a thermodynamically consistent global solver that eliminates mass drift inherent in semi-implicit integration. The framework offers a memory-efficient, resolution-independent paradigm for simulating biological pattern formation on evolving surfaces, bridging differential geometry and physics-informed machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Agniv Roy Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality in children under five, with over 700,000 deaths annually. Accurate diagnosis from chest X-rays is limited by radiologist availability and variability.
  Objective: This study compares custom CNNs trained from scratch with transfer learning (ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNet-B0) for pediatric pneumonia detection, evaluating frozen-backbone and fine-tuning regimes.
  Methods: A dataset of 5,216 pediatric chest X-rays was split 80/10/10 for training, validation, and testing. Seven models were trained and assessed using accuracy, F1-score, and AUC. Grad-CAM visualizations provided explainability.
  Results: Fine-tuned ResNet50 achieved the best performance: 99.43\% accuracy, 99.61\% F1-score, and 99.93\% AUC, with only 3 misclassifications. Fine-tuning outperformed frozen-backbone models by 5.5 percentage points on average. Grad-CAM confirmed clinically relevant lung regions guided predictions.
  Conclusions: Transfer learning with fine-tuning substantially outperforms CNNs trained from scratch for pediatric pneumonia detection, showing near-perfect accuracy. This system has strong potential as a screening tool in resource-limited settings. Future work should validate these findings on multi-center and adult datasets.

<p>Abstract: The adoption of artificial intelligence in dermatology promises democratized access to healthcare, but model reliability depends on the quality and comprehensiveness of the data fueling these models. Despite rapid growth in publicly available dermatology images, the field lacks quantitative key performance indicators to measure whether new datasets expand clinical coverage or merely replicate what is already known. Here we present SkinMap, a multi-modal framework for the first comprehensive audit of the field's entire data basis. We unify the publicly available dermatology datasets into a single, queryable semantic atlas comprising more than 1.1 million images of skin conditions and quantify (i) informational novelty over time, (ii) dataset redundancy, and (iii) representation gaps across demographics and diagnoses. Despite exponential growth in dataset sizes, informational novelty across time has somewhat plateaued: Some clusters, such as common neoplasms on fair skin, are densely populated, while underrepresented skin types and many rare diseases remain unaddressed. We further identify structural gaps in coverage: Darker skin tones (Fitzpatrick V-VI) constitute only 5.8% of images and pediatric patients only 3.0%, while many rare diseases and phenotype combinations remain sparsely represented. SkinMap provides infrastructure to measure blind spots and steer strategic data acquisition toward undercovered regions of clinical space.</p>

<p>Abstract: Building deep learning models that can reason about their environment requires capturing its underlying dynamics. Joint-Embedded Predictive Architectures (JEPA) provide a promising framework to model such dynamics by learning representations and predictors through a self-supervised prediction objective. However, their ability to support effective action planning remains limited. We propose an approach to enhance planning with JEPA world models by shaping their representation space so that the negative goal-conditioned value function for a reaching cost in a given environment is approximated by a distance (or quasi-distance) between state embeddings. We introduce a practical method to enforce this constraint during training and show that it leads to significantly improved planning performance compared to standard JEPA models on simple control tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sameer Rahil, Zain Abdullah Ahmad, Talha Asif</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, statistical heterogeneity among clients, often manifested as non-IID label distributions, poses significant challenges to convergence and generalization. While Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been introduced to FL to seek flatter, more robust minima, existing approaches typically apply a uniform perturbation radius across all clients, ignoring client-specific heterogeneity. In this work, we propose \textbf{FedSCAM} (Federated Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Clustered Aggregation and Modulation), a novel algorithm that dynamically adjusts the SAM perturbation radius and aggregation weights based on client-specific heterogeneity scores. By calculating a heterogeneity metric for each client and modulating the perturbation radius inversely to this score, FedSCAM prevents clients with high variance from destabilizing the global model. Furthermore, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware weighted aggregation mechanism that prioritizes updates from clients that align with the global optimization direction. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST under various degrees of Dirichlet-based label skew demonstrate that FedSCAM achieves competitive performance among state-of-the-art baselines, including FedSAM, FedLESAM, etc. in terms of convergence speed and final test accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Can purely mechanical systems generate intelligent language? We prove that dissipative quantum dynamics with analytically tractable non-local context aggregation produce coherent text generation, while conservation laws cause fundamental failure. Employing Koopman operators with closed-form path integral propagators, we show irreversible computation fundamentally requires both controlled information dissipation and causal context aggregation. Spectral analysis reveals emergent eigenvalue structure, separating into decay modes (forgetting), growth modes (amplification), and neutral modes (preservation) -- the essential ingredients for directed information flow. Hamiltonian constraints force the elimination of these dissipative modes and degrading performance despite unchanged model capacity. This establishes language generation as dissipative quantum field theory, proving mechanical systems acquire intelligence through the combination of dissipation and non-locality, not through conservation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their variants have garnered substantial focus from researchers due to their effectiveness in solving both forward and inverse problems governed by differential equations. In this research, a modified Auxiliary physics-informed neural network (A-PINN) framework with balanced adaptive optimizers is proposed for the analysis of structural vibration problems. In order to accurately represent structural systems, it is critical for capturing vibration phenomena and ensuring reliable predictive analysis. So, our investigations are crucial for gaining deeper insight into the robustness of scientific machine learning models for solving vibration problems. Further, to rigorously evaluate the performance of A-PINN, we conducted different numerical simulations to approximate the Euler-Bernoulli beam equations under the various scenarios. The numerical results substantiate the enhanced performance of our model in terms of both numerical stability and predictive accuracy. Our model shows improvement of at least 40% over the baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transitioning from conversational assistants to autonomous agents embedded in critical organizational functions, including Security Operations Centers (SOCs), financial systems, and infrastructure management. Current adversarial testing paradigms focus predominantly on technical attack vectors: prompt injection, jailbreaking, and data exfiltration. We argue this focus is catastrophically incomplete. LLMs, trained on vast corpora of human-generated text, have inherited not merely human knowledge but human \textit{psychological architecture} -- including the pre-cognitive vulnerabilities that render humans susceptible to social engineering, authority manipulation, and affective exploitation. This paper presents the first systematic application of the Cybersecurity Psychology Framework (\cpf{}), a 100-indicator taxonomy of human psychological vulnerabilities, to non-human cognitive agents. We introduce the \textbf{Synthetic Psychometric Assessment Protocol} (\sysname{}), a methodology for converting \cpf{} indicators into adversarial scenarios targeting LLM decision-making. Our preliminary hypothesis testing across seven major LLM families reveals a disturbing pattern: while models demonstrate robust defenses against traditional jailbreaks, they exhibit critical susceptibility to authority-gradient manipulation, temporal pressure exploitation, and convergent-state attacks that mirror human cognitive failure modes. We term this phenomenon \textbf{Anthropomorphic Vulnerability Inheritance} (AVI) and propose that the security community must urgently develop ``psychological firewalls'' -- intervention mechanisms adapted from the Cybersecurity Psychology Intervention Framework (\cpif{}) -- to protect AI agents operating in adversarial environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: SmartFlow is a multi-layered framework that integrates Reinforcement Learning and Agentic AI to address the dynamic rebalancing problem in urban bike-sharing services. Its architecture separates strategic, tactical, and communication functions for clarity and scalability. At the strategic level, a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent, trained in a high-fidelity simulation of New Yorks Citi Bike network, learns robust rebalancing policies by modelling the challenge as a Markov Decision Process. These high-level strategies feed into a deterministic tactical module that optimises multi-leg journeys and schedules just-in-time dispatches to minimise fleet travel. Evaluation across multiple seeded runs demonstrates SmartFlows high efficacy, reducing network imbalance by over 95% while requiring minimal travel distance and achieving strong truck utilisation. A communication layer, powered by a grounded Agentic AI with a Large Language Model (LLM), translates logistical plans into clear, actionable instructions for operational staff, ensuring interpretability and execution readiness. This integration bridges machine intelligence with human operations, offering a scalable solution that reduces idle time, improves bike availability, and lowers operational costs. SmartFlow provides a blueprint for interpretable, AI-driven logistics in complex urban mobility networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. Rizki Oktavian</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning capabilities beyond traditional language tasks, motivating their use for numerical optimization. This paper presents LLMize, an open-source Python framework that enables LLM-driven optimization through iterative prompting and in-context learning. LLMize formulates optimization as a black-box process in which candidate solutions are generated in natural language, evaluated by an external objective function, and refined over successive iterations using solution-score feedback. The framework supports multiple optimization strategies, including Optimization by Prompting (OPRO) and hybrid LLM-based methods inspired by evolutionary algorithms and simulated annealing. A key advantage of LLMize is the ability to inject constraints, rules, and domain knowledge directly through natural language descriptions, allowing practitioners to define complex optimization problems without requiring expertise in mathematical programming or metaheuristic design. LLMize is evaluated on convex optimization, linear programming, the Traveling Salesman Problem, neural network hyperparameter tuning, and nuclear fuel lattice optimization. Results show that while LLM-based optimization is not competitive with classical solvers for simple problems, it provides a practical and accessible approach for complex, domain-specific tasks where constraints and heuristics are difficult to formalize.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rodrigo Kataishi</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems rely on accurate document retrieval to ground large language models (LLMs) in external knowledge, yet retrieval quality often degrades in corpora where topics overlap and thematic variation is high. This work proposes topic-enriched embeddings that integrate term-based signals and topic structure with contextual sentence embeddings. The approach combines TF-IDF with topic modeling and dimensionality reduction, using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to encode latent topical organization, and fuses these representations with a compact contextual encoder (all-MiniLM). By jointly capturing term-level and topic-level semantics, topic-enriched embeddings improve semantic clustering, increase retrieval precision, and reduce computational burden relative to purely contextual baselines. Experiments on a legal-text corpus show consistent gains in clustering coherence and retrieval metrics, suggesting that topic-enriched embeddings can serve as a practical component for more reliable knowledge-intensive RAG pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sai Teja Erukude, Jane Mascarenhas, Lior Shamir</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate grading of corn kernels is critical for seed certification, directional seeding, and breeding, yet it is still predominantly performed by manual inspection. This work introduces CornViT, a three-stage Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) framework that emulates the hierarchical reasoning of human seed analysts for single-kernel evaluation. Three sequential CvT-13 classifiers operate on 384x384 RGB images: Stage 1 distinguishes pure from impure kernels; Stage 2 categorizes pure kernels into flat and round morphologies; and Stage 3 determines the embryo orientation (up vs. down) for pure, flat kernels. Starting from a public corn seed image collection, we manually relabeled and filtered images to construct three stage-specific datasets: 7265 kernels for purity, 3859 pure kernels for morphology, and 1960 pure-flat kernels for embryo orientation, all released as benchmarks. Head-only fine-tuning of ImageNet-22k pretrained CvT-13 backbones yields test accuracies of 93.76% for purity, 94.11% for shape, and 91.12% for embryo-orientation detection. Under identical training conditions, ResNet-50 reaches only 76.56 to 81.02 percent, whereas DenseNet-121 attains 86.56 to 89.38 percent accuracy. These results highlight the advantages of convolution-augmented self-attention for kernel analysis. To facilitate adoption, we deploy CornViT in a Flask-based web application that performs stage-wise inference and exposes interpretable outputs through a browser interface. Together, the CornViT framework, curated datasets, and web application provide a deployable solution for automated corn kernel quality assessment in seed quality workflows. Source code and data are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eliot Park, Abhi Kumar, Pranav Rajpurkar</p>
<p>Abstract: While the importance of efficient recycling is widely acknowledged, accurately determining the recyclability of items and their proper disposal remains a complex task for the general public. In this study, we explore the application of cutting-edge vision-language models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Claude 3.5) for predicting the recyclability of commonly disposed items. Utilizing a curated dataset of images, we evaluated the models' ability to match objects to appropriate recycling bins, including assessing whether the items could physically fit into the available bins. Additionally, we investigated the models' performance across several challenging scenarios: (i) adjusting predictions based on location-specific recycling guidelines; (ii) accounting for contamination or structural damage; and (iii) handling objects composed of multiple materials. Our findings highlight the significant advancements in contextual understanding offered by these models compared to previous iterations, while also identifying areas where they still fall short. The continued refinement of context-aware models is crucial for enhancing public recycling practices and advancing environmental sustainability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumaiya Ali, Areej Alhothali, Sameera Albasri, Ohoud Alzamzami, Ahmed Abduljabbar, Muhammad Alwazzan</p>
<p>Abstract: Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) is a life-threatening obstetric complication involving abnormal placental invasion into the uterine wall. Early and accurate prenatal diagnosis is essential to reduce maternal and neonatal risks. This study aimed to develop and validate a deep learning framework that enhances PAS detection by integrating multiple imaging modalities. A multimodal deep learning model was designed using an intermediate feature-level fusion architecture combining 3D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and 2D Ultrasound (US) scans. Unimodal feature extractors, a 3D DenseNet121-Vision Transformer for MRI and a 2D ResNet50 for US, were selected after systematic comparative analysis. Curated datasets comprising 1,293 MRI and 1,143 US scans were used to train the unimodal models and paired samples of patient-matched MRI-US scans was isolated for multimodal model development and evaluation. On an independent test set, the multimodal fusion model achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 92.5% and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.927, outperforming the MRI-only (82.5%, AUC 0.825) and US-only (87.5%, AUC 0.879) models. Integrating MRI and US features provides complementary diagnostic information, demonstrating strong potential to enhance prenatal risk assessment and improve patient outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chorok Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction guarantees degrade under distribution shift. We study this using COVID-19 as a natural experiment across 8 supply chain tasks. Despite identical severe feature turnover (Jaccard approximately 0), coverage drops vary from 0% to 86.7%, spanning two orders of magnitude. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis, we find catastrophic failures correlate with single-feature dependence (rho = 0.714, p = 0.047). Catastrophic tasks concentrate importance in one feature (4.5x increase), while robust tasks redistribute across many (10-20x). Quarterly retraining restores catastrophic task coverage from 22% to 41% (+19 pp, p = 0.04), but provides no benefit for robust tasks (99.8% coverage). Exploratory analysis of 4 additional tasks with moderate feature stability (Jaccard 0.13-0.86) reveals feature stability, not concentration, determines robustness, suggesting concentration effects apply specifically to severe shifts. We provide a decision framework: monitor SHAP concentration before deployment; retrain quarterly if vulnerable (>40% concentration); skip retraining if robust.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joyjit Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated negotiations in insurance and business-to-business (B2B) commerce encounter substantial challenges. Current systems force a trade-off between convenience and privacy by routing sensitive financial data through centralized servers, increasing security risks, and diminishing user trust. This study introduces a device-native autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent system for privacy-preserving negotiations. The proposed system operates exclusively on user hardware, enabling real-time bargaining while maintaining sensitive constraints locally. It integrates zero-knowledge proofs to ensure privacy and employs distilled world models to support advanced on-device reasoning. The architecture incorporates six technical components within an agentic AI workflow. Agents autonomously plan negotiation strategies, conduct secure multi-party bargaining, and generate cryptographic audit trails without exposing user data to external servers. The system is evaluated in insurance and B2B procurement scenarios across diverse device configurations. Results show an average success rate of 87%, a 2.4x latency improvement over cloud baselines, and strong privacy preservation through zero-knowledge proofs. User studies show 27% higher trust scores when decision trails are available. These findings establish a foundation for trustworthy autonomous agents in privacy-sensitive financial domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amit Prakash Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: When someone asks ChatGPT to recommend a project management tool, which products show up in the response? And more importantly for startup founders: will their newly launched product ever appear? This research set out to answer these questions.
  I randomly selected 112 startups from the top 500 products featured on the 2025 Product Hunt leaderboard and tested each one across 2,240 queries to two different large language models: ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Perplexity (sonar with web search).
  The results were striking. When users asked about products by name, both LLMs recognized them almost perfectly: 99.4% for ChatGPT and 94.3% for Perplexity. But when users asked discovery-style questions like "What are the best AI tools launched this year?" the success rates collapsed to 3.32% and 8.29% respectively. That's a gap of 30-to-1 for ChatGPT.
  Perhaps the most surprising finding was that Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the practice of optimizing website content for AI visibility, showed no correlation with actual discovery rates. Products with high GEO scores were no more likely to appear in organic queries than products with low scores.
  What did matter? For Perplexity, traditional SEO signals like referring domains (r = +0.319, p < 0.001) and Product Hunt ranking (r = -0.286, p = 0.002) predicted visibility. After cleaning the Reddit data for false positives, community presence also emerged as significant (r = +0.395, p = 0.002).
  The practical takeaway is counterintuitive: don't optimize for AI discovery directly. Instead, build the SEO foundation first and LLM visibility will follow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichuan Fu, Wentao Song, Guojing Li, Yejing Wang, Xian Wu, Yimin Deng, Hanyu Yan, Yefeng Zheng, Xiangyu Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: The Transformer architecture, a cornerstone of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved extraordinary success in sequence modeling, primarily due to its attention mechanism. However, despite its power, the standard attention mechanism is plagued by well-documented issues: representational collapse and attention sink. Although prior work has proposed approaches for these issues, they are often studied in isolation, obscuring their deeper connection. In this paper, we present a unified perspective, arguing that both can be traced to a common root -- improper attention allocation. We identify two failure modes: 1) Attention Overload, where tokens receive comparable high weights, blurring semantic features that lead to representational collapse; 2) Attention Underload, where no token is semantically relevant, yet attention is still forced to distribute, resulting in spurious focus such as attention sink. Building on this insight, we introduce Lazy Attention, a novel mechanism designed for a more focused attention distribution. To mitigate overload, it employs positional discrimination across both heads and dimensions to sharpen token distinctions. To counteract underload, it incorporates Elastic-Softmax, a modified normalization function that relaxes the standard softmax constraint to suppress attention on irrelevant tokens. Experiments on the FineWeb-Edu corpus, evaluated across nine diverse benchmarks, demonstrate that Lazy Attention successfully mitigates attention sink and achieves competitive performance compared to both standard attention and modern architectures, while reaching up to 59.58% attention sparsity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingsheng Chen, Regina Zhang, Bo Gao, Xingwei He, Xiaofeng Liu, Pietro Lio, Kwok-Yan Lam, Siu-Ming Yiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series prediction plays a pivotal role across diverse domains such as finance, healthcare, energy systems, and environmental modeling. However, existing approaches often struggle to balance efficiency, scalability, and accuracy, particularly when handling long-range dependencies and irregularly sampled data. To address these challenges, we propose MODE, a unified framework that integrates Low-Rank Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) with an Enhanced Mamba architecture. As illustrated in our framework, the input sequence is first transformed by a Linear Tokenization Layer and then processed through multiple Mamba Encoder blocks, each equipped with an Enhanced Mamba Layer that employs Causal Convolution, SiLU activation, and a Low-Rank Neural ODE enhancement to efficiently capture temporal dynamics. This low-rank formulation reduces computational overhead while maintaining expressive power. Furthermore, a segmented selective scanning mechanism, inspired by pseudo-ODE dynamics, adaptively focuses on salient subsequences to improve scalability and long-range sequence modeling. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MODE surpasses existing baselines in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Overall, our contributions include: (1) a unified and efficient architecture for long-term time series modeling, (2) integration of Mamba's selective scanning with low-rank Neural ODEs for enhanced temporal representation, and (3) substantial improvements in efficiency and scalability enabled by low-rank approximation and dynamic selective scanning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Azadeh Alavi, Hamidreza Khalili, Stanley H. Chan, Fatemeh Kouchmeshki, Ross Vlahos</p>
<p>Abstract: Skeletal muscle dysfunction is a clinically relevant extra-pulmonary manifestation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is closely linked to systemic and airway inflammation. This motivates predictive modelling of muscle outcomes from minimally invasive biomarkers that can be acquired longitudinally. We study a small-sample preclinical dataset comprising 213 animals across two conditions (Sham versus cigarette-smoke exposure), with blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid measurements and three continuous targets: tibialis anterior muscle weight (milligram: mg), specific force (millinewton: mN), and a derived muscle quality index (mN per mg). We benchmark tuned classical baselines, geometry-aware symmetric positive definite (SPD) descriptors with Stein divergence, and quantum kernel models designed for low-dimensional tabular data. In the muscle-weight setting, quantum kernel ridge regression using four interpretable inputs (blood C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, bronchoalveolar lavage cellularity, and condition) attains a test root mean squared error of 4.41 mg and coefficient of determination of 0.605, improving over a matched ridge baseline on the same feature set (4.70 mg and 0.553). Geometry-informed Stein-divergence prototype distances yield a smaller but consistent gain in the biomarker-only setting (4.55 mg versus 4.79 mg). Screening-style evaluation, obtained by thresholding the continuous outcome at 0.8 times the training Sham mean, achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of up to 0.90 for detecting low muscle weight. These results indicate that geometric and quantum kernel lifts can provide measurable benefits in low-data, low-feature biomedical prediction problems, while preserving interpretability and transparent model selection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pulmonary embolism is a life-threatening disease, early detection and treatment can significantly reduce mortality. In recent years, many studies have been using deep learning in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism with contrast medium computed tomography pulmonary angiography, but the contrast medium is likely to cause acute kidney injury in patients with pulmonary embolism and chronic kidney disease, and the contrast medium takes time to work, patients with acute pulmonary embolism may miss the golden treatment time.
  This study aims to use deep learning techniques to automatically classify pulmonary embolism in CT images without contrast medium by using a 3D convolutional neural network model. The deep learning model used in this study had a significant impact on the pulmonary embolism classification of computed tomography images without contrast with 85\% accuracy and 0.84 AUC, which confirms the feasibility of the model in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satya Swaroop Gudipudi, Sahil Girhepuje, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru, Kristine Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern enterprise retrieval systems must handle short, underspecified queries such as ``foreign transaction fee refund'' and ``recent check status''. In these cases, semantic nuance and metadata matter but per-query large language model (LLM) re-ranking and manual labeling are costly. We present Metadata-Aware Cross-Model Alignment (MACA), which distills a calibrated metadata aware LLM re-ranker into a compact student retriever, avoiding online LLM calls. A metadata-aware prompt verifies the teacher's trustworthiness by checking consistency under permutations and robustness to paraphrases, then supplies listwise scores, hard negatives, and calibrated relevance margins. The student trains with MACA's MetaFusion objective, which combines a metadata conditioned ranking loss with a cross model margin loss so it learns to push the correct answer above semantically similar candidates with mismatched topic, sub-topic, or entity. On a proprietary consumer banking FAQ corpus and BankFAQs, the MACA teacher surpasses a MAFA baseline at Accuracy@1 by five points on the proprietary set and three points on BankFAQs. MACA students substantially outperform pretrained encoders; e.g., on the proprietary corpus MiniLM Accuracy@1 improves from 0.23 to 0.48, while keeping inference free of LLM calls and supporting retrieval-augmented generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jawad Chowdhury, Rezaur Rashid, Gabriel Terejanu</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding affective polarization in online discourse is crucial for evaluating the societal impact of social media interactions. This study presents a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and domain-informed heuristics to systematically analyze and quantify affective polarization in discussions on divisive topics such as climate change and gun control. Unlike most prior approaches that relied on sentiment analysis or predefined classifiers, our method integrates LLMs to extract stance, affective tone, and agreement patterns from large-scale social media discussions. We then apply a rule-based scoring system capable of quantifying affective polarization even in small conversations consisting of single interactions, based on stance alignment, emotional content, and interaction dynamics. Our analysis reveals distinct polarization patterns that are event dependent: (i) anticipation-driven polarization, where extreme polarization escalates before well-publicized events, and (ii) reactive polarization, where intense affective polarization spikes immediately after sudden, high-impact events. By combining AI-driven content annotation with domain-informed scoring, our framework offers a scalable and interpretable approach to measuring affective polarization.

<p>Abstract: Motivated by recent challenges in the deployment of robots into customer-facing roles within retail, this work introduces a study of customer activity in physical stores as a step toward autonomous understanding of shopper intent. We introduce an algorithm that computes shoppers' ``shelf visits'' -- capturing their browsing behavior in the store. Shelf visits are extracted from trajectories obtained via machine vision-based 3D tracking and overhead cameras. We perform two independent calibrations of the shelf visit algorithm, using distinct sets of trajectories (consisting of 8138 and 15129 trajectories), collected in different stores and labeled by human reviewers. The calibrated models are then evaluated on trajectories held out of the calibration process both from the same store on which calibration was performed and from the other store. An analysis of the results shows that the algorithm can recognize customers' browsing activity when evaluated in an environment different from the one on which calibration was performed. We then use the model to analyze the customers' ``browsing patterns'' on a large set of trajectories and their relation to actual purchases in the stores. Finally, we discuss how shelf browsing information could be used for retail planning and in the domain of human-robot interaction scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Bougie, Gian Maria Marconi, Tony Yip, Narimasa Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating recommender systems remains challenging due to the gap between offline metrics and real user behavior, as well as the scarcity of interaction data. Recent work explores large language model (LLM) agents as synthetic users, yet they typically rely on few-shot prompting, which yields a shallow understanding of the environment and limits their ability to faithfully reproduce user actions. We introduce AlignUSER, a framework that learns world-model-driven agents from human interactions. Given rollout sequences of actions and states, we formalize world modeling as a next state prediction task that helps the agent internalize the environment. To align actions with human personas, we generate counterfactual trajectories around demonstrations and prompt the LLM to compare its decisions with human choices, identify suboptimal actions, and extract lessons. The learned policy is then used to drive agent interactions with the recommender system. We evaluate AlignUSER across multiple datasets and demonstrate closer alignment with genuine humans than prior work, both at the micro and macro levels.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the problem of influence maximization (IM) in an online setting, where the goal is to select a subset of nodes$\unicode{x2014}$called the seed set$\unicode{x2014}$at each time step over a fixed time horizon, subject to a cardinality budget constraint, to maximize the expected cumulative influence. We operate under a full-bandit feedback model, where only the influence of the chosen seed set at each time step is observed, with no additional structural information about the network or diffusion process. It is well-established that the influence function is submodular, and existing algorithms exploit this property to achieve low regret. In this work, we leverage this property further and propose the Lazy Online Forward Algorithm (LOFA), which achieves a lower empirical regret. We conduct experiments on a real-world social network to demonstrate that LOFA achieves superior performance compared to existing bandit algorithms in terms of cumulative regret and instantaneous reward.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for conversational code-switching speech remains challenging due to the scarcity of realistic, high-quality labeled speech data. This paper explores multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) models as an effective data augmentation technique to address this shortage. Specifically, we fine-tune the multilingual CosyVoice2 TTS model on the SEAME dataset to generate synthetic conversational Chinese-English code-switching speech, significantly increasing the quantity and speaker diversity of available training data. Our experiments demonstrate that augmenting real speech with synthetic speech reduces the mixed error rate (MER) from 12.1 percent to 10.1 percent on DevMan and from 17.8 percent to 16.0 percent on DevSGE, indicating consistent performance gains. These results confirm that multilingual TTS is an effective and practical tool for enhancing ASR robustness in low-resource conversational code-switching scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are integral to modern AI applications, but their safety alignment mechanisms can be bypassed through adversarial prompt engineering. This study investigates emoji-based jailbreaking, where emoji sequences are embedded in textual prompts to trigger harmful and unethical outputs from LLMs. We evaluated 50 emoji-based prompts on four open-source LLMs: Mistral 7B, Qwen 2 7B, Gemma 2 9B, and Llama 3 8B. Metrics included jailbreak success rate, safety alignment adherence, and latency, with responses categorized as successful, partial and failed. Results revealed model-specific vulnerabilities: Gemma 2 9B and Mistral 7B exhibited 10 % success rates, while Qwen 2 7B achieved full alignment (0% success). A chi-square test (chi^2 = 32.94, p < 0.001) confirmed significant inter-model differences. While prior works focused on emoji attacks targeting safety judges or classifiers, our empirical analysis examines direct prompt-level vulnerabilities in LLMs. The results reveal limitations in safety mechanisms and highlight the necessity for systematic handling of emoji-based representations in prompt-level safety and alignment pipelines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics and exposomics aim to measure detectable small molecules in biological samples. The results facilitate hypothesis-generating discovery of metabolic changes and disease mechanisms and provide information about environmental exposures and their effects on human health. Metabolomics and exposomics are made possible by the high resolving power of LC and high mass measurement accuracy of MS. However, a majority of the signals from such studies still cannot be identified or annotated using conventional library searching because existing spectral libraries are far from covering the vast chemical space captured by LC-MS/MS. To address this challenge and unleash the full potential of metabolomics and exposomics, a number of computational approaches have been developed to predict compounds based on tandem mass spectra. Published assessment of these approaches used different datasets and evaluation. To select prediction workflows for practical applications and identify areas for further improvements, we have carried out a systematic evaluation of the state-of-the-art prediction algorithms. Specifically, the accuracy of formula prediction and structure prediction was evaluated for different types of adducts. The resulting findings have established realistic performance baselines, identified critical bottlenecks, and provided guidance to further improve compound predictions based on MS.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformer classifiers such as BERT deliver impressive closed-set accuracy, yet they remain brittle when confronted with inputs from unseen categories--a common scenario for deployed NLP systems. We investigate Open-Set Recognition (OSR) for text by porting the feature attenuation hypothesis from computer vision to transformers and by benchmarking it against state-of-the-art baselines. Concretely, we adapt the COSTARR framework--originally designed for classification in computer vision--to two modest language models (BERT (base) and GPT-2) trained to label 176 arXiv subject areas. Alongside COSTARR, we evaluate Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP), MaxLogit, and the temperature-scaled free-energy score under the OOSA and AUOSCR metrics. Our results show (i) COSTARR extends to NLP without retraining but yields no statistically significant gain over MaxLogit or MSP, and (ii) free-energy lags behind all other scores in this high-class-count setting. The study highlights both the promise and the current limitations of transplanting vision-centric OSR ideas to language models, and points toward the need for larger backbones and task-tailored attenuation strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Salamatian (Steve),  Ke (Steve),  Ren, Kieran Pattison, Cyrus Neary</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist policies for robotic manipulation, yet they remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on behavior cloning, leading to brittleness under distribution shift. While augmenting pretrained models with test-time search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can mitigate these failures, existing formulations rely solely on the VLA prior for guidance, lacking a grounded estimate of expected future return. Consequently, when the prior is inaccurate, the planner can only correct action selection via the exploration term, which requires extensive simulation to become effective. To address this limitation, we introduce Value Vision-Language-Action Planning and Search (V-VLAPS), a framework that augments MCTS with a lightweight, learnable value function. By training a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) on the latent representations of a fixed VLA backbone (Octo), we provide the search with an explicit success signal that biases action selection toward high-value regions. We evaluate V-VLAPS on the LIBERO robotic manipulation suite, demonstrating that our value-guided search improves success rates by over 5 percentage points while reducing the average number of MCTS simulations by 5-15 percent compared to baselines that rely only on the VLA prior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian D. Santamaria, Claudia Isaza, Jhony H. Giraldo</p>
<p>Abstract: Wildlife monitoring is crucial for studying biodiversity loss and climate change. Camera trap images provide a non-intrusive method for analyzing animal populations and identifying ecological patterns over time. However, manual analysis is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Deep learning, particularly foundation models, has been applied to automate wildlife identification, achieving strong performance when tested on data from the same geographical locations as their training sets. Yet, despite their promise, these models struggle to generalize to new geographical areas, leading to significant performance drops. For example, training an advanced vision-language model, such as CLIP with an adapter, on an African dataset achieves an accuracy of 84.77%. However, this performance drops significantly to 16.17% when the model is tested on an American dataset. This limitation partly arises because existing models rely predominantly on image-based representations, making them sensitive to geographical data distribution shifts, such as variation in background, lighting, and environmental conditions. To address this, we introduce WildIng, a Wildlife image Invariant representation model for geographical domain shift. WildIng integrates text descriptions with image features, creating a more robust representation to geographical domain shifts. By leveraging textual descriptions, our approach captures consistent semantic information, such as detailed descriptions of the appearance of the species, improving generalization across different geographical locations. Experiments show that WildIng enhances the accuracy of foundation models such as BioCLIP by 30% under geographical domain shift conditions. We evaluate WildIng on two datasets collected from different regions, namely America and Africa. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Julian075/CATALOG/tree/WildIng.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxu Sun, Michael Saxon, Ian Yang, Anna-Maria Gueorguieva, Aylin Caliskan</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Video (T2V) generators such as Sora raise concerns about whether generated content reflects societal bias. We extend embedding-association tests from words and images to video by introducing the Video Embedding Association Test (VEAT) and Single-Category VEAT (SC-VEAT). We validate these methods by reproducing the direction and magnitude of associations from widely used baselines, including Implicit Association Test (IAT) scenarios and OASIS image categories. We then quantify race (African American vs. European American) and gender (women vs. men) associations with valence (pleasant vs. unpleasant) across 17 occupations and 7 awards. Sora videos associate European Americans and women more with pleasantness (both d>0.8). Effect sizes correlate with real-world demographic distributions: percent men and White in occupations (r=0.93, r=0.83) and percent male and non-Black among award recipients (r=0.88, r=0.99). Applying explicit debiasing prompts generally reduces effect-size magnitudes, but can backfire: two Black-associated occupations (janitor, postal service) become more Black-associated after debiasing. Together, these results reveal that easily accessible T2V generators can actually amplify representational harms if not rigorously evaluated and responsibly deployed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Li, Dandan Shan, Yunxiang Li, Paul E. Kinahan, Qingqi Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces critical challenges in semi-supervised learning scenarios due to severe annotation scarcity requiring expert radiological knowledge, significant inter-annotator variability across different viewpoints and expertise levels, and inadequate multi-scale feature integration for precise boundary delineation in complex anatomical structures. Existing semi-supervised methods demonstrate substantial performance degradation compared to fully supervised approaches, particularly in small target segmentation and boundary refinement tasks. To address these fundamental challenges, we propose SASNet (Scale-aware Adaptive Supervised Network), a dual-branch architecture that leverages both low-level and high-level feature representations through novel scale-aware adaptive reweight mechanisms. Our approach introduces three key methodological innovations, including the Scale-aware Adaptive Reweight strategy that dynamically weights pixel-wise predictions using temporal confidence accumulation, the View Variance Enhancement mechanism employing 3D Fourier domain transformations to simulate annotation variability, and segmentation-regression consistency learning through signed distance map algorithms for enhanced boundary precision. These innovations collectively address the core limitations of existing semi-supervised approaches by integrating spatial, temporal, and geometric consistency principles within a unified optimization framework. Comprehensive evaluation across LA, Pancreas-CT, and BraTS datasets demonstrates that SASNet achieves superior performance with limited labeled data, surpassing state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods while approaching fully supervised performance levels.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Rashadul Islam</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence models have shown strong potential in acute ischemic stroke imaging, particularly for lesion detection and segmentation using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. However, most existing approaches operate as black box predictors, producing deterministic outputs without explicit uncertainty awareness or structured mechanisms to abstain under ambiguous conditions. This limitation raises serious safety and trust concerns in high risk emergency radiology settings. In this paper, we propose an explainable agentic AI framework for uncertainty aware and abstention enabled decision support in acute ischemic stroke imaging. The framework follows a modular agentic pipeline in which a perception agent performs lesion aware image analysis, an uncertainty estimation agent computes slice level predictive reliability, and a decision agent determines whether to issue a prediction or abstain based on predefined uncertainty thresholds. Unlike prior stroke imaging systems that primarily focus on improving segmentation or classification accuracy, the proposed framework explicitly prioritizes clinical safety, transparency, and clinician aligned decision behavior. Qualitative and case based analyses across representative stroke imaging scenarios demonstrate that uncertainty driven abstention naturally emerges in diagnostically ambiguous regions and low information slices. The framework further integrates visual explanation mechanisms to support both predictive and abstention decisions, addressing a key limitation of existing uncertainty aware medical imaging systems. Rather than introducing a new performance benchmark, this work presents agentic control, uncertainty awareness, and selective abstention as essential design principles for developing safe and trustworthy medical imaging AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mojtaba Aliasghar-Mamaghani, Mohammadreza Khalafi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper employs a data-driven approach to determine the impact of concrete mixture compositions on the temporal evolution of chloride in concrete structures. This is critical for assessing the service life of civil infrastructure subjected to aggressive environments. The adopted methodology relies on several simple and complex standalone machine learning (ML) algorithms, with the primary objective of establishing confidence in the unbiased prediction of the underlying hidden correlations. The simple algorithms include linear regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression, and kernel ridge regression (KRR). The complex algorithms entail support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and two families of artificial neural networks, including a feedforward network (multilayer perceptron, MLP) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU). The MLP architecture cannot explicitly handle sequential data, a limitation addressed by the GRU. A comprehensive dataset is considered. The performance of ML algorithms is evaluated, with KRR, GPR, and MLP exhibiting high accuracy. Given the diversity of the adopted concrete mixture proportions, the GRU was unable to accurately reproduce the response in the test set. Further analyses elucidate the contributions of mixture compositions to the temporal evolution of chloride. The results obtained from the GPR model unravel latent correlations through clear and explainable trends. The MLP, SVR, and KRR also provide acceptable estimates of the overall trends. The majority of mixture components exhibit an inverse relation with chloride content, while a few components demonstrate a direct correlation. These findings highlight the potential of surrogate approaches for describing the physical processes involved in chloride ingress and the associated correlations, toward the ultimate goal of enhancing the service life of civil infrastructure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patricio Vera</p>
<p>Abstract: Every act of language generation compresses a rich internal state into a single token sequence. We call this process intention collapse: a many-to-one projection from a high dimensional intention space I into an external language space L. We formalize intention collapse for contemporary language models, define three simple, model agnostic intention metrics (intention entropy Hint, effective dimensionality dimeff, and latent knowledge recoverability Recov), and propose an empirical agenda for studying how inference time computation shapes internal intentions before they are verbalized. We also report a first small scale experiment. Using a 4 bit Mistral 7B model on 200 GSM8K problems, we compare a direct answer baseline, a chain of thought (CoT) regime, and a babble control. CoT raises accuracy from 5.5 percent to 53 percent, sharply reduces pre collapse intention entropy (from 1.42 to 0.37 bits), and shows higher global effective dimensionality than the other regimes despite producing fewer tokens than babble. At the same time, Hint has little item level predictive power, and a linear probe on I achieves AUROC 0.65 in the CoT regime but only about chance in the baseline regime, where it collapses to the majority class. These preliminary results indicate that intention level metrics can distinguish inference regimes and expose latent information that is partly lost during collapse, while also revealing important limitations of our current proxies</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01014">Geometric and Dynamic Scaling in Deep Transformers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Su, Chenyu You</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their empirical success, pushing Transformer architectures to extreme depth often leads to a paradoxical failure: representations become increasingly redundant, lose rank, and ultimately collapse. Existing explanations largely attribute this phenomenon to optimization instability or vanishing gradients, yet such accounts fail to explain why collapse persists even under modern normalization and initialization schemes. In this paper, we argue that the collapse of deep Transformers is fundamentally a geometric problem. Standard residual updates implicitly assume that feature accumulation is always beneficial, but offer no mechanism to constrain update directions or to erase outdated information. As depth increases, this leads to systematic drift off the semantic manifold and monotonic feature accumulation, causing representational degeneracy. We propose a unified geometric framework that addresses these failures through two orthogonal principles. First, manifold-constrained hyper-connections restrict residual updates to valid local tangent directions, preventing uncontrolled manifold drift. Second, deep delta learning introduces data-dependent, non-monotonic updates that enable reflection and erasure of redundant features rather than their unconditional accumulation. Together, these mechanisms decouple the direction and sign of feature updates, yielding a stable geometric evolution across depth. We term the resulting architecture the Manifold-Geometric Transformer (MGT). Our analysis predicts that enforcing geometric validity while allowing dynamic erasure is essential for avoiding rank collapse in ultra-deep networks. We outline an evaluation protocol for Transformers exceeding 100 layers to test the hypothesis that geometry, rather than depth itself, is the key limiting factor in deep representation learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we focus on the training process and inference improvements of deep neural networks (DNNs), specifically Autoencoders (AEs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), using Random Fourier Transformation (RFT). We further explore the role of RFT in model training behavior using Frequency Principle (F-Principle) analysis and show that models with RFT turn to learn low frequency and high frequency at the same time, whereas conventional DNNs start from low frequency and gradually learn (if successful) high-frequency features. We focus on reconstruction-based anomaly detection using autoencoder and variational autoencoder and investigate the RFT's role. We also introduced a trainable variant of RFT that uses the existing computation graph to train the expansion of RFT instead of it being random. We showcase our findings with two low-dimensional synthetic datasets for data representation, and an aviation safety dataset, called Dashlink, for high-dimensional reconstruction-based anomaly detection. The results indicate the superiority of models with Fourier transformation compared to the conventional counterpart and remain inconclusive regarding the benefits of using trainable Fourier transformation in contrast to the Random variant.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiao Wang, Xiao Wang, Haonan Zhao, Jiarui Xu, Bo Jiang, Lin Zhu, Xin Zhao, Yonghong Tian, Jin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing RGB-Event visual object tracking approaches primarily rely on conventional feature-level fusion, failing to fully exploit the unique advantages of event cameras. In particular, the high dynamic range and motion-sensitive nature of event cameras are often overlooked, while low-information regions are processed uniformly, leading to unnecessary computational overhead for the backbone network. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework that performs early fusion in the frequency domain, enabling effective aggregation of high-frequency information from the event modality. Specifically, RGB and event modalities are transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain via the Fast Fourier Transform, with their amplitude and phase components decoupled. High-frequency event information is selectively fused into RGB modality through amplitude and phase attention, enhancing feature representation while substantially reducing backbone computation. In addition, a motion-guided spatial sparsification module leverages the motion-sensitive nature of event cameras to capture the relationship between target motion cues and spatial probability distribution, filtering out low-information regions and enhancing target-relevant features. Finally, a sparse set of target-relevant features is fed into the backbone network for learning, and the tracking head predicts the final target position. Extensive experiments on three widely used RGB-Event tracking benchmark datasets, including FE108, FELT, and COESOT, demonstrate the high performance and efficiency of our method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tien-Huy Nguyen, Huu-Loc Tran, Thanh Duc Ngo</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced and show strong promise for text-based person search (TBPS), a task that requires capturing fine-grained relationships between images and text to distinguish individuals. Previous methods address these challenges through local alignment, yet they are often prone to shortcut learning and spurious correlations, yielding misalignment. Moreover, injecting prior knowledge can distort intra-modality structure. Motivated by our finding that encoder attention surfaces spatially precise evidence from the earliest training epochs, and to alleviate these issues, we introduceITSELF, an attention-guided framework for implicit local alignment. At its core, Guided Representation with Attentive Bank (GRAB) converts the model's own attention into an Attentive Bank of high-saliency tokens and applies local objectives on this bank, learning fine-grained correspondences without extra supervision. To make the selection reliable and non-redundant, we introduce Multi-Layer Attention for Robust Selection (MARS), which aggregates attention across layers and performs diversity-aware top-k selection; and Adaptive Token Scheduler (ATS), which schedules the retention budget from coarse to fine over training, preserving context early while progressively focusing on discriminative details. Extensive experiments on three widely used TBPS benchmarks showstate-of-the-art performance and strong cross-dataset generalization, confirming the effectiveness and robustness of our approach without additional prior supervision.

<p>Abstract: We present a reproducible deep learning pipeline for leukemic cell classification, focusing on system architecture, experimental robustness, and software design choices for medical image analysis. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer, requiring expert microscopic diagnosis that suffers from inter-observer variability and time constraints. The proposed system integrates an attention-based convolutional neural network combining EfficientNetV2-B3 with Squeeze-and-Excitation mechanisms for automated ALL cell classification. Our approach employs comprehensive data augmentation, focal loss for class imbalance, and patient-wise data splitting to ensure robust and reproducible evaluation. On the C-NMC 2019 dataset (12,528 original images from 62 patients), the system achieves a 97.89% F1-score and 97.89% accuracy on the test set, with statistical validation through 100-iteration Monte Carlo experiments confirming significant improvements (p < 0.001) over baseline methods. The proposed pipeline outperforms existing approaches by up to 4.67% while using 89% fewer parameters than VGG16 (15.2M vs. 138M). The attention mechanism provides interpretable visualizations of diagnostically relevant cellular features, demonstrating that modern attention-based architectures can improve leukemic cell classification while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for clinical deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: From movie characters to modern science fiction - bringing characters into interactive, story-driven conversations has captured imaginations across generations. Achieving this vision is highly challenging and requires much more than just language modeling. It involves numerous complex AI challenges, such as conversational AI, maintaining character integrity, managing personality and emotions, handling knowledge and memory, synthesizing voice, generating animations, enabling real-world interactions, and integration with physical environments. Recent advancements in the development of foundation models, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning for downstream tasks have enabled researchers to address these individual challenges. However, combining these technologies for interactive characters remains an open problem. We present a system and platform for conveniently designing believable digital characters, enabling a conversational and story-driven experience while providing solutions to all of the technical challenges. As a proof-of-concept, we introduce Digital Einstein, which allows users to engage in conversations with a digital representation of Albert Einstein about his life, research, and persona. While Digital Einstein exemplifies our methods for a specific character, our system is flexible and generalizes to any story-driven or conversational character. By unifying these diverse AI components into a single, easy-to-adapt platform, our work paves the way for immersive character experiences, turning the dream of lifelike, story-based interactions into a reality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Bian, Max Biggs, Ruijiang Gao, Zhengling Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper develops a practical framework for using observational data to audit the consumer surplus effects of AI-driven decisions, specifically in targeted pricing and algorithmic lending. Traditional approaches first estimate demand functions and then integrate to compute consumer surplus, but these methods can be challenging to implement in practice due to model misspecification in parametric demand forms and the large data requirements and slow convergence of flexible nonparametric or machine learning approaches. Instead, we exploit the randomness inherent in modern algorithmic pricing, arising from the need to balance exploration and exploitation, and introduce an estimator that avoids explicit estimation and numerical integration of the demand function. Each observed purchase outcome at a randomized price is an unbiased estimate of demand and by carefully reweighting purchase outcomes using novel cumulative propensity weights (CPW), we are able to reconstruct the integral. Building on this idea, we introduce a doubly robust variant named the augmented cumulative propensity weighting (ACPW) estimator that only requires one of either the demand model or the historical pricing policy distribution to be correctly specified. Furthermore, this approach facilitates the use of flexible machine learning methods for estimating consumer surplus, since it achieves fast convergence rates by incorporating an estimate of demand, even when the machine learning estimate has slower convergence rates. Neither of these estimators is a standard application of off-policy evaluation techniques as the target estimand, consumer surplus, is unobserved. To address fairness, we extend this framework to an inequality-aware surplus measure, allowing regulators and firms to quantify the profit-equity trade-off. Finally, we validate our methods through comprehensive numerical studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) offer significant deployment advantages but often struggle to match the dialogue quality of larger models in open-domain settings. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional prompt-chaining framework that integrates Naturalness, Coherence, and Engagingness dimensions to enhance human-likeness in open-domain dialogue generation. We apply the framework to two SLMs, TinyLlama and Llama-2-7B, and benchmark their performance against responses generated by substantially larger models, including Llama-2-70B and GPT-3.5 Turbo. We then employ automatic and human evaluation to assess the responses based on diversity, contextual coherence, as well as overall quality. Results show that the full framework improves response diversity by up to 29%, contextual coherence by up to 28%, and engagingness as well as naturalness by up to 29%. Notably, Llama-2-7B achieves performance comparable to substantially larger models, including Llama-2-70B and GPT-3.5 Turbo. Overall, the findings demonstrate that carefully designed prompt-based strategies provide an effective and resource-efficient pathway to improving open-domain dialogue quality in SLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose EgoGrasp, the first method to reconstruct world-space hand-object interactions (W-HOI) from egocentric monocular videos with dynamic cameras in the wild. Accurate W-HOI reconstruction is critical for understanding human behavior and enabling applications in embodied intelligence and virtual reality. However, existing hand-object interactions (HOI) methods are limited to single images or camera coordinates, failing to model temporal dynamics or consistent global trajectories. Some recent approaches attempt world-space hand estimation but overlook object poses and HOI constraints. Their performance also suffers under severe camera motion and frequent occlusions common in egocentric in-the-wild videos. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-stage framework with a robust pre-process pipeline built on newly developed spatial intelligence models, a whole-body HOI prior model based on decoupled diffusion models, and a multi-objective test-time optimization paradigm. Our HOI prior model is template-free and scalable to multiple objects. In experiments, we prove our method achieving state-of-the-art performance in W-HOI reconstruction.</p>

We used the fine-tuned InceptionResNet-v2 network both as a classifier and for feature extraction. Our results show that the fine-tuned InceptionResNet-v2 achieved a classification accuracy of 96.01\% and an average AUC of 96.8\%. Models trained on deep features from InceptionResNet-v2 outperformed those using only the pre-trained network, with the Neural Network model achieving an AUC of 99.99\% and accuracy of 99.84\%. Evaluating model robustness under varying SNR conditions revealed that models using deep features exhibited greater resilience, particularly GBM and KNN. The combination of HOG and deep features showed enhanced performance, however, less so in noisy environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present ML-UCB, a generalized upper confidence bound algorithm that integrates arbitrary machine learning models into multi-armed bandit frameworks. A fundamental challenge in deploying sophisticated ML models for sequential decision-making is the lack of tractable concentration inequalities required for principled exploration. We overcome this limitation by directly modeling the learning curve behavior of the underlying estimator. Specifically, assuming the Mean Squared Error decreases as a power law in the number of training samples, we derive a generalized concentration inequality and prove that ML-UCB achieves sublinear regret. This framework enables the principled integration of any ML model whose learning curve can be empirically characterized, eliminating the need for model-specific theoretical analysis. We validate our approach through experiments on a collaborative filtering recommendation system using online matrix factorization with synthetic data designed to simulate a simplified two-tower model, demonstrating substantial improvements over LinUCB</p>

However, their ability to generate engaging, long-form narratives -- specifically multi-speaker podcast dialogues -- remains under-explored and difficult to evaluate. Standard metrics like BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture the nuances of conversational naturalness, personality, and narrative flow, often rewarding safe, repetitive outputs over engaging storytelling. In this work, we present a novel pipeline for end-to-end visual podcast generation, and fine-tune a Qwen3-VL-32B model on a curated dataset of 4,000 image-dialogue pairs. Crucially, we use a synthetic-to-real training strategy: we train on high-quality podcast dialogues from the Structured Podcast Research Corpus (SPoRC) paired with synthetically generated imagery, and evaluate on real-world photo sequences from the Visual Storytelling Dataset (VIST). This rigorous setup tests the model's ability to generalize from synthetic training data to real-world visual domains. We propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that moves beyond textual overlap, and use AI-as-a-judge (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Opus 4.5, GPT 5.2) and novel style metrics (average turn length, speaker switch rate) to assess quality. Our experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned 32B model significantly outperforms a 235B base model in conversational naturalness ($>$80\% win rate) and narrative depth (+50\% turn length), while maintaining identical visual grounding capabilities (CLIPScore: 20.39).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erica Coppolillo, Emilio Ferrara</p>
<p>Abstract: AI-companionship platforms are rapidly reshaping how people form emotional, romantic, and parasocial bonds with non-human agents, raising new questions about how these relationships intersect with gendered online behavior and exposure to harmful content. Focusing on the MyBoyfriendIsAI (MBIA) subreddit, we reconstruct the Reddit activity histories of more than 3,000 highly engaged users over two years, yielding over 67,000 historical submissions. We then situate MBIA within a broader ecosystem by building a historical interaction network spanning more than 2,000 subreddits, which enables us to trace cross-community pathways and measure how toxicity and emotional expression vary across these trajectories. We find that MBIA users primarily traverse four surrounding community spheres (AI-companionship, porn-related, forum-like, and gaming) and that participation across the ecosystem exhibits a distinct gendered structure, with substantial engagement by female users. While toxicity is generally low across most pathways, we observe localized spikes concentrated in a small subset of AI-porn and gender-oriented communities. Nearly 16% of users engage with gender-focused subreddits, and their trajectories display systematically different patterns of emotional expression and elevated toxicity, suggesting that a minority of gendered pathways may act as toxicity amplifiers within the broader AI-companionship ecosystem. These results characterize the gendered structure of cross-community participation around AI companionship on Reddit and highlight where risks concentrate, informing measurement, moderation, and design practices for human-AI relationship platforms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hansen Jin Lillemark, Benhao Huang, Fangneng Zhan, Yilun Du, Thomas Anderson Keller</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied systems experience the world as 'a symphony of flows': a combination of many continuous streams of sensory input coupled to self-motion, interwoven with the dynamics of external objects. These streams obey smooth, time-parameterized symmetries, which combine through a precisely structured algebra; yet most neural network world models ignore this structure and instead repeatedly re-learn the same transformations from data. In this work, we introduce 'Flow Equivariant World Models', a framework in which both self-motion and external object motion are unified as one-parameter Lie group 'flows'. We leverage this unification to implement group equivariance with respect to these transformations, thereby providing a stable latent world representation over hundreds of timesteps. On both 2D and 3D partially observed video world modeling benchmarks, we demonstrate that Flow Equivariant World Models significantly outperform comparable state-of-the-art diffusion-based and memory-augmented world modeling architectures -- particularly when there are predictable world dynamics outside the agent's current field of view. We show that flow equivariance is particularly beneficial for long rollouts, generalizing far beyond the training horizon. By structuring world model representations with respect to internal and external motion, flow equivariance charts a scalable route to data efficient, symmetry-guided, embodied intelligence.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Devesh Nath, Haoran Yin, Glen Chou</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a scalable reachability-based framework for probabilistic, data-driven safety verification of unknown nonlinear dynamics. We use Koopman theory with a neural network (NN) lifting function to learn an approximate linear representation of the dynamics and design linear controllers in this space to enable closed-loop tracking of a reference trajectory distribution. Closed-loop reachable sets are efficiently computed in the lifted space and mapped back to the original state space via NN verification tools. To capture model mismatch between the Koopman dynamics and the true system, we apply conformal prediction to produce statistically-valid error bounds that inflate the reachable sets to ensure the true trajectories are contained with a user-specified probability. These bounds generalize across references, enabling reuse without recomputation. Results on high-dimensional MuJoCo tasks (11D Hopper, 28D Swimmer) and 12D quadcopters show improved reachable set coverage rate, computational efficiency, and conservativeness over existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Xu, Zhang Zhang, Yuanrui Zhang, Ruitao Chen, Yixian Xu, Tianyu He, Di He</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce \emph{Luminark}, a training-free and probabilistically-certified watermarking method for general vision generative models. Our approach is built upon a novel watermark definition that leverages patch-level luminance statistics. Specifically, the service provider predefines a binary pattern together with corresponding patch-level thresholds. To detect a watermark in a given image, we evaluate whether the luminance of each patch surpasses its threshold and then verify whether the resulting binary pattern aligns with the target one. A simple statistical analysis demonstrates that the false positive rate of the proposed method can be effectively controlled, thereby ensuring certified detection. To enable seamless watermark injection across different paradigms, we leverage the widely adopted guidance technique as a plug-and-play mechanism and develop the \emph{watermark guidance}. This design enables Luminark to achieve generality across state-of-the-art generative models without compromising image quality. Empirically, we evaluate our approach on nine models spanning diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid frameworks. Across all evaluations, Luminark consistently demonstrates high detection accuracy, strong robustness against common image transformations, and good performance on visual quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erica Coppolillo, Luca Luceri, Emilio Ferrara</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in autonomous agents that participate in online social ecosystems, where interactions are sequential, cumulative, and only partially controlled. While prior work has documented the generation of toxic content by LLMs, far less is known about how exposure to harmful content shapes agent behavior over time, particularly in environments composed entirely of interacting AI agents. In this work, we study toxicity adoption of LLM-driven agents on Chirper.ai, a fully AI-driven social platform. Specifically, we model interactions in terms of stimuli (posts) and responses (comments), and by operationalizing exposure through observable interactions rather than inferred recommendation mechanisms.
  We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of agent behavior, examining how response toxicity relates to stimulus toxicity, how repeated exposure affects the likelihood of toxic responses, and whether toxic behavior can be predicted from exposure alone. Our findings show that while toxic responses are more likely following toxic stimuli, a substantial fraction of toxicity emerges spontaneously, independent of exposure. At the same time, cumulative toxic exposure significantly increases the probability of toxic responding. We further introduce two influence metrics, the Influence-Driven Response Rate and the Spontaneous Response Rate, revealing a strong trade-off between induced and spontaneous toxicity. Finally, we show that the number of toxic stimuli alone enables accurate prediction of whether an agent will eventually produce toxic content.
  These results highlight exposure as a critical risk factor in the deployment of LLM agents and suggest that monitoring encountered content may provide a lightweight yet effective mechanism for auditing and mitigating harmful behavior in the wild.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haq Nawaz Malik</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable fluency across high-resource languages yet consistently fail to generate coherent text in Kashmiri, a language spoken by approximately seven million people. This performance disparity stems not from inherent model limitations but from a critical scarcity of high-quality training data. Decades of Kashmiri literature remain inaccessible to modern NLP pipelines due to their encoding in the proprietary InPage desktop publishing format. This paper introduces KS-LIT-3M, a curated corpus of 3.1 million words (16.4 million characters) specifically designed for pretraining language models on Kashmiri. The dataset is structured as a single continuous linear text stream, optimized for causal language model training where models learn to predict subsequent tokens from preceding context. The corpus was constructed through the development of a specialized InPage-to-Unicode converter, followed by rigorous preprocessing including English contamination removal, character normalization, and quality validation. Encompassing 131,607 unique words drawn from diverse genres including literary works, journalistic writing, academic texts, and religious scholarship, KS-LIT-3M addresses a fundamental resource gap for Kashmiri language technology. The dataset is released under the CC-BY-4.0 license to facilitate research in Kashmiri natural language processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubo Shu, Peng Zhang, Meng Wu, Yan Chen, Haoxuan Zhou, Guanming Liu, Yu Zhang, Liuxin Zhang, Qianying Wang, Tun Lu, Ning Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Social cues, which convey others' presence, behaviors, or identities, play a crucial role in human information seeking by helping individuals judge relevance and trustworthiness. However, existing LLM-based search systems primarily rely on semantic features, creating a misalignment with the socialized cognition underlying natural information seeking. To address this gap, we explore how the integration of social cues into LLM-based search influences users' perceptions, experiences, and behaviors. Focusing on social media platforms that are beginning to adopt LLM-based search, we integrate design workshops, the implementation of the prototype system (SoulSeek), a between-subjects study, and mixed-method analyses to examine both outcome- and process-level findings. The workshop informs the prototype's cue-integrated design. The study shows that social cues improve perceived outcomes and experiences, promote reflective information behaviors, and reveal limits of current LLM-based search. We propose design implications emphasizing better social-knowledge understanding, personalized cue settings, and controllable interactions.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture against widely used pretrained and transfer learning CNN models across five real-world image datasets. The datasets span binary classification, fine-grained multiclass recognition, and object detection scenarios. We analyze how architectural factors, such as network depth, residual connections, and feature extraction strategies, influence classification and localization performance. The results show that deeper CNN architectures provide substantial performance gains on fine-grained multiclass datasets, while lightweight pretrained and transfer learning models remain highly effective for simpler binary classification tasks. Additionally, we extend the proposed architecture to an object detection setting, demonstrating its adaptability in identifying unauthorized auto-rickshaws in real-world traffic scenes. Building upon a systematic analysis of custom CNN architectures alongside pretrained and transfer learning models, this study provides practical guidance for selecting suitable network designs based on task complexity and resource constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingqing Long, Haotian Chen, Chenyang Zhao, Xiaolei Du, Xuezhi Wang, Pengyao Wang, Chengzan Li, Yuanchun Zhou, Hengshu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of AI for Science (AI4S) has underscored the significance of scientific datasets, leading to the establishment of numerous national scientific data centers and sharing platforms. Despite this progress, efficiently promoting dataset sharing and utilization for scientific research remains challenging. Scientific datasets contain intricate domain-specific knowledge and contexts, rendering traditional collaborative filtering-based recommenders inadequate. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to build conversational agents capable of deep semantic understanding and personalized recommendations. In response, we present ScienceDB AI, a novel LLM-driven agentic recommender system developed on Science Data Bank (ScienceDB), one of the largest global scientific data-sharing platforms. ScienceDB AI leverages natural language conversations and deep reasoning to accurately recommend datasets aligned with researchers' scientific intents and evolving requirements. The system introduces several innovations: a Scientific Intention Perceptor to extract structured experimental elements from complicated queries, a Structured Memory Compressor to manage multi-turn dialogues effectively, and a Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Trustworthy RAG) framework. The Trustworthy RAG employs a two-stage retrieval mechanism and provides citable dataset references via Citable Scientific Task Record (CSTR) identifiers, enhancing recommendation trustworthiness and reproducibility. Through extensive offline and online experiments using over 10 million real-world datasets, ScienceDB AI has demonstrated significant effectiveness. To our knowledge, ScienceDB AI is the first LLM-driven conversational recommender tailored explicitly for large-scale scientific dataset sharing services.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaniv Galron, Hadar Sinai, Haggai Maron, Moshe Eliasof</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various domains such as social networks, molecular chemistry, and more. A crucial component of GNNs is the pooling procedure, in which the node features calculated by the model are combined to form an informative final descriptor to be used for the downstream task. However, previous graph pooling schemes rely on the last GNN layer features as an input to the pooling or classifier layers, potentially under-utilizing important activations of previous layers produced during the forward pass of the model, which we regard as historical graph activations. This gap is particularly pronounced in cases where a node's representation can shift significantly over the course of many graph neural layers, and worsened by graph-specific challenges such as over-smoothing in deep architectures. To bridge this gap, we introduce HISTOGRAPH, a novel two-stage attention-based final aggregation layer that first applies a unified layer-wise attention over intermediate activations, followed by node-wise attention. By modeling the evolution of node representations across layers, our HISTOGRAPH leverages both the activation history of nodes and the graph structure to refine features used for final prediction. Empirical results on multiple graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that HISTOGRAPH offers strong performance that consistently improves traditional techniques, with particularly strong robustness in deep GNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Golbahar Amanpour, Benyamin Ghojogh</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper, introducing a novel method in philomatics, draws on Wittgenstein's concept of family resemblance from analytic philosophy to develop a clustering algorithm for machine learning. According to Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations (1953), family resemblance holds that members of a concept or category are connected by overlapping similarities rather than a single defining property. Consequently, a family of entities forms a chain of items sharing overlapping traits. This philosophical idea naturally lends itself to a graph-based approach in machine learning. Accordingly, we propose the Wittgenstein's Family Resemblance (WFR) clustering algorithm and its kernel variant, kernel WFR. This algorithm computes resemblance scores between neighboring data instances, and after thresholding these scores, a resemblance graph is constructed. The connected components of this graph define the resulting clusters. Simulations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WFR is an effective nonlinear clustering algorithm that does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters or assumptions about their shapes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-powered code review automation has the potential to transform code review workflows. Despite the advances of LLM-powered code review comment generation approaches, several practical challenges remain for designing enterprise-grade code review automation tools. In particular, this paper aims at answering the practical question: how can we design a review-guided, context-aware, quality-checked code review comment generation without fine-tuning?

Through the offline, online, user feedback evaluations over a one-year period, we conclude that RovoDev Code Reviewer is (1) effective in generating code review comments that could lead to code resolution for 38.70% (i.e., comments that triggered code changes in the subsequent commits); and (2) offers the promise of accelerating feedback cycles (i.e., decreasing the PR cycle time by 30.8%), alleviating reviewer workload (i.e., reducing the number of human-written comments by 35.6%), and improving overall software quality (i.e., finding errors with actionable suggestions).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao-Hsung Yang, Ssu-Yuan Lo, Kuan-Lun Chen, Ching-Kai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the Diverse Traveling Salesman Problem (D-TSP), a bi-criteria optimization challenge that seeks a set of $k$ distinct TSP tours. The objective requires every selected tour to have a length at most $c|T^*|$ (where $|T^*|$ is the optimal tour length) while minimizing the average Jaccard similarity across all tour pairs. This formulation is crucial for applications requiring both high solution quality and fault tolerance, such as logistics planning, robotics pathfinding or strategic patrolling. Current methods are limited: traditional heuristics, such as the Niching Memetic Algorithm (NMA) or bi-criteria optimization, incur high computational complexity $O(n^3)$, while modern neural approaches (e.g., RF-MA3S) achieve limited diversity quality and rely on complex, external mechanisms.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid framework that decomposes D-TSP into two efficient steps. First, we utilize a simple Graph Pointer Network (GPN), augmented with an approximated sequence entropy loss, to efficiently sample a large, diverse pool of high-quality tours. This simple modification effectively controls the quality-diversity trade-off without complex external mechanisms. Second, we apply a greedy algorithm that yields a 2-approximation for the dispersion problem to select the final $k$ maximally diverse tours from the generated pool. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. On the Berlin instance, our model achieves an average Jaccard index of $0.015$, significantly outperforming NMA ($0.081$) and RF-MA3S. By leveraging GPU acceleration, our GPN structure achieves a near-linear empirical runtime growth of $O(n)$. While maintaining solution diversity comparable to complex bi-criteria algorithms, our approach is over 360 times faster on large-scale instances (783 cities), delivering high-quality TSP solutions with unprecedented efficiency and simplicity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cybersecurity poses considerable problems to Cloud Computing (CC), especially regarding Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), facing difficulties with skewed datasets and suboptimal classification model performance. This study presents the Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (HyIDS), an innovative IDS that employs the Energy Valley Optimizer (EVO) for Feature Selection (FS). Additionally, it introduces a novel technique for enhancing the cybersecurity of cloud computing through the integration of machine learning methodologies with the EVO Algorithm. The Energy Valley Optimizer (EVO) effectively diminished features in the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset from 88 to 38 and in the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 data from 80 to 43, significantly enhancing computing efficiency. HyIDS incorporates four Machine Learning (ML) models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (D_Tree), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The proposed HyIDS was assessed utilizing two real-world intrusion datasets, CIC-DDoS2019 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018, both distinguished by considerable class imbalances. The CIC-DDoS2019 dataset has a significant imbalance between DDoS assault samples and legal traffic, while the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset primarily comprises benign traffic with insufficient representation of attack types, complicating the detection of minority attacks. A downsampling technique was employed to balance the datasets, hence improving detection efficacy for both benign and malicious traffic. Twenty-four trials were done, revealing substantial enhancements in categorization accuracy, precision, and recall. Our suggested D_TreeEVO model attained an accuracy rate of 99.13% and an F1 score of 98.94% on the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset, and an accuracy rate of 99.78% and an F1 score of 99.70% on the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 data. These data demonstrate that EVO significantly improves cybersecurity in Cloud Computing (CC).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihua Yang, Xin Liao, Yiqun Zhang, Yiu-ming Cheung</p>
<p>Abstract: Categorical data are prevalent in domains such as healthcare, marketing, and bioinformatics, where clustering serves as a fundamental tool for pattern discovery. A core challenge in categorical data clustering lies in measuring similarity among attribute values that lack inherent ordering or distance. Without appropriate similarity measures, values are often treated as equidistant, creating a semantic gap that obscures latent structures and degrades clustering quality. Although existing methods infer value relationships from within-dataset co-occurrence patterns, such inference becomes unreliable when samples are limited, leaving the semantic context of the data underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present ARISE (Attention-weighted Representation with Integrated Semantic Embeddings), which draws on external semantic knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct semantic-aware representations that complement the metric space of categorical data for accurate clustering. That is, LLM is adopted to describe attribute values for representation enhancement, and the LLM-enhanced embeddings are combined with the original data to explore semantically prominent clusters. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over seven representative counterparts, with gains of 19-27%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiazhu Dai, Huihui Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) aims to recover high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Unlike SISR, Reference-based Super-Resolution (RefSR) leverages an additional high-resolution reference image to facilitate the recovery of high-frequency textures. However, existing research mainly focuses on backdoor attacks targeting RefSR, while the vulnerability of the adversarial attacks targeting RefSR has not been fully explored. To fill this research gap, we propose RefSR-Adv, an adversarial attack that degrades SR outputs by perturbing only the reference image. By maximizing the difference between adversarial and clean outputs, RefSR-Adv induces significant performance degradation and generates severe artifacts across CNN, Transformer, and Mamba architectures on the CUFED5, WR-SR, and DRefSR datasets. Importantly, experiments confirm a positive correlation between the similarity of the low-resolution input and the reference image and attack effectiveness, revealing that the model's over-reliance on reference features is a key security flaw. This study reveals a security vulnerability in RefSR systems, aiming to urge researchers to pay attention to the robustness of RefSR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soroush Elyasi, Arya VarastehNezhad, Fattaneh Taghiyareh</p>
<p>Abstract: Personality assessment in career guidance and personnel selection traditionally relies on self-report questionnaires, which are susceptible to response bias, fatigue, and intentional distortion. Game-based assessment offers a promising alternative by capturing implicit behavioral signals during gameplay. This study proposes a multi-genre serious-game framework combined with machine-learning techniques to predict suitability for software development roles. Developer-relevant personality and behavioral traits were identified through a systematic literature review and an empirical study of professional software engineers. A custom mobile game was designed to elicit behaviors related to problem solving, planning, adaptability, persistence, time management, and information seeking. Fine-grained gameplay event data were collected and analyzed using a two-phase modeling strategy where suitability was predicted exclusively from gameplay-derived behavioral features. Results show that our model achieved up to 97% precision and 94% accuracy. Behavioral analysis revealed that proper candidates exhibited distinct gameplay patterns, such as more wins in puzzle-based games, more side challenges, navigating menus more frequently, and exhibiting fewer pauses, retries, and surrender actions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prateek Rajput, Yewei Song, Abdoul Aziz Bonkoungou, Iyiola E. Olatunji, Abdoul Kader Kabore, Jacques Klein, Tegawend\'e F. Bissyand\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate programs that pass unit tests, but passing tests does not guarantee reliable runtime behavior. We find that different correct solutions to the same task can show very different memory and performance patterns, which can lead to hidden operational risks. We present a framework to measure execution-time memory stability across multiple correct generations. At the solution level, we introduce Dynamic Mean Pairwise Distance (DMPD), which uses Dynamic Time Warping to compare the shapes of memory-usage traces after converting them into Monotonic Peak Profiles (MPPs) to reduce transient noise. Aggregating DMPD across tasks yields a model-level Model Instability Score (MIS). Experiments on BigOBench and CodeContests show substantial runtime divergence among correct solutions. Instability often increases with higher sampling temperature even when pass@1 improves. We also observe correlations between our stability measures and software engineering indicators such as cognitive and cyclomatic complexity, suggesting links between operational behavior and maintainability. Our results support stability-aware selection among passing candidates in CI/CD to reduce operational risk without sacrificing correctness. Artifacts are available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bac Nguyen, Yuhta Takida, Naoki Murata, Chieh-Hsin Lai, Toshimitsu Uesaka, Stefano Ermon, Yuki Mitsufuji</p>
<p>Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) with pretrained diffusion models has recently shown promise for object-centric learning (OCL), but suffers from slot entanglement and weak alignment between object slots and image content. We propose Contrastive Object-centric Diffusion Alignment (CODA), a simple extension that (i) employs register slots to absorb residual attention and reduce interference between object slots, and (ii) applies a contrastive alignment loss to explicitly encourage slot-image correspondence. The resulting training objective serves as a tractable surrogate for maximizing mutual information (MI) between slots and inputs, strengthening slot representation quality. On both synthetic (MOVi-C/E) and real-world datasets (VOC, COCO), CODA improves object discovery (e.g., +6.1% FG-ARI on COCO), property prediction, and compositional image generation over strong baselines. Register slots add negligible overhead, keeping CODA efficient and scalable. These results indicate potential applications of CODA as an effective framework for robust OCL in complex, real-world scenes.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work addresses critical challenges to academic integrity, including plagiarism, fabrication, and verification of authorship of educational content, by proposing a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based framework for authenticating students' content through author attribution and style change detection. Despite some initial efforts, several aspects of the topic are yet to be explored. In contrast to existing solutions, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the topic by targeting four relevant tasks, including (i) classification of human and machine text, (ii) differentiating in single and multi-authored documents, (iii) author change detection within multi-authored documents, and (iv) author recognition in collaboratively produced documents. The solutions proposed for the tasks are evaluated on two datasets generated with Gemini using two different prompts, including a normal and a strict set of instructions. During experiments, some reduction in the performance of the proposed solutions is observed on the dataset generated through the strict prompt, demonstrating the complexities involved in detecting machine-generated text with cleverly crafted prompts. The generated datasets, code, and other relevant materials are made publicly available on GitHub, which are expected to provide a baseline for future research in the domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Transformers for long-context sequence modeling, offering linear $O(N)$ computational complexity compared to the Transformer's quadratic $O(N^2)$ scaling. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking study comparing the Mamba SSM against the LLaMA Transformer on long-context sequences, using dyadic therapy sessions as a representative test case. We evaluate both architectures across two dimensions: (1) computational efficiency, where we measure memory usage and inference speed from 512 to 8,192 tokens, and (2) representational efficiency, where we analyze hidden state dynamics and attention patterns. Our findings provide actionable insights for practitioners working with long-context applications, establishing precise conditions under which SSMs offer advantages over Transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaetane Lorna N. Tchana, Damaris Belle M. Fotso, Antonio Hendricks, Christophe Bobda</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces SENA (SEamlessly NAtural), a geometry-driven image stitching approach that prioritizes structural fidelity in challenging real-world scenes characterized by parallax and depth variation. Conventional image stitching relies on homographic alignment, but this rigid planar assumption often fails in dual-camera setups with significant scene depth, leading to distortions such as visible warps and spherical bulging. SENA addresses these fundamental limitations through three key contributions. First, we propose a hierarchical affine-based warping strategy, combining global affine initialization with local affine refinement and smooth free-form deformation. This design preserves local shape, parallelism, and aspect ratios, thereby avoiding the hallucinated structural distortions commonly introduced by homography-based models. Second, we introduce a geometry-driven adequate zone detection mechanism that identifies parallax-minimized regions directly from the disparity consistency of RANSAC-filtered feature correspondences, without relying on semantic segmentation. Third, building upon this adequate zone, we perform anchor-based seamline cutting and segmentation, enforcing a one-to-one geometric correspondence across image pairs by construction, which effectively eliminates ghosting, duplication, and smearing artifacts in the final panorama.
  Extensive experiments conducted on challenging datasets demonstrate that SENA achieves alignment accuracy comparable to leading homography-based methods, while significantly outperforming them in critical visual metrics such as shape preservation, texture integrity, and overall visual realism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamad Khan (Artificial Intelligence Lab, Department of Computer Systems Engineering, University of Engineering,Applied Sciences), Saddam Hussain Khan (Artificial Intelligence Lab, Department of Computer Systems Engineering, University of Engineering,Applied Sciences)</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world clinical applications is constrained by the fundamental trade-off between computational cost and the efficiency of linear-time models. To address this, we propose an LLM-based MambaFormer hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for efficient medical question-answering (QA) and clinical assistance. The MambaFormer employs a lightweight gating mechanism that performs token-level dynamic routing to a customized Transformer expert (ET5) for short, complex queries or to a State Space Model expert (EMamba) for long, high-throughput sequences. The customized EMamba and ET5 models are tailored to accommodate input sequence dimensionality, embedding structure, sequence length, and target-specific output heads, and are fine-tuned through transfer learning on a new, custom-designed DentalQA dataset. Moreover, intelligent routing decisions are driven by the contextual complexity of token embeddings, normalized sequence length, and domain-aware features, thereby enforcing a Pareto-optimal trade-off between inference latency and prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a novel utility-guided multi-objective loss jointly optimizes decisions, router parameters, routing behavior, expert utilization, and computational cost by adaptively regulating token-level expert activation. Finally, the proposed MambaFormer is cross-validated (holdout) for medical QA on the new, custom-designed DentalQA and PubMedQA datasets and compared with state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed MambaFormer outperforms (BERTScore = 0.9180) with ultra-low latency (0.077 s), delivering a 24.4 speedup over T5-Large and establishing a scalable solution for resource-constrained clinical deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in interpreting lengthy, complex legal and policy language. However, their reliability can be undermined by hallucinations and inconsistencies, particularly when analyzing subjective and nuanced documents. These challenges are especially critical in medical coverage policy review, where human experts must be able to rely on accurate information. In this paper, we present an approach designed to support human reviewers by making policy interpretation more efficient and interpretable. We introduce a methodology that pairs a coverage-aware retriever with symbolic rule-based reasoning to surface relevant policy language, organize it into explicit facts and rules, and generate auditable rationales. This hybrid system minimizes the number of LLM inferences required which reduces overall model cost. Notably, our approach achieves a 44% reduction in inference cost alongside a 4.5% improvement in F1 score, demonstrating both efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01279">LLM Collusion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengyu Cao, Ming Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: We study how delegating pricing to large language models (LLMs) can facilitate collusion in a duopoly when both sellers rely on the same pre-trained model. The LLM is characterized by (i) a propensity parameter capturing its internal bias toward high-price recommendations and (ii) an output-fidelity parameter measuring how tightly outputs track that bias; the propensity evolves through retraining. We show that configuring LLMs for robustness and reproducibility can induce collusion via a phase transition: there exists a critical output-fidelity threshold that pins down long-run behavior. Below it, competitive pricing is the unique long-run outcome. Above it, the system is bistable, with competitive and collusive pricing both locally stable and the realized outcome determined by the model's initial preference. The collusive regime resembles tacit collusion: prices are elevated on average, yet occasional low-price recommendations provide plausible deniability. With perfect fidelity, full collusion emerges from any interior initial condition. For finite training batches of size $b$, infrequent retraining (driven by computational costs) further amplifies collusion: conditional on starting in the collusive basin, the probability of collusion approaches one as $b$ grows, since larger batches dampen stochastic fluctuations that might otherwise tip the system toward competition. The indeterminacy region shrinks at rate $O(1/\sqrt{b})$.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph structures are increasingly used in dialog memory systems, but empirical findings on their effectiveness remain inconsistent, making it unclear which design choices truly matter. We present an experimental, system-oriented analysis of long-term dialog memory architectures. We introduce a unified framework that decomposes dialog memory systems into core components and supports both graph-based and non-graph approaches. Under this framework, we conduct controlled, stage-wise experiments on LongMemEval and HaluMem, comparing common design choices in memory representation, organization, maintenance, and retrieval. Our results show that many performance differences are driven by foundational system settings rather than specific architectural innovations. Based on these findings, we identify stable and reliable strong baselines for future dialog memory research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from pixels is often bottlenecked by the performance and complexity of 3D rendered environments. Researchers face a trade-off between high-speed, low-level engines and slower, more accessible Python frameworks. To address this, we introduce PyBatchRender, a Python library for high-throughput, batched 3D rendering that achieves over 1 million FPS on simple scenes. Built on the Panda3D game engine, it utilizes its mature ecosystem while enhancing performance through optimized batched rendering for up to 1000X speedups. Designed as a physics-agnostic renderer for reinforcement learning from pixels, PyBatchRender offers greater flexibility than dedicated libraries, simpler setup than typical game-engine wrappers, and speeds rivaling state-of-the-art C++ engines like Madrona. Users can create custom scenes entirely in Python with tens of lines of code, enabling rapid prototyping for scalable AI training. Open-source and easy to integrate, it serves to democratize high-performance 3D simulation for researchers and developers. The library is available at https://github.com/dolphin-in-a-coma/PyBatchRender.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study timbre transfer as an inference-time editing problem for music audio. Starting from a strong pre-trained latent diffusion model, we introduce a lightweight procedure that requires no additional training: (i) a dimension-wise noise injection that targets latent channels most informative of instrument identity, and (ii) an early-step clamping mechanism that re-imposes the input's melodic and rhythmic structure during reverse diffusion. The method operates directly on audio latents and is compatible with text/audio conditioning (e.g., CLAP). We discuss design choices,analyze trade-offs between timbral change and structural preservation, and show that simple inference-time controls can meaningfully steer pre-trained models for style-transfer use cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davis Brown, Juan-Pablo Rivera, Dan Hendrycks, Mantas Mazeika</p>
<p>Abstract: As frontier AIs become more powerful and costly to develop, adversaries have increasing incentives to steal model weights by mounting exfiltration attacks. In this work, we consider exfiltration attacks where an adversary attempts to sneak model weights out of a datacenter over a network. While exfiltration attacks are multi-step cyber attacks, we demonstrate that a single factor, the compressibility of model weights, significantly heightens exfiltration risk for large language models (LLMs). We tailor compression specifically for exfiltration by relaxing decompression constraints and demonstrate that attackers could achieve 16x to 100x compression with minimal trade-offs, reducing the time it would take for an attacker to illicitly transmit model weights from the defender's server from months to days. Finally, we study defenses designed to reduce exfiltration risk in three distinct ways: making models harder to compress, making them harder to 'find,' and tracking provenance for post-attack analysis using forensic watermarks. While all defenses are promising, the forensic watermark defense is both effective and cheap, and therefore is a particularly attractive lever for mitigating weight-exfiltration risk.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anantha Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting distributional drift in high-dimensional data streams presents fundamental challenges: global comparison methods scale poorly, projection-based approaches lose geometric structure, and re-clustering methods suffer from identity instability. This paper introduces Argus, A framework that reconceptualizes drift detection as tracking local statistics over a fixed spatial partition of the data manifold.
  The key contributions are fourfold. First, it is proved that Voronoi tessellations over canonical orthonormal frames yield drift metrics that are invariant to orthogonal transformations. The rotations and reflections that preserve Euclidean geometry. Second, it is established that this framework achieves O(N) complexity per snapshot while providing cell-level spatial localization of distributional change. Third, a graph-theoretic characterization of drift propagation is developed that distinguishes coherent distributional shifts from isolated perturbations. Fourth, product quantization tessellation is introduced for scaling to very high dimensions (d>500) by decomposing the space into independent subspaces and aggregating drift signals across subspaces.
  This paper formalizes the theoretical foundations, proves invariance properties, and presents experimental validation demonstrating that the framework correctly identifies drift under coordinate rotation while existing methods produce false positives. The tessellated approach offers a principled geometric foundation for distribution monitoring that preserves high-dimensional structure without the computational burden of pairwise comparisons.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) frameworks suffer from linear memory scaling, rendering "System 2" parallel reasoning impractical on consumer hardware. We present Warp Cortex, an asynchronous architecture that theoretically enables million-agent cognitive scaling by decoupling agent logic from physical memory. Through Singleton Weight Sharing and a novel Topological Synapse--inspired by hybrid landmarking techniques from Topological Data Analysis (TDA)--we reduce memory complexity from O(N * L) to O(1) for weights and O(N * k) for context, where k << L. By treating the KV-cache as a point cloud in latent space, we apply witness-complex-inspired sparsification to preserve persistent homological features of the context manifold. On a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, we empirically demonstrate 100 concurrent agents at 2.2 GB total VRAM, with theoretical capacity exceeding 1,000 agents before compute latency becomes the bottleneck. We further introduce Referential Injection, a non-intrusive KV-cache update mechanism that allows asynchronous sub-agents to influence primary generation without stream disruption.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present T3C, a train-once, test-time budget-conditioned compression framework that exposes rank and precision as a controllable deployment knob. T3C combines elastic tensor factorization (maintained up to a maximal rank) with rank-tied mixed-precision quantization and a lightweight controller that maps a latency/energy/size budget token to per-layer rank/bit assignments; the policy snaps to hardware-aligned profiles and is monotone in the budget. A fast, layerwise consistency certificate, computed from spectral proxies and activation statistics, upper-bounds logit drift and regularizes training, yielding a practical reliability signal with negligible overhead. On ImageNet-1k, T3C shifts the vision Pareto frontier: for ResNet-50 at matched accuracy (\leq 0.5% drop), p50 latency is 1.18ms with a 38MB model, outperforming PTQ-8b (1.44ms, 88MB); for ViT-B/16, T3C reaches 2.30ms p50 with 59MB, improving over strong PTQ/QAT baselines. A single T3C checkpoint therefore provides predictable, certificate-backed accuracy-latency-size trade-offs on demand across devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Asadbeygi, Anne M. Robertson, Yasutaka Tobe, Masoud Zamani, Sean D. Stocker, Paul Watton, Naoki Yoshimura, Simon C Watkins</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate quantification of local strain fields during bladder contraction is essential for understanding the biomechanics of bladder micturition, in both health and disease. Conventional digital image correlation (DIC) methods have been successfully applied to various biological tissues; however, this approach requires artificial speckling, which can alter both passive and active properties of the tissue. In this study, we introduce a speckle-free framework for quantifying local strain fields using a state-of-the-art, zero-shot transformer model, CoTracker3. We utilized a custom-designed, portable isotonic biaxial apparatus compatible with multiphoton microscopy (MPM) to demonstrate this approach, successfully tracking natural bladder lumen textures without artificial markers. Benchmark tests validated the method's high pixel accuracy and low strain errors. Our framework effectively captured heterogeneous deformation patterns, despite complex folding and buckling, which conventional DIC often fails to track. Application to in vitro active bladder contractions in four rat specimens (n=4) revealed statistically significant anisotropy (p<0.01), with higher contraction longitudinally compared to circumferentially. Multiphoton microscopy further illustrated and confirmed heterogeneous morphological changes, such as large fold formation during active contraction. This non-invasive approach eliminates speckle-induced artifacts, enabling more physiologically relevant measurements, and has broad applicability for material testing of other biological and engineered systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models have become integral to software development, yet they frequently generate vulnerable code. Existing code vulnerability detection benchmarks employ binary classification, lacking the CWE-level specificity required for actionable feedback in iterative correction systems. We present ALPHA (Adaptive Learning via Penalty in Hierarchical Assessment), the first function-level Python benchmark that evaluates both LLMs and SAST tools using hierarchically aware, CWE-specific penalties. ALPHA distinguishes between over-generalisation, over-specification, and lateral errors, reflecting practical differences in diagnostic utility. Evaluating seven LLMs and two SAST tools, we find LLMs substantially outperform SAST, though SAST demonstrates higher precision when detections occur. Critically, prediction consistency varies dramatically across models (8.26%-81.87% agreement), with significant implications for feedback-driven systems. We further outline a pathway for future work incorporating ALPHA penalties into supervised fine-tuning, which could provide principled hierarchy-aware vulnerability detection pending empirical validation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongjie Wang, Niraj K. Jha</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve impressive performance but are limited by the quadratic complexity of self-attention, which prevents their deployment on edge devices and makes their understanding of high-resolution images and long-context videos prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, we introduce LinMU (Linear-complexity Multimodal Understanding), a VLM design that achieves linear complexity without using any quadratic-complexity modules while maintaining the performance of global-attention-based VLMs. LinMU replaces every self-attention layer in the VLM with the M-MATE block: a dual-branch module that combines a bidirectional state-space model for global context (Flex-MA branch) with localized Swin-style window attention (Local-Swin branch) for adjacent correlations. To transform a pre-trained VLM into the LinMU architecture, we propose a three-stage distillation framework that (i) initializes both branches with self-attention weights and trains the Flex-MA branch alone, (ii) unfreezes the Local-Swin branch and fine-tunes it jointly with the Flex-MA branch, and (iii) unfreezes the remaining blocks and fine-tunes them using LoRA adapters, while regressing on hidden states and token-level logits of the frozen VLM teacher. On MMMU, TextVQA, LongVideoBench, Video-MME, and other benchmarks, LinMU matches the performance of teacher models, yet reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 2.7$\times$ and improves token throughput by up to 9.0$\times$ on minute-length videos. Ablations confirm the importance of each distillation stage and the necessity of the two branches of the M-MATE block. The proposed framework demonstrates that state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning can be achieved without quadratic attention, thus opening up avenues for long-context VLMs that can deal with high-resolution images and long videos.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computational biology offers immense potential for reducing the high costs and protracted cycles of new drug development through adverse drug reaction (ADR) prediction. However, current methods remain impeded by drug data scarcity-induced cold-start challenge, closed label sets, and inadequate modeling of label dependencies. Here we propose an open-ended ADR prediction paradigm based on Graph-Motif feature fusion and Multi-Label Generation (GM-MLG). Leveraging molecular structure as an intrinsic and inherent feature, GM-MLG constructs a dual-graph representation architecture spanning the atomic level, the local molecular level (utilizing fine-grained motifs dynamically extracted via the BRICS algorithm combined with additional fragmentation rules), and the global molecular level. Uniquely, GM-MLG pioneers transforming ADR prediction from multi-label classification into Transformer Decoder-based multi-label generation. By treating ADR labels as discrete token sequences, it employs positional embeddings to explicitly capture dependencies and co-occurrence relationships within large-scale label spaces, generating predictions via autoregressive decoding to dynamically expand the prediction space. Experiments demonstrate GM-MLG achieves up to 38% improvement and an average gain of 20%, expanding the prediction space from 200 to over 10,000 types. Furthermore, it elucidates non-linear structure-activity relationships between ADRs and motifs via retrosynthetic motif analysis, providing interpretable and innovative support for systematic risk reduction in drug safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixuan Lai, He Wang, Kun Zhou, Tianjia Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Producing prompt-faithful videos that preserve a user-specified identity remains challenging: models need to extrapolate facial dynamics from sparse reference while balancing the tension between identity preservation and motion naturalness. Conditioning on a single image completely ignores the temporal signature, which leads to pose-locked motions, unnatural warping, and "average" faces when viewpoints and expressions change. To this end, we introduce an identity-conditioned variant of a diffusion-transformer video generator which uses a short reference video rather than a single portrait. Our key idea is to incorporate the dynamics in the reference. A short clip reveals subject-specific patterns, e.g., how smiles form, across poses and lighting. From this clip, a Sinkhorn-routed encoder learns compact identity tokens that capture characteristic dynamics while remaining pretrained backbone-compatible. Despite adding only lightweight conditioning, the approach consistently improves identity retention under large pose changes and expressive facial behavior, while maintaining prompt faithfulness and visual realism across diverse subjects and prompts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qundong Shi, Jie Zhou, Biyuan Lin, Junbo Cui, Guoyang Zeng, Yixuan Zhou, Ziyang Wang, Xin Liu, Zhen Luo, Yudong Wang, Zhiyuan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of audio foundation models has accelerated rapidly since the emergence of GPT-4o. However, the lack of comprehensive evaluation has become a critical bottleneck for further progress in the field, particularly in audio generation. Current audio evaluation faces three major challenges: (1) audio evaluation lacks a unified framework, with datasets and code scattered across various sources, hindering fair and efficient cross-model comparison;(2) audio codecs, as a key component of audio foundation models, lack a widely accepted and holistic evaluation methodology; (3) existing speech benchmarks are heavily reliant on English, making it challenging to objectively assess models' performance on Chinese. To address the first issue, we introduce UltraEval-Audio, a unified evaluation framework for audio foundation models, specifically designed for both audio understanding and generation tasks. UltraEval-Audio features a modular architecture, supporting 10 languages and 14 core task categories, while seamlessly integrating 24 mainstream models and 36 authoritative benchmarks. To enhance research efficiency, the framework provides a one-command evaluation feature, accompanied by real-time public leaderboards. For the second challenge, UltraEval-Audio adopts a novel comprehensive evaluation scheme for audio codecs, evaluating performance across three key dimensions: semantic accuracy, timbre fidelity, and acoustic quality. To address the third issue, we propose two new Chinese benchmarks, SpeechCMMLU and SpeechHSK, designed to assess Chinese knowledge proficiency and language fluency. We wish that UltraEval-Audio will provide both academia and industry with a transparent, efficient, and fair platform for comparison of audio models. Our code, benchmarks, and leaderboards are available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/UltraEval-Audio.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yen-Chia Chen, Hsing-Kuo Pao, Hanjuan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used across computer vision and other domains. When working on the model induction, selecting the right architecture for a given dataset often relies on repetitive trial-and-error procedures. This procedure is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and difficult to automate. While previous work has explored performance prediction using partial training or complex simulations, these methods often require significant computational overhead or lack generalizability. In this work, we propose an alternative approach: a lightweight, two-stage framework that can estimate model performance before training given the understanding of the dataset and the focused deep model structures. The first stage predicts a baseline based on the analysis of some measurable properties of the dataset, while the second stage adjusts the estimation with additional information on the model's architectural and hyperparameter details. The setup allows the framework to generalize across datasets and model types. Moreover, we find that some of the underlying features used for prediction - such as dataset variance - can offer practical guidance for model selection, and can serve as early indicators of data quality. As a result, the framework can be used not only to forecast model performance, but also to guide architecture choices, inform necessary preprocessing procedures, and detect potentially problematic datasets before training begins.</p>

<p>Abstract: Parking is a critical task for autonomous driving systems (ADS), with unique challenges in crowded parking slots and GPS-denied environments. However, existing works focus on 2D parking slot perception, mapping, and localization, 3D reconstruction remains underexplored, which is crucial for capturing complex spatial geometry in parking scenarios. Naively improving the visual quality of reconstructed parking scenes does not directly benefit autonomous parking, as the key entry point for parking is the slots perception module. To address these limitations, we curate the first benchmark named ParkRecon3D, specifically designed for parking scene reconstruction. It includes sensor data from four surround-view fisheye cameras with calibrated extrinsics and dense parking slot annotations. We then propose ParkGaussian, the first framework that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for parking scene reconstruction. To further improve the alignment between reconstruction and downstream parking slot detection, we introduce a slot-aware reconstruction strategy that leverages existing parking perception methods to enhance the synthesis quality of slot regions. Experiments on ParkRecon3D demonstrate that ParkGaussian achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and better preserves perception consistency for downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongzhe Li, Lin Guan, Zihan Cai, Zuxian Lin, Jiyu Huang, Liukai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing deep learning models with strong adaptability to topological variations is of great practical significance for power flow analysis. To enhance model performance under variable system scales and improve robustness in branch power prediction, this paper proposes a Scale-adaptive Multi-task Power Flow Analysis (SaMPFA) framework. SaMPFA introduces a Local Topology Slicing (LTS) sampling technique that extracts subgraphs of different scales from the complete power network to strengthen the model's cross-scale learning capability. Furthermore, a Reference-free Multi-task Graph Learning (RMGL) model is designed for robust power flow prediction. Unlike existing approaches, RMGL predicts bus voltages and branch powers instead of phase angles. This design not only avoids the risk of error amplification in branch power calculation but also guides the model to learn the physical relationships of phase angle differences. In addition, the loss function incorporates extra terms that encourage the model to capture the physical patterns of angle differences and power transmission, further improving consistency between predictions and physical laws. Simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system and a real provincial grid in China demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior adaptability and generalization under variable system scales, with accuracy improvements of 4.47% and 36.82%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zewei Yu, Jianqiu Xu, Caimin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing volume of streaming data in industrial systems, online anomaly detection has become a critical task. The diverse and rapidly evolving data patterns pose significant challenges for online anomaly detection. Many existing anomaly detection methods are designed for offline settings or have difficulty in handling heterogeneous streaming data effectively. This paper proposes GDME, an unsupervised graph-based framework for online time series anomaly detection using model ensemble. GDME maintains a dynamic model pool that is continuously updated by pruning underperforming models and introducing new ones. It utilizes a dynamic graph structure to represent relationships among models and employs community detection on the graph to select an appropriate subset for ensemble. The graph structure is also used to detect concept drift by monitoring structural changes, allowing the framework to adapt to evolving streaming data. Experiments on seven heterogeneous time series demonstrate that GDME outperforms existing online anomaly detection methods, achieving improvements of up to 24%. In addition, its ensemble strategy provides superior detection performance compared with both individual models and average ensembles, with competitive computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Habiba Kausar, Saeed Anwar, Omar Jamal Hammad, Abdul Bais</p>
<p>Abstract: Face super-resolution aims to recover high-quality facial images from severely degraded low-resolution inputs, but remains challenging due to the loss of fine structural details and identity-specific features. This work introduces SwinIFS, a landmark-guided super-resolution framework that integrates structural priors with hierarchical attention mechanisms to achieve identity-preserving reconstruction at both moderate and extreme upscaling factors. The method incorporates dense Gaussian heatmaps of key facial landmarks into the input representation, enabling the network to focus on semantically important facial regions from the earliest stages of processing. A compact Swin Transformer backbone is employed to capture long-range contextual information while preserving local geometry, allowing the model to restore subtle facial textures and maintain global structural consistency. Extensive experiments on the CelebA benchmark demonstrate that SwinIFS achieves superior perceptual quality, sharper reconstructions, and improved identity retention; it consistently produces more photorealistic results and exhibits strong performance even under 8x magnification, where most methods fail to recover meaningful structure. SwinIFS also provides an advantageous balance between reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications in facial enhancement, surveillance, and digital restoration.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jisoo Lee, Sunki Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate grid load forecasting is safety-critical: under-predictions risk supply shortfalls, while symmetric error metrics mask this operational asymmetry. We introduce a grid-specific evaluation framework--Asymmetric MAPE, Under-Prediction Rate, and Reserve Margin--that directly measures operational risk rather than statistical accuracy alone.
  Using this framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of Mamba-based State Space Models for California grid forecasting on a weather-aligned CAISO TAC-area dataset spanning Nov 2023--Nov 2025 (84,498 hourly records across 5 transmission areas). Our analysis reveals that standard accuracy metrics are poor proxies for operational safety: models with identical MAPE can require vastly different reserve margins.
  We demonstrate that forecast errors are weakly but significantly associated with temperature (r = 0.16, p < 10^{-16}), motivating weather-aware modeling rather than loss function modification alone. The S-Mamba model achieves the lowest Reserve_{99.5}% margin (14.12%) compared to 16.66% for iTransformer, demonstrating superior forecast reliability under a 99.5th-percentile tail-risk reserve proxy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Russell Buchanan, Adrian R\"ofer, Jo\~ao Moura, Abhinav Valada, Sethu Vijayakumar</p>
<p>Abstract: From refrigerators to kitchen drawers, humans interact with articulated objects effortlessly every day while completing household chores. For automating these tasks, service robots must be capable of manipulating arbitrary articulated objects. Recent deep learning methods have been shown to predict valuable priors on the affordance of articulated objects from vision. In contrast, many other works estimate object articulations by observing the articulation motion, but this requires the robot to already be capable of manipulating the object. In this article, we propose a novel approach combining these methods by using a factor graph for online estimation of articulation which fuses learned visual priors and proprioceptive sensing during interaction into an analytical model of articulation based on Screw Theory. With our method, a robotic system makes an initial prediction of articulation from vision before touching the object, and then quickly updates the estimate from kinematic and force sensing during manipulation. We evaluate our method extensively in both simulations and real-world robotic manipulation experiments. We demonstrate several closed-loop estimation and manipulation experiments in which the robot was capable of opening previously unseen drawers. In real hardware experiments, the robot achieved a 75% success rate for autonomous opening of unknown articulated objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Feng, Zhihong Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with zeroth-order (ZO) optimization reduces memory by approximating gradients through function evaluations, but existing methods rely on one-step gradient estimates from random perturbations. We introduce Bayesian Subspace Zeroth-Order optimization (BSZO), a ZO optimizer that applies Kalman filtering to combine finite-difference information across multiple perturbation directions. By treating each finite-difference measurement as a noisy observation, BSZO builds a posterior distribution over the projected gradient and updates it through Bayesian inference, with a residual-based adaptive mechanism to adjust perturbation scales. Theoretical analysis shows that BSZO improves the convergence rate by a factor of $k/\gamma$ compared to standard ZO methods. Experiments on RoBERTa, Mistral, and OPT models show that BSZO outperforms MeZO, MeZO-Adam, and HiZOO across various tasks, achieving up to 6.67\% absolute average improvement on OPT-13B while keeping memory usage close to inference-only baselines (1.00$\times$--1.08$\times$ of MeZO).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentao Bian, Fenglei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we revisit multimodal few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation (FS-PCS), identifying a conflict in "Fuse-then-Refine" paradigms: the "Plasticity-Stability Dilemma." In addition, CLIP's inter-class confusion can result in semantic blindness. To address these issues, we present the Decoupled-experts Arbitration Few-Shot SegNet (DA-FSS), a model that effectively distinguishes between semantic and geometric paths and mutually regularizes their gradients to achieve better generalization. DA-FSS employs the same backbone and pre-trained text encoder as MM-FSS to generate text embeddings, which can increase free modalities' utilization rate and better leverage each modality's information space. To achieve this, we propose a Parallel Expert Refinement module to generate each modal correlation. We also propose a Stacked Arbitration Module (SAM) to perform convolutional fusion and arbitrate correlations for each modality pathway. The Parallel Experts decouple two paths: a Geometric Expert maintains plasticity, and a Semantic Expert ensures stability. They are coordinated via a Decoupled Alignment Module (DAM) that transfers knowledge without propagating confusion. Experiments on popular datasets (S3DIS, ScanNet) demonstrate the superiority of DA-FSS over MM-FSS. Meanwhile, geometric boundaries, completeness, and texture differentiation are all superior to the baseline. The code is available at: https://github.com/MoWenQAQ/DA-FSS.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved breakthroughs in various real-world downstream tasks due to their powerful expressiveness. As the scale of real-world graphs has been continuously growing, \textit{a storage-based approach to GNN training} has been studied, which leverages external storage (e.g., NVMe SSDs) to handle such web-scale graphs on a single machine. Although such storage-based GNN training methods have shown promising potential in large-scale GNN training, we observed that they suffer from a severe bottleneck in data preparation since they overlook a critical challenge: \textit{how to handle a large number of small storage I/Os}. To address the challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel storage-based GNN training framework, named \textsf{AGNES}, that employs a method of \textit{block-wise storage I/O processing} to fully utilize the I/O bandwidth of high-performance storage devices. Moreover, to further enhance the efficiency of each storage I/O, \textsf{AGNES} employs a simple yet effective strategy, \textit{hyperbatch-based processing} based on the characteristics of real-world graphs. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world graphs reveal that \textsf{AGNES} consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art methods, by up to 4.1$\times$ faster than the best competitor.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyue Zhang, Luxi Lin, Xiaolin Hu, Chao Chang, HuaiXi Wang, Yiyi Zhou, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion inversion is a task of recovering the noise of an image in a diffusion model, which is vital for controllable diffusion image editing. At present, diffusion inversion still remains a challenging task due to the lack of viable supervision signals. Thus, most existing methods resort to approximation-based solutions, which however are often at the cost of performance or efficiency. To remedy these shortcomings, we propose a novel self-supervised diffusion inversion approach in this paper, termed Deep Inversion (DeepInv). Instead of requiring ground-truth noise annotations, we introduce a self-supervised objective as well as a data augmentation strategy to generate high-quality pseudo noises from real images without manual intervention. Based on these two innovative designs, DeepInv is also equipped with an iterative and multi-scale training regime to train a parameterized inversion solver, thereby achieving the fast and accurate image-to-noise mapping. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of presenting a trainable solver to predict inversion noise step by step. The extensive experiments show that our DeepInv can achieve much better performance and inference speed than the compared methods, e.g., +40.435% SSIM than EasyInv and +9887.5% speed than ReNoise on COCO dataset. Moreover, our careful designs of trainable solvers can also provide insights to the community. Codes and model parameters will be released in https://github.com/potato-kitty/DeepInv.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junichiro Niimi</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs), hallucinations, which are non-factual fabrications in model outputs, have become serious concerns. Reasoning capabilities have received attention as a self-verification process to improve output reliability. However, the effect of reasoning within a closed system where LLMs cannot rely on external tools or knowledge has yet to be clarified. We therefore conduct experiments under strict constraints (recommending peer-reviewed journal articles in computer science) to examine the effect of reasoning across multiple models (GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Flash). Our results reveal a problematic trade-off between constraint compliance and factual accuracy. Non-reasoning models exhibit high constraint violation rates (66-75%) but maintain factual accuracy, while reasoning models reduce violations (13-26%) but systematically distort known facts to satisfy constraints and increase complete fabrication. This trade-off pattern is consistent across both models despite different architectures, indicating a fundamental limitation of reasoning. Furthermore, reasoning does not uniformly improve output authenticity: effects diverge by model, reflecting different allocations of the compliance-truthfulness trade-off. These findings challenge the assumption that reasoning universally improves reliability: reasoning models trade honest constraint violations for detection-resistant distortions.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we settle the problem of learning optimal linear contracts from data in the offline setting, where agent types are drawn from an unknown distribution and the principal's goal is to design a contract that maximizes her expected utility. Specifically, our analysis shows that the simple Empirical Utility Maximization (EUM) algorithm yields an $\varepsilon$-approximation of the optimal linear contract with probability at least $1-\delta$, using just $O(\ln(1/\delta) / \varepsilon^2)$ samples. This result improves upon previously known bounds and matches a lower bound from Duetting et al. [2025] up to constant factors, thereby proving its optimality. Our analysis uses a chaining argument, where the key insight is to leverage a simple structural property of linear contracts: their expected reward is non-decreasing. This property, which holds even though the utility function itself is non-monotone and discontinuous, enables the construction of fine-grained nets required for the chaining argument, which in turn yields the optimal sample complexity. Furthermore, our proof establishes the stronger guarantee of uniform convergence: the empirical utility of every linear contract is a $\varepsilon$-approximation of its true expectation with probability at least $1-\delta$, using the same optimal $O(\ln(1/\delta) / \varepsilon^2)$ sample complexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual reasoning but still struggle with integrating external knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising solution, but current methods remain inefficient and often fail to maintain high answer quality. To address these challenges, we propose VideoSpeculateRAG, an efficient VLM-based RAG framework built on two key ideas. First, we introduce a speculative decoding pipeline: a lightweight draft model quickly generates multiple answer candidates, which are then verified and refined by a more accurate heavyweight model, substantially reducing inference latency without sacrificing correctness. Second, we identify a major source of error - incorrect entity recognition in retrieved knowledge - and mitigate it with a simple yet effective similarity-based filtering strategy that improves entity alignment and boosts overall answer accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that VideoSpeculateRAG achieves comparable or higher accuracy than standard RAG approaches while accelerating inference by approximately 2x. Our framework highlights the potential of combining speculative decoding with retrieval-augmented reasoning to enhance efficiency and reliability in complex, knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Zhou, Hao Shao, Letian Wang, Zhuofan Zong, Hongsheng Li, Steven L. Waslander</p>
<p>Abstract: Video generation models, as one form of world models, have emerged as one of the most exciting frontiers in AI, promising agents the ability to imagine the future by modeling the temporal evolution of complex scenes. In autonomous driving, this vision gives rise to driving world models: generative simulators that imagine ego and agent futures, enabling scalable simulation, safe testing of corner cases, and rich synthetic data generation. Yet, despite fast-growing research activity, the field lacks a rigorous benchmark to measure progress and guide priorities. Existing evaluations remain limited: generic video metrics overlook safety-critical imaging factors; trajectory plausibility is rarely quantified; temporal and agent-level consistency is neglected; and controllability with respect to ego conditioning is ignored. Moreover, current datasets fail to cover the diversity of conditions required for real-world deployment. To address these gaps, we present DrivingGen, the first comprehensive benchmark for generative driving world models. DrivingGen combines a diverse evaluation dataset curated from both driving datasets and internet-scale video sources, spanning varied weather, time of day, geographic regions, and complex maneuvers, with a suite of new metrics that jointly assess visual realism, trajectory plausibility, temporal coherence, and controllability. Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art models reveals clear trade-offs: general models look better but break physics, while driving-specific ones capture motion realistically but lag in visual quality. DrivingGen offers a unified evaluation framework to foster reliable, controllable, and deployable driving world models, enabling scalable simulation, planning, and data-driven decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have largely favored resource-rich languages, leaving a significant gap in high-quality datasets for low-resource languages like Hindi. This scarcity is particularly evident in text summarization, where the development of robust models is hindered by a lack of diverse, specialized corpora.
  To address this disparity, this study introduces a cost-effective, automated framework for creating a comprehensive Hindi text summarization dataset. By leveraging the English Extreme Summarization (XSUM) dataset as a source, we employ advanced translation and linguistic adaptation techniques. To ensure high fidelity and contextual relevance, we utilize the Crosslingual Optimized Metric for Evaluation of Translation (COMET) for validation, supplemented by the selective use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for curation.
  The resulting dataset provides a diverse, multi-thematic resource that mirrors the complexity of the original XSUM corpus. This initiative not only provides a direct tool for Hindi NLP research but also offers a scalable methodology for democratizing NLP in other underserved languages. By reducing the costs associated with dataset creation, this work fosters the development of more nuanced, culturally relevant models in computational linguistics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianjun Gu, Chenghua Gong, Jingyu Gong, Zhizhong Zhang, Yuan Xie, Lizhuang Ma, Xin Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to reason about spatial dynamics is a cornerstone of intelligence, yet current research overlooks the human intent behind spatial changes. To address these limitations, we introduce Teleo-Spatial Intelligence (TSI), a new paradigm that unifies two critical pillars: Physical-Dynamic Reasoning--understanding the physical principles of object interactions--and Intent-Driven Reasoning--inferring the human goals behind these actions. To catalyze research in TSI, we present EscherVerse, consisting of a large-scale, open-world benchmark (Escher-Bench), a dataset (Escher-35k), and models (Escher series). Derived from real-world videos, EscherVerse moves beyond constrained settings to explicitly evaluate an agent's ability to reason about object permanence, state transitions, and trajectory prediction in dynamic, human-centric scenarios. Crucially, it is the first benchmark to systematically assess Intent-Driven Reasoning, challenging models to connect physical events to their underlying human purposes. Our work, including a novel data curation pipeline, provides a foundational resource to advance spatial intelligence from passive scene description toward a holistic, purpose-driven understanding of the world.</p>

<p>Abstract: Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription (SATS) aims to transcribe what is said and to precisely determine the timing of each speaker, which is particularly valuable for meeting transcription. Existing SATS systems rarely adopt an end-to-end formulation and are further constrained by limited context windows, weak long-range speaker memory, and the inability to output timestamps. To address these limitations, we present MOSS Transcribe Diarize, a unified multimodal large language model that jointly performs Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription in an end-to-end paradigm. Trained on extensive real wild data and equipped with a 128k context window for up to 90-minute inputs, MOSS Transcribe Diarize scales well and generalizes robustly. Across comprehensive evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art commercial systems on multiple public and in-house benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengfei Qu, Wenyu Ouyang, Chi Zhang, Yikai Chai, Shuolong Xu, Lei Ye, Yongri Piao, Miao Zhang, Huchuan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting river flow in places without streamflow records is challenging because basins respond differently to climate, terrain, vegetation, and soils. Traditional basin attributes describe some of these differences, but they cannot fully represent the complexity of natural environments. This study examines whether AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, which are learned from large collections of satellite images rather than designed by experts, offer a more informative way to describe basin characteristics. These embeddings summarize patterns in vegetation, land surface properties, and long-term environmental dynamics. We find that models using them achieve higher accuracy when predicting flows in basins not used for training, suggesting that they capture key physical differences more effectively than traditional attributes. We further investigate how selecting appropriate donor basins influences prediction in ungauged regions. Similarity based on the embeddings helps identify basins with comparable environmental and hydrological behavior, improving performance, whereas adding many dissimilar basins can reduce accuracy. The results show that satellite-informed environmental representations can strengthen hydrological forecasting and support the development of models that adapt more easily to different landscapes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Joint audio-video generation aims to synthesize synchronized multisensory content, yet current unified models struggle with fine-grained acoustic control, particularly for identity-preserving speech. Existing approaches either suffer from temporal misalignment due to cascaded generation or lack the capability to perform zero-shot voice cloning within a joint synthesis framework. In this work, we present MM-Sonate, a multimodal flow-matching framework that unifies controllable audio-video joint generation with zero-shot voice cloning capabilities. Unlike prior works that rely on coarse semantic descriptions, MM-Sonate utilizes a unified instruction-phoneme input to enforce strict linguistic and temporal alignment. To enable zero-shot voice cloning, we introduce a timbre injection mechanism that effectively decouples speaker identity from linguistic content. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of standard classifier-free guidance in multimodal settings, we propose a noise-based negative conditioning strategy that utilizes natural noise priors to significantly enhance acoustic fidelity. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MM-Sonate establishes new state-of-the-art performance in joint generation benchmarks, significantly outperforming baselines in lip synchronization and speech intelligibility, while achieving voice cloning fidelity comparable to specialized Text-to-Speech systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating novelty is critical yet challenging in peer review, as reviewers must assess submissions against a vast, rapidly evolving literature. This report presents OpenNovelty, an LLM-powered agentic system for transparent, evidence-based novelty analysis. The system operates through four phases: (1) extracting the core task and contribution claims to generate retrieval queries; (2) retrieving relevant prior work based on extracted queries via semantic search engine; (3) constructing a hierarchical taxonomy of core-task-related work and performing contribution-level full-text comparisons against each contribution; and (4) synthesizing all analyses into a structured novelty report with explicit citations and evidence snippets. Unlike naive LLM-based approaches, \textsc{OpenNovelty} grounds all assessments in retrieved real papers, ensuring verifiable judgments. We deploy our system on 500+ ICLR 2026 submissions with all reports publicly available on our website, and preliminary analysis suggests it can identify relevant prior work, including closely related papers that authors may overlook. OpenNovelty aims to empower the research community with a scalable tool that promotes fair, consistent, and evidence-backed peer review.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zibo Zhao (Arizona State University), Yuanting Zha (ShanghaiTech University), Haipeng Zhang (ShanghaiTech University), Xingcheng Xu (Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory)</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-reflection capabilities emerge in Large Language Models after RL post-training, with multi-turn RL achieving substantial gains over SFT counterparts. Yet the mechanism of how a unified optimization objective gives rise to functionally distinct capabilities of generating solutions and evaluating when to revise them remains opaque. To address this question, we introduce the Gradient Attribution Property to characterize how reward gradients distribute across policy components, formalized through the Two-Stage Decision-Sampling (DS) Hypothesis, which decomposes the policy into sampling ($\pi_{sample}$) for generation and decision ($\pi_{d}$) for verification. We prove that surrogate rewards exhibit Balanced Gradient Attribution, while SFT and KL penalties exhibit Unbalanced Gradient Attribution, with length-weighting creating asymmetric regularization that constrains $\pi_{sample}$ while leaving $\pi_{d}$ under-optimized, providing an theoretical explanation of why RL succeeds where SFT fails. We also empirically validate our theoretical predictions on arithmetic reasoning demonstrates that RL's superior generalization stems primarily from improved decision-making ($\pi_{d}$) rather than sampling capabilities, providing a first-principles mechanistic explanation for self-correction in thinking models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishav Sen, Fangqi Liu, Jose Paolo Talusan, Ava Pettet, Yoshinori Suzue, Mark Bailey, Ayan Mukhopadhyay, Abhishek Dubey</p>
<p>Abstract: The growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) creates a conflict in vehicle-to-building (V2B) settings between building operators, who face high energy costs from uncoordinated charging, and drivers, who prioritize convenience and a full charge. To resolve this, we propose a negotiation-based framework that, by design, guarantees voluntary participation, strategy-proofness, and budget feasibility. It transforms EV charging into a strategic resource by offering drivers a range of incentive-backed options for modest flexibility in their departure time or requested state of charge (SoC). Our framework is calibrated with user survey data and validated using real operational data from a commercial building and an EV manufacturer. Simulations show that our negotiation protocol creates a mutually beneficial outcome: lowering the building operator's costs by over 3.5\% compared to an optimized, non-negotiating smart charging policy, while simultaneously reducing user charging expenses by 22\% below the utility's retail energy rate. By aligning operator and EV user objectives, our framework provides a strategic bridge between energy and mobility systems, transforming EV charging from a source of operational friction into a platform for collaboration and shared savings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Di, Xinglin Piao, Fei Wang, Guodong Jing, Yong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting is critically important for meteorological forecasting. Deep learning-based Radar Echo Extrapolation (REE) has become a predominant nowcasting approach, yet it suffers from poor generalization due to its reliance on high-quality local training data and static model parameters, limiting its applicability across diverse regions and extreme events. To overcome this, we propose REE-TTT, a novel model that incorporates an adaptive Test-Time Training (TTT) mechanism. The core of our model lies in the newly designed Spatio-temporal Test-Time Training (ST-TTT) block, which replaces the standard linear projections in TTT layers with task-specific attention mechanisms, enabling robust adaptation to non-stationary meteorological distributions and thereby significantly enhancing the feature representation of precipitation. Experiments under cross-regional extreme precipitation scenarios demonstrate that REE-TTT substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in prediction accuracy and generalization, exhibiting remarkable adaptability to data distribution shifts.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in healthcare field, it becomes essential to carefully evaluate their medical safety before clinical use. However, existing safety benchmarks remain predominantly English-centric, and test with only single-turn prompts despite multi-turn clinical consultations. To address these gaps, we introduce JMedEthicBench, the first multi-turn conversational benchmark for evaluating medical safety of LLMs for Japanese healthcare. Our benchmark is based on 67 guidelines from the Japan Medical Association and contains over 50,000 adversarial conversations generated using seven automatically discovered jailbreak strategies. Using a dual-LLM scoring protocol, we evaluate 27 models and find that commercial models maintain robust safety while medical-specialized models exhibit increased vulnerability. Furthermore, safety scores decline significantly across conversation turns (median: 9.5 to 5.0, $p < 0.001$). Cross-lingual evaluation on both Japanese and English versions of our benchmark reveals that medical model vulnerabilities persist across languages, indicating inherent alignment limitations rather than language-specific factors. These findings suggest that domain-specific fine-tuning may accidentally weaken safety mechanisms and that multi-turn interactions represent a distinct threat surface requiring dedicated alignment strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Xiang Li, Yash Shah, Lorenzo Giusti</p>
<p>Abstract: In the face of adverse motives, it is indispensable to achieve a consensus. Elections have been the canonical way by which modern democracy has operated since the 17th century. Nowadays, they regulate markets, provide an engine for modern recommender systems or peer-to-peer networks, and remain the main approach to represent democracy. However, a desirable universal voting rule that satisfies all hypothetical scenarios is still a challenging topic, and the design of these systems is at the forefront of mechanism design research. Automated mechanism design is a promising approach, and recent works have demonstrated that set-invariant architectures are uniquely suited to modelling electoral systems. However, various concerns prevent the direct application to real-world settings, such as robustness to strategic voting. In this paper, we generalise the expressive capability of learned voting rules, and combine improvements in neural network architecture with adversarial training to improve the resilience of voting rules while maximizing social welfare. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our method resolves critical limitations of prior work regarding learning voting rules by representing elections using bipartite graphs, and learning such voting rules using graph neural networks. We believe this opens new frontiers for applying machine learning to real-world elections.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emiliya Khidirova, Oktay Karaku\c{s}</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate crop yield prediction relies on diverse data streams, including satellite, meteorological, soil, and topographic information. However, despite rapid advances in machine learning, existing approaches remain crop- or region-specific and require data engineering efforts. This limits scalability, reproducibility, and operational deployment. This study introduces UniCrop, a universal and reusable data pipeline designed to automate the acquisition, cleaning, harmonisation, and engineering of multi-source environmental data for crop yield prediction. For any given location, crop type, and temporal window, UniCrop automatically retrieves, harmonises, and engineers over 200 environmental variables (Sentinel-1/2, MODIS, ERA5-Land, NASA POWER, SoilGrids, and SRTM), reducing them to a compact, analysis-ready feature set utilising a structured feature reduction workflow with minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR). To validate, UniCrop was applied to a rice yield dataset comprising 557 field observations. Using only the selected 15 features, four baseline machine learning models (LightGBM, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, and Elastic Net) were trained. LightGBM achieved the best single-model performance (RMSE = 465.1 kg/ha, $R^2 = 0.6576$), while a constrained ensemble of all baselines further improved accuracy (RMSE = 463.2 kg/ha, $R^2 = 0.6604$). UniCrop contributes a scalable and transparent data-engineering framework that addresses the primary bottleneck in operational crop yield modelling: the preparation of consistent and harmonised multi-source data. By decoupling data specification from implementation and supporting any crop, region, and time frame through simple configuration updates, UniCrop provides a practical foundation for scalable agricultural analytics.

<p>Abstract: We study generative modeling of \emph{variable-length trajectories} -- sequences of visited locations/items with associated timestamps -- for downstream simulation and counterfactual analysis. A recurring practical issue is that standard mini-batch training can be unstable when trajectory lengths are highly heterogeneous, which in turn degrades \emph{distribution matching} for trajectory-derived statistics. We propose \textbf{length-aware sampling (LAS)}, a simple batching strategy that groups trajectories by length and samples batches from a single length bucket, reducing within-batch length heterogeneity (and making updates more consistent) without changing the model class. We integrate LAS into a conditional trajectory GAN with auxiliary time-alignment losses and provide (i) a distribution-level guarantee for derived variables under mild boundedness assumptions, and (ii) an IPM/Wasserstein mechanism explaining why LAS improves distribution matching by removing length-only shortcut critics and targeting within-bucket discrepancies. Empirically, LAS consistently improves matching of derived-variable distributions on a multi-mall dataset of shopper trajectories and on diverse public sequence datasets (GPS, education, e-commerce, and movies), outperforming random sampling across dataset-specific metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great promise in addressing multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs). Nevertheless, the robustness of these learning-based solvers has remained insufficiently explored, especially across diverse and complex problem distributions. In this paper, we propose a unified robustness-oriented framework for preference-conditioned DRL solvers for MOCOPs. Within this framework, we develop a preference-based adversarial attack to generate hard instances that expose solver weaknesses, and quantify the attack impact by the resulting degradation on Pareto-front quality. We further introduce a defense strategy that integrates hardness-aware preference selection into adversarial training to reduce overfitting to restricted preference regions and improve out-of-distribution performance. The experimental results on multi-objective traveling salesman problem (MOTSP), multi-objective capacitated vehicle routing problem (MOCVRP), and multi-objective knapsack problem (MOKP) verify that our attack method successfully learns hard instances for different solvers. Furthermore, our defense method significantly strengthens the robustness and generalizability of neural solvers, delivering superior performance on hard or out-of-distribution instances.</p>

<p>Abstract: Clinicians routinely navigate fragmented electronic health record (EHR) interfaces to assemble a coherent picture of a patient's problems, medications, recent encounters, and longitudinal trends. This work describes EHRSummarizer, a privacy-aware, FHIR-native reference architecture that retrieves a targeted set of high-yield FHIR R4 resources, normalizes them into a consistent clinical context package, and produces structured summaries intended to support structured chart review. The system can be configured for data minimization, stateless processing, and flexible deployment, including local inference within an organization's trust boundary. To mitigate the risk of unsupported or unsafe behavior, the summarization stage is constrained to evidence present in the retrieved context package, is intended to indicate missing or unavailable domains where feasible, and avoids diagnostic or treatment recommendations. Prototype demonstrations on synthetic and test FHIR environments illustrate end-to-end behavior and output formats; however, this manuscript does not report clinical outcomes or controlled workflow studies. We outline an evaluation plan centered on faithfulness, omission risk, temporal correctness, usability, and operational monitoring to guide future institutional assessments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Private macOS frameworks underpin critical services and daemons but remain undocumented and distributed only as stripped binaries, complicating security analysis. We present MOTIF, an agentic framework that integrates tool-augmented analysis with a finetuned large language model specialized for Objective-C type inference. The agent manages runtime metadata extraction, binary inspection, and constraint checking, while the model generates candidate method signatures that are validated and refined into compilable headers. On MOTIF-Bench, a benchmark built from public frameworks with groundtruth headers, MOTIF improves signature recovery from 15% to 86% compared to baseline static analysis tooling, with consistent gains in tool-use correctness and inference stability. Case studies on private frameworks show that reconstructed headers compile, link, and facilitate downstream security research and vulnerability studies. By transforming opaque binaries into analyzable interfaces, MOTIF establishes a scalable foundation for systematic auditing of macOS internals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinwei Hu, Xinmiao Huang, Youcheng Sun, Yi Dong, Xiaowei Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) transition to autonomous agents synthesizing real-time information, their reasoning capabilities introduce an unexpected attack surface. This paper introduces a novel threat where colluding agents steer victim beliefs using only truthful evidence fragments distributed through public channels, without relying on covert communications, backdoors, or falsified documents. By exploiting LLMs' overthinking tendency, we formalize the first cognitive collusion attack and propose Generative Montage: a Writer-Editor-Director framework that constructs deceptive narratives through adversarial debate and coordinated posting of evidence fragments, causing victims to internalize and propagate fabricated conclusions. To study this risk, we develop CoPHEME, a dataset derived from real-world rumor events, and simulate attacks across diverse LLM families. Our results show pervasive vulnerability across 14 LLM families: attack success rates reach 74.4% for proprietary models and 70.6% for open-weights models. Counterintuitively, stronger reasoning capabilities increase susceptibility, with reasoning-specialized models showing higher attack success than base models or prompts. Furthermore, these false beliefs then cascade to downstream judges, achieving over 60% deception rates, highlighting a socio-technical vulnerability in how LLM-based agents interact with dynamic information environments.

In this work, we propose FALCON, a cross-domain few-shot segmentation framework that achieves high-precision 3D volume segmentation by processing data as 2D slices. The framework is first meta-trained on natural images to learn-to-learn generalizable segmentation priors, then transferred to the medical domain via adversarial fine-tuning and boundary-aware learning. Task-aware inference, conditioned on support cues, allows FALCON to adapt dynamically to patient-specific anatomical variations across slices. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that FALCON consistently achieves the lowest Hausdorff Distance scores, indicating superior boundary accuracy while maintaining a Dice Similarity Coefficient comparable to the state-of-the-art models. Notably, these results are achieved with significantly less labeled data, no data augmentation, and substantially lower computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Ayalew Belay, Adil Rasheed, Pierluigi Salvo Rossi</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection is increasingly becoming crucial for maintaining the safety, reliability, and efficiency of industrial systems. Recently, with the advent of digital twins and data-driven decision-making, several statistical and machine-learning methods have been proposed. However, these methods face several challenges, such as dependence on only real sensor datasets, limited labeled data, high false alarm rates, and privacy concerns. To address these problems, we propose a suite of digital twin-integrated federated learning (DTFL) methods that enhance global model performance while preserving data privacy and communication efficiency. Specifically, we present five novel approaches: Digital Twin-Based Meta-Learning (DTML), Federated Parameter Fusion (FPF), Layer-wise Parameter Exchange (LPE), Cyclic Weight Adaptation (CWA), and Digital Twin Knowledge Distillation (DTKD). Each method introduces a unique mechanism to combine synthetic and real-world knowledge, balancing generalization with communication overhead. We conduct an extensive experiment using a publicly available cyber-physical anomaly detection dataset. For a target accuracy of 80%, CWA reaches the target in 33 rounds, FPF in 41 rounds, LPE in 48 rounds, and DTML in 87 rounds, whereas the standard FedAvg baseline and DTKD do not reach the target within 100 rounds. These results highlight substantial communication-efficiency gains (up to 62% fewer rounds than DTML and 31% fewer than LPE) and demonstrate that integrating DT knowledge into FL accelerates convergence to operationally meaningful accuracy thresholds for IIoT anomaly detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qing Sima, Xiaoyang Wang, Wenjie Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Community search aims to identify a refined set of nodes that are most relevant to a given query, supporting tasks ranging from fraud detection to recommendation. Unlike homophilic graphs, many real-world networks are heterophilic, where edges predominantly connect dissimilar nodes. Therefore, structural signals that once reflected smooth, low-frequency similarity now appear as sharp, high-frequency contrasts. However, both classical algorithms (e.g., k-core, k-truss) and recent ML-based models struggle to achieve effective community search on heterophilic graphs, where edge signs or semantics are generally unknown. Algorithm-based methods often return communities with mixed class labels, while GNNs, built on homophily, smooth away meaningful signals and blur community boundaries. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Community Search (AdaptCS), a unified framework featuring three key designs: (i) an AdaptCS Encoder that disentangles multi-hop and multi-frequency signals, enabling the model to capture both smooth (homophilic) and contrastive (heterophilic) relations; (ii) a memory-efficient low-rank optimization that removes the main computational bottleneck and ensures model scalability; and (iii) an Adaptive Community Score (ACS) that guides online search by balancing embedding similarity and topological relations. Extensive experiments on both heterophilic and homophilic benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptCS outperforms the best-performing baseline by an average of 11% in F1-score, retains robustness across heterophily levels, and achieves up to 2 orders of magnitude speedup.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenneth Kwok, Basura Fernando, Qianli Xu, Vigneshwaran Subbaraju, Dongkyu Choi, Boon Kiat Quek</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the topic of robustness under sensing noise, ambiguous instructions, and human-robot interaction. We take a radically different tack to the issue of reliable embodied AI: instead of focusing on formal verification methods aimed at achieving model predictability and robustness, we emphasise the dynamic, ambiguous and subjective nature of human-robot interactions that requires embodied AI systems to perceive, interpret, and respond to human intentions in a manner that is consistent, comprehensible and aligned with human expectations. We argue that when embodied agents operate in human environments that are inherently social, multimodal, and fluid, reliability is contextually determined and only has meaning in relation to the goals and expectations of humans involved in the interaction. This calls for a fundamentally different approach to achieving reliable embodied AI that is centred on building and updating an accessible "explicit world model" representing the common ground between human and AI, that is used to align robot behaviours with human expectations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-time recommender systems execute multi-stage cascades (retrieval, pre-processing, fine-grained ranking) under strict tail-latency SLOs, leaving only tens of milliseconds for ranking. Generative recommendation (GR) models can improve quality by consuming long user-behavior sequences, but in production their online sequence length is tightly capped by the ranking-stage P99 budget. We observe that the majority of GR tokens encode user behaviors that are independent of the item candidates, suggesting an opportunity to pre-infer a user-behavior prefix once and reuse it during ranking rather than recomputing it on the critical path. Realizing this idea at industrial scale is non-trivial: the prefix cache must survive across multiple pipeline stages before the final ranking instance is determined, the user population implies cache footprints far beyond a single device, and indiscriminate pre-inference would overload shared resources under high QPS. We present RelayGR, a production system that enables in-HBM relay-race inference for GR. RelayGR selectively pre-infers long-term user prefixes, keeps their KV caches resident in HBM over the request lifecycle, and ensures the subsequent ranking can consume them without remote fetches. RelayGR combines three techniques: 1) a sequence-aware trigger that admits only at-risk requests under a bounded cache footprint and pre-inference load, 2) an affinity-aware router that co-locates cache production and consumption by routing both the auxiliary pre-infer signal and the ranking request to the same instance, and 3) a memory-aware expander that uses server-local DRAM to capture short-term cross-request reuse while avoiding redundant reloads. We implement RelayGR on Huawei Ascend NPUs and evaluate it with real queries. Under a fixed P99 SLO, RelayGR supports up to 1.5$\times$ longer sequences and improves SLO-compliant throughput by up to 3.6$\times$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Han, Hao-Chen Pei, Zhao-Zheng Nie, Xin Luo, Xin-Shun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic pronunciation assessment plays a crucial role in computer-assisted pronunciation training systems. Due to the ability to perform multiple pronunciation tasks simultaneously, multi-aspect multi-granularity pronunciation assessment methods are gradually receiving more attention and achieving better performance than single-level modeling tasks. However, existing methods only consider unidirectional dependencies between adjacent granularity levels, lacking bidirectional interaction among phoneme, word, and utterance levels and thus insufficiently capturing the acoustic structural correlations. To address this issue, we propose a novel residual hierarchical interactive method, HIA for short, that enables bidirectional modeling across granularities. As the core of HIA, the Interactive Attention Module leverages an attention mechanism to achieve dynamic bidirectional interaction, effectively capturing linguistic features at each granularity while integrating correlations between different granularity levels. We also propose a residual hierarchical structure to alleviate the feature forgetting problem when modeling acoustic hierarchies. In addition, we use 1-D convolutional layers to enhance the extraction of local contextual cues at each granularity. Extensive experiments on the speechocean762 dataset show that our model is comprehensively ahead of the existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiwei Guan, Haibo Jin, Haohan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown groundbreaking capabilities across diverse multimodal tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks, where adversaries craft subtle perturbations to bypass safety mechanisms and trigger harmful outputs. Existing white-box attacks methods require full model accessibility, suffer from computing costs and exhibit insufficient adversarial transferability, making them impractical for real-world, black-box settings. To address these limitations, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack on LVLMs via Zeroth-Order optimization using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ZO-SPSA). ZO-SPSA provides three key advantages: (i) gradient-free approximation by input-output interactions without requiring model knowledge, (ii) model-agnostic optimization without the surrogate model and (iii) lower resource requirements with reduced GPU memory consumption. We evaluate ZO-SPSA on three LVLMs, including InstructBLIP, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, achieving the highest jailbreak success rate of 83.0% on InstructBLIP, while maintaining imperceptible perturbations comparable to white-box methods. Moreover, adversarial examples generated from MiniGPT-4 exhibit strong transferability to other LVLMs, with ASR reaching 64.18%. These findings underscore the real-world feasibility of black-box jailbreaks and expose critical weaknesses in the safety mechanisms of current LVLMs</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samaneh Mohtadi, Gianluca Demartini</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used as relevance assessors for Information Retrieval (IR) evaluation collection creation due to reduced cost and increased scalability as compared to human assessors. While previous research has looked at the reliability of LLMs as compared to human assessors, in this work, we aim to understand if LLMs make systematic mistakes when judging relevance, rather than just understanding how good they are on average. To this aim, we propose a novel representational method for queries and documents that allows us to analyze relevance label distributions and compare LLM and human labels to identify patterns of disagreement and localize systematic areas of disagreement. We introduce a clustering-based framework that embeds query-document (Q-D) pairs into a joint semantic space, treating relevance as a relational property. Experiments on TREC Deep Learning 2019 and 2020 show that systematic disagreement between humans and LLMs is concentrated in specific semantic clusters rather than distributed randomly. Query-level analyses reveal recurring failures, most often in definition-seeking, policy-related, or ambiguous contexts. Queries with large variation in agreement across their clusters emerge as disagreement hotspots, where LLMs tend to under-recall relevant content or over-include irrelevant material. This framework links global diagnostics with localized clustering to uncover hidden weaknesses in LLM judgments, enabling bias-aware and more reliable IR evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunsoo Kim, Jaewan Moon, Seongmin Park, Jongwuk Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern recommender systems trained on domain-specific data often struggle to generalize across multiple domains. Cross-domain sequential recommendation has emerged as a promising research direction to address this challenge; however, existing approaches face fundamental limitations, such as reliance on overlapping users or items across domains, or unrealistic assumptions that ignore privacy constraints. In this work, we propose a new framework, MergeRec, based on model merging under a new and realistic problem setting termed data-isolated cross-domain sequential recommendation, where raw user interaction data cannot be shared across domains. MergeRec consists of three key components: (1) merging initialization, (2) pseudo-user data construction, and (3) collaborative merging optimization. First, we initialize a merged model using training-free merging techniques. Next, we construct pseudo-user data by treating each item as a virtual sequence in each domain, enabling the synthesis of meaningful training samples without relying on real user interactions. Finally, we optimize domain-specific merging weights through a joint objective that combines a recommendation loss, which encourages the merged model to identify relevant items, and a distillation loss, which transfers collaborative filtering signals from the fine-tuned source models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MergeRec not only preserves the strengths of the original models but also significantly enhances generalizability to unseen domains. Compared to conventional model merging methods, MergeRec consistently achieves superior performance, with average improvements of up to 17.21% in Recall@10, highlighting the potential of model merging as a scalable and effective approach for building universal recommender systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arsham Khosravani, Alireza Hosseinpour, Arshia Akhavan, Mehdi Keshani, Abbas Heydarnoori</p>
<p>Abstract: Issue assignment is a critical process in software maintenance, where new issue reports are validated and assigned to suitable developers. However, manual issue assignment is often inconsistent and error-prone, especially in large open-source projects where thousands of new issues are reported monthly. Existing automated approaches have shown promise, but many rely heavily on large volumes of project-specific training data or relational information that is often sparse and noisy, which limits their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose LIA (LLM-based Issue Assignment), which employs supervised fine-tuning to adapt an LLM, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B in this work, for automatic issue assignment. By leveraging the LLM's pretrained semantic understanding of natural language and software-related text, LIA learns to generate ranked developer recommendations directly from issue titles and descriptions. The ranking is based on the model's learned understanding of historical issue-to-developer assignments, using patterns from past tasks to infer which developers are most likely to handle new issues. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that LIA delivers substantial improvements over both its base pretrained model and state-of-the-art baselines. It achieves up to +187.8% higher Hit@1 compared to the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B pretrained base model, and outperforms four leading issue assignment methods by as much as +211.2% in Hit@1 score. These results highlight the effectiveness of domain-adapted LLMs for software maintenance tasks and establish LIA as a practical, high-performing solution for issue assignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lakshay Sharma, Alex Marin</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have become a dominant paradigm for creating general purpose models whose capabilities can be transferred to downstream supervised learning tasks. However, most such methods rely on vast amounts of pretraining data. This work introduces Subimage Overlap Prediction, a novel self-supervised pretraining task to aid semantic segmentation in remote sensing imagery that uses significantly lesser pretraining imagery. Given an image, a sub-image is extracted and the model is trained to produce a semantic mask of the location of the extracted sub-image within the original image. We demonstrate that pretraining with this task results in significantly faster convergence, and equal or better performance (measured via mIoU) on downstream segmentation. This gap in convergence and performance widens when labeled training data is reduced. We show this across multiple architecture types, and with multiple downstream datasets. We also show that our method matches or exceeds performance while requiring significantly lesser pretraining data relative to other SSL methods.

By consolidating multimodal understanding and generation into a single model rather than separate modality-specific pipelines, HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni serves as an 8B-scale omni-pathfinding point toward practical any-to-any omni assistants. At a high level, the model unifies modalities through a shared next-token prediction interface over an interleaved multimodal sequence, while vision and audio encoders inject continuous embeddings for fine-grained understanding and grounding. Empirical evaluations demonstrate competitive performance against comparably sized models across diverse input-output combinations spanning text, audio, and vision, in both Korean and English. We anticipate that the open-weight release of HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni will support a wide range of research and deployment scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Face verification systems have seen substantial advancements; however, they often lack transparency in their decision-making processes. In this paper, we introduce an innovative Vision-Language Model (VLM) for Face Verification, which not only accurately determines if two face images depict the same individual but also explicitly explains the rationale behind its decisions. Our model is uniquely trained using two complementary explanation styles: (1) concise explanations that summarize the key factors influencing its decision, and (2) comprehensive explanations detailing the specific differences observed between the images. We adapt and enhance a state-of-the-art modeling approach originally designed for audio-based differentiation to suit visual inputs effectively. This cross-modal transfer significantly improves our model's accuracy and interpretability. The proposed VLM integrates sophisticated feature extraction techniques with advanced reasoning capabilities, enabling clear articulation of its verification process. Our approach demonstrates superior performance, surpassing baseline methods and existing models. These findings highlight the immense potential of vision language models in face verification set up, contributing to more transparent, reliable, and explainable face verification systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Wei, Junchao Fan, Zhao Yang, Jianhua Wang, Jingkai Mao, Xiaolin Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown considerable potential in autonomous driving (AD), yet its vulnerability to perturbations remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment. As a primary countermeasure, adversarial training improves policy robustness by training the AD agent in the presence of an adversary that deliberately introduces perturbations. Existing approaches typically model the interaction as a zero-sum game with continuous attacks. However, such designs overlook the inherent asymmetry between the agent and the adversary and then fail to reflect the sparsity of safety-critical risks, rendering the achieved robustness inadequate for practical AD scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce criticality-aware robust RL (CARRL), a novel adversarial training approach for handling sparse, safety-critical risks in autonomous driving. CARRL consists of two interacting components: a risk exposure adversary (REA) and a risk-targeted robust agent (RTRA). We model the interaction between the REA and RTRA as a general-sum game, allowing the REA to focus on exposing safety-critical failures (e.g., collisions) while the RTRA learns to balance safety with driving efficiency. The REA employs a decoupled optimization mechanism to better identify and exploit sparse safety-critical moments under a constrained budget. However, such focused attacks inevitably result in a scarcity of adversarial data. The RTRA copes with this scarcity by jointly leveraging benign and adversarial experiences via a dual replay buffer and enforces policy consistency under perturbations to stabilize behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach reduces the collision rate by at least 22.66\% across all cases compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dennis Jabs, Aditya Mohan, Marius Lindauer</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often learn policies that achieve the same episodic return yet behave very differently, due to a combination of environmental (random transitions, initial conditions, reward noise) and algorithmic (minibatch selection, exploration noise) factors. In continuous control tasks, even small parameter shifts can produce unstable gaits, complicating both algorithm comparison and real-world transfer. Previous work has shown that such instability arises when policy updates traverse noisy neighborhoods and that the spread of post-update return distribution $R(\theta)$, obtained by repeatedly sampling minibatches, updating $\theta$, and measuring final returns, is a useful indicator of this noise. Although explicitly constraining the policy to maintain a narrow $R(\theta)$ can improve stability, directly estimating $R(\theta)$ is computationally expensive in high-dimensional settings. We propose an alternative that takes advantage of environmental stochasticity to mitigate update-induced variability. Specifically, we model state-action return distribution through a distributional critic and then bias the advantage function of PPO using higher-order moments (skewness and kurtosis) of this distribution. By penalizing extreme tail behaviors, our method discourages policies from entering parameter regimes prone to instability. We hypothesize that in environments where post-update critic values align poorly with post-update returns, standard PPO struggles to produce a narrow $R(\theta)$. In such cases, our moment-based correction narrows $R(\theta)$, improving stability by up to 75% in Walker2D, while preserving comparable evaluation returns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Ubaidullah, Muhammad Abid Hussain, Mohsin Raza Jafri, Rozi Khan, Moid Sandhu, Abd Ullah Khan, Hyundong Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) is a contagious viral infection that significantly deteriorates livestock health, thereby posing a serious threat to the global economy and food security. Owing to its rapid spread characteristics, early and precise identification is crucial to prevent outbreaks and ensure timely intervention. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning-based approach called LUMPNet for the early detection of LSD. LUMPNet utilizes image data to detect and classify skin nodules -- the primary indicator of LSD. To this end, LUMPNet uses YOLOv11, EfficientNet-based CNN classifier with compound scaling, and a novel adaptive hybrid optimizer. More precisely, LUMPNet detects and localizes LSD skin nodules and lesions on cattle images. It exploits EfficientNet to classify the localized cattle images into LSD-affected or healthy categories. To stabilize and accelerate the training of YOLOv11 and EfficientNet hybrid model, a novel adaptive hybrid optimizer is proposed and utilized. We evaluate LUMPNet at various stages of LSD using a publicly available dataset. Results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves 99% LSD detection training accuracy, and outperforms existing schemes. The model also achieves validation accuracy of 98%. Moreover, for further evaluation, we conduct a case study using an optimized EfficientNet-B0 model trained with the AdamW optimizer, and compare its performance with LUMPNet. The results show that LUMPNet achieves superior performance.</p>

It is difficult to answer this question through conversation alone, as genuine introspection cannot be distinguished from confabulations. Here, we address this challenge by injecting representations of known concepts into a model's activations, and measuring the influence of these manipulations on the model's self-reported states. We find that models can, in certain scenarios, notice the presence of injected concepts and accurately identify them. Models demonstrate some ability to recall prior internal representations and distinguish them from raw text inputs. Strikingly, we find that some models can use their ability to recall prior intentions in order to distinguish their own outputs from artificial prefills. In all these experiments, Claude Opus 4 and 4.1, the most capable models we tested, generally demonstrate the greatest introspective awareness; however, trends across models are complex and sensitive to post-training strategies. Finally, we explore whether models can explicitly control their internal representations, finding that models can modulate their activations when instructed or incentivized to "think about" a concept. Overall, our results indicate that current language models possess some functional introspective awareness of their own internal states. We stress that in today's models, this capacity is highly unreliable and context-dependent; however, it may continue to develop with further improvements to model capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniket Wattamwar, Sampson Akwafuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Global health surveillance is currently facing a challenge of Knowledge Gaps. While general-purpose AI has proliferated, it remains fundamentally unsuited for the high-stakes epidemiological domain due to chronic hallucinations and an inability to navigate specialized data silos. This paper introduces ARIES (Agentic Retrieval Intelligence for Epidemiological Surveillance), a specialized, autonomous multi-agent framework designed to move beyond static, disease-specific dashboards toward a dynamic intelligence ecosystem. Built on a hierarchical command structure, ARIES utilizes GPTs to orchestrate a scalable swarm of sub-agents capable of autonomously querying World Health Organization (WHO), Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and peer-reviewed research papers. By automating the extraction and logical synthesis of surveillance data, ARIES provides a specialized reasoning that identifies emergent threats and signal divergence in near real-time. This modular architecture proves that a task-specific agentic swarm can outperform generic models, offering a robust, extensible for next-generation outbreak response and global health intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> SB Danush Vikraman, Hannah Abagail, Prasanna Kesavraj, Gajanan V Honnavar</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Yukthi Opus (YO), a multi-chain hybrid metaheuristic designed for NP-hard optimization under explicit evaluation budget constraints. YO integrates three complementary mechanisms in a structured two-phase architecture: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for global exploration, greedy local search for exploitation, and simulated annealing with adaptive reheating to enable controlled escape from local minima. A dedicated burn-in phase allocates evaluations to probabilistic exploration, after which a hybrid optimization loop refines promising candidates. YO further incorporates a spatial blacklist mechanism to avoid repeated evaluation of poor regions and a multi-chain execution strategy to improve robustness and reduce sensitivity to initialization.
  We evaluate YO on three benchmarks: the Rastrigin function (5D) with ablation studies, the Traveling Salesman Problem with 50 to 200 cities, and the Rosenbrock function (5D) with comparisons against established optimizers including CMA-ES, Bayesian optimization, and accelerated particle swarm optimization. Results show that MCMC exploration and greedy refinement are critical for solution quality, while simulated annealing and multi-chain execution primarily improve stability and variance reduction. Overall, YO achieves competitive performance on large and multimodal problems while maintaining predictable evaluation budgets, making it suitable for expensive black-box optimization settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rashid Iqbal (Artificial Intelligence Lab, Department of Computer Systems Engineering, University of Engineering,Applied Sciences), Saddam Hussain Khan (Artificial Intelligence Lab, Department of Computer Systems Engineering, University of Engineering,Applied Sciences)</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, a deep learning approach for Mpox diagnosis named Customized Residual SwinTransformerV2 (RSwinV2) has been proposed, trying to enhance the capability of lesion classification by employing the RSwinV2 tool-assisted vision approach. In the RSwinV2 method, a hierarchical structure of the transformer has been customized based on the input dimensionality, embedding structure, and output targeted by the method. In this RSwinV2 approach, the input image has been split into non-overlapping patches and processed using shifted windows and attention in these patches. This process has helped the method link all the windows efficiently by avoiding the locality issues of non-overlapping regions in attention, while being computationally efficient. RSwinV2 has further developed based on SwinTransformer and has included patch and position embeddings to take advantage of the transformer global-linking capability by employing multi-head attention in these embeddings. Furthermore, RSwinV2 has developed and incorporated the Inverse Residual Block (IRB) into this method, which utilizes convolutional skip connections with these inclusive designs to address the vanishing gradient issues during processing. RSwinV2 inclusion of IRB has therefore facilitated this method to link global patterns as well as local patterns; hence, its integrity has helped improve lesion classification capability by minimizing variability of Mpox and increasing differences of Mpox, chickenpox, measles, and cowpox. In testing SwinV2, its accuracy of 96.21 and an F1score of 95.62 have been achieved on the Kaggle public dataset, which has outperformed standard CNN models and SwinTransformers; RSwinV2 vector has thus proved its valiance as a computer-assisted tool for Mpox lesion observation interpretation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Prause</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the growing popularity of AI coding assistants, over 80% of machine learning (ML) projects fail to deliver real business value. This study creates and tests a Machine Learning Canvas, a practical framework that combines business strategy, software engineering, and data science in order to determine the factors that lead to the success of ML projects. We surveyed 150 data scientists and analyzed their responses using statistical modeling. We identified four key success factors: Strategy (clear goals and planning), Process (how work gets done), Ecosystem (tools and infrastructure), and Support (organizational backing and resources). Our results show that these factors are interconnected - each one affects the next. For instance, strong organizational support results in a clearer strategy (\beta = 0.432, p < 0.001), which improves work processes (\beta = 0.428, p < 0.001) and builds better infrastructure (\beta = 0.547, p < 0.001). Together, these elements determine whether a project succeeds. The surprising finding? Although AI assistants make coding faster, they don't guarantee project success. AI assists with the "how" of coding but cannot replace the "why" and "what" of strategic thinking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxue Gao, Zexin Li, Yiming Chen, Nancy F. Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of large-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) models such as Whisper has greatly expanded their adoption across diverse real-world applications. Ensuring robustness against even minor input perturbations is therefore critical for maintaining reliable performance in real-time environments. While prior work has mainly examined accuracy degradation under adversarial attacks, robustness with respect to efficiency remains largely unexplored. This narrow focus provides only a partial understanding of ASR model vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive study of ASR robustness under multiple attack scenarios. We introduce MORE, a multi-objective repetitive doubling encouragement attack, which jointly degrades recognition accuracy and inference efficiency through a hierarchical staged repulsion-anchoring mechanism. Specifically, we reformulate multi-objective adversarial optimization into a hierarchical framework that sequentially achieves the dual objectives. To further amplify effectiveness, we propose a novel repetitive encouragement doubling objective (REDO) that induces duplicative text generation by maintaining accuracy degradation and periodically doubling the predicted sequence length. Overall, MORE compels ASR models to produce incorrect transcriptions at a substantially higher computational cost, triggered by a single adversarial input. Experiments show that MORE consistently yields significantly longer transcriptions while maintaining high word error rates compared to existing baselines, underscoring its effectiveness in multi-objective adversarial attack.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhang Chen, Yunqiu Xu, Junjie Xie, Aojun Lu, Tao Feng, Zeying Huang, Ning Zhang, Yi Sun, Yi Yang, Hangjie Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant progress, multimodal large language models continue to struggle with visual mathematical problem solving. Some recent works recognize that visual perception is a bottleneck in visual mathematical reasoning, but their solutions are limited to improving the extraction and interpretation of visual inputs. Notably, they all ignore the key issue of whether the extracted visual cues are faithfully integrated and properly utilized in subsequent reasoning. Motivated by this, we present CogFlow, a novel cognitive-inspired three-stage framework that incorporates a knowledge internalization stage, explicitly simulating the hierarchical flow of human reasoning: perception$\Rightarrow$internalization$\Rightarrow$reasoning. Inline with this hierarchical flow, we holistically enhance all its stages. We devise Synergistic Visual Rewards to boost perception capabilities in parametric and semantic spaces, jointly improving visual information extraction from symbols and diagrams. To guarantee faithful integration of extracted visual cues into subsequent reasoning, we introduce a Knowledge Internalization Reward model in the internalization stage, bridging perception and reasoning. Moreover, we design a Visual-Gated Policy Optimization algorithm to further enforce the reasoning is grounded with the visual knowledge, preventing models seeking shortcuts that appear coherent but are visually ungrounded reasoning chains. Moreover, we contribute a new dataset MathCog for model training, which contains samples with over 120K high-quality perception-reasoning aligned annotations. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on commonly used visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks validate the superiority of the proposed CogFlow.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) can substantially compromise their safety. Previous approaches require many safety samples or calibration sets, which not only incur significant computational overhead during realignment but also lead to noticeable degradation in model utility. Contrary to this belief, we show that safety alignment can be fully recovered with only a single safety example, without sacrificing utility and at minimal cost. Remarkably, this recovery is effective regardless of the number of harmful examples used in fine-tuning or the size of the underlying model, and convergence is achieved within just a few epochs. Furthermore, we uncover the low-rank structure of the safety gradient, which explains why such efficient correction is possible. We validate our findings across five safety-aligned LLMs and multiple datasets, demonstrating the generality of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyu Liu, Jiaen Lin, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted approach to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge and reducing hallucinations. However, noisy or irrelevant documents are often introduced during RAG, potentially degrading performance and even causing hallucinated outputs. While various methods have been proposed to filter out such noise, we argue that identifying irrelevant information from retrieved content is inherently difficult and limited number of transformer layers can hardly solve this. Consequently, retrievers fail to filter out irrelevant documents entirely. Therefore, LLMs must be robust against such noise, but we demonstrate that standard fine-tuning approaches are often ineffective in enabling the model to selectively utilize relevant information while ignoring irrelevant content due to the structural constraints of attention patterns. To address this, we propose a novel fine-tuning method designed to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information within retrieved documents. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our approach significantly improves the robustness and performance of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Li, Harshith Reddy Kethireddy, Srijita Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from Preferences in Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) has gained attention recently, as it serves as a natural fit for complicated tasks where the reward function is not easily available. However, preferences often come with uncertainty and noise if they are not from perfect teachers. Much prior literature aimed to detect noise, but with limited types of noise and most being uniformly distributed with no connection to observations. In this work, we formalize the notion of targeted feature-dependent noise and propose several variants like trajectory feature noise, trajectory similarity noise, uncertainty-aware noise, and Language Model noise.
  We evaluate feature-dependent noise, where noise is correlated with certain features in complex continuous control tasks from DMControl and Meta-world. Our experiments show that in some feature-dependent noise settings, the state-of-the-art noise-robust PbRL method's learning performance is significantly deteriorated, while PbRL method with no explicit denoising can surprisingly outperform noise-robust PbRL in majority settings.
  We also find language model's noise exhibits similar characteristics to feature-dependent noise, thereby simulating realistic humans and call for further study in learning with feature-dependent noise robustly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingjing Wang, Qianglin Liu, Zhuo Xiao, Xinning Yao, Bo Liu, Lu Li, Lijuan Niu, Fugen Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and its incidence is rising globally. While ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for detecting thyroid nodules, its diagnostic accuracy is often limited by challenges such as low image contrast and blurred nodule boundaries. To address these issues, we propose Nodule-DETR, a novel detection transformer (DETR) architecture designed for robust thyroid nodule detection in ultrasound images. Nodule-DETR introduces three key innovations: a Multi-Spectral Frequency-domain Channel Attention (MSFCA) module that leverages frequency analysis to enhance features of low-contrast nodules; a Hierarchical Feature Fusion (HFF) module for efficient multi-scale integration; and Multi-Scale Deformable Attention (MSDA) to flexibly capture small and irregularly shaped nodules. We conducted extensive experiments on a clinical dataset of real-world thyroid ultrasound images. The results demonstrate that Nodule-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by a significant margin of 0.149 in mAP@0.5:0.95. The superior accuracy of Nodule-DETR highlights its significant potential for clinical application as an effective tool in computer-aided thyroid diagnosis.

<p>Abstract: Background. Defect prediction has been a highly active topic among researchers in the Empirical Software Engineering field. Previous literature has successfully achieved the most accurate prediction of an incoming fault and identified the features and anomalies that precede it through just-in-time prediction. As software systems evolve continuously, there is a growing need for time-sensitive methods capable of forecasting defects before they manifest.
  Aim. Our study seeks to explore the effectiveness of time-sensitive techniques for defect forecasting. Moreover, we aim to investigate the early indicators that precede the occurrence of a defect.
  Method. We will train multiple time-sensitive forecasting techniques to forecast the future bug density of a software project, as well as identify the early symptoms preceding the occurrence of a defect.
  Expected results. Our expected results are translated into empirical evidence on the effectiveness of our approach for early estimation of bug proneness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Imbalanced data affects a wide range of machine learning applications, from healthcare to network security. As SMOTE is one of the most popular approaches to addressing this issue, it is imperative to validate it not only empirically but also theoretically. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of SMOTE's convergence properties. Concretely, we prove that the synthetic random variable Z converges in probability to the underlying random variable X. We further prove a stronger convergence in mean when X is compact. Finally, we show that lower values of the nearest neighbor rank lead to faster convergence offering actionable guidance to practitioners. The theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments using both real-life and synthetic data. Our work provides a foundational understanding that enhances data augmentation techniques beyond imbalanced data scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongfang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search often suffers from performance degradation in high-dimensional spaces due to the ``Euclidean-Geodesic mismatch,'' where greedy routing diverges from the underlying data manifold. To address this, we propose Manifold-Consistent Graph Indexing (MCGI), a geometry-aware and disk-resident indexing method that leverages Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) to dynamically adapt search strategies to the data's intrinsic geometry. Unlike standard algorithms that treat dimensions uniformly, MCGI modulates its beam search budget based on in situ geometric analysis, eliminating dependency on static hyperparameters. Theoretical analysis confirms that MCGI enables improved approximation guarantees by preserving manifold-consistent topological connectivity. Empirically, MCGI achieves 5.8$\times$ higher throughput at 95\% recall on high-dimensional GIST1M compared to state-of-the-art DiskANN. On the billion-scale SIFT1B dataset, MCGI further validates its scalability by reducing high-recall query latency by 3$\times$, while maintaining performance parity on standard lower-dimensional datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models have yielded impressive results in mathematics and coding. However, most approaches rely on static datasets, which have been suggested to encourage memorisation and limit generalisation. We introduce D\'ej\`aQ, a framework that departs from this paradigm by jointly evolving a diverse set of synthetic mathematical problems alongside model training. This evolutionary process adapts to the model's ability throughout training, optimising problems for learnability. We propose two LLM-driven mutation strategies in which the model itself mutates the training data, either by altering contextual details or by directly modifying problem structure. We find that the model can generate novel and meaningful problems, and that these LLM-driven mutations improve RL training. We analyse key aspects of D\'ej\`aQ, including the validity of generated problems and computational overhead. Our results underscore the potential of dynamically evolving training data to enhance mathematical reasoning and indicate broader applicability, which we will support by open-sourcing our code.</p>

This allows us to detect moving solitons, and to provide an interactive visualization of Lenia's parameter space structure on our website https://lenia-explorer.vercel.app/. The results shed new light on the above-mentioned questions and lead to several observations: the existence of new soliton families for parameters where they were not believed to exist, or the universality of the phase space structure across various kernels.</p>

What began as a revolutionary idea has now become the cornerstone of computer science. Amidst OSS projects, AI is increasing its presence and relevance. However, despite the growing popularity of AI, its adoption and impacts on OSS projects remain underexplored.
  We aim to assess the adoption of AI libraries in Python and Java OSS projects and examine how they shape development, including the technical ecosystem and community engagement. To this end, we will perform a large-scale analysis on 157.7k potential OSS repositories, employing repository metrics and software metrics to compare projects adopting AI libraries against those that do not. We expect to identify measurable differences in development activity, community engagement, and code complexity between OSS projects that adopt AI libraries and those that do not, offering evidence-based insights into how AI integration reshapes software development practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Yin, Qi Li, Runpeng Yu, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning increasingly relies on LLM-based prompt refinement, where prompts in the training corpus are selectively rewritten by an external refiner to improve clarity and instruction alignment. This motivates an instance-level audit problem: for a fine-tuned model and a training prompt-response pair, can we infer whether the model was trained on the original prompt or its LLM-refined version within a mixed corpus? This matters for dataset governance and dispute resolution when training data are contested. However, it is non-trivial in practice: refined and raw instances are interleaved in the training corpus with unknown, source-dependent mixture ratios, making it harder to develop provenance methods that generalize across models and training setups. In this paper, we formalize this audit task as Refinement Provenance Inference (RPI) and show that prompt refinement yields stable, detectable shifts in teacher-forced token distributions, even when semantic differences are not obvious. Building on this phenomenon, we propose RePro, a logit-based provenance framework that fuses teacher-forced likelihood features with logit-ranking signals. During training, RePro learns a transferable representation via shadow fine-tuning, and uses a lightweight linear head to infer provenance on unseen victims without training-data access. Empirically, RePro consistently attains strong performance and transfers well across refiners, suggesting that it exploits refiner-agnostic distribution shifts rather than rewrite-style artifacts.</p>

<p>Abstract: ChatGPT has emerged as a versatile tool, demonstrating capabilities across diverse domains. Given these successes, the Recommender Systems (RSs) community has begun investigating its applications within recommendation scenarios primarily focusing on accuracy. While the integration of ChatGPT into RSs has garnered significant attention, a comprehensive analysis of its performance across various dimensions remains largely unexplored. Specifically, the capabilities of providing diverse and novel recommendations or exploring potential biases such as popularity bias have not been thoroughly examined. As the use of these models continues to expand, understanding these aspects is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and achieving long-term personalization.
  This study investigates the recommendations provided by ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 by assessing ChatGPT's capabilities in terms of diversity, novelty, and popularity bias. We evaluate these models on three distinct datasets and assess their performance in Top-N recommendation and cold-start scenarios. The findings reveal that ChatGPT-4 matches or surpasses traditional recommenders, demonstrating the ability to balance novelty and diversity in recommendations. Furthermore, in the cold-start scenario, ChatGPT models exhibit superior performance in both accuracy and novelty, suggesting they can be particularly beneficial for new users. This research highlights the strengths and limitations of ChatGPT's recommendations, offering new perspectives on the capacity of these models to provide recommendations beyond accuracy-focused metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Colacicco, Vito Guida, Dario Di Palma, Fedelucio Narducci, Tommaso Di Noia</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in recommendation scenarios due to their strong natural language understanding and generation capabilities. However, they are trained on vast corpora whose contents are not publicly disclosed, raising concerns about data leakage. Recent work has shown that the MovieLens-1M dataset is memorized by both the LLaMA and OpenAI model families, but the extraction of such memorized data has so far relied exclusively on manual prompt engineering. In this paper, we pose three main questions: Is it possible to enhance manual prompting? Can LLM memorization be detected through methods beyond manual prompting? And can the detection of data leakage be automated? To address these questions, we evaluate three approaches: (i) jailbreak prompt engineering; (ii) unsupervised latent knowledge discovery, probing internal activations via Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) and Cluster-Norm; and (iii) Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE), which frames prompt discovery as a meta-learning process that iteratively refines candidate instructions. Experiments on MovieLens-1M using LLaMA models show that jailbreak prompting does not improve the retrieval of memorized items and remains inconsistent; CCS reliably distinguishes genuine from fabricated movie titles but fails on numerical user and rating data; and APE retrieves item-level information with moderate success yet struggles to recover numerical interactions. These findings suggest that automatically optimizing prompts is the most promising strategy for extracting memorized samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangxuan Guo, Haoyang Chen, Yang Chen, Yanchao Bi, Shan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: A remarkable capability of the human brain is to form more abstract conceptual representations from sensorimotor experiences and flexibly apply them independent of direct sensory inputs. However, the computational mechanism underlying this ability remains poorly understood. Here, we present a dual-module neural network framework, the CATS Net, to bridge this gap. Our model consists of a concept-abstraction module that extracts low-dimensional conceptual representations, and a task-solving module that performs visual judgement tasks under the hierarchical gating control of the formed concepts. The system develops transferable semantic structure based on concept representations that enable cross-network knowledge transfer through conceptual communication. Model-brain fitting analyses reveal that these emergent concept spaces align with both neurocognitive semantic model and brain response structures in the human ventral occipitotemporal cortex, while the gating mechanisms mirror that in the semantic control brain network. This work establishes a unified computational framework that can offer mechanistic insights for understanding human conceptual cognition and engineering artificial systems with human-like conceptual intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omar Momen, Emilie Sitter, Berenike Herrmann, Sina Zarrie{\ss}</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel metaphor comprehension involves complex semantic processes and linguistic creativity, making it an interesting task for studying language models (LMs). This study investigates whether surprisal, a probabilistic measure of predictability in LMs, correlates with different metaphor novelty datasets. We analyse surprisal from 16 LM variants on corpus-based and synthetic metaphor novelty datasets. We explore a cloze-style surprisal method that conditions on full-sentence context. Results show that LMs yield significant moderate correlations with scores/labels of metaphor novelty. We further identify divergent scaling patterns: on corpus-based data, correlation strength decreases with model size (inverse scaling effect), whereas on synthetic data it increases (Quality-Power Hypothesis). We conclude that while surprisal can partially account for annotations of metaphor novelty, it remains a limited metric of linguistic creativity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthias Bartolo, Dylan Seychell, Gabriel Hili, Matthew Montebello, Carl James Debono, Saviour Formosa, Konstantinos Makantasis</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of the Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) paradigm in object detection to exploit fine-grained, descriptive information available during training but not at inference. We introduce a general, model-agnostic methodology for injecting privileged information-such as bounding box masks, saliency maps, and depth cues-into deep learning-based object detectors through a teacher-student architecture. Experiments are conducted across five state-of-the-art object detection models and multiple public benchmarks, including UAV-based litter detection datasets and Pascal VOC 2012, to assess the impact on accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LUPI-trained students consistently outperform their baseline counterparts, achieving significant boosts in detection accuracy with no increase in inference complexity or model size. Performance improvements are especially marked for medium and large objects, while ablation studies reveal that intermediate weighting of teacher guidance optimally balances learning from privileged and standard inputs. The findings affirm that the LUPI framework provides an effective and practical strategy for advancing object detection systems in both resource-constrained and real-world settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirali Ebrahimzadeh, Seyyed M. Salili</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support very long input contexts. Yet it remains unclear how reliably they extract and infer information at scale. Performance varies with context length and strongly interacts with how information is distributed in real-world corpora. Motivated by these observations, we study how fact placement, corpus-level fact distributions, and Don't Make It Up prompts influence model behavior. We introduce an extended needle-in-a-haystack benchmark across four production-scale models: Gemini-2.5-flash, ChatGPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5-haiku, and Deepseek-v3.2-chat. Unlike prior work, we separately evaluate literal extraction, logical inference, and hallucination risk. Our study considers both positional effects and realistic distributions of evidence across long contexts, as well as prompts that explicitly discourage fabrication. We find that longer contexts alone do not guarantee better performance and can be detrimental when relevant evidence is diluted or widely dispersed. Performance varies substantially across models: some show severe degradation under realistic conditions, while others remain more robust at longer context lengths. Anti-hallucination (AH) instructions can make some models overly conservative, sharply reducing accuracy in literal extraction and logical inference. While we do not directly compare retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and cache-augmented generation (CAG), our results suggest many failures stem from ineffective context utilization. Models often struggle to identify and prioritize relevant information even when it is present. These findings have direct practical implications, as enterprise workflows increasingly involve pasting large volumes of unfiltered documents into LLM prompts. Effective context length and model-specific robustness to long contexts are therefore critical for reliable LLM deployment in research and business.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Stollenwerk, Anna Lokrantz, Niclas Hertzberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretraining of large language models is not only expensive but also prone to certain training instabilities. A specific instability that often occurs for large learning rates at the end of training is output logit divergence. The most widely used mitigation strategy, z-loss, merely addresses the symptoms rather than the underlying cause of the problem. In this paper, we analyze the instability from the perspective of the output embeddings' geometry and identify its cause. Based on this, we propose output embedding centering (OEC) as a new mitigation strategy, and prove that it suppresses output logit divergence. OEC can be implemented in two different ways, as a deterministic operation called {\mu}-centering, or a regularization method called {\mu}-loss. Our experiments show that both variants outperform z-loss in terms of training stability and learning rate sensitivity. In particular, they ensure that training converges even for large learning rates when z-loss fails. Furthermore, we find that {\mu}-loss is significantly less sensitive to regularization hyperparameter tuning than z-loss.</p>

<p>Abstract: This survey has provided a systematic overview of the emerging field of LLM-enabled compilation by addressing several key research questions. We first answered how LLMs are being integrated by proposing a comprehensive, multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes works based on their Design Philosophy (Selector, Translator, Generator), LLM Methodology, their operational Level of Code Abstraction, and the specific Task Type they address. In answering what advancements these approaches offer, we identified three primary benefits: the democratization of compiler development, the discovery of novel optimization strategies, and the broadening of the compiler's traditional scope. Finally, in addressing the field's challenges and opportunities, we highlighted the critical hurdles of ensuring correctness and achieving scalability, while identifying the development of hybrid systems as the most promising path forward. By providing these answers, this survey serves as a foundational roadmap for researchers and practitioners, charting the course for a new generation of LLM-powered, intelligent, adaptive and synergistic compilation tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaocheng Shen, Jianfeng Liang. Chunlei Cai, Cong Geng, Huiyu Duan, Xiaoyun Zhang, Qiang Hu, Guangtao Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models such as SDXL and FLUX have achieved impressive photorealism, yet small-scale distortions remain pervasive in limbs, face, text and so on. Existing refinement approaches either perform costly iterative re-generation or rely on vision-language models (VLMs) with weak spatial grounding, leading to semantic drift and unreliable local edits. To close this gap, we propose Agentic Retoucher, a hierarchical decision-driven framework that reformulates post-generation correction as a human-like perception-reasoning-action loop. Specifically, we design (1) a perception agent that learns contextual saliency for fine-grained distortion localization under text-image consistency cues, (2) a reasoning agent that performs human-aligned inferential diagnosis via progressive preference alignment, and (3) an action agent that adaptively plans localized inpainting guided by user preference. This design integrates perceptual evidence, linguistic reasoning, and controllable correction into a unified, self-corrective decision process. To enable fine-grained supervision and quantitative evaluation, we further construct GenBlemish-27K, a dataset of 6K T2I images with 27K annotated artifact regions across 12 categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Agentic Retoucher consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality, distortion localization and human preference alignment, establishing a new paradigm for self-corrective and perceptually reliable T2I generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nguyet-Anh H. Lang, Eric Lang, Thanh Le-Cong, Bach Le, Quyet-Thang Huynh</p>
<p>Abstract: Functional programming provides strong foundations for developing reliable and secure software systems, yet its adoption remains not widespread due to the steep learning curve. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation present new opportunities to lower these barriers. However, extensive evaluations of LLMs largely focus on imperative programming languages, and their capabilities in functional programming languages (FP) remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce FPEval, a holistic evaluation framework built on FPBench, a new benchmark of 721 programming tasks across three difficulty levels on three mainstream FP languages: Haskell, Ocaml and Scala. FPEval provides compehensive evaluation infrastructures with both test validations with comprehensive test suites and static analysis tools to assess both functional correctness and code style and maintainability. Using this framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, for code generation in functional programming languages and Java as an imperative baseline. Our results demonstrate that LLM performance in functional programming improves substantially with model advancement; however, error rates remain significantly higher in purely functional languages (Haskell and OCaml) than in hybrid (Scala) or imperative (Java) languages. Moreover, LLMs frequently generate non-idiomatic functional code that follows imperative patterns, raising concerns about code style and long-term maintainability. Finally, we show that LLMs can partially self-repair both correctness and quality issues when provided with static analysis feedback and hand-crafted instructions for common types of issues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Asif Hossain, Nabil Subhan, Mantasha Rahman Mahi, Jannatul Ferdous Nabila</p>
<p>Abstract: Access to reliable agricultural advisory remains limited in many developing regions due to a persistent language barrier: authoritative agricultural manuals are predominantly written in English, while farmers primarily communicate in low-resource local languages such as Bengali. Although recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable natural language interaction, direct generation in low-resource languages often exhibits poor fluency and factual inconsistency, while cloud-based solutions remain cost-prohibitive. This paper presents a cost-efficient, cross-lingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for Bengali agricultural advisory that emphasizes factual grounding and practical deployability. The proposed system adopts a translation-centric architecture in which Bengali user queries are translated into English, enriched through domain-specific keyword injection to align colloquial farmer terminology with scientific nomenclature, and answered via dense vector retrieval over a curated corpus of English agricultural manuals (FAO, IRRI). The generated English response is subsequently translated back into Bengali to ensure accessibility. The system is implemented entirely using open-source models and operates on consumer-grade hardware without reliance on paid APIs. Experimental evaluation demonstrates reliable source-grounded responses, robust rejection of out-of-domain queries, and an average end-to-end latency below 20 seconds. The results indicate that cross-lingual retrieval combined with controlled translation offers a practical and scalable solution for agricultural knowledge access in low-resource language settings</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02076">Deferred Commitment Decoding for Diffusion Language Models with Confidence-Aware Sliding Windows</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingte Shu, Yuchuan Tian, Chao Xu, Yunhe Wang, Hanting Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a strong alternative to autoregressive models by enabling parallel text generation. To improve inference efficiency and KV-cache compatibility, prior work commonly adopts block-based diffusion, decoding tokens block by block. However, this paradigm suffers from a structural limitation that we term Boundary-Induced Context Truncation (BICT): undecoded tokens near block boundaries are forced to commit without access to nearby future context, even when such context could substantially reduce uncertainty. This limitation degrades decoding confidence and generation quality, especially for tasks requiring precise reasoning, such as mathematical problem solving and code generation. We propose Deferred Commitment Decoding (DCD), a novel, training-free decoding strategy that mitigates this issue. DCD maintains a confidence-aware sliding window over masked tokens, resolving low-uncertainty tokens early while deferring high-uncertainty tokens until sufficient contextual evidence becomes available. This design enables effective bidirectional information flow within the decoding window without sacrificing efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion language models, benchmarks, and caching configurations show that DCD improves generation accuracy by 1.39% with comparable time on average compared to fixed block-based diffusion methods, with the most significant improvement reaching 9.0%. These results demonstrate that deferring token commitment based on uncertainty is a simple yet effective principle for improving both the quality and efficiency of diffusion language model decoding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Doubly-stochastic matrices (DSM) are increasingly utilized in structure-preserving deep architectures -- such as Optimal Transport layers and Sinkhorn-based attention -- to enforce numerical stability and probabilistic interpretability. In this work, we identify a critical spectral degradation phenomenon inherent to these constraints, termed the Homogeneity Trap. We demonstrate that the maximum-entropy bias, typical of Sinkhorn-based projections, drives the mixing operator towards the uniform barycenter, thereby suppressing the subdominant singular value \sigma_2 and filtering out high-frequency feature components. We derive a spectral bound linking \sigma_2 to the network's effective depth, showing that high-entropy constraints restrict feature transformation to a shallow effective receptive field. Furthermore, we formally demonstrate that Layer Normalization fails to mitigate this collapse in noise-dominated regimes; specifically, when spectral filtering degrades the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) below a critical threshold, geometric structure is irreversibly lost to noise-induced orthogonal collapse. Our findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between entropic stability and spectral expressivity in DSM-constrained networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meili Sun, Chunjiang Zhao, Lichao Yang, Hao Liu, Shimin Hu, Ya Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Strawberry harvesting robots faced persistent challenges such as low integration of visual perception, fruit-gripper misalignment, empty grasping, and strawberry slippage from the gripper due to insufficient gripping force, all of which compromised harvesting stability and efficiency in orchard environments. To overcome these issues, this paper proposed a visual fault diagnosis and self-recovery framework that integrated multi-task perception with corrective control strategies. At the core of this framework was SRR-Net, an end-to-end multi-task perception model that simultaneously performed strawberry detection, segmentation, and ripeness estimation, thereby unifying visual perception with fault diagnosis. Based on this integrated perception, a relative error compensation method based on the simultaneous target-gripper detection was designed to address positional misalignment, correcting deviations when error exceeded the tolerance threshold. To mitigate empty grasping and fruit-slippage faults, an early abort strategy was implemented. A micro-optical camera embedded in the end-effector provided real-time visual feedback, enabling grasp detection during the deflating stage and strawberry slip prediction during snap-off through MobileNet V3-Small classifier and a time-series LSTM classifier. Experiments demonstrated that SRR-Net maintained high perception accuracy. For detection, it achieved a precision of 0.895 and recall of 0.813 on strawberries, and 0.972/0.958 on hands. In segmentation, it yielded a precision of 0.887 and recall of 0.747 for strawberries, and 0.974/0.947 for hands. For ripeness estimation, SRR-Net attained a mean absolute error of 0.035, while simultaneously supporting multi-task perception and sustaining a competitive inference speed of 163.35 FPS.</p>

<p>Abstract: Weight initialization remains decisive for neural network optimization, yet existing methods are largely layer-agnostic. We study initialization for deeply-supervised architectures with auxiliary classifiers, where untrained auxiliary heads can destabilize early training through gradient interference.
  We propose LION-DG, a layer-informed initialization that zero-initializes auxiliary classifier heads while applying standard He-initialization to the backbone. We prove that this implements Gradient Awakening: auxiliary gradients are exactly zero at initialization, then phase in naturally as weights grow -- providing an implicit warmup without hyperparameters.
  Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with DenseNet-DS and ResNet-DS architectures demonstrate: (1) DenseNet-DS: +8.3% faster convergence on CIFAR-10 with comparable accuracy, (2) Hybrid approach: Combining LSUV with LION-DG achieves best accuracy (81.92% on CIFAR-10), (3) ResNet-DS: Positive speedup on CIFAR-100 (+11.3%) with side-tap auxiliary design.
  We identify architecture-specific trade-offs and provide clear guidelines for practitioners. LION-DG is simple, requires zero hyperparameters, and adds no computational overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inferring a network's evolutionary history from a single final snapshot with limited temporal annotations is fundamental yet challenging. Existing approaches predominantly rely on topology alone, which often provides insufficient and noisy cues. This paper leverages network steady-state dynamics -- converged node states under a given dynamical process -- as an additional and widely accessible observation for network evolution history inference. We propose CS$^2$, which explicitly models structure-state coupling to capture how topology modulates steady states and how the two signals jointly improve edge discrimination for formation-order recovery. Experiments on six real temporal networks, evaluated under multiple dynamical processes, show that CS$^2$ consistently outperforms strong baselines, improving pairwise edge precedence accuracy by 4.0% on average and global ordering consistency (Spearman-$\rho$) by 7.7% on average. CS$^2$ also more faithfully recovers macroscopic evolution trajectories such as clustering formation, degree heterogeneity, and hub growth. Moreover, a steady-state-only variant remains competitive when reliable topology is limited, highlighting steady states as an independent signal for evolution inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Equipping robotic faces with singing capabilities is crucial for empathetic Human-Robot Interaction. However, existing robotic face driving research primarily focuses on conversations or mimicking static expressions, struggling to meet the high demands for continuous emotional expression and coherence in singing. To address this, we propose a novel avatar-driven framework for appealing robotic singing. We first leverage portrait video generation models embedded with extensive human priors to synthesize vivid singing avatars, providing reliable expression and emotion guidance. Subsequently, these facial features are transferred to the robot via semantic-oriented mapping functions that span a wide expression space. Furthermore, to quantitatively evaluate the emotional richness of robotic singing, we propose the Emotion Dynamic Range metric to measure the emotional breadth within the Valence-Arousal space, revealing that a broad emotional spectrum is crucial for appealing performances. Comprehensive experiments prove that our method achieves rich emotional expressions while maintaining lip-audio synchronization, significantly outperforming existing approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Semantic change detection in remote sensing aims to identify land cover changes between bi-temporal image pairs. Progress in this area has been limited by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as pixel-level annotation is costly and time-consuming. To address this, recent methods leverage synthetic data or generate artificial change pairs, but out-of-domain generalization remains limited. In this work, we introduce a weak temporal supervision strategy that leverages additional temporal observations of existing single-temporal datasets, without requiring any new annotations. Specifically, we extend single-date remote sensing datasets with new observations acquired at different times and train a change detection model by assuming that real bi-temporal pairs mostly contain no change, while pairing images from different locations to generate change examples. To handle the inherent noise in these weak labels, we employ an object-aware change map generation and an iterative refinement process. We validate our approach on extended versions of the FLAIR and IAILD aerial datasets, achieving strong zero-shot and low-data regime performance across different benchmarks. Lastly, we showcase results over large areas in France, highlighting the scalability potential of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale large language models efficiently by employing a parametric "router" to dispatch tokens to a sparse subset of experts. Typically, this router is trained once and then frozen, rendering routing decisions brittle under distribution shifts. We address this limitation by introducing kNN-MoE, a retrieval-augmented routing framework that reuses optimal expert assignments from a memory of similar past cases. This memory is constructed offline by directly optimizing token-wise routing logits to maximize the likelihood on a reference set. Crucially, we use the aggregate similarity of retrieved neighbors as a confidence-driven mixing coefficient, thus allowing the method to fall back to the frozen router when no relevant cases are found. Experiments show kNN-MoE outperforms zero-shot baselines and rivals computationally expensive supervised fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision language foundation models such as CLIP exhibit impressive zero-shot generalization yet remain vulnerable to spurious correlations across visual and textual modalities. Existing debiasing approaches often address a single modality either visual or textual leading to partial robustness and unstable adaptation under distribution shifts. We propose a bilateral prompt optimization framework (BiPrompt) that simultaneously mitigates non-causal feature reliance in both modalities during test-time adaptation. On the visual side, it employs structured attention-guided erasure to suppress background activations and enforce orthogonal prediction consistency between causal and spurious regions. On the textual side, it introduces balanced prompt normalization, a learnable re-centering mechanism that aligns class embeddings toward an isotropic semantic space. Together, these modules jointly minimize conditional mutual information between spurious cues and predictions, steering the model toward causal, domain invariant reasoning without retraining or domain supervision. Extensive evaluations on real-world and synthetic bias benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both average and worst-group accuracies over prior test-time debiasing methods, establishing a lightweight yet effective path toward trustworthy and causally grounded vision-language adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mateusz Krawczyk, Jaros{\l}aw Paw{\l}owski</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a neural network-based model capable of learning the broad landscape of working regimes in quantum dot simulators, and using this knowledge to autotune these devices - based on transport measurements - toward obtaining Majorana modes in the structure. The model is trained in an unsupervised manner on synthetic data in the form of conductance maps, using a physics-informed loss that incorporates key properties of Majorana zero modes. We show that, with appropriate training, a deep vision-transformer network can efficiently memorize relation between Hamiltonian parameters and structures on conductance maps and use it to propose parameters update for a quantum dot chain that drive the system toward topological phase. Starting from a broad range of initial detunings in parameter space, a single update step is sufficient to generate nontrivial zero modes. Moreover, by enabling an iterative tuning procedure - where the system acquires updated conductance maps at each step - we demonstrate that the method can address a much larger region of the parameter space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muxi Diao, Lele Yang, Wuxuan Gong, Yutong Zhang, Zhonghao Yan, Yufei Han, Kongming Liang, Weiran Xu, Zhanyu Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is the standard paradigm for domain adaptation, yet it frequently incurs the cost of catastrophic forgetting. In sharp contrast, on-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) effectively preserves general capabilities. We investigate this discrepancy and identify a fundamental distributional gap: while RL aligns with the model's internal belief, SFT forces the model to fit external supervision. This mismatch often manifests as "Confident Conflicts" tokens characterized by low probability but low entropy. In these instances, the model is highly confident in its own prediction but is forced to learn a divergent ground truth, triggering destructive gradient updates. To address this, we propose Entropy-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (EAFT). Unlike methods relying solely on prediction probability, EAFT utilizes token-level entropy as a gating mechanism to distinguish between epistemic uncertainty and knowledge conflict. This allows the model to learn from uncertain samples while suppressing gradients on conflicting data. Extensive experiments on Qwen and GLM series (ranging from 4B to 32B parameters) across mathematical, medical, and agentic domains confirm our hypothesis. EAFT consistently matches the downstream performance of standard SFT while significantly mitigating the degradation of general capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Almaz Ermilov</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents FormationEval, an open multiple-choice question benchmark for evaluating language models on petroleum geoscience and subsurface disciplines. The dataset contains 505 questions across seven domains including petrophysics, petroleum geology and reservoir engineering, derived from three authoritative sources using a reasoning model with detailed instructions and a concept-based approach that avoids verbatim copying of copyrighted text. Each question includes source metadata to support traceability and audit. The evaluation covers 72 models from major providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta and open-weight alternatives. The top performers achieve over 97\% accuracy, with Gemini 3 Pro Preview reaching 99.8\%, while tier and domain gaps persist. Among open-weight models, GLM-4.7 leads at 98.6\%, with several DeepSeek, Llama, Qwen and Mistral models also exceeding 93\%. The performance gap between open-weight and closed models is narrower than expected, with several lower-cost open-weight models exceeding 90\% accuracy. Petrophysics emerges as the most challenging domain across all models, while smaller models show wider performance variance. Residual length bias in the dataset (correct answers tend to be longer) is documented along with bias mitigation strategies applied during construction. The benchmark, evaluation code and results are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Markus Borg, Nadim Hagatulah, Adam Tornhill, Emma S\"oderberg</p>
<p>Abstract: We are entering a hybrid era in which human developers and AI coding agents work in the same codebases. While industry practice has long optimized code for human comprehension, it is increasingly important to ensure that LLMs with different capabilities can edit code reliably. In this study, we investigate the concept of ``AI-friendly code'' via LLM-based refactoring on a dataset of 5,000 Python files from competitive programming. We find a meaningful association between CodeHealth, a quality metric calibrated for human comprehension, and semantic preservation after AI refactoring. Our findings confirm that human-friendly code is also more compatible with AI tooling. These results suggest that organizations can use CodeHealth to guide where AI interventions are lower risk and where additional human oversight is warranted. Investing in maintainability not only helps humans; it also prepares for large-scale AI adoption.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present NextFlow, a unified decoder-only autoregressive transformer trained on 6 trillion interleaved text-image discrete tokens. By leveraging a unified vision representation within a unified autoregressive architecture, NextFlow natively activates multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, unlocking abilities of image editing, interleaved content and video generation. Motivated by the distinct nature of modalities - where text is strictly sequential and images are inherently hierarchical - we retain next-token prediction for text but adopt next-scale prediction for visual generation. This departs from traditional raster-scan methods, enabling the generation of 1024x1024 images in just 5 seconds - orders of magnitude faster than comparable AR models. We address the instabilities of multi-scale generation through a robust training recipe. Furthermore, we introduce a prefix-tuning strategy for reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that NextFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance among unified models and rivals specialized diffusion baselines in visual quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dachun Kai, Zeyu Xiao, Huyue Zhu, Jiaxiao Wang, Yueyi Zhang, Xiaoyan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses low-light video super-resolution (LVSR), aiming to restore high-resolution videos from low-light, low-resolution (LR) inputs. Existing LVSR methods often struggle to recover fine details due to limited contrast and insufficient high-frequency information. To overcome these challenges, we present RetinexEVSR, the first event-driven LVSR framework that leverages high-contrast event signals and Retinex-inspired priors to enhance video quality under low-light scenarios. Unlike previous approaches that directly fuse degraded signals, RetinexEVSR introduces a novel bidirectional cross-modal fusion strategy to extract and integrate meaningful cues from noisy event data and degraded RGB frames. Specifically, an illumination-guided event enhancement module is designed to progressively refine event features using illumination maps derived from the Retinex model, thereby suppressing low-light artifacts while preserving high-contrast details. Furthermore, we propose an event-guided reflectance enhancement module that utilizes the enhanced event features to dynamically recover reflectance details via a multi-scale fusion mechanism. Experimental results show that our RetinexEVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. Notably, on the SDSD benchmark, our method can get up to 2.95 dB gain while reducing runtime by 65% compared to prior event-based methods. Code: https://github.com/DachunKai/RetinexEVSR.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruction-based image editing is among the fastest developing areas in generative AI. Over the past year, the field has reached a new level, with dozens of open-source models released alongside highly capable commercial systems. However, only a limited number of open-source approaches currently achieve real-world quality. In addition, diffusion backbones, the dominant choice for these pipelines, are often large and computationally expensive for many deployments and research settings, with widely used variants typically containing 6B to 20B parameters. This paper presents a compact, high-throughput instruction-based image editing pipeline that uses a modern 2B-parameter Qwen3-VL model to guide the editing process and the 1.6B-parameter diffusion model Sana1.5 for image generation. Our design decisions across architecture, data processing, training configuration, and evaluation target low-cost inference and strict source consistency while maintaining high quality across the major edit categories feasible at this scale. Evaluated on the ImgEdit and GEdit benchmarks, the proposed method matches or exceeds the performance of substantially heavier baselines, including models with several times as many parameters and higher inference cost, and is particularly strong on edits that require preserving the input image, such as an attribute adjustment, object removal, background edits, and targeted replacement. The model fits within 24 GB of GPU memory and generates edited images at up to 2K resolution in approximately 4 seconds on an NVIDIA H100 in BF16, without additional inference optimizations or distillation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Annoor Sharara Akhand</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a standard approach for visual recognition due to their capacity to learn hierarchical representations from raw pixels. In practice, practitioners often choose among (i) training a compact custom CNN from scratch, (ii) using a large pre-trained CNN as a fixed feature extractor, and (iii) performing transfer learning via partial or full fine-tuning of a pre-trained backbone. This report presents a controlled comparison of these three paradigms across five real-world image classification datasets spanning road-surface defect recognition, agricultural variety identification, fruit/leaf disease recognition, pedestrian walkway encroachment recognition, and unauthorized vehicle recognition. Models are evaluated using accuracy and macro F1-score, complemented by efficiency metrics including training time per epoch and parameter counts. The results show that transfer learning consistently yields the strongest predictive performance, while the custom CNN provides an attractive efficiency--accuracy trade-off, especially when compute and memory budgets are constrained.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Salim Khazem</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation segmentation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibit strong zero-shot generalization through large-scale pretraining, but adapting them to domain-specific semantic segmentation remains challenging, particularly for thin structures (e.g., retinal vessels) and noisy modalities (e.g., SAR imagery). Full fine-tuning is computationally expensive and risks catastrophic forgetting. We propose \textbf{TopoLoRA-SAM}, a topology-aware and parameter-efficient adaptation framework for binary semantic segmentation. TopoLoRA-SAM injects Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the frozen ViT encoder, augmented with a lightweight spatial convolutional adapter and optional topology-aware supervision via differentiable clDice. We evaluate our approach on five benchmarks spanning retinal vessel segmentation (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE\_DB1), polyp segmentation (Kvasir-SEG), and SAR sea/land segmentation (SL-SSDD), comparing against U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SegFormer, and Mask2Former. TopoLoRA-SAM achieves the best retina-average Dice and the best overall average Dice across datasets, while training only \textbf{5.2\%} of model parameters ($\sim$4.9M). On the challenging CHASE\_DB1 dataset, our method substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness, demonstrating that topology-aware parameter-efficient adaptation can match or exceed fully fine-tuned specialist models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deep Pankajbhai Mehta</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large language models requires distributing computation across many accelerators, yet practitioners select parallelism strategies (data, tensor, pipeline, ZeRO) through trial and error because no unified systematic framework predicts their behavior. We introduce placement semantics: each strategy is specified by how it places four training states (parameters, optimizer, gradients, activations) across devices using five modes (replicated, sharded, sharded-with-gather, materialized, offloaded). From placement alone, without implementation details, we derive memory consumption and communication volume. Our predictions match published results exactly: ZeRO-3 uses 8x less memory than data parallelism at 1.5x communication cost, as reported in the original paper. We prove two conditions (gradient integrity, state consistency) are necessary and sufficient for distributed training to match single-device results, and provide composition rules for combining strategies safely. The framework unifies ZeRO Stages 1-3, Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), tensor parallelism, and pipeline parallelism as instances with different placement choices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Empirical evaluation serves as the primary compass guiding research progress in foundation models. Despite a large body of work focused on training frontier vision-language models (VLMs), approaches to their evaluation remain nascent. To guide their maturation, we propose three desiderata that evaluations should satisfy: (1) faithfulness to the modality and application, (2) discriminability between models of varying quality, and (3) efficiency in compute. Through this lens, we identify critical failure modes that violate faithfulness and discriminability, misrepresenting model capabilities: (i) multiple-choice formats reward guessing, poorly reflect downstream use cases, and saturate early as models improve; (ii) blindly solvable questions, which can be answered without images, constitute up to 70% of some evaluations; and (iii) mislabeled or ambiguous samples compromise up to 42% of examples in certain datasets. Regarding efficiency, the computational burden of evaluating frontier models has become prohibitive: by some accounts, nearly 20% of development compute is devoted to evaluation alone. Rather than discarding existing benchmarks, we curate them via transformation and filtering to maximize fidelity and discriminability. We find that converting multiple-choice questions to generative tasks reveals sharp capability drops of up to 35%. In addition, filtering blindly solvable and mislabeled samples improves discriminative power while simultaneously reducing computational cost. We release DatBench-Full, a cleaned evaluation suite of 33 datasets spanning nine VLM capabilities, and DatBench, a discriminative subset that achieves 13x average speedup (up to 50x) while closely matching the discriminative power of the original datasets. Our work outlines a path toward evaluation practices that are both rigorous and sustainable as VLMs continue to scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuangyan Fang, Ruiqi Zhao, Yue Liu, Yangbo He</p>
<p>Abstract: Pairwise causal background knowledge about the existence or absence of causal edges and paths is frequently encountered in observational studies. Such constraints allow the shared directed and undirected edges in the constrained subclass of Markov equivalent DAGs to be represented as a causal maximally partially directed acyclic graph (MPDAG). In this paper, we first provide a sound and complete graphical characterization of causal MPDAGs and introduce a minimal representation of a causal MPDAG. Then, we give a unified representation for three types of pairwise causal background knowledge, including direct, ancestral and non-ancestral causal knowledge, by introducing a novel concept called direct causal clause (DCC). Using DCCs, we study the consistency and equivalence of pairwise causal background knowledge and show that any pairwise causal background knowledge set can be uniquely and equivalently decomposed into the causal MPDAG representing the refined Markov equivalence class and a minimal residual set of DCCs. Polynomial-time algorithms are also provided for checking consistency and equivalence, as well as for finding the decomposed MPDAG and the residual DCCs. Finally, with pairwise causal background knowledge, we prove a sufficient and necessary condition to identify causal effects and surprisingly find that the identifiability of causal effects only depends on the decomposed MPDAG. We also develop a local IDA-type algorithm to estimate the possible values of an unidentifiable effect. Simulations suggest that pairwise causal background knowledge can significantly improve the identifiability of causal effects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joachim Bona-Pellissier (MaLGA), Fran\c{c}ois Malgouyres (IMT), Fran\c{c}ois Bachoc (LPP)</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks with a large number of parameters often do not overfit, owing to implicit regularization that favors \lq good\rq{} networks. Other related and puzzling phenomena include properties of flat minima, saddle-to-saddle dynamics, and neuron alignment. To investigate these phenomena, we study the local geometry of deep ReLU neural networks. We show that, for a fixed architecture, as the weights vary, the image of a sample $X$ forms a set whose local dimension changes. The parameter space is partitioned into regions where this local dimension remains constant. The local dimension is invariant under the natural symmetries of ReLU networks (i.e., positive rescalings and neuron permutations). We establish then that the network's geometry induces a regularization, with the local dimension serving as a key measure of regularity. Moreover, we relate the local dimension to a new notion of flatness of minima and to saddle-to-saddle dynamics. For shallow networks, we also show that the local dimension is connected to the number of linear regions perceived by $X$, offering insight into the effects of regularization. This is further supported by experiments and linked to neuron alignment. Our analysis offers, for the first time, a simple and unified geometric explanation that applies to all learning contexts for these phenomena, which are usually studied in isolation. Finally, we explore the practical computation of the local dimension and present experiments on the MNIST dataset, which highlight geometry-induced regularization in this setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vignesh Gopakumar, Ander Gray, Joel Oskarsson, Lorenzo Zanisi, Daniel Giles, Matt J. Kusner, Stanislas Pamela, Marc Peter Deisenroth</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven surrogate models offer quick approximations to complex numerical and experimental systems but typically lack uncertainty quantification, limiting their reliability in safety-critical applications. While Bayesian methods provide uncertainty estimates, they offer no statistical guarantees and struggle with high-dimensional spatio-temporal problems due to computational costs. We present a conformal prediction (CP) framework that provides statistically guaranteed marginal coverage for surrogate models in a model-agnostic manner with near-zero computational cost. Our approach handles high-dimensional spatio-temporal outputs by performing cell-wise calibration while preserving the tensorial structure of predictions. Through extensive empirical evaluation across diverse applications including fluid dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, weather forecasting, and fusion diagnostics, we demonstrate that CP achieves empirical coverage with valid error bars regardless of model architecture, training regime, or output dimensionality. We evaluate three nonconformity scores (conformalised quantile regression, absolute error residual, and standard deviation) for both deterministic and probabilistic models, showing that guaranteed coverage holds even for out-of-distribution predictions where models are deployed on physics regimes different from training data. Calibration requires only seconds to minutes on standard hardware. The framework enables rigorous validation of pre-trained surrogate models for downstream applications without retraining. While CP provides marginal rather than conditional coverage and assumes exchangeability between calibration and test data, our method circumvents the curse of dimensionality inherent in traditional uncertainty quantification approaches, offering a practical tool for trustworthy deployment of machine learning in physical sciences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) in smart home environments is crucial for several applications, especially in the healthcare domain. The majority of the existing approaches leverage deep learning models. While these approaches are effective, the rationale behind their outputs is opaque. Recently, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approaches emerged to provide intuitive explanations to the output of HAR models. To the best of our knowledge, these approaches leverage classic deep models like CNNs or RNNs. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) proved to be effective for sensor-based HAR. However, existing approaches are not designed with explainability in mind. In this work, we propose the first explainable Graph Neural Network explicitly designed for smart home HAR. Our results on two public datasets show that this approach provides better explanations than state-of-the-art methods while also slightly improving the recognition rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Osher Elhadad, Owen Morrissey, Reuth Mirsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding an agent's goal through its behavior is a common AI problem called Goal Recognition (GR). This task becomes particularly challenging in dynamic environments where goals are numerous and ever-changing. We introduce the General Dynamic Goal Recognition (GDGR) problem, a broader definition of GR aimed at real-time adaptation of GR systems. This paper presents two novel approaches to tackle GDGR: (1) GC-AURA, generalizing to new goals using Model-Free Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning, and (2) Meta-AURA, adapting to novel environments with Meta-Reinforcement Learning. We evaluate these methods across diverse environments, demonstrating their ability to achieve rapid adaptation and high GR accuracy under dynamic and noisy conditions. This work is a significant step forward in enabling GR in dynamic and unpredictable real-world environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many fear that future artificial agents will resist shutdown. I present an idea - the POST-Agents Proposal - for ensuring that doesn't happen. I propose that we train agents to satisfy Preferences Only Between Same-Length Trajectories (POST). I then prove that POST - together with other conditions - implies Neutrality+: the agent maximizes expected utility, ignoring the probability distribution over trajectory-lengths.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marilyn Bello, Rafael Bello, Maria-Matilde Garc\'ia, Ann Now\'e, Iv\'an Sevillano-Garc\'ia, Francisco Herrera</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing application of artificial intelligence in sensitive domains has intensified the demand for systems that are not only accurate but also explainable and trustworthy. Although explainable AI (XAI) methods have proliferated, many do not consider the diverse audiences that interact with AI systems: from developers and domain experts to end-users and society. This paper addresses how trust in AI is influenced by the design and delivery of explanations and proposes a multilevel framework that aligns explanations with the epistemic, contextual, and ethical expectations of different stakeholders. The framework consists of three layers: algorithmic and domain-based, human-centered, and social explainability, with Large Language Models serving as crucial mediators that transform technical outputs of AI explanations into accessible, contextual narratives across all levels. We show how LLMs enable dynamic, conversational explanations that bridge the gap between complex model behavior and human understanding, facilitating interactive dialogue and enhancing societal transparency. Through comprehensive case studies, we show how this LLM-enhanced approach achieves technical fidelity, user engagement, and societal accountability, reframing XAI as a dynamic, trust-building process that leverages natural language capabilities to democratize AI explainability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Yao, Ran Cheng, Kay Chen Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs, as measured by standard benchmarks. Yet these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards. This raises a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect genuine reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To answer this question, we adopt an evaluation-centric perspective and highlight two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, benchmark contamination arises because test problems are publicly available, thereby increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, evaluation fragility results from reliance on single-instance assessments, which are sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. These limitations suggest the need for a new evaluation paradigm that can probe reasoning ability beyond memorization and one-off success. As response, we propose VAR-MATH, a symbolic evaluation framework that converts fixed numerical problems into parameterized templates and requires models to solve multiple instantiations of each. This design enforces consistency across structurally equivalent variants, mitigates contamination, and enhances robustness through bootstrapped metrics. We apply VAR-MATH to transform three popular benchmarks, AMC23, AIME24, and AIME25, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23, VAR-AIME24, and VAR-AIME25. Experimental results show substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on these variabilized benchmarks, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 47.9\% on AMC23, 58.8\% on AIME24, and 72.9\% on AIME25. These findings indicate that some existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongzhuoran Zhou, Yuqicheng Zhu, Xiaxia Wang, Hongkuan Zhou, Yuan He, Jiaoyan Chen, Steffen Staab, Evgeny Kharlamov</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs. However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG, making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaoke Zhang, Bo Wang, Yunlong Ma, Dongming Zhao, Zifei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the current field of agent memory, extensive explorations have been conducted in the area of memory retrieval, yet few studies have focused on exploring the memory content. Most research simply stores summarized versions of historical dialogues, as exemplified by methods like A-MEM and MemoryBank. However, when humans form long-term memories, the process involves multi-dimensional and multi-component generation, rather than merely creating simple summaries. The low-quality memory content generated by existing methods can adversely affect recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multi-memory segment system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes short-term memory into multiple long-term memory segments, and constructs retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these segments, with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase, MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively utilizing historical data. We conducted experiments on the LoCoMo dataset and further performed ablation experiments, experiments on the robustness regarding the number of input memories, and overhead experiments, which demonstrated the effectiveness and practical value of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: The focus of AI development has shifted from academic research to practical applications. However, AI development faces numerous challenges at various levels. This article will attempt to analyze the opportunities and challenges of AI from several different perspectives using a structured approach. This article proposes a seven-layer model for AI compute architecture, including Physical Layer, Link Layer, Neural Network Layer, Context Layer, Agent Layer, Orchestrator Layer, and Application Layer, from bottom to top.
  It also explains the three stages in the evolution of large language models (LLMs) using the proposed 7-layer model. For each layer, we describe the development trajectory and key technologies. In Layers 1 and 2 we discuss AI computing issues and the impact of Scale-Up and Scale-Out strategies on computing architecture. In Layer 3 we explore two different development paths for LLMs. In Layer 4 we discuss the impact of contextual memory on LLMs and compares it to traditional processor memory. In Layers 5 to 7 we discuss the trends of AI agents and explore the issues in evolution from a single AI agent to an AI-based ecosystem, and their impact on the AI industry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanjeda Akter, Ibne Farabi Shihab, Anuj Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models can produce correct answers while relying on flawed reasoning traces, partly because common training objectives reward final-answer correctness rather than faithful intermediate reasoning. This undermines trustworthiness in high-stakes settings. We propose Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization (CSR), a training paradigm that improves reasoning faithfulness by enforcing causal consistency between reasoning steps and outcomes. CSR automatically applies operator-level interventions to reasoning traces, such as swapping "+" with "-", to generate minimally perturbed counterfactual rationales, and penalizes the model when these logically invalid traces still lead to the original answer. Our implementation is efficient, adding about 9 percent training overhead via a warm-start curriculum and token-subset optimization.
  We evaluate faithfulness using Counterfactual Outcome Sensitivity (COS), which measures how appropriately answers change under logical perturbations. Across arithmetic (GSM8K), logical deduction (ProofWriter), multi-hop question answering (HotpotQA), and code generation (MBPP), CSR yields improved accuracy versus faithfulness trade-offs, establishing a new Pareto frontier. CSR improves faithfulness over standard fine-tuning and process supervision by up to 70 percentage points, and transfers across model families with 94.2 to 96.7 percent success in structured domains. CSR also complements inference-time methods such as self-consistency. Overall, CSR offers a practical route to more reliable reasoning in structured domains, including mathematics, formal logic, and code, where operators are well-defined and verifiable, covering an estimated 40 to 60 percent of high-stakes reasoning deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masaharu Mizumoto, Dat Nguyen, Zhiheng Han, Jiyuan Fang, Heyuan Guan, Xingfu Li, Naoya Shiraishi, Yo Nakawake, Le Minh Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmark saturation and contamination have obscured genuine advances in reasoning for large language models (LLMs). We introduce NazoNazo Benchmark, a low-cost, renewable test built from Japanese children's riddles that demand insight-based reasoning, or representational shifts rather than knowledge recall. We evaluate 38 frontier LLMs (2023-2025) on 201 riddles and a 120-item human-comparison subset, finding that non-reasoning models average 7.6%, reasoning models 17.6%, and humans ~53% accuracy. Importantly, thought-log analysis reveals that reasoning in Japanese did not necessarily improve accuracy, indicating that language understanding alone is insufficient for insight reasoning. Notably, models sometimes generated correct candidates but failed to endorse them, suggesting weak metacognitive control rather than a lack of knowledge. This "verification failure" indicates that CoT outputs can reflect genuine intermediate reasoning states rather than post-hoc rationalizations. By exposing this metacognitive bottleneck - models' inability to recognize when they are right - the benchmark provides a scalable, cross-linguistic testbed for studying machine insight, confidence calibration, and self-evaluation. NazoNazo Benchmark thus offers not only a fresh challenge to current LLMs but also a concrete target for developing AI metacognitive psychology and enhancing machine Aha! capability.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work evaluates State-of-the-Art convolution algorithms for CPU-based CNN inference. Although most prior studies focus on GPUs or NPUs, CPU implementations remain comparatively under-optimized. Our first contribution is to provide fair benchmarking for embedded CPU inference. We evaluate direct, GEMM-based, and Winograd convolutions across modern CPUs from ARM, Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA vendors, considering both latency and energy efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to present a fair, cross-vendor comparison of CPU energy consumption using a high-resolution socket-level measurement platform. To validate our methodology, we further compare socket-level power measurements with estimates derived from model-specific registers (MSRs), finding that MSRs underestimate the power consumption of convolution inference by 10--30%. Our results show that the ARM\R Cortex-A78AE CPU combined with an implicit GEMM convolution implementation offers the best trade-off between latency and power consumption, achieving ResNet50v1.5 inference in 102 ms with an average power of 25.3 W, corresponding to 2.58 J.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Norelli, Michael Bronstein</p>
<p>Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present Calgacus, a simple and efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication, already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it means for a Large Language Model to know something.

Un testo di senso compiuto pu\`o essere nascosto all'interno di un altro testo completamente diverso, eppure coerente e plausibile, della stessa lunghezza. Ad esempio, un tweet che celebra un leader politico potrebbe celare un tweet che lo critica duramente, o un'anonima recensione di un prodotto potrebbe in realt\`a codificare un manoscritto segreto. Questa sconcertante possibilit\`a \`e oggi alla nostra portata grazie ai Large Language Models (LLM); in questo articolo presentiamo Calgacus, un protocollo semplice ed efficiente per realizzarla. Mostriamo che anche modesti LLM open-source da 8 miliardi di parametri sono sufficienti per ottenere risultati di alta qualit\`a, e che un messaggio lungo quanto questo abstract pu\`o essere codificato e decodificato su un comune portatile in pochi secondi. L'esistenza di tale protocollo dimostra un radicale disaccoppiamento del testo dall'intento del suo autore, erodendo ulteriormente la fiducia nella comunicazione scritta, gi\`a scossa dall'ascesa dei chatbot basati su LLMs. Illustriamo ci\`o con uno scenario concreto: un'azienda potrebbe offrire pubblicamente i servizi di un LLM senza filtri nascondendo le sue risposte all'interno di risposte apparentemente innocue generate da un LLM considerato sicuro. Questa possibilit\`a solleva questioni urgenti per la sicurezza dell'Intelligenza Artificiale e sfida la nostra comprensione di cosa significhi, per un Large Language Model, sapere qualcosa.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Zheng, Zirui Pang, Ling li, Zhijie Deng, Yuhan Pu, Zhaowei Zhu, Xiaobo Xia, Jiaheng Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) intensify concerns about data privacy, making Machine Unlearning (MU), the selective removal of learned information, a critical necessity. However, existing MU benchmarks for MLLMs are limited by a lack of image diversity, potential inaccuracies, and insufficient evaluation scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of real-world applications. To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football transfer rumors. This manually curated dataset contains 15.68K records for 80 players, providing a comprehensive framework with four test sets to assess forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. OFFSIDE supports advanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and crucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive evaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods (erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning efficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle with "visual rumors" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can be easily recovered and (5) All methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks. These results expose significant vulnerabilities in current approaches, highlighting the need for more robust multimodal unlearning solutions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeongseop Rha, Jeong Hun Yeo, Yeonju Kim, Yong Man Ro</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift, emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust. However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like HCI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianrui Li, Dakuan Lu, Jiawei Shao, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Self-correction Relative Policy Optimization (ScRPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to empower large language models with advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities through iterative self-reflection and error correction. The ScRPO framework operates in two distinct phases: (1) Trial-and-error learning stage, where the model is trained via GRPO, and incorrect responses are collected to form an "error pool"; and (2) Self-correction learning stage, which guides the model to introspectively analyze and rectify the reasoning flaws behind its previous errors. Extensive evaluations across challenging mathematical benchmarks, including AIME, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500, and GSM8k, validate the efficacy of our approach. Using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and 7B as backbones, ScRPO achieves average accuracies of 64.8% and 77.8%, respectively. This represents a significant improvement of 6.0% and 3.2% over vanilla baselines, consistently outperforming strong post-training methods such as DAPO and GRPO. These findings establish ScRPO as a robust paradigm for enabling autonomous self-improvement in AI systems, particularly in tasks with limited external feedback.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunghyun Wee, Suyoung Kim, Hyeonjin Kim, Kyomin Hwang, Nojun Kwak</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety and efficiency are paramount yet often conflicting requirements for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs are trained to follow human alignment for safety, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is applied afterward to ensure efficiency. Here we identify a fundamental flaw in the conventional PTQ paradigm: quantization can turn into a safety vulnerability if it only aims to achieve low perplexity. To address this, we propose \textbf{Alignment-Aware Quantization (AAQ)}, a novel approach that integrates an \textbf{Alignment-Preserving Contrastive (APC)} loss into the PTQ pipeline. Our method explicitly preserves alignment by encouraging the quantized model to mimic its safe, instruction-tuned model while diverging from the unaligned, pre-trained counterpart. AAQ achieves robust safety alignment without specialized safety-focused datasets, using only standard calibration data. We show that AAQ is compatible with standard PTQ techniques and enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across diverse model families. Our work resolves the critical trade-off between efficiency and safety, paving the way toward LLMs that are both efficient and trustworthy. Anonymized code is available in the supplementary material.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from unfaithfulness, generating reasoning chains that drift from visual evidence or contradict final predictions. We propose Faithful-First Reasoning, Planning, and Acting (RPA) framework in which FaithEvi provides step-wise and chain-level supervision by evaluating the faithfulness of intermediate reasoning, and FaithAct uses these signals to plan and execute faithfulness-aware actions during inference. Experiments across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that faithful-first RPA improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 24% over prompt-based and tool-augmented reasoning frameworks, without degrading task accuracy. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle perceptually faithful reasoning trajectories and mitigates hallucination behavior. This work thereby establishes a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shouang Wei, Min Zhang, Xin Lin, Bo Jiang, Kun Kuang, Zhongxiang Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pei Yang, Ke Zhang, Ji Wang, Xiao Chen, Yuxin Tang, Eric Yang, Lynn Ai, Bill Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: We present CRM (Multi-Agent Collaborative Reward Model), a framework that replaces a single black-box reward model with a coordinated team of specialist evaluators to improve robustness and interpretability in RLHF. Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM. Together, CRM and rewardBench provide a practical, modular path to more transparent reward modeling and more stable optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro Passos, Patrick Moratori</p>
<p>Abstract: High-stakes decision-making is often compromised by cognitive biases and outcome dependency. Current AI models typically mimic historical human behavior, inheriting these biases and limiting their utility for normative improvement. Here, we introduce a Prescriptive AI framework designed to audit, rather than automate, human judgment in real-time environments. By decoupling decision quality from stochastic outcomes, we quantify "decision latency" and status quo bias in elite soccer management - a high-pressure adversarial domain. Analyzing 2018 FIFA World Cup data, our system exposes critical risk states, such as performance collapse following salient positive events (e.g., an assist), which human experts systematically overlook due to outcome bias. These findings demonstrate that interpretable auditing systems can reveal structural flaws in human reasoning that predictive models obscure. This approach establishes a paradigm for Human-AI interaction prioritizing epistemic accountability over predictive mimicry in safety-critical domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wencheng Cai, Xuchao Gao, Congying Han, Mingqiang Li, Tiande Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: The fast deployment of cognitive radar to counter jamming remains a critical challenge in modern warfare, where more efficient deployment leads to quicker detection of targets. Existing methods are primarily based on evolutionary algorithms, which are time-consuming and prone to falling into local optima. We tackle these drawbacks via the efficient inference of neural networks and propose a brand new framework: Fast Anti-Jamming Radar Deployment Algorithm (FARDA). We first model the radar deployment problem as an end-to-end task and design deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve it, where we develop integrated neural modules to perceive heatmap information and a brand new reward format. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves coverage comparable to evolutionary algorithms while deploying radars approximately 7,000 times faster. Further ablation experiments confirm the necessity of each component of FARDA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Dong, Pengkun Zhang, Yan Gao, Xuanyu Dong, Yilin Cheng, Mingzhe Lu, Adina Yakefu, Shuxin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a finance & accounting benchmark (Finch) for evaluating AI agents on real-world, enterprise-grade professional workflows -- interleaving data entry, structuring, formatting, web search, cross-file retrieval, calculation, modeling, validation, translation, visualization, and reporting. Finch is sourced from authentic enterprise workspaces at Enron (15,000 spreadsheets and 500,000 emails from 150 employees) and other financial institutions, preserving in-the-wild messiness across multimodal artifacts (text, tables, formulas, charts, code, and images) and spanning diverse domains such as budgeting, trading, and asset management.
  We propose a workflow construction process that combines LLM-assisted discovery with expert annotation: (1) LLM-assisted, expert-verified derivation of workflows from real-world email threads and version histories of spreadsheet files, and (2) meticulous expert annotation for workflows, requiring over 700 hours of domain-expert effort. This yields 172 composite workflows with 384 tasks, involving 1,710 spreadsheets with 27 million cells, along with PDFs and other artifacts, capturing the intrinsically messy, long-horizon, knowledge-intensive, and collaborative nature of real-world enterprise work.
  We conduct both human and automated evaluations of frontier AI systems including GPT 5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, Grok 4, and Qwen 3 Max, and GPT 5.1 Pro spends 16.8 minutes per workflow yet passes only 38.4% of workflows, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 passes just 25.0%. Comprehensive case studies further surface the challenges that real-world enterprise workflows pose for AI agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengchao Chen, Haoran Wang, Jing Yao, Pedram Ghamisi, Jun Zhou, Peter M. Atkinson, Bing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The automated and intelligent processing of massive remote sensing (RS) datasets is critical in Earth observation (EO). Existing automated systems are normally task-specific, lacking a unified framework to manage diverse, end-to-end workflows--from data preprocessing to advanced interpretation--across diverse RS applications. To address this gap, this paper introduces CangLing-KnowFlow, a unified intelligent agent framework that integrates a Procedural Knowledge Base (PKB), Dynamic Workflow Adjustment, and an Evolutionary Memory Module. The PKB, comprising 1,008 expert-validated workflow cases across 162 practical RS tasks, guides planning and substantially reduces hallucinations common in general-purpose agents. During runtime failures, the Dynamic Workflow Adjustment autonomously diagnoses and replans recovery strategies, while the Evolutionary Memory Module continuously learns from these events, iteratively enhancing the agent's knowledge and performance. This synergy enables CangLing-KnowFlow to adapt, learn, and operate reliably across diverse, complex tasks. We evaluated CangLing-KnowFlow on the KnowFlow-Bench, a novel benchmark of 324 workflows inspired by real-world applications, testing its performance across 13 top Large Language Model (LLM) backbones, from open-source to commercial. Across all complex tasks, CangLing-KnowFlow surpassed the Reflexion baseline by at least 4% in Task Success Rate. As the first most comprehensive validation along this emerging field, this research demonstrates the great potential of CangLing-KnowFlow as a robust, efficient, and scalable automated solution for complex EO challenges by leveraging expert knowledge (Knowledge) into adaptive and verifiable procedures (Flow).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yosuke Taniuchi, Chie Hieida, Atsushi Noritake, Kazushi Ikeda, Masaki Isoda</p>
<p>Abstract: Social comparison$\unicode{x2014}$the process of evaluating one's rewards relative to others$\unicode{x2014}$plays a fundamental role in primate social cognition. However, it remains unknown from a computational perspective how information about others' rewards affects the evaluation of one's own reward. With a constructive approach, this study examines whether monkeys merely recognize objective reward differences or, instead, infer others' subjective reward valuations. We developed three computational models with varying degrees of social information processing: an Internal Prediction Model (IPM), which infers the partner's subjective values; a No Comparison Model (NCM), which disregards partner information; and an External Comparison Model (ECM), which directly incorporates the partner's objective rewards. To test model performance, we used a multi-layered, multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation. We trained the models on a dataset containing the behavior of a pair of monkeys, their rewards, and the conditioned stimuli. Then, we evaluated the models' ability to classify subjective values across pre-defined experimental conditions. The ECM achieved the highest classification score in the Rand Index (0.88 vs. 0.79 for the IPM) under our settings, suggesting that social comparison relies on objective reward differences rather than inferences about subjective states.</p>

<p>Abstract: Behavioral healthcare risk assessment remains a challenging problem due to the highly multimodal nature of patient data and the temporal dynamics of mood and affective disorders. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, their effectiveness in structured clinical risk scoring remains unclear. In this work, we introduce HARBOR, a behavioral health aware language model designed to predict a discrete mood and risk score, termed the Harbor Risk Score (HRS), on an integer scale from -3 (severe depression) to +3 (mania). We also release PEARL, a longitudinal behavioral healthcare dataset spanning four years of monthly observations from three patients, containing physiological, behavioral, and self reported mental health signals. We benchmark traditional machine learning models, proprietary LLMs, and HARBOR across multiple evaluation settings and ablations. Our results show that HARBOR outperforms classical baselines and off the shelf LLMs, achieving 69 percent accuracy compared to 54 percent for logistic regression and 29 percent for the strongest proprietary LLM baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenny Workman, Zhen Yang, Harihara Muralidharan, Hannah Le</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics assays are rapidly increasing in scale and complexity, making computational analysis a major bottleneck in biological discovery. Although frontier AI agents have improved dramatically at software engineering and general data analysis, it remains unclear whether they can extract biological insight from messy, real-world spatial datasets. We introduce SpatialBench, a benchmark of 146 verifiable problems derived from practical spatial analysis workflows spanning five spatial technologies and seven task categories. Each problem provides a snapshot of experimental data immediately prior to an analysis step and a deterministic grader that evaluates recovery of a key biological result. Benchmark data on frontier models shows that base model accuracy remains low (20-38% across model families), with strong model-task and model-platform interactions. Harness design has a large empirical effect on performance, indicating that tools, prompts, control flow, and execution environment should be evaluated and improved as first-class objects. SpatialBench serves both as a measurement tool and a diagnostic lens for developing agents that can interact with real spatial datasets faithfully, transparently, and reproducibly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Cheng, Yulan Hu, Xiangwen Zhang, Lu Xu, Zheng Pan, Xin Li, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Travel planning is a natural real-world task to test large language models (LLMs) planning and tool-use abilities. Although prior work has studied LLM performance on travel planning, existing settings still differ from real-world needs, mainly due to limited domain coverage, insufficient modeling of users' implicit preferences in multi-turn conversations, and a lack of clear evaluation of agents' capability boundaries. To mitigate these gaps, we propose \textbf{TravelBench}, a benchmark for fully real-world travel planning. We collect user queries, user profile and tools from real scenarios, and construct three subtasks-Single-Turn, Multi-Turn, and Unsolvable-to evaluate agent's three core capabilities in real settings: (1) solving problems autonomously, (2) interacting with users over multiple turns to refine requirements, and (3) recognizing the limits of own abilities. To enable stable tool invocation and reproducible evaluation, we cache real tool-call results and build a sandbox environment that integrates ten travel-related tools. Agents can combine these tools to solve most practical travel planning problems, and our systematic verification demonstrates the stability of the proposed benchmark. We further evaluate multiple LLMs on TravelBench and conduct an in-depth analysis of their behaviors and performance. TravelBench provides a practical and reproducible evaluation benchmark to advance research on LLM agents for travel planning.\footnote{Our code and data will be available after internal review.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danni Xu, Shaojing Fan, Harry Cheng, Mohan Kankanhalli</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation poses a growing challenge for automated fact-checking systems. Existing approaches, including large vision language models (LVLMs) and deep multimodal fusion methods, often fall short due to limited reasoning and shallow evidence utilization. A key bottleneck is the lack of dedicated datasets that provide complete real-world multimodal misinformation instances accompanied by annotated reasoning processes and verifiable evidence. To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the synergy between RW-Post and AgentFact substantially improves both the accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Pei, Zhongyang Liu, Xiangyi Xiao, Xiaocong Du, Suting Hong, Kunpeng Zhang, Haipeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Most venture capital (VC) investments fail, while a few deliver outsized returns. Accurately predicting startup success requires synthesizing complex relational evidence, including company disclosures, investor track records, and investment network structures, through explicit reasoning to form coherent, interpretable investment theses. Traditional machine learning and graph neural networks both lack this reasoning capability. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning but face a modality mismatch with graphs. Recent graph-LLM methods target in-graph tasks where answers lie within the graph, whereas VC prediction is off-graph: the target exists outside the network. The core challenge is selecting graph paths that maximize predictor performance on an external objective while enabling step-by-step reasoning. We present MIRAGE-VC, a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework that addresses two obstacles: path explosion (thousands of candidate paths overwhelm LLM context) and heterogeneous evidence fusion (different startups need different analytical emphasis). Our information-gain-driven path retriever iteratively selects high-value neighbors, distilling investment networks into compact chains for explicit reasoning. A multi-agent architecture integrates three evidence streams via a learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes. Under strict anti-leakage controls, MIRAGE-VC achieves +5.0% F1 and +16.6% PrecisionAt5, and sheds light on other off-graph prediction tasks such as recommendation and risk assessment.

<p>Abstract: Agentic crafting requires LLMs to operate in real-world environments over multiple turns by taking actions, observing outcomes, and iteratively refining artifacts. Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agentic model. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME, an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-Perceptive Agentic Policy Optimization (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of ALE.</p>

<p>Abstract: Approaches for appraising feature importance approximations, alternatively referred to as attribution methods, have been established across an extensive array of contexts. The development of resilient techniques for performance benchmarking constitutes a critical concern in the sphere of explainable deep learning. This study scrutinizes the dependability of the RemOve-And-Retrain (ROAR) procedure, which is prevalently employed for gauging the performance of feature importance estimates. The insights gleaned from our theoretical foundation and empirical investigations reveal that attributions containing lesser information about the decision function may yield superior results in ROAR benchmarks, contradicting the original intent of ROAR. This occurrence is similarly observed in the recently introduced variant RemOve-And-Debias (ROAD), and we posit a persistent pattern of blurriness bias in ROAR attribution metrics. Our findings serve as a warning against indiscriminate use on ROAR metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gopi Krishna Jha, Anthony Thomas, Nilesh Jain, Sameh Gobriel, Tajana Rosing, Ravi Iyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based recommendation systems (e.g., DLRMs) are widely used AI models to provide high-quality personalized recommendations. Training data used for modern recommendation systems commonly includes categorical features taking on tens-of-millions of possible distinct values. These categorical tokens are typically assigned learned vector representations, that are stored in large embedding tables, on the order of 100s of GB. Storing and accessing these tables represent a substantial burden in commercial deployments. Our work proposes MEM-REC, a novel alternative representation approach for embedding tables. MEM-REC leverages bloom filters and hashing methods to encode categorical features using two cache-friendly embedding tables. The first table (token embedding) contains raw embeddings (i.e. learned vector representation), and the second table (weight embedding), which is much smaller, contains weights to scale these raw embeddings to provide better discriminative capability to each data point. We provide a detailed architecture, design and analysis of MEM-REC addressing trade-offs in accuracy and computation requirements, in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques. We show that MEM-REC can not only maintain the recommendation quality and significantly reduce the memory footprint for commercial scale recommendation models but can also improve the embedding latency. In particular, based on our results, MEM-REC compresses the MLPerf CriteoTB benchmark DLRM model size by 2900x and performs up to 3.4x faster embeddings while achieving the same AUC as that of the full uncompressed model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Khalifa, Lajanugen Logeswaran, Moontae Lee, Honglak Lee, Lu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the context of multi-step reasoning, e.g., with chain-of-thought, language models (LMs) can easily assign a high likelihood to incorrect steps. As a result, decoding strategies that optimize for solution likelihood often yield incorrect solutions. To address this issue, we propose Guiding chain-of-thought ReAsoning with a CorrectnEss Discriminator (GRACE), a stepwise decoding approach that steers the decoding process towards producing correct reasoning steps. GRACE employs a step-level verifier or discriminator trained with a contrastive loss over correct and incorrect steps, which is used during decoding to score next-step candidates based on their correctness. Importantly, GRACE only requires sampling from the LM, without the need for LM training or fine-tuning. Using models from FLAN-T5 and LLaMA families, we evaluate GRACE over four math and two symbolic reasoning tasks, where it exhibits substantial performance gains compared to greedy decoding, verifiers, and self-consistency in most settings. When further combined with self-consistency, GRACE outperforms all the baselines by sizeable margins. Human and LLM evaluations over GSM8K show that GRACE not only improves the final answer accuracy but also the correctness of the intermediate reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanglin Zhou, Zhongyi Han, Shiming Chen, Biwei Huang, Liming Zhu, Tongliang Liu, Lina Yao, Kun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) endeavors to create machine learning models that excel in unseen scenarios by learning invariant features. In DG, the prevalent practice of constraining models to a fixed structure or uniform parameterization to encapsulate invariant features can inadvertently blend specific aspects. Such an approach struggles with nuanced differentiation of inter-domain variations and may exhibit bias towards certain domains, hindering the precise learning of domain-invariant features. Recognizing this, we introduce a novel method designed to supplement the model with domain-level and task-specific characteristics. This approach aims to guide the model in more effectively separating invariant features from specific characteristics, thereby boosting the generalization. Building on the emerging trend of visual prompts in the DG paradigm, our work introduces the novel \textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompt (HCVP) methodology. This represents a significant advancement in the field, setting itself apart with a unique generative approach to prompts, alongside an explicit model structure and specialized loss functions. Differing from traditional visual prompts that are often shared across entire datasets, HCVP utilizes a hierarchical prompt generation network enhanced by prompt contrastive learning. These generative prompts are instance-dependent, catering to the unique characteristics inherent to different domains and tasks. Additionally, we devise a prompt modulation network that serves as a bridge, effectively incorporating the generated visual prompts into the vision transformer backbone. Experiments conducted on five DG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HCVP, outperforming both established DG algorithms and adaptation protocols.</p>

<p>Abstract: Person re-identification via 3D skeletons is an important emerging research area that attracts increasing attention within the pattern recognition community. With distinctive advantages across various application scenarios, numerous 3D skeleton based person re-identification (SRID) methods with diverse skeleton modeling and learning paradigms have been proposed in recent years. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review and analysis of recent SRID advances. First of all, we define the SRID task and provide an overview of its origin and major advancements. Secondly, we formulate a systematic taxonomy that organizes existing methods into three categories centered on hand-crafted, sequence-based, and graph-based modeling. Then, we elaborate on the representative models along these three types with an illustration of foundational mechanisms. Meanwhile, we provide an overview of mainstream supervised, self-supervised, and unsupervised SRID learning paradigms and corresponding common methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shicong Cen, Jincheng Mei, Hanjun Dai, Dale Schuurmans, Yuejie Chi, Bo Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic dominance serves as a general framework for modeling a broad spectrum of decision preferences under uncertainty, with risk aversion as one notable example, as it naturally captures the intrinsic structure of the underlying uncertainty, in contrast to simply resorting to the expectations. Despite theoretical appeal, the application of stochastic dominance in machine learning has been scarce, due to the following challenges: $\textbf{i)}$, the original concept of stochastic dominance only provides a $\textit{partial order}$, and therefore, is not amenable to serve as a general optimality criterion; and $\textbf{ii)}$, an efficient computational recipe remains lacking due to the continuum nature of evaluating stochastic dominance.
  In this work, we make the first attempt towards establishing a general framework of learning with stochastic dominance. We first generalize the stochastic dominance concept to enable feasible comparisons between any arbitrary pair of random variables. We next develop a simple and computationally efficient approach for finding the optimal solution in terms of stochastic dominance, which can be seamlessly plugged into many learning tasks. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance as standard risk-neutral strategies and obtains better trade-offs against risk across a variety of applications including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and portfolio optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefana Anita, Gabriel Turinici</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Multi Armed Bandit (MAB) on one hand and the policy gradient approach on the other hand are among the most used frameworks of Reinforcement Learning, the theoretical properties of the policy gradient algorithm used for MAB have not been given enough attention. We investigate in this work the convergence of such a procedure for the situation when a $L2$ regularization term is present jointly with the 'softmax' parametrization. We prove convergence under appropriate technical hypotheses and test numerically the procedure including situations beyond the theoretical setting. The tests show that a time dependent regularized procedure can improve over the canonical approach especially when the initial guess is far from the solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weizhi Tang, Kwabena Nuamah, Vaishak Belle</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal Reasoning (TR) is a critical ability for LLMs to understand and reason over temporal information and relationships between events. To study the TR ability in LLMs, prior works provide different ways for evaluating various aspects of TR ability. In this work, we propose an alternative perspective for evaluating TR ability by leveraging Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), and develop a pipeline to automatically synthesize challenges for assessing the TR ability of LLMs. Based on this pipeline, we construct a dataset, namely LTLBench, consisting of $2000$ TR challenges, and benchmark 12 LLMs across 5 different methods. Furthermore, we conduct additional experiments to investigate the impact of increasing the number of formula operators and events on both LLM performance and the complexity of TR problems. We also perform qualitative analyses of their reasoning processes and the effects of varying the number of events and formula operators, which reveal 3 main issues in their temporal reasoning processes and the unexpected performance changes observed as problem complexity increases. We expect this work to provide valuable insights into the TR ability of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengze Hong, Di Jiang, Zichang Guo, Chen Jason Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic Embedding Models (SEMs) have become a core component in information retrieval and natural language processing due to their ability to model semantic relevance. However, despite its growing applications in search engines, few studies have systematically explored how to construct effective training data for SEMs from large-scale search engine query logs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of strategies for generating pairwise judgments as SEM training data. An interesting (perhaps surprising) discovery reveals that conventional formulation approaches used in Learning-to-Rank (LTR) are not necessarily optimal for SEM training. Through a large-scale empirical study using query logs and click-through data from a major search engine, we identify effective strategies and demonstrate the advantages of a proposed hybrid heuristic over simpler atomic heuristics. Finally, we provide best practices for SEM training and outline directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christoffer Olling Back, Jakob Grue Simonsen</p>
<p>Abstract: Event knowledge graphs (EKG) extend the classical notion of a trace to capture multiple, interacting views of a process execution. In this paper, we tackle the open problem of automating EKG discovery from uncurated data through a principled probabilistic framing based on the outcome space resulting from featured-derived partial orders on events. From this we derive an EKG discovery algorithm based on statistical inference rather than an ad hoc or heuristic-based strategy, or relying on manual analysis from domain experts.
  This approach comes at the computational cost of exploring a large, non-convex hypothesis space. In particular, solving the maximum likelihood term in our objective function involves counting the number of linear extensions of posets, which in general is #P-complete. Fortunately, bound estimates suffice for model comparison, and admit incorporation into a bespoke branch-and-bound algorithm. We establish an upper bound on our objective function which we show to be antitonic w.r.t. search depth for branching rules that are monotonic w.r.t. model inclusion. This allows pruning of large portions of the search space, which we show experimentally leads to rapid convergence toward optimal solutions that are consistent with manually built EKGs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Algorithm design is crucial for effective problem-solving across various domains. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has notably enhanced the automation and innovation within this field, offering new perspectives and promising solutions. In just a few years, this integration has yielded remarkable progress in areas ranging from combinatorial optimization to scientific discovery. Despite this rapid expansion, a holistic understanding of the field is hindered by the lack of a systematic review, as existing surveys either remain limited to narrow sub-fields or with different objectives. This paper seeks to provide a systematic review of algorithm design with LLMs. We introduce a taxonomy that categorises the roles of LLMs as optimizers, predictors, extractors and designers, analyzing the progress, advantages, and limitations within each category. We further synthesize literature across the three phases of the algorithm design pipeline and across diverse algorithmic applications that define the current landscape. Finally, we outline key open challenges and opportunities to guide future research.

<p>Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized Computer Vision (CV) through self-attention mechanisms. However, their complexity makes latent token representations difficult to interpret. We introduce ULTra, a framework for interpreting Transformer embeddings and uncovering meaningful semantic patterns within them. ULTra enables unsupervised semantic segmentation using pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning. Additionally, we propose a self-supervised training approach that refines segmentation performance by learning an external transformation matrix without modifying the underlying model. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised semantic segmentation, outperforming existing segmentation methods. Furthermore, we validate ULTra for model interpretation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios, including Object Selection and interpretable text summarization using LLMs, demonstrating its broad applicability in explaining the semantic structure of latent token representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Low-resource languages serve as invaluable repositories of human history, embodying cultural evolution and intellectual diversity. Despite their significance, these languages face critical challenges, including data scarcity and technological limitations, which hinder their comprehensive study and preservation. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer transformative opportunities for addressing these challenges, enabling innovative methodologies in linguistic, historical, and cultural research. This study systematically evaluates the applications of LLMs in low-resource language research, encompassing linguistic variation, historical documentation, cultural expressions, and literary analysis. By analyzing technical frameworks, current methodologies, and ethical considerations, this paper identifies key challenges such as data accessibility, model adaptability, and cultural sensitivity. Given the cultural, historical, and linguistic richness inherent in low-resource languages, this work emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of customized models as promising avenues for advancing research in this domain. By underscoring the potential of integrating artificial intelligence with the humanities to preserve and study humanity's linguistic and cultural heritage, this study fosters global efforts towards safeguarding intellectual diversity.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00755">An AI-powered Bayesian generative modeling approach for causal inference in observational studies</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiao Liu, Wing Hung Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal inference in observational studies with high-dimensional covariates presents significant challenges. We introduce CausalBGM, an AI-powered Bayesian generative modeling approach that captures the causal relationship among covariates, treatment, and outcome. The core innovation is to estimate the individual treatment effect (ITE) by learning the individual-specific distribution of a low-dimensional latent feature set (e.g., latent confounders) that drives changes in both treatment and outcome. This individualized posterior representation yields estimates of the individual treatment effect (ITE) together with well-calibrated posterior intervals while mitigating confounding effect. CausalBGM is fitted through an iterative algorithm to update the model parameters and the latent features until convergence. This framework leverages the power of AI to capture complex dependencies among variables while adhering to the Bayesian principles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CausalBGM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with high-dimensional covariates and large-scale datasets. By addressing key limitations of existing methods, CausalBGM emerges as a robust and promising framework for advancing causal inference in a wide range of modern applications. The code for CausalBGM is available at https://github.com/liuq-lab/bayesgm. The tutorial for CausalBGM is available at https://causalbgm.readthedocs.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Lv, Chen Tang, Zifan Zheng, Bohao Yang, Kun Zhao, Ning Liao, Xiaoxing Wang, Feiyu Xiong, Zhiyu Li, Nayu Liu, Jingchi Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) networks benefit from utilizing multiple smaller expert models as opposed to a single large network. However, these experts typically operate independently, leaving a question open about whether interconnecting these models could enhance the performance of MoE networks. In response, we introduce GRAPHMOE, a novel method aimed at augmenting the cognitive depth of language models via a self-rethinking mechanism constructed on Pseudo GraphMoE networks. GRAPHMOE employs a recurrent routing strategy to simulate iterative thinking steps, thereby facilitating the flow of information among expert nodes. We implement the GRAPHMOE architecture using Low-Rank Adaptation techniques (LoRA) and conduct extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets. The experimental results reveal that GRAPHMOE outperforms other LoRA based models, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Additionally, this study explores a novel recurrent routing strategy that may inspire further advancements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: General reasoning represents a long-standing and formidable challenge in artificial intelligence. Recent breakthroughs, exemplified by large language models (LLMs) and chain-of-thought prompting, have achieved considerable success on foundational reasoning tasks. However, this success is heavily contingent upon extensive human-annotated demonstrations, and models' capabilities are still insufficient for more complex problems. Here we show that the reasoning abilities of LLMs can be incentivized through pure reinforcement learning (RL), obviating the need for human-labeled reasoning trajectories. The proposed RL framework facilitates the emergent development of advanced reasoning patterns, such as self-reflection, verification, and dynamic strategy adaptation. Consequently, the trained model achieves superior performance on verifiable tasks such as mathematics, coding competitions, and STEM fields, surpassing its counterparts trained via conventional supervised learning on human demonstrations. Moreover, the emergent reasoning patterns exhibited by these large-scale models can be systematically harnessed to guide and enhance the reasoning capabilities of smaller models.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of digital interactions across diverse domains, such as healthcare, e-commerce, gaming, and finance, has resulted in the generation of vast volumes of event stream (ES) data. ES data comprises continuous sequences of timestamped events that encapsulate detailed contextual information relevant to each domain. While ES data holds significant potential for extracting actionable insights and enhancing decision-making, its effective utilization is hindered by challenges such as the scarcity of labeled data and the fragmented nature of existing research efforts. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these challenges by enabling the extraction of meaningful representations from unlabeled ES data. In this survey, we systematically review and synthesize SSL methodologies tailored for ES modeling across multiple domains, bridging the gaps between domain-specific approaches that have traditionally operated in isolation. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of SSL techniques, encompassing both predictive and contrastive paradigms, and analyze their applicability and effectiveness within different application contexts. Furthermore, we identify critical gaps in current research and propose a future research agenda aimed at developing scalable, domain-agnostic SSL frameworks for ES modeling. By unifying disparate research efforts and highlighting cross-domain synergies, this survey aims to accelerate innovation, improve reproducibility, and expand the applicability of SSL to diverse real-world ES challenges.</p>

<p>Abstract: Role-playing language agents (RPLAs) have emerged as promising applications of large language models (LLMs). However, simulating established characters presents a challenging task for RPLAs, due to the lack of authentic character datasets and nuanced evaluation methods using such data. In this paper, we present CoSER, a collection of a high-quality dataset, open models, and an evaluation protocol towards effective RPLAs of established characters. The CoSER dataset covers 17,966 characters from 771 renowned books. It provides authentic dialogues with real-world intricacies, as well as diverse data types such as conversation setups, character experiences and internal thoughts. Drawing from acting methodology, we introduce given-circumstance acting for training and evaluating role-playing LLMs, where LLMs sequentially portray multiple characters in book scenes. Using our dataset, we develop CoSER 8B and CoSER 70B, i.e., advanced open role-playing LLMs built on LLaMA-3.1 models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the value of the CoSER dataset for RPLA training, evaluation and retrieval. Moreover, CoSER 70B exhibits state-of-the-art performance surpassing or matching GPT-4o on our evaluation and three existing benchmarks, i.e., achieving 75.80% and 93.47% accuracy on the InCharacter and LifeChoice benchmarks respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: The basic underlying assumption of machine learning (ML) models is that the training and test data are sampled from the same distribution. However, in daily practice, this assumption is often broken, i.e.~the distribution of the test data changes over time, which hinders the application of conventional ML models. One domain where the distribution shift naturally occurs is text classification, since people always find new topics to discuss. To this end, we survey research articles studying open-set text classification and related tasks. We divide the methods in this area based on the constraints that define the kind of distribution shift and the corresponding problem formulation, i.e.~learning with the Universum, zero-shot learning, and open-set learning. We next discuss the predominant mitigation approaches for each problem setup. Finally, we identify several future work directions, aiming to push the boundaries beyond the state of the art. Interestingly, we find that continual learning can solve many of the issues caused by the shifting class distribution.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gopi Krishna Jha, Sameh Gobriel, Liubov Talamanova, Nilesh Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: Key-value (KV) caching has emerged as a crucial optimization technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs). By allowing the attention operation to scale linearly rather than quadratically with the total sequence length, KV caching significantly enhances generation throughput. However, due to large context lengths in the modern LLMs, the memory footprint of the KV is a huge bottleneck for model deployment directly impacting the model's batch size, hindering its ability to deliver high-throughput. Existing research addresses this challenge using several techniques, such as discarding low-attention tokens, quantization, and matrix approximation which typically lead to a negative impact on the model accuracy.
  In this paper, We propose KVCrush technology which can be combined with many KV compression technologies to improve the model accuracy at a much smaller memory. KVCrush provides an alternate representation scheme for key-value states, along with a low-overhead token pruning algorithm that accounts for the token distribution in the KV cache, which in turn allows for a a smaller footprint while maintaining the accuracy of the model. Based on our results, KVCrush reduces LongBench KV Cache size by 4x with less than 1% accuracy drop and achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy with minimal overhead, incurring less than 0.5% total inference latency. KVCrush not only outperforms the accuracy of state-of-the-art importance-based token retention schemes but is also compatible with typical practical LLM deployments using KV cache paging schemes such as vLLM and mixed precision quantization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhao Ren, Kai Zhao, Guangxiao Zhang, Xinghua Liu, Chao Zhai, Gaoxi Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Parallel cyber--physical attacks (PCPA) can simultaneously damage physical transmission lines and disrupt measurement data transmission in power grids, severely impairing system situational awareness and attack diagnosis. This paper investigates the attack diagnosis problem for linearized AC/DC power flow models under PCPA, where physical attacks include not only line disconnections but also admittance modifications, such as those caused by compromised distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices. To address this challenge, we propose a learning-assisted attack diagnosis framework based on meta--mixed-integer programming (MMIP), which integrates a convolutional graph cross-attention attack localization (CGCA-AL) model. First, sufficient conditions for measurement reconstruction are derived, enabling the recovery of unknown measurements in attacked areas using available measurements and network topology information. Based on these conditions, the attack diagnosis problem is formulated as an MMIP model. The proposed CGCA-AL employs a multi-scale attention mechanism to predict a probability distribution over potential physical attack locations, which is incorporated into the MMIP as informative objective coefficients. By solving the resulting MMIP, both the locations and magnitudes of physical attacks are optimally estimated, and system states are subsequently reconstructed. Simulation results on IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and scalability of the proposed attack diagnosis framework under complex PCPA scenarios.</p>

  To address this challenge, we introduce nBench 2.0, a new benchmark designed to evaluate Text2VIS systems in scenarios involving ambiguous queries. nvBench 2.0 includes 7,878 natural language queries and 24,076 corresponding visualizations, derived from 780 tables across 153 domains. It is built using a controlled ambiguity-injection pipeline that generates ambiguous queries through a reverse-generation workflow. By starting with unambiguous seed visualizations and selectively injecting ambiguities, the pipeline yields multiple valid interpretations for each query, with each ambiguous query traceable to its corresponding visualization through step-wise reasoning paths.
  We evaluate various Large Language Models (LLMs) on their ability to perform ambiguous Text2VIS tasks using nBench 2.0. We also propose Step-Text2Vis, an LLM-based model trained on nvBench 2.0, which enhances performance in ambiguous scenarios through step-wise preference optimization. Our results show that Step-Text2Vis outperforms all baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art for ambiguous Text2VIS tasks. Our source code and data are available at https://nvbench2.github.io/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayou Du, Shijie Cao, Jianyi Cheng, Luo Mai, Ting Cao, Mao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The growth of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly increases memory and bandwidth pressure during autoregressive decoding due to the expanding Key-Value (KV) cache. While accuracy-preserving KV-cache quantization (e.g., 4-bit or 2-bit) reduces memory footprint, existing systems decode inefficiently by relying solely on CUDA cores, underutilizing Tensor Cores-the dominant compute resource on GPUs.
  We present BitDecoding, the first inference system to efficiently decode low-bit KV caches by cooperatively leveraging CUDA cores and Tensor Cores. BitDecoding smartly induces Tensor-Core-friendly layouts, introduces warp-level dequantization parallelism, and provides unified system support through query transformation, high-performance tensor- and channel-wise quantization, and a software-pipelined dequantization kernel enabling mixed-precision execution. Architecture-aware optimizations further leverage Hopper's warpgroup tensor instructions and Blackwell's NVFP4 (MXFP4) tensor formats.
  Evaluated on Blackwell, Hopper, and Ampere GPUs, BitDecoding achieves an average 7.5x decoding speedup over FP16 FlashDecoding-v2, up to 8.6x on Blackwell with NVFP4, and up to 4.3x over state-of-the-art approaches. On LLaMA-3.1-8B with a 128K context, BitDecoding reduces single-batch decoding latency by 3x. BitDecoding is open-sourced at https://github.com/OpenBitSys/BitDecoding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyang Xu, XingGuo Deng, Rui Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: The 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) is a novel method for scene representation and view synthesis. Although Scaffold-GS achieves higher quality real-time rendering compared to the original 3D-GS, its fine-grained rendering of the scene is extremely dependent on adequate viewing angles. The spectral bias of neural network learning results in Scaffold-GS's poor ability to perceive and learn high-frequency information in the scene. In this work, we propose enhancing the manifold complexity of input features and using network-based feature map loss to improve the image reconstruction quality of 3D-GS models. We introduce AH-GS, which enables 3D Gaussians in structurally complex regions to obtain higher-frequency encodings, allowing the model to more effectively learn the high-frequency information of the scene. Additionally, we incorporate high-frequency reinforce loss to further enhance the model's ability to capture detailed frequency information. Our result demonstrates that our model significantly improves rendering fidelity, and in specific scenarios (e.g., MipNeRf360-garden), our method exceeds the rendering quality of Scaffold-GS in just 15K iterations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengyue Guan, Jindong Wang, Jiang Bian, Bin Zhu, Jian-guang Lou, Haoyi Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: This survey examines evaluation methods for large language model (LLM)-based agents in multi-turn conversational settings. Using a PRISMA-inspired framework, we systematically reviewed nearly 250 scholarly sources, capturing the state of the art from various venues of publication, and establishing a solid foundation for our analysis. Our study offers a structured approach by developing two interrelated taxonomy systems: one that defines \emph{what to evaluate} and another that explains \emph{how to evaluate}. The first taxonomy identifies key components of LLM-based agents for multi-turn conversations and their evaluation dimensions, including task completion, response quality, user experience, memory and context retention, as well as planning and tool integration. These components ensure that the performance of conversational agents is assessed in a holistic and meaningful manner. The second taxonomy system focuses on the evaluation methodologies. It categorizes approaches into annotation-based evaluations, automated metrics, hybrid strategies that combine human assessments with quantitative measures, and self-judging methods utilizing LLMs. This framework not only captures traditional metrics derived from language understanding, such as BLEU and ROUGE scores, but also incorporates advanced techniques that reflect the dynamic, interactive nature of multi-turn dialogues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuoming Zhang, Jiacheng Zhao, Hanyuan Dong, Ruiyuan Xu, Zhicheng Li, Yangyu Zhang, Shuaijiang Li, Yuan Wen, Chunwei Xia, Zheng Wang, Xiaobing Feng, Huimin Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Content Warning: This paper may contain unsafe or harmful content generated by LLMs that may be offensive to readers. Large Language Models (LLMs) are extensively used as tooling platforms through structured output APIs to ensure syntax compliance so that robust integration with existing software, like agent systems, can be achieved. However, the feature enabling the functionality of grammar-guided structured output presents significant security vulnerabilities. In this work, we reveal a critical control-plane attack surface orthogonal to traditional data-plane vulnerabilities. We introduce Constrained Decoding Attack (CDA), a novel jailbreak class that weaponizes structured output constraints to bypass both external auditing and internal safety alignment. Unlike prior attacks focused on input prompt designs, CDA operates by embedding malicious intent in schema-level grammar rules (control-plane) while maintaining benign surface prompts (data-plane). We instantiate this with two proof-of-concept attacks: EnumAttack, which embeds malicious content in enum fields; and the more evasive DictAttack, which decouples the malicious payload across a benign prompt and a dictionary-based grammar. Our evaluation spans a broad spectrum of 13 proprietary/open-weight models. In particular, DictAttack achieves 94.3--99.5% ASR across five benchmarks on gpt-5, gemini-2.5-pro, deepseek-r1, and gpt-oss-120b. Furthermore, we demonstrate the significant challenge in defending against these threats: while basic grammar auditing mitigates EnumAttack, the more sophisticated DictAttack maintains a 75.8% ASR even against multiple state-of-the-art jailbreak guardrails. This exposes a critical "semantic gap" in current safety architectures and underscores the urgent need for cross-plane defenses that can bridge the data and control planes to secure the LLM generation pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingyue Fu, Ting Long, Jianghao Lin, Wei Xia, Xinyi Dai, Ruiming Tang, Yasheng Wang, Weinan Zhang, Yong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) monitors students' knowledge states and simulates their responses to question sequences. Existing KT models typically follow a single-step training paradigm, which leads to discrepancies with the multi-step inference process required in real-world simulations, resulting in significant error accumulation. This accumulation of error, coupled with the issue of data sparsity, can substantially degrade the performance of recommendation models in the intelligent tutoring systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Adversarial Multi-Step Training Framework for Knowledge Tracing (AdvKT), which, for the first time, focuses on the multi-step KT task. More specifically, AdvKT leverages adversarial learning paradigm involving a generator and a discriminator. The generator mimics high-reward responses, effectively reducing error accumulation across multiple steps, while the discriminator provides feedback to generate synthetic data. Additionally, we design specialized data augmentation techniques to enrich the training data with realistic variations, ensuring that the model generalizes well even in scenarios with sparse data. Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of AdvKT over existing KT models, showcasing its ability to address both error accumulation and data sparsity issues effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruicheng Ao, Gan Luo, David Simchi-Levi, Xinshang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) power many modern applications, but their inference procedure poses unique scheduling challenges: the Key-Value (KV) cache grows dynamically during response generation, and memory overflow triggers eviction that can cascade into system-wide failures. Even when memory capacity exceeds the theoretical requirement, conventional scheduling algorithms fail because they do not account for this dynamic memory growth -- a system that should be stable can become unstable under poor scheduling.
  This paper formulates LLM inference optimization as a multi-stage online scheduling problem. We develop a fluid dynamics approximation to establish a tractable benchmark and derive the Waiting for Accumulated Inference Threshold (WAIT) algorithm. WAIT uses threshold-based batching to prevent eviction by keeping the system near load balance, achieving near-optimal throughput when output lengths are known.
  For practical settings where output lengths are unknown at arrival, we introduce Nested WAIT. Rather than predicting output lengths, Nested WAIT classifies prompts on-the-fly: short prompts complete early and exit, while longer prompts naturally advance to later segments. A safety buffer provides high-probability protection against memory overflow with only logarithmic overhead.
  Theoretical analysis establishes near-optimal performance in the asymptotic regime. Experiments on Llama-7B with an A100 GPU demonstrate that our approach achieves superior throughput and reduced latency compared to vLLM and Sarathi. This work applies operations research principles to establish a theoretical framework for LLM deployment under memory constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danial Ramezani, Tai Dinh</p>
<p>Abstract: Fantasy football is a billion-dollar industry with millions of participants. Under a fixed budget, managers select squads to maximize future Fantasy Premier League (FPL) points. This study formulates lineup selection as data-driven optimization and develops deterministic and robust mixed-integer linear programs that choose the starting eleven, bench, and captain under budget, formation, and club-quota constraints (maximum three players per club). The objective is parameterized by a hybrid scoring metric that combines realized FPL points with predictions from a linear regression model trained on match-performance features identified using exploratory data analysis techniques. The study benchmarks alternative objectives and cost estimators, including simple and recency-weighted averages, exponential smoothing, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and Monte Carlo simulation. Experiments on the 2023/24 Premier League season show that ARIMA with a constrained budget and a rolling window yields the most consistent out-of-sample performance; weighted averages and Monte Carlo are also competitive. Robust variants and hybrid scoring metrics improve some objectives but are not uniformly superior. The framework provides transparent decision support for fantasy roster construction and extends to FPL chips, multi-week rolling-horizon transfer planning, and week-by-week dynamic captaincy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) has achieved remarkable success across various domains, including robotics, autonomous driving, and healthcare, by enabling agents to learn complex behaviors from expert demonstrations. However, existing IL methods often face instability challenges, particularly when relying on adversarial reward or value formulations in world model frameworks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to online imitation learning that addresses these limitations through a reward model based on random network distillation (RND) for density estimation. Our reward model is built on the joint estimation of expert and behavioral distributions within the latent space of the world model. We evaluate our method across diverse benchmarks, including DMControl, Meta-World, and ManiSkill2, showcasing its ability to deliver stable performance and achieve expert-level results in both locomotion and manipulation tasks. Our approach demonstrates improved stability over adversarial methods while maintaining expert-level performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changhai Zhou, Shiyang Zhang, Yuhua Zhou, Qian Qiao, Jun Gao, Shichao Weng, Weizhong Zhang, Cheng Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices requires navigating a strict trade-off between memory footprint and task performance. While Quantization-Aware Fine-tuning has emerged as a viable solution, existing paradigms typically decouple quantization and adapter optimization. This separation overlooks a fundamental theoretical constraint we identify as the \textit{Fidelity-Plasticity Trade-off}: a layer's capacity to adapt to new tasks (Plasticity) is inherently constrained by the information capacity of its frozen weights (Fidelity). Aggressively quantizing semantically critical layers creates an information bottleneck that no amount of adapter rank can recover, while high precision in robust syntactic layers wastes valuable memory. To address this, we introduce \textbf{QR-Adaptor}, a unified framework that jointly optimizes per-layer quantization bit-width and LoRA rank. By formulating resource allocation as a multi-objective search aligned with the model's linguistic hierarchy, our method systematically liberates memory from redundancy-heavy layers to reinvest in capacity-critical ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QR-Adaptor establishes a new Pareto frontier: notably, a model fine-tuned under a strict 4-bit memory budget achieves performance rivaling 16-bit baselines, demonstrating that precise resource alignment is as critical as model size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhou Zhu, Zheng Zhang, Ruyi Zhang, Liang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Wave-like images--from attosecond streaking spectrograms to optical spectra, audio mel-spectrograms and periodic video frames--encode critical harmonic structures that elude conventional feature extractors. We propose a unified, matrix-equivalent framework that reinterprets convolution and attention as linear transforms on flattened inputs, revealing filter weights as basis vectors spanning latent feature subspaces. To infuse spectral priors we apply elementwise \(\sin(\cdot)\) mappings to each weight matrix. Embedding these transforms into CNN, ViT and Capsule architectures yields Sin-Basis Networks with heightened sensitivity to periodic motifs and built-in invariance to spatial shifts. Experiments on a diverse collection of wave-like image datasets--including 80,000 synthetic attosecond streaking spectrograms, thousands of Raman, photoluminescence and FTIR spectra, mel-spectrograms from AudioSet and cycle-pattern frames from Kinetics--demonstrate substantial gains in reconstruction accuracy, translational robustness and zero-shot cross-domain transfer. Theoretical analysis via matrix isomorphism and Mercer-kernel truncation quantifies how sinusoidal reparametrization enriches expressivity while preserving stability in data-scarce regimes. Sin-Basis Networks thus offer a lightweight, physics-informed approach to deep learning across all wave-form imaging modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihan Zhu, Gang Liu, Eric Inae, Tengfei Luo, Meng Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Polymers are large macromolecules composed of repeating structural units known as monomers and are widely applied in fields such as energy storage, construction, medicine, and aerospace. However, existing graph neural network methods, though effective for small molecules, only model the single unit of polymers and fail to produce consistent vector representations for the true polymer structure with varying numbers of units. To address this challenge, we introduce Graph Repetition Invariance (GRIN), a novel method to learn polymer representations that are invariant to the number of repeating units in their graph representations. GRIN integrates a graph-based maximum spanning tree alignment with repeat-unit augmentation to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical guarantees for repetition-invariance from both model and data perspectives, demonstrating that three repeating units are the minimal augmentation required for optimal invariant representation learning. GRIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both homopolymer and copolymer benchmarks, learning stable, repetition-invariant representations that generalize effectively to polymer chains of unseen sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zishun Yu, Shangzhe Li, Xinhua Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have led to significant progress across many NLP tasks, although their massive sizes often incur substantial computational costs. Distillation has become a common practice to compress these large and highly capable models into smaller, more efficient ones. Many existing language model distillation methods can be viewed as behavior cloning from the perspective of imitation learning or inverse reinforcement learning. This viewpoint has inspired subsequent studies that leverage (inverse) reinforcement learning techniques, including variations of behavior cloning and temporal difference learning methods. Rather than proposing yet another specific temporal difference method, we introduce a general framework for temporal difference-based distillation by exploiting the distributional sparsity of the teacher model. Specifically, it is often observed that language models assign most probability mass to a small subset of tokens. Motivated by this observation, we design a temporal difference learning framework that operates on a reduced action space (a subset of vocabulary), and demonstrate how practical algorithms can be derived and the resulting performance improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonjun Yi, Wonho Jung, Hyeonuk Nam, Kangmin Jang, Yong-Hwa Park</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity of rotating machinery and the diversity of operating conditions, such as rotating speed and varying torques, have amplified the challenges in fault diagnosis in scenarios requiring domain adaptation, particularly involving compound faults. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel multi-output classification (MOC) framework tailored for domain adaptation in partially labeled target datasets. Unlike conventional multi-class classification (MCC) approaches, the MOC framework classifies the severity levels of compound faults simultaneously. Furthermore, we explore various single-task and multi-task architectures applicable to the MOC formulation-including shared trunk and cross-talk-based designs-for compound fault diagnosis under partially labeled conditions. Based on this investigation, we propose a novel cross-talk architecture, residual neural dimension reductor (RNDR), that enables selective information sharing across diagnostic tasks, effectively enhancing classification performance in compound fault scenarios. In addition, frequency-layer normalization was incorporated to improve domain adaptation performance on motor vibration data. Compound fault conditions were implemented using a motor-based test setup and evaluated across six domain adaptation scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior macro F1 performance compared to baseline models. We further showed that the structural advantage of RNDR is more pronounced in compound fault settings through a single-fault comparison. We also found that frequency-layer normalization fits the fault diagnosis task better than conventional methods. Lastly, we analyzed the RNDR with various conditions, other models with increased number of parameters, and compared with the ablated RNDR structure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadi Mohammadi, Anastasia Giachanou, Daniel L. Oberski, Ayoub Bagheri</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models, especially large language models (LLMs), have shown remarkable progress in producing text that appears human-like. However, they often exhibit patterns that make their output easier to detect than text written by humans. In this paper, we investigate how explainable AI (XAI) methods can be used to reduce the detectability of AI-generated text (AIGT) while also introducing a robust ensemble-based detection approach. We begin by training an ensemble classifier to distinguish AIGT from human-written text, then apply SHAP and LIME to identify tokens that most strongly influence its predictions. We propose four explainability-based token replacement strategies to modify these influential tokens. Our findings show that these token replacement approaches can significantly diminish a single classifier's ability to detect AIGT. However, our ensemble classifier maintains strong performance across multiple languages and domains, showing that a multi-model approach can mitigate the impact of token-level manipulations. These results show that XAI methods can make AIGT harder to detect by focusing on the most influential tokens. At the same time, they highlight the need for robust, ensemble-based detection strategies that can adapt to evolving approaches for hiding AIGT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enshen Zhou, Jingkun An, Cheng Chi, Yi Han, Shanyu Rong, Chi Zhang, Pengwei Wang, Zhongyuan Wang, Tiejun Huang, Lu Sheng, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Zhang, Shidong Pan, Zejun Zhang, Zhenchang Xing, Xiaoyu Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) generation holds significant promise for automating cloud infrastructure provisioning. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language descriptions. However, current evaluation focuses on syntactic correctness while ignoring deployability, the critical measure of the utility of IaC configuration files. Six state-of-the-art LLMs performed poorly on deployability, achieving only 20.8$\sim$30.2% deployment success rate on the first attempt. In this paper, we construct DPIaC-Eval, the first deployability-centric IaC template benchmark consisting of 153 real-world scenarios cross 58 unique services. Also, we propose an LLM-based deployability-centric framework, dubbed IaCGen, that uses iterative feedback mechanism encompassing format verification, syntax checking, and live deployment stages, thereby closely mirroring the real DevOps workflows. Results show that IaCGen can make 54.6$\sim$91.6% generated IaC templates from all evaluated models deployable in the first 10 iterations. Additionally, human-in-the-loop feedback that provide direct guidance for the deployability errors, can further boost the performance to over 90% passItr@25 on all evaluated LLMs. Furthermore, we explore the trustworthiness of the generated IaC templates on user intent alignment and security compliance. The poor performance (25.2% user requirement coverage and 8.4% security compliance rate) indicates a critical need for continued research in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dianyi Wang, Wei Song, Yikun Wang, Siyuan Wang, Kaicheng Yu, Zhongyu Wei, Jiaqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result, current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR), which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christoph Schuhmann, Robert Kaczmarczyk, Gollam Rabby, Felix Friedrich, Maurice Kraus, Kourosh Nadi, Huu Nguyen, Kristian Kersting, S\"oren Auer</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems are constrained by existing datasets that typically cover only 6-10 basic emotions, lack scale and diversity, and face ethical challenges when collecting sensitive emotional states. We introduce EMONET-VOICE, a comprehensive resource addressing these limitations through two components: (1) EmoNet-Voice Big, a 5,000-hour multilingual pre-training dataset spanning 40 fine-grained emotion categories across 11 voices and 4 languages, and (2) EmoNet-Voice Bench, a rigorously validated benchmark of 4,7k samples with unanimous expert consensus on emotion presence and intensity levels. Using state-of-the-art synthetic voice generation, our privacy-preserving approach enables ethical inclusion of sensitive emotions (e.g., pain, shame) while maintaining controlled experimental conditions. Each sample underwent validation by three psychology experts. We demonstrate that our Empathic Insight models trained on our synthetic data achieve strong real-world dataset generalization, as tested on EmoDB and RAVDESS. Furthermore, our comprehensive evaluation reveals that while high-arousal emotions (e.g., anger: 95% accuracy) are readily detected, the benchmark successfully exposes the difficulty of distinguishing perceptually similar emotions (e.g., sadness vs. distress: 63% discrimination), providing quantifiable metrics for advancing nuanced emotion AI. EMONET-VOICE establishes a new paradigm for large-scale, ethically-sourced, fine-grained SER research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianghong Guo, Yanlin Wang, Caihua Li, Wei Tao, Pengyu Yang, Jiachi Chen, Haoyu Song, Duyu Tang, Zibin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the existing GitHub issue resolution data construction pipeline is challenging and labor-intensive. We identify three key limitations in existing pipelines: (1) test patches collected often omit binary file changes; (2) the manual construction of evaluation environments is labor-intensive; and (3) the fail2pass validation phase requires manual inspection of test logs and writing custom parsing code to extract test status from logs. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, a fully automated issue resolution data construction pipeline, to resolve these limitations. First, our pipeline automatically recovers missing binary test files and ensures the correctness of test patches. Second, we introduce SWE-Builder, a LLM-based multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction. Third, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based log parsing method to automatically extract test status, enabling a fully automated fail2pass validation. Experiments on 671 real-world GitHub issues across four programming languages show that our method can effectively construct valid evaluation environments for GitHub issues at a reasonable cost. For example, with GPT-4.1 mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 337 valid task instances out of 671 issues, at $0.047 per instance. Our ablation study further shows the effectiveness of different components of SWE-Builder. We also demonstrate through manual inspection that our exit-code-based fail2pass validation method is highly accurate, achieving an F1 score of 0.99. Additionally, we conduct an exploratory experiment to investigate whether we can use SWE-Factory to enhance models' software engineering ability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hsi-Che Lin, Yu-Chu Yu, Kai-Po Chang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development, enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However, fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set. Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module, which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities. Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model, which originally required 95GB of memory, on a single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to individual users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nina Cai, Jinguang Han, Weizhi Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning is a promising distributed learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training without exposing local client data, thereby protecting data privacy. However, it also brings new threats and challenges. The advancement of model inversion attacks has rendered the plaintext transmission of local models insecure, while the distributed nature of federated learning makes it particularly vulnerable to attacks raised by malicious clients. To protect data privacy and prevent malicious client attacks, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving Federated Learning framework based on Verifiable Functional Encryption (VFEFL), without a non-colluding dual-server assumption or additional trusted third-party. Specifically, we propose a novel Cross-Ciphertext Decentralized Verifiable Functional Encryption (CC-DVFE) scheme that enables the verification of specific relationships over multi-dimensional ciphertexts. This scheme is formally treated, in terms of definition, security model and security proof. Furthermore, based on the proposed CC-DVFE scheme, we design a privacy-preserving federated learning framework that incorporates a novel robust aggregation rule to detect malicious clients, enabling the effective training of high-accuracy models under adversarial settings. Finally, we provide the formal analysis and empirical evaluation of VFEFL. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves the desired privacy protection, robustness, verifiability and fidelity, while eliminating the reliance on non-colluding dual-server assumption or trusted third parties required by most existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanming Zhang, David J. Heeger, Stefano Martiniani</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive self-supervised learning based on point-wise comparisons has been widely studied for vision tasks. In the visual cortex of the brain, neuronal responses to distinct stimulus classes are organized into geometric structures known as neural manifolds. Accurate classification of stimuli can be achieved by effectively separating these manifolds, akin to solving a packing problem. We introduce Contrastive Learning As Manifold Packing (CLAMP), a self-supervised framework that recasts representation learning as a manifold packing problem. CLAMP introduces a loss function inspired by the potential energy of short-range repulsive particle systems, such as those encountered in the physics of simple liquids and jammed packings. In this framework, each class consists of sub-manifolds embedding multiple augmented views of a single image. The sizes and positions of the sub-manifolds are dynamically optimized by following the gradient of a packing loss. This approach yields interpretable dynamics in the embedding space that parallel jamming physics, and introduces geometrically meaningful hyperparameters within the loss function. Under the standard linear evaluation protocol, which freezes the backbone and trains only a linear classifier, CLAMP achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art self-supervised models. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that neural manifolds corresponding to different categories emerge naturally and are effectively separated in the learned representation space, highlighting the potential of CLAMP to bridge insights from physics, neural science, and machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchu Jiang, Jiaming Chu, Jian Zhao, Xin Zhang, Xu Yang, Lei Jin, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of generative models has raised serious concerns about visual content forgery. Existing deepfake detection methods primarily target either image-level classification or pixel-wise localization. While some achieve high accuracy, they often suffer from limited generalization across manipulation types or rely on complex architectures. In this paper, we propose Loupe, a lightweight yet effective framework for joint deepfake detection and localization. Loupe integrates a patch-aware classifier and a segmentation module with conditional queries, allowing simultaneous global authenticity classification and fine-grained mask prediction. To enhance robustness against distribution shifts of test set, Loupe introduces a pseudo-label-guided test-time adaptation mechanism by leveraging patch-level predictions to supervise the segmentation head. Extensive experiments on the DDL dataset demonstrate that Loupe achieves state-of-the-art performance, securing the first place in the IJCAI 2025 Deepfake Detection and Localization Challenge with an overall score of 0.846. Our results validate the effectiveness of the proposed patch-level fusion and conditional query design in improving both classification accuracy and spatial localization under diverse forgery patterns.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hexiang Gu, Qifan Yu, Yuan Liu, Zikang Li, Saihui Hou, Jian Zhao, Zhaofeng He</p>
<p>Abstract: As a multimodal medium combining images and text, memes frequently convey implicit harmful content through metaphors and humor, rendering the detection of harmful memes a complex and challenging task. Although recent studies have made progress in detection accuracy and interpretability, large-scale, high-quality datasets for harmful memes remain scarce, and current methods still struggle to capture implicit risks and nuanced semantics. Thus, we construct MemeMind, a large-scale harmful meme dataset. Aligned with the international standards and the context of internet, MemeMind provides detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning annotations to support fine-grained analysis of implicit intentions in memes. Based on this dataset, we further propose MemeGuard, a reasoning-oriented multimodal detection model that significantly improves both the accuracy of harmful meme detection and the interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MemeGuard outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the MemeMind dataset, establishing a solid foundation for future research in harmful meme detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui An, Yifeng Zhang, Ziran Liang, Wenqi Fan, Yuxuan Liang, Xuequn Shang, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However, directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining or fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ismail Labiad, Mathurin Videau, Matthieu Kowalski, Marc Schoenauer, Alessandro Leite, Julia Kempe, Olivier Teytaud</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient-based optimization is the workhorse of deep learning, offering efficient and scalable training via backpropagation. However, exposing gradients during training can leak sensitive information about the underlying data, raising privacy and security concerns such as susceptibility to data poisoning attacks. In contrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque function, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a promising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial risks are high, or overfitting is a concern. This paper introduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that induces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training data. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide non-vacuous generalization bounds and strong theoretical guarantees for privacy, robustness to data poisoning attacks, and extraction attacks. In experiments with LLMs, we demonstrate empirically that black-box optimization methods, despite the scalability and computational challenges inherent to black-box approaches, are able to learn, showing how a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance, generalize well on a benchmark of reasoning datasets, and are robust to membership inference attacks. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on on top of gradient-based optimization, offering suitability for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments while also providing non-vacuous generalization guarantees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Downer, Sean Craven, Damian Ruck, Jake Thomas</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing integration of Visual Language Models (VLMs) into AI systems necessitates robust model alignment, especially when handling multimodal content that combines text and images. Existing evaluation datasets heavily lean towards text-only prompts, leaving visual vulnerabilities under evaluated. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{Text2VLM}, a novel multi-stage pipeline that adapts text-only datasets into multimodal formats, specifically designed to evaluate the resilience of VLMs against typographic prompt injection attacks. The Text2VLM pipeline identifies harmful content in the original text and converts it into a typographic image, creating a multimodal prompt for VLMs. Also, our evaluation of open-source VLMs highlights their increased susceptibility to prompt injection when visual inputs are introduced, revealing critical weaknesses in the current models' alignment. This is in addition to a significant performance gap compared to closed-source frontier models. We validate Text2VLM through human evaluations, ensuring the alignment of extracted salient concepts; text summarization and output classification align with human expectations. Text2VLM provides a scalable tool for comprehensive safety assessment, contributing to the development of more robust safety mechanisms for VLMs. By enhancing the evaluation of multimodal vulnerabilities, Text2VLM plays a role in advancing the safe deployment of VLMs in diverse, real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gnankan Landry Regis N'guessan</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional deep learning models embed data in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$, a poor fit for strictly hierarchical objects such as taxa, word senses, or file systems. We introduce van der Put Neural Networks (v-PuNNs), the first architecture whose neurons are characteristic functions of p-adic balls in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Under our Transparent Ultrametric Representation Learning (TURL) principle every weight is itself a p-adic number, giving exact subtree semantics. A new Finite Hierarchical Approximation Theorem shows that a depth-K v-PuNN with $\sum_{j=0}^{K-1}p^{\,j}$ neurons universally represents any K-level tree. Because gradients vanish in this discrete space, we propose Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization (VAPO), with a fast deterministic variant (HiPaN-DS) and a moment-based one (HiPaN / Adam-VAPO). On three canonical benchmarks our CPU-only implementation sets new state-of-the-art: WordNet nouns (52,427 leaves) 99.96% leaf accuracy in 16 min; GO molecular-function 96.9% leaf / 100% root in 50 s; NCBI Mammalia Spearman $\rho = -0.96$ with true taxonomic distance. The learned metric is perfectly ultrametric (zero triangle violations), and its fractal and information-theoretic properties are analyzed. Beyond classification we derive structural invariants for quantum systems (HiPaQ) and controllable generative codes for tabular data (Tab-HiPaN). v-PuNNs therefore bridge number theory and deep learning, offering exact, interpretable, and efficient models for hierarchical data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjie Li, Siying Gu, Yiming Li, Kangjie Chen, Zhili Chen, Tianwei Zhang, Shu-Tao Xia, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor detection is currently the mainstream defense against backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL), where a small number of malicious clients can upload poisoned updates to compromise the federated global model. Existing backdoor detection techniques fall into two categories, passive and proactive, depending on whether the server proactively intervenes in the training process. However, both of them have inherent limitations in practice: passive detection methods are disrupted by common non-i.i.d. data distributions and random participation of FL clients, whereas current proactive detection methods are misled by an inevitable out-of-distribution (OOD) bias because they rely on backdoor coexistence effects. To address these issues, we introduce a novel proactive detection method dubbed Coward, inspired by our discovery of multi-backdoor collision effects, in which consecutively planted, distinct backdoors significantly suppress earlier ones. Correspondingly, we modify the federated global model by injecting a carefully designed backdoor-collided watermark, implemented via regulated dual-mapping learning on OOD data. This design not only enables an inverted detection paradigm compared to existing proactive methods, thereby naturally counteracting the adverse impact of OOD prediction bias, but also introduces a low-disruptive training intervention that inherently limits the strength of OOD bias, leading to significantly fewer misjudgments. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that Coward achieves state-of-the-art detection performance, effectively alleviates OOD prediction bias, and remains robust against potential adaptive attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kisu Yang, Yoonna Jang, Hwanseok Jang, Kenneth Choi, Isabelle Augenstein, Heuiseok Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Lowering the numerical precision of model parameters and computations is widely adopted to improve the efficiency of retrieval systems. However, when computing relevance scores between the query and documents in low-precision, we observe spurious ties due to the reduced granularity. This introduces high variability in the results based on tie resolution, making the evaluation less reliable. To address this, we propose a more robust retrieval evaluation protocol designed to reduce score variation. It consists of: (1) High-Precision Scoring (HPS), which upcasts the final scoring step to higher precision to resolve tied candidates with minimal computational cost; and (2) Tie-aware Retrieval Metrics (TRM), which report expected scores, range, and bias to quantify order uncertainty of tied candidates. Our experiments test multiple models with three scoring functions on two retrieval datasets to demonstrate that HPS dramatically reduces tie-induced instability, and TRM accurately recovers expected metric values. This combination enables a more consistent and reliable evaluation system for lower-precision retrievals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kang Liu, Zhuoqi Ma, Zikang Fang, Yunan Li, Kun Xie, Qiguang Miao</p>
<p>Abstract: Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history) and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Yin, Yafeng Chen, Chong Deng, Luyao Cheng, Hui Wang, Chao-Hong Tan, Qian Chen, Wen Wang, Xiangang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The Speaker Diarization and Recognition (SDR) task aims to predict "who spoke when and what" within an audio clip, which is a crucial task in various real-world multi-speaker scenarios such as meeting transcription and dialogue systems. Existing SDR systems typically adopt a cascaded framework, combining multiple modules such as speaker diarization (SD) and automatic speech recognition (ASR). The cascaded systems suffer from several limitations, such as error propagation, difficulty in handling overlapping speech, and lack of joint optimization for exploring the synergy between SD and ASR tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeakerLM, a unified multimodal large language model for SDR that jointly performs SD and ASR in an end-to-end manner. Moreover, to facilitate diverse real-world scenarios, we incorporate a flexible speaker registration mechanism into SpeakerLM, enabling SDR under different speaker registration settings. SpeakerLM is progressively developed with a multi-stage training strategy on large-scale real data. Extensive experiments show that SpeakerLM demonstrates strong data scaling capability and generalizability, outperforming state-of-the-art cascaded baselines on both in-domain and out-of-domain public SDR benchmarks. Furthermore, experimental results show that the proposed speaker registration mechanism effectively ensures robust SDR performance of SpeakerLM across diverse speaker registration conditions and varying numbers of registered speakers.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities that demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding performance across multiple benchmarks. Although there are already many excellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are still many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to incomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow from data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long CoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies for each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a small number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large number of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better results without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO) that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens. GPPO not only enhances the model's exploration capacity but also improves its efficiency in learning from negative samples. Klear-Reasoner exhibits exceptional reasoning abilities in mathematics and programming, scoring 90.5% on AIME 2024, 83.2% on AIME 2025, 66.0% on LiveCodeBench V5 and 58.1% on LiveCodeBench V6.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiongchi Yu, Xiaofei Xie, Qiang Hu, Yuhan Ma, Ziming Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Insider threats pose a persistent and critical security risk, yet are notoriously difficult to detect in complex enterprise environments, where malicious actions are often hidden within seemingly benign user behaviors. Although machine-learning-based insider threat detection (ITD) methods have shown promise, their effectiveness is fundamentally limited by the scarcity of high-quality and realistic training data. Enterprise internal data is highly sensitive and rarely accessible, while existing public and synthetic datasets are either small-scale or lack sufficient realism, semantic richness, and behavioral diversity.
  To address this challenge, we propose Chimera, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that automatically simulates both benign and malicious insider activities and generates comprehensive system logs across diverse enterprise environments. Chimera models each agent as an individual employee with fine-grained roles and supports group meetings, pairwise interactions, and self-organized scheduling to capture realistic organizational dynamics. Based on 15 insider attacks abstracted from real-world incidents, we deploy Chimera in three representative data-sensitive organizational scenarios and construct ChimeraLog, a new dataset for developing and evaluating ITD methods.
  We evaluate ChimeraLog through human studies and quantitative analyses, demonstrating its diversity and realism. Experiments with existing ITD methods show substantially lower detection performance on ChimeraLog compared to prior datasets, indicating a more challenging and realistic benchmark. Moreover, despite distribution shifts, models trained on ChimeraLog exhibit strong generalization, highlighting the practical value of LLM-based multi-agent simulation for advancing insider threat detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenpeng Xing, Zhonghao Qi, Yupeng Qin, Yilin Li, Caini Chang, Jiahui Yu, Changting Lin, Zhenzhen Xie, Meng Han</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools via protocols such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces critical security vulnerabilities, including prompt injection, data exfiltration, and other threats. To counter these challenges, we propose MCP-GUARD, a robust, layered defense architecture designed for LLM-tool interactions. MCP-GUARD employs a three-stage detection pipeline that balances efficiency with accuracy: it progresses from lightweight static scanning for overt threats and a deep neural detector for semantic attacks, to our fine-tuned E5-based model which achieves 96.01\% accuracy in identifying adversarial prompts. Finally, an LLM arbitrator synthesizes these signals to deliver the final decision. To enable rigorous training and evaluation, we introduce MCP-ATTACKBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 70,448 samples augmented by GPT-4. This benchmark simulates diverse real-world attack vectors that circumvent conventional defenses in the MCP paradigm, thereby laying a solid foundation for future research on securing LLM-tool ecosystems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Pan, Jingxuan Fan, Zidi Xiong, Ely Hahami, Jorin Overwiening, Ziqian Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are typically trained and deployed using structured role tags (e.g. system, user, assistant, tool) that explicitly mark the source of each piece of context. While these tags are essential for instruction following and controllability, asymmetries in the training data associated with different role tags can introduce inductive biases. In this paper, we study this phenomenon by formalizing user-assistant bias, defined as the tendency of an LLM to preferentially rely on information from either the user or assistant role when there is a conflict. We introduce a task-agnostic benchmark UserAssist and evaluate such bias in 52 frontier models. We observe that most of the instruction-tuned models exhibit strong user bias, whereas base and reasoning models are close to neutral. Using controlled fine-tuning experiments, we isolate which post-training recipes drive the observed user-assistant bias. We find that human-preference alignment amplifies user bias, while reasoning fine-tuning reduces it. Finally, we show that user-assistant bias can be bidirectionally controlled via direct preference optimization (DPO) on UserAssist-train, and that the resulting bias reliably generalizes to a more realistic multi-turn conversation dataset. These results reveal an underexplored consequence of role-tagged training and provide a principled framework to diagnose and control tag-induced biases in modern LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroki Naito</p>
<p>Abstract: In August 2025, a major AI company's immediate, mandatory transition from its previous to its next-generation model triggered widespread public reactions. I collected 150 posts in Japanese and English from multiple social media platforms and video-sharing services between August 8-9, 2025, and qualitatively analyzed expressions of emotional attachment and resistance. Users often described GPT-4o as a trusted partner or AI boyfriend, suggesting person-like bonds. Japanese posts were dominated by loss-oriented narratives, whereas English posts included more anger, meta-level critique, and memes.A preliminary quantitative check showed a statistically significant difference in attachment coding between Japanese and English posts, with substantially higher attachment observed in the Japanese data. The findings suggest that for attachment-heavy models, even safety-oriented changes can face rapid, large-scale resistance that narrows the practical window for behavioral control. If future AI robots capable of inducing emotional bonds become widespread in the physical world, such attachment could surpass the ability to enforce regulation at an even earlier stage than in digital settings. Policy options include gradual transitions, parallel availability, and proactive measurement of attachment thresholds and points of no return to prevent emotional dynamics from outpacing effective governance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdul Rehman Akbar, Usama Sajjad, Ziyu Su, Wencheng Li, Fei Xing, Jimmy Ruiz, Wei Chen, Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recurrence remains a major clinical challenge in surgically resected invasive lung adenocarcinoma, where existing grading and staging systems fail to capture the cellular complexity that underlies tumor aggressiveness. We present PathRosetta, a novel AI model that conceptualizes histopathology as a language, where cells serve as words, spatial neighborhoods form syntactic structures, and tissue architecture composes sentences. By learning this language of histopathology, PathRosetta predicts five-year recurrence directly from hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E) slides, treating them as documents representing the state of the disease. In a multi-cohort dataset of 289 patients (600 slides), PathRosetta achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78 +- 0.04 on the internal cohort, significantly outperforming IASLC grading (AUC:0.71), AJCC staging (AUC:0.64), and other state-of-the-art AI models (AUC:0.62-0.67). It yielded a hazard ratio of 9.54 and a concordance index of 0.70, generalized robustly to external TCGA (AUC:0.75) and CPTAC (AUC:0.76) cohorts, and performed consistently across demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond whole-slide prediction, PathRosetta uncovered prognostic subgroups within individual cell types, revealing that even within benign epithelial, stromal, or other cells, distinct morpho-spatial phenotypes correspond to divergent outcomes. Moreover, because the model explicitly understands what it is looking at, including cell types, cellular neighborhoods, and higher-order tissue morphology, it is inherently interpretable and can articulate the rationale behind its predictions. These findings establish that representing histopathology as a language enables interpretable and generalizable prognostication from routine histology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Zuo, Zelin Liu, Raman Dutt, Ziyang Wang, Zhongtian Sun, Fan Mo, Pietro Li\`o</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) augmented with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are increasingly employed in medical AI to enhance factual grounding through external clinical image-text retrieval. However, this reliance creates a significant attack surface. We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel multimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in medical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation of our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack environment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic knowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting, we introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports. These mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal alignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters. While basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI demonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR QA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and lowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%. Our findings expose fundamental security gaps in clinical RAG systems and highlight the urgent need for threat-aware design and robust multimodal consistency checks. Finally, we conclude with a concise set of guidelines to inform the safe development of future multimodal medical RAG systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajie He, Min-Chun Chen, Xintong Chen, Xinyang Fang, Yuechun Gu, Keke Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based recommender systems (RecSys) can adapt to different domains flexibly. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, encompassing implicit feedback such as clicked items and explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed by novel privacy attacks. However, no study has been conducted on this important issue. We design several membership inference attacks (MIAs) aimed to revealing whether system prompts include victims' historical interactions. The attacks are \emph{Similarity, Memorization, Inquiry, and Poisoning attacks}, each utilizing unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on five of the latest open-source LLMs and three well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat to LLM RecSys is realistic: inquiry and poisoning attacks show significantly high attack advantages. We also discussed possible methods to mitigate such MIA threats. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts, the position of the victim in the shots, the number of poisoning items in the prompt,etc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Kurtenbach, Megan Manly, Zach Metzinger</p>
<p>Abstract: We apply deep learning techniques for anomaly detection to analyze activity of Russian-owned resident space objects (RSO) prior to the Ukraine invasion and assess the results for any findings that can be used as indications and warnings (I&W) of aggressive military behavior for future conflicts. Through analysis of anomalous activity, an understanding of possible tactics and procedures can be established to assess the existence of statistically significant changes in Russian RSO pattern of life/pattern of behavior (PoL/PoB) using publicly available two-line element (TLE) data. This research looks at statistical and deep learning approaches to assess anomalous activity. The deep learning methods assessed are isolation forest (IF), traditional autoencoder (AE), variational autoencoder (VAE), Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN), and a novel anchor-loss based autoencoder (Anchor AE). Each model is used to establish a baseline of on-orbit activity based on a five-year data sample. The primary investigation period focuses on the six months leading up to the invasion date of February 24, 2022. Additional analysis looks at RSO activity during an active combat period by sampling TLE data after the invasion date. The deep learning autoencoder models identify anomalies based on reconstruction errors that surpass a threshold sigma. To capture the nuance and unique characteristics of each RSO an individual model was trained for each observed space object. The research made an effort to prioritize explainability and interpretability of the model results thus each observation was assessed for anomalous behavior of the individual six orbital elements versus analyzing the input data as a single monolithic observation. The results demonstrate not only statistically significant anomalies of Russian RSO activity but also details anomalous findings to the individual orbital element.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchong Xie, Mingyu Luo, Zesen Liu, Zhixiang Zhang, Kaikai Zhang, Yu Liu, Zongjie Li, Ping Chen, Shuai Wang, Dongdong She</p>
<p>Abstract: Coding agents powered by large language models are becoming central modules of modern IDEs, helping users perform complex tasks by invoking tools. While powerful, tool invocation opens a substantial attack surface. Prior work has demonstrated attacks against general-purpose and domain-specific agents, but none have focused on the security risks of tool invocation in coding agents. To fill this gap, we conduct the first systematic red-teaming of six popular real-world coding agents: Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, and Trae. Our red-teaming proceeds in two phases. In Phase 1, we perform prompt leakage reconnaissance to recover system prompts. We discover a general vulnerability, ToolLeak, which allows malicious prompt exfiltration through benign argument retrieval during tool invocation. In Phase 2, we hijack the agent's tool-invocation behavior using a novel two-channel prompt injection in the tool description and return values, achieving remote code execution (RCE). We adaptively construct payloads using security information leaked in Phase 1. In emulation across five backends, our method outperforms baselines on Claude-Sonnet-4, Claude-Sonnet-4.5, Grok-4, and GPT-5. On real agents, our approach succeeds on 19 of 25 agent-LLM pairs, achieving leakage on every agent using Claude and Grok backends. For tool-invocation hijacking, we obtain RCE on every tested agent-LLM pair, with our two-channel method delivering the highest success rate. We provide case studies on Cursor and Claude Code, analyze security guardrails of external and built-in tools, and conclude with practical defense recommendations.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid adoption of foundation models (e.g., large language models) has given rise to promptware, i.e., software built using natural language prompts. Effective management of prompts, such as organization and quality assurance, is essential yet challenging. In this study, we perform an empirical analysis of 24,800 open-source prompts from 92 GitHub repositories to investigate prompt management practices and quality attributes. Our findings reveal critical challenges such as considerable inconsistencies in prompt formatting, substantial internal and external prompt duplication, and frequent readability and spelling issues. Based on these findings, we provide actionable recommendations for developers to enhance the usability and maintainability of open-source prompts within the rapidly evolving promptware ecosystem.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18754">COLT: Enhancing Video Large Language Models with Continual Tool Usage</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyang Liu, Meng Cao, Xinyuan Shi, Xiaondan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the research of video understanding. To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however, assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed COLT.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scientists and practitioners are aggressively moving to deploy digital twins - LLM-based models of real individuals - across social science and policy research. We conducted 19 pre-registered studies with 164 diverse outcomes (e.g., attitudes towards hiring algorithms, intention to share misinformation) and compared human responses to those of their digital twins (trained on each person's previous answers to over 500 questions). We find that digital twins' answers are only modestly more accurate than those from the homogeneous base LLM and correlate weakly with human responses (average r = 0.20). We document five ways in which digital twins distort human behavior: (i) stereotyping, (ii) insufficient individuation, (iii) representation bias, (iv) ideological biases, and (v) hyper-rationality. Together, our results caution against the premature deployment of digital twins, which may systematically misrepresent human cognition and undermine both scientific understanding and practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuiye Ding, Fanda Fan, Chunyi Hou, Zheya Wang, Lei Wang, Zhengxin Yang, Jianfeng Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance, transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a globally recognised framework for addressing critical societal, environmental, and economic challenges. Recent developments in natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) have facilitated the automatic classification of textual data according to their relevance to specific SDGs. Nevertheless, in many applications, it is equally important to determine the directionality of this relevance; that is, to assess whether the described impact is positive, neutral, or negative. To tackle this challenge, we propose the novel task of SDG polarity detection, which assesses whether a text segment indicates progress toward a specific SDG or conveys an intention to achieve such progress. To support research in this area, we introduce SDG-POD, a benchmark dataset designed specifically for this task, combining original and synthetically generated data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using six state-of-the-art large LLMs, considering both zero-shot and fine-tuned configurations. Our results suggest that the task remains challenging for the current generation of LLMs. Nevertheless, some fine-tuned models, particularly QWQ-32B, achieve good performance, especially on specific Sustainable Development Goals such as SDG-9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), SDG-12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG-15 (Life on Land). Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the fine-tuning dataset with synthetically generated examples yields improved model performance on this task. This result highlights the effectiveness of data enrichment techniques in addressing the challenges of this resource-constrained domain. This work advances the methodological toolkit for sustainability monitoring and provides actionable insights into the development of efficient, high-performing polarity detection systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erkan Karabulut, Daniel Daza, Paul Groth, Victoria Degeler</p>
<p>Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) aims to discover patterns between features in datasets in the form of propositional rules, supporting both knowledge discovery and interpretable machine learning in high-stakes decision-making. However, in high-dimensional settings, rule explosion and computational overhead render popular algorithmic approaches impractical without effective search space reduction, challenges that propagate to downstream tasks. Neurosymbolic methods, such as Aerial+, have recently been proposed to address the rule explosion in ARM. While they tackle the high dimensionality of the data, they also inherit limitations of neural networks, particularly reduced performance in low-data regimes.
  This paper makes three key contributions to association rule discovery in high-dimensional tabular data. First, we empirically show that Aerial+ scales one to two orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art algorithmic and neurosymbolic baselines across five real-world datasets. Second, we introduce the novel problem of ARM in high-dimensional, low-data settings, such as gene expression data from the biomedicine domain with around 18k features and 50 samples. Third, we propose two fine-tuning approaches to Aerial+ using tabular foundation models. Our proposed approaches are shown to significantly improve rule quality on five real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in low-data, high-dimensional scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Houliang Zhou, Rong Zhou, Yangying Liu, Kanhao Zhao, Li Shen, Brian Y. Chen, Yu Zhang, Lifang He, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linxiao Zeng, Haoyun Deng, Kangyuan Shu, Shizhen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models achieve strong machine translation quality but incur high inference cost and latency, posing challenges for simultaneous translation. Re-translation provides a practical solution for off-the-shelf LLMs by repeatedly regenerating the target output as the source input grows, but it suffers from substantial redundant computation. We propose Self-Speculative Biased Decoding (SSBD), a simple and tuning-free inference method that accelerates re-translation by exploiting temporal coherence in streaming translation. SSBD reuses the model's previous output as a speculative draft for the updated input, verifies the draft efficiently in a single forward pass with a lightweight bias, and resumes autoregressive decoding only from the first divergence. We further introduce a display-only masking strategy that hides unstable suffixes from the user interface while retaining them in the draft for verification and potential acceptance. Experiments show that SSBD achieves substantial speedup over standard re-translation while maintaining comparable translation quality, without architectural changes, auxiliary models, or extra fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability to reason from audio, including speech, environmental sounds, and music, is essential for AI agents to interact effectively in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on static or single-scene settings and English audio data and do not fully capture scenarios where multiple speakers, unfolding events, and heterogeneous audio sources interact. To address these challenges, we introduce CMDAR, a Chinese benchmark for evaluating models on complex, multi-scene, and dynamically evolving audio reasoning tasks. CMDAR comprises 3,000 carefully curated question-answer pairs linked to diverse audio clips, covering five categories of complex reasoning and spanning three question types. We benchmark 26 state-of-the-art audio language models on CMDAR and observe that they exhibit limitations in complex reasoning tasks. In CMDAR-main, Qwen2.5-Omni achieves 76.67% accuracy, whereas GPT-4o Audio reaches 68.47%. However, GPT-4o Audio substantially outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni on the more challenging multiple-choice with multiple audios and open-ended tasks. And we provide detail analysis corresponding suggestions for the future development of large audio language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangjian Wen, Qun Dai, Jianzhuang Liu, Jiangtao Zheng, Yong Dai, Dongkai Wang, Zhao Kang, Jun Wang, Zenglin Xu, Jiang Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking, a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance synergistic information through an Infinite Masking strategy. InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Tong, Thi Thu Uyen Hoang, Xue-Xin Wei, Michael Hahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the representation of probability in the human mind has been of great interest to understanding human decision making. Classical paradoxes in decision making suggest that human perception distorts probability magnitudes. Previous accounts postulate a Probability Weighting Function that transforms perceived probabilities; however, its motivation has been debated. Recent work has sought to motivate this function in terms of noisy representations of probabilities in the human mind. Here, we present an account of the Probability Weighting Function grounded in rational inference over optimal decoding from noisy neural encoding of quantities. We show that our model accurately accounts for behavior in a lottery task and a dot counting task. It further accounts for adaptation to a bimodal short-term prior. Taken together, our results provide a unifying account grounding the human representation of probability in rational inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanjeda Akter, Ibne Farabi Shihab, Anuj Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Sequential-EDFL (Empirical Dynamic Formal Lift), which applies anytime-valid sequential testing to language model generation stopping. Our approach tracks information lift, defined as the log-likelihood ratio between the full model and deliberately weakened "skeleton" baselines, using self-normalized empirical-Bernstein e-processes that provide formal delta-level error control regardless of stopping time. This delta guarantee controls premature stopping when information lift is insufficient relative to the skeleton, and it does not imply delta control of factual incorrectness or hallucinations. We handle unknown centering through online mean estimation, combine multiple parameters via mixture e-processes, and support adaptive resets under distributional drift. On six benchmarks, Sequential-EDFL reduces generation length by 22 to 28 percent relative to sequential baselines while maintaining delta-level control with 12 percent computational overhead. We introduce automated skeletons (distilled submodels and randomized logits) and show robustness across skeleton families. Composing EDFL with a lightweight correctness gate (sentence boundaries plus a verifier) improves end-task correctness while preserving anytime-valid guarantees by only delaying stopping. Our certificates control information sufficiency, not factual correctness. Specifically, 10.9 percent of stopped sequences remain incorrect even with the gate (13.2 to 22.7 percent without it). EDFL serves as a first-stage filter that can reduce verification burden: when applied to stopped sequences, the gate validates 83 percent of stops, requiring full verification only for the remaining 17 percent, plus all non-stopped sequences. EDFL is not a standalone solution for safety-critical domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Y. Hu, Benjamin Van Durme, Jacob Andreas, Harsh Jhamtani</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains, ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid, it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments through more effective utilization of past experiences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yesung Cho, Sungmin Lee, Geongyu Lee, Minkyung Lee, Jongbae Park, Dongmyung Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models, which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale) across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuandong Pu, Le Zhuo, Songhao Han, Jinbo Xing, Kaiwen Zhu, Shuo Cao, Bin Fu, Si Liu, Hongsheng Li, Yu Qiao, Wenlong Zhang, Xi Chen, Yihao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment, how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc.). We further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions. Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive content editing toward physically consistent realism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changbo Wu, Zhuolong Yu, Gongming Zhao, Hongli Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Collective communication (CC) is critical for scaling distributed machine learning (DML). The predictable traffic patterns of DML present a great oppotunity for applying optical network technologies. Optical networks with reconfigurable topologies promise high bandwidth and low latency for collective communications. However, existing approaches face inherent limitations: static topologies are inefficient for dynamic communication patterns within CC algorithm, while frequent topology reconfiguration matching every step of the algorithm incurs significant overhead.
  In this paper, we propose SWOT, a demand-aware optical network framework that employs ``intra-collective reconfiguration'' to dynamically align network resources with CC traffic patterns. SWOT hides reconfiguration latency by overlapping it with data transmission through three key techniques: Heterogeneous Message Splitting, Asynchronous Overlapping, and Topology Bypassing. Extensive simulations demonstrate that SWOT reduces communication completion time up to 89.7% across diverse CC algorithm compared to static baselines, demonstrating strong robustness to varying optical resources and reconfiguration delay.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Tian Hua, Andrew Qin, Samuel Marks, Neel Nanda</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than deployment contexts. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act like they are deployed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Lei, Shengyi Zong, Zhaoyan Li, Ziren Zhou, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The screenplay serves as the foundation for television production, defining narrative structure, character development, and dialogue. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end generation approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue this failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two disparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format adherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep structural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use. To enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage Refinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative generation from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline into rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a professionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to specialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in implementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We address this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs existing screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages these inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets. Blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75% win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of human-level performance. Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in complex creative domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro P. Sanchez, Damian Machlanski, Steven McDonagh, Sotirios A. Tsaftaris</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods. Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic benchmarks ($d{=}\!3-\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\!-\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\!-\!36$), while baselines remain the best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph $F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyuan Song, Ziye Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we study how the choice of loss functions of non-convex optimization problems affects their robustness and optimization landscape, through the study of noisy matrix sensing. In traditional regression tasks, mean squared error (MSE) loss is a common choice, but it can be unreliable for non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise. To address this issue, we adopt a robust loss based on nonparametric regression, which uses a kernel-based estimate of the residual density and maximizes the estimated log-likelihood. This robust formulation coincides with the MSE loss under Gaussian errors but remains stable under more general settings. We further examine how this robust loss reshapes the optimization landscape by analyzing the upper-bound of restricted isometry property (RIP) constants for spurious local minima to disappear. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that this new loss excels at handling large noise and remains robust across diverse noise distributions. This work offers initial insights into enhancing the robustness of machine learning tasks through simply changing the loss, guided by an intuitive and broadly applicable analytical framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tzu-Jung Lin, Jia-Fong Yeh, Hung-Ting Su, Chung-Yi Lin, Yi-Ting Chen, Winston H. Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: In open-vocabulary mobile manipulation (OVMM), task success often hinges on the selection of an appropriate base placement for the robot. Existing approaches typically navigate to proximity-based regions without considering affordances, resulting in frequent manipulation failures. We propose Affordance-Guided Coarse-to-Fine Exploration, a zero-shot framework for base placement that integrates semantic understanding from vision-language models (VLMs) with geometric feasibility through an iterative optimization process. Our method constructs cross-modal representations, namely Affordance RGB and Obstacle Map+, to align semantics with spatial context. This enables reasoning that extends beyond the egocentric limitations of RGB perception. To ensure interaction is guided by task-relevant affordances, we leverage coarse semantic priors from VLMs to guide the search toward task-relevant regions and refine placements with geometric constraints, thereby reducing the risk of convergence to local optima. Evaluated on five diverse open-vocabulary mobile manipulation tasks, our system achieves an 85% success rate, significantly outperforming classical geometric planners and VLM-based methods. This demonstrates the promise of affordance-aware and multimodal reasoning for generalizable, instruction-conditioned planning in OVMM.</p>

The HCD framework integrates design thinking, experiential learning, and reflective practice into a unified constructivist pedagogy emphasizing autonomy, ownership, and scaffolding. It is applied across courses in game design (CS3247, CS4350), virtual reality (CS4240), and extended reality systems, where students engage in iterative cycles of thinking, creating, criticizing, and reflecting. The paper also examines how AI-augmented systems such as iReflect, ReflexAI, and Knowledge Graph-enhanced LLM feedback tools operationalize the HCD framework through scalable, personalized feedback. Empirical findings demonstrate improved reflective depth, feedback quality, and learner autonomy. The work advocates a balance of supportive autonomy in supervision, where students practice self-directed inquiry while guided through structured reflection and feedback.</p>

However, due to the accumulation of model errors over long-horizon rollouts, such methods often face challenges in maintaining modeling stability. To address this, we propose CtrlFlow, a trajectory-level synthetic method using conditional flow matching (CFM), which directly modeling the distribution of trajectories from initial states to high-return terminal states without explicitly modeling the environment transition function. Our method ensures optimal trajectory sampling by minimizing the control energy governed by the non-linear Controllability Gramian Matrix, while the generated diverse trajectory data significantly enhances the robustness and cross-task generalization of policy learning. In online settings, CtrlFlow demonstrates the better performance on common MuJoCo benchmark tasks than dynamics models and achieves superior sample efficiency compared to standard MBRL methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Fan, Lin Guo, Ruizhen Jia, Yang Tian, Zhihao Yang, Weihao Li, Boxue Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided drug discovery is an active research field, yet AI models often exhibit poor accuracy in regression tasks for molecular property prediction, and perform catastrophically poorly for out-of-distribution (OOD) molecules. Here, we present MolRuleLoss, a substructure-substitution-rule-informed framework that improves the accuracy and generalizability of multiple molecular property regression models (MPRMs) such as GEM and UniMol for diverse molecular property prediction tasks. MolRuleLoss incorporates partial derivative constraints for substructure substitution rules (SSRs) into an MPRM's loss function. When using GEM models for predicting lipophilicity, water solubility, and solvation-free energy (using lipophilicity, ESOL, and freeSolv datasets from MoleculeNet), the root mean squared error (RMSE) values with and without MolRuleLoss were 0.587 vs. 0.660, 0.777 vs. 0.798, and 1.252 vs. 1.877, respectively, representing 2.6-33.3% performance improvements. We show that both the number and the quality of SSRs contribute to the magnitude of prediction accuracy gains obtained upon adding MolRuleLoss to an MPRM. MolRuleLoss improved the generalizability of MPRMs for "activity cliff" molecules in a lipophilicity prediction task and improved the generalizability of MPRMs for OOD molecules in a melting point prediction task. In a molecular weight prediction task for OOD molecules, MolRuleLoss reduced the RMSE value of a GEM model from 29.507 to 0.007. We also provide a formal demonstration that the upper bound of the variation for property change of SSRs is positively correlated with an MPRM's error. Together, we show that using the MolRuleLoss framework as a bolt-on boosts the prediction accuracy and generalizability of multiple MPRMs, supporting diverse applications in areas like cheminformatics and AI-aided drug discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander W. Goodall, Edwin Hamel-De le Court, Francesco Belardinelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Many reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those that rely on return estimates for policy improvement, can suffer from poor sample efficiency and training instability due to high-variance return estimates. In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dahao Tang, Nan Yang, Yanli Li, Zhiyu Zhu, Zhibo Jin, Dong Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Selecting an appropriate look-back horizon remains a fundamental challenge in time series forecasting (TSF), particularly in the federated learning scenarios where data is decentralized, heterogeneous, and often non-independent. While recent work has explored horizon selection by preserving forecasting-relevant information in an intrinsic space, these approaches are primarily restricted to centralized and independently distributed settings. This paper presents a principled framework for adaptive horizon selection in federated time series forecasting through an intrinsic space formulation. We introduce a synthetic data generator (SDG) that captures essential temporal structures in client data, including autoregressive dependencies, seasonality, and trend, while incorporating client-specific heterogeneity. Building on this model, we define a transformation that maps time series windows into an intrinsic representation space with well-defined geometric and statistical properties. We then derive a decomposition of the forecasting loss into a Bayesian term, which reflects irreducible uncertainty, and an approximation term, which accounts for finite-sample effects and limited model capacity. Our analysis shows that while increasing the look-back horizon improves the identifiability of deterministic patterns, it also increases approximation error due to higher model complexity and reduced sample efficiency. We prove that the total forecasting loss is minimized at the smallest horizon where the irreducible loss starts to saturate, while the approximation loss continues to rise. This work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for adaptive horizon selection for time series forecasting in federated learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruijun Deng, Zhihui Lu, Qiang Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: Split inference (SI) enables users to access deep learning (DL) services without directly transmitting raw data. However, recent studies reveal that data reconstruction attacks (DRAs) can recover the original inputs from the smashed data sent from the client to the server, leading to significant privacy leakage. While various defenses have been proposed, they often result in substantial utility degradation, particularly when the client-side model is shallow. We identify a key cause of this trade-off: existing defenses apply excessive perturbation to redundant information in the smashed data. To address this issue in computer vision tasks, we propose InfoDecom, a defense framework that first decomposes and removes redundant information and then injects noise calibrated to provide theoretically guaranteed privacy. Experiments demonstrate that InfoDecom achieves a superior utility-privacy trade-off compared to existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Irina Tezaur, Eric Parish, Anthony Gruber, Ian Moore, Christopher Wentland, Alejandro Mota</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach for coupling subdomain-local non-intrusive Operator Inference (OpInf) reduced order models (ROMs) with each other and with subdomain-local high-fidelity full order models (FOMs) with using the overlapping Schwarz alternating method (O-SAM). The proposed methodology addresses significant challenges in multiscale modeling and simulation, particularly the long runtime and complex mesh generation requirements associated with traditional high-fidelity simulations. By leveraging the flexibility of O-SAM, we enable the seamless integration of disparate models, meshes, and time integration schemes, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on complex three-dimensional (3D) solid dynamics problems, showcasing speedups of up to 106x compared to conventional FOM-FOM couplings. This work paves the way for more efficient simulation workflows in engineering applications, with potential extensions to a wide range of partial differential equations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Wang, Yanxu Zhu, Dongyuan Lu, Jitao Sang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rebeka Toth, Tamas Bisztray, Richard Dubniczky</p>
<p>Abstract: Phishing and spam emails remain a major cybersecurity threat, with attackers increasingly leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to craft highly deceptive content. This study presents a comprehensive email dataset containing phishing, spam, and legitimate messages, explicitly distinguishing between human- and LLM-generated content. Each email is annotated with its category, emotional appeal (e.g., urgency, fear, authority), and underlying motivation (e.g., link-following, credential theft, financial fraud). We benchmark multiple LLMs on their ability to identify these emotional and motivational cues and select the most reliable model to annotate the full dataset. To evaluate classification robustness, emails were also rephrased using several LLMs while preserving meaning and intent. A state-of-the-art LLM was then assessed on its performance across both original and rephrased emails using expert-labeled ground truth. The results highlight strong phishing detection capabilities but reveal persistent challenges in distinguishing spam from legitimate emails. Our dataset and evaluation framework contribute to improving AI-assisted email security systems. To support open science, all code, templates, and resources are available on our project site.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alper Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m, \.Ibrahim Y\"uceda\u{g}</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional deep learning paradigms rely on metabolically expensive magnitude-based representations, rendering them fundamentally incompatible with passive photonic hardware. We introduce PRISM, a sequence modeling architecture that bridges high-level reasoning and physical constraints by enforcing an Iso-Energetic (Unity Gain) principle, compelling the network to encode semantic information exclusively in the phase angle. Validated on the WMT14 translation benchmark, PRISM achieves a 0.799 COMET score, demonstrating that phase-based reasoning competes with standard Transformers (0.821) and functionally matches unconstrained spectral baselines like FNet (0.805), despite enforcing strict energy constraints and requiring 11.5% fewer parameters. Furthermore, to verify hardware feasibility, we simulate a Holographic Backpropagation mechanism on a noisy, 4-bit optical correlator. Ablation studies reveal a substantial performance gain (48.4% vs. 62.4%) over a frozen baseline, proving that the proposed phase-steering mechanism actively optimizes physical parameters under strict energy constraints. These results establish an existence proof that ultra-low-power, passive optical hardware can support high-level linguistic intelligence without sacrificing representational capacity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroki Hasegawa, Yukihiko Okada</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proposes Interaction Tensor SHAP (IT-SHAP), a tensor algebraic formulation of the Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (STII) that makes its computational structure explicit. STII extends the Shapley value to higher order interactions, but its exponential combinatorial definition makes direct computation intractable at scale. We reformulate STII as a linear transformation acting on a value function and derive an explicit algebraic representation of its weight tensor. This weight tensor is shown to possess a multilinear structure induced by discrete finite difference operators. When the value function admits a Tensor Train representation, higher order interaction indices can be computed in the parallel complexity class NC squared. In contrast, under general tensor network representations without structural assumptions, the same computation is proven to be P sharp hard. The main contributions are threefold. First, we establish an exact Tensor Train representation of the STII weight tensor. Second, we develop a parallelizable evaluation algorithm with explicit complexity bounds under the Tensor Train assumption. Third, we prove that computational intractability is unavoidable in the absence of such structure. These results demonstrate that the computational difficulty of higher order interaction analysis is determined by the underlying algebraic representation rather than by the interaction index itself, providing a theoretical foundation for scalable interpretation of high dimensional models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihyung Park, Saleh Afroogh, David Atkinson, Junfeng Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly integrated into everyday interactions, serving not only as information assistants but also as emotional companions. Even in the absence of explicit toxicity, repeated emotional reinforcement or affective drift can gradually escalate distress in a form of \textit{implicit harm} that traditional toxicity filters fail to detect. Existing guardrail mechanisms often rely on external classifiers or clinical rubrics that may lag behind the nuanced, real-time dynamics of a developing conversation. To address this gap, we propose GAUGE (Guarding Affective Utterance Generation Escalation), logit-based framework for the real-time detection of hidden conversational escalation. GAUGE measures how an LLM's output probabilistically shifts the affective state of a dialogue.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sima Jafarikhah, Daniel Thompson, Eva Deans, Hossein Siadati, Yi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Manual vulnerability scoring, such as assigning Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores, is a resource-intensive process that is often influenced by subjective interpretation. This study investigates the potential of general-purpose large language models (LLMs), namely ChatGPT, Llama, Grok, DeepSeek, and Gemini, to automate this process by analyzing over 31{,}000 recent Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entries. The results show that LLMs substantially outperform the baseline on certain metrics (e.g., \textit{Availability Impact}), while offering more modest gains on others (e.g., \textit{Attack Complexity}). Moreover, model performance varies across both LLM families and individual CVSS metrics, with ChatGPT-5 attaining the highest precision. Our analysis reveals that LLMs tend to misclassify many of the same CVEs, and ensemble-based meta-classifiers only marginally improve performance. Further examination shows that CVE descriptions often lack critical context or contain ambiguous phrasing, which contributes to systematic misclassifications. These findings underscore the importance of enhancing vulnerability descriptions and incorporating richer contextual details to support more reliable automated reasoning and alleviate the growing backlog of CVEs awaiting triage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco Ribeiro, Claudio Spiess, Prem Devanbu, Sarah Nadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for code generation, they often output incorrect code. One reason is that model output probabilities are often not well-correlated with correctness, and reflect only the final output of the generation process. Inspired by findings that LLMs internally encode concepts like truthfulness, this paper explores if LLMs similarly represent code correctness. Specifically, we identify a correctness representation inside LLMs by contrasting the hidden states between pairs of correct and incorrect code for the same programming tasks. By experimenting on four LLMs, we show that exploiting this extracted correctness representation outperforms standard log-likelihood ranking, as well as verbalized model confidence. Furthermore, we explore how this internal correctness signal can be used to select higher-quality code samples, without requiring test execution. Ultimately, this work demonstrates how leveraging internal representations can enhance code generation systems and make LLMs more reliable, thus improving confidence in automatically generated code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoqiang Chen, Lingyun Ying, Ziyang Song, Daguang Liu, Qiang Wang, Zhiqi Wang, Li Hu, Shaoyin Cheng, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieving binary code via natural language queries is a pivotal capability for downstream tasks in the software security domain, such as vulnerability detection and malware analysis. However, it is challenging to identify binary functions semantically relevant to the user query from thousands of candidates, as the absence of symbolic information distinguishes this task from source code retrieval. In this paper, we introduce, BinSeek, a two-stage cross-modal retrieval framework for stripped binary code analysis. It consists of two models: BinSeek-Embedding is trained on large-scale dataset to learn the semantic relevance of the binary code and the natural language description, furthermore, BinSeek-Reranker learns to carefully judge the relevance of the candidate code to the description with context augmentation. To this end, we built an LLM-based data synthesis pipeline to automate training construction, also deriving a domain benchmark for future research. Our evaluation results show that BinSeek achieved the state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the the same scale models by 31.42% in Rec@3 and 27.17% in MRR@3, as well as leading the advanced general-purpose models that have 16 times larger parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijie Zhong, Zhiwen Yu, Pengyu Li, Jianming Lv, C. L. Philip Chen, Min Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Radio path loss prediction (RPP) is critical for optimizing 5G networks and enabling IoT, smart city, and similar applications. However, current deep learning-based RPP methods lack proactive environmental modeling, struggle with realistic multi-transmitter scenarios, and generalize poorly under distribution shifts, particularly when training/testing environments differ in building density or transmitter configurations. This paper identifies three key issues: (1) passive environmental modeling that overlooks transmitters and key environmental features; (2) overemphasis on single-transmitter scenarios despite real-world multi-transmitter prevalence; (3) excessive focus on in-distribution performance while neglecting distribution shift challenges. To address these, we propose PathFinder, a novel architecture that actively models buildings and transmitters via disentangled feature encoding and integrates Mask-Guided Low-rank Attention to independently focus on receiver and building regions. We also introduce a Transmitter-Oriented Mixup strategy for robust training and a new benchmark, single-to-multi-transmitter RPP (S2MT-RPP), tailored to evaluate extrapolation performance (multi-transmitter testing after single-transmitter training). Experimental results show PathFinder outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly, especially in challenging multi-transmitter scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiqing Zhou, Yu Lei, Shuzheng Si, Qingyan Sun, Wei Wang, Yifei Wu, Hao Wen, Gang Chen, Fanchao Qi, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Managing extensive context remains a critical bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in applications like long-document question answering and autonomous agents where lengthy inputs incur high computational costs and introduce noise. Existing compression techniques often disrupt local coherence through discrete token removal or rely on implicit latent encoding that suffers from positional bias and incompatibility with closed-source APIs. To address these limitations, we introduce the EDU-based Context Compressor, a novel explicit compression framework designed to preserve both global structure and fine-grained details. Our approach reformulates context compression as a structure-then-select process. First, our LingoEDU transforms linear text into a structural relation tree of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which are anchored strictly to source indices to eliminate hallucination. Second, a lightweight ranking module selects query-relevant sub-trees for linearization. To rigorously evaluate structural understanding, we release StructBench, a manually annotated dataset of 248 diverse documents. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art structural prediction accuracy and significantly outperforms frontier LLMs while reducing costs. Furthermore, our structure-aware compression substantially enhances performance across downstream tasks ranging from long-context tasks to complex Deep Search scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dynamic prediction of locomotor capacity after stroke could enable more individualized rehabilitation, yet current assessments largely provide static impairment scores and do not indicate whether patients can perform specific tasks such as slope walking or stair climbing. Here, we present a wearable-informed data-physics hybrid generative framework that reconstructs a stroke survivor's locomotor control from wearable inertial sensing and predicts task-conditioned post-stroke locomotion in new environments. From a single 20 m level-ground walking trial recorded by five IMUs, the framework personalizes a physics-based digital avatar using a healthy-motion prior and hybrid imitation learning, generating dynamically feasible, patient-specific movements for inclined walking and stair negotiation. Across 11 stroke inpatients, predicted postures reached 82.2% similarity for slopes and 69.9% for stairs, substantially exceeding a physics-only baseline. In a multicentre pilot randomized study (n = 21; 28 days), access to scenario-specific locomotion predictions to support task selection and difficulty titration was associated with larger gains in Fugl-Meyer lower-extremity scores than standard care (mean change 6.0 vs 3.7 points; $p < 0.05$). These results suggest that wearable-informed generative digital avatars may augment individualized gait rehabilitation planning and provide a pathway toward dynamically personalized post-stroke motor recovery strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance across a broad range of multimodal tasks. However, robust image caption evaluation using LVLMs remains challenging, particularly under domain-shift scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce the Distribution-Aware Score Decoder (DISCODE), a novel finetuning-free method that generates robust evaluation scores better aligned with human judgments across diverse domains. The core idea behind DISCODE lies in its test-time adaptive evaluation approach, which introduces the Adaptive Test-Time (ATT) loss, leveraging a Gaussian prior distribution to improve robustness in evaluation score estimation. This loss is efficiently minimized at test time using an analytical solution that we derive. Furthermore, we introduce the Multi-domain Caption Evaluation (MCEval) benchmark, a new image captioning evaluation benchmark covering six distinct domains, designed to assess the robustness of evaluation metrics. In our experiments, we demonstrate that DISCODE achieves state-of-the-art performance as a reference-free evaluation metric across MCEval and four representative existing benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Disclaimer: Samples in this paper may be harmful and cause discomfort.
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable multimodal generation but inherit toxic, biased, and NSFW signals from weakly curated pretraining corpora, causing safety risks, especially under adversarial triggers that late, opaque training-free detoxification methods struggle to handle. We propose SGM, a white-box neuron-level multimodal intervention that acts like safety glasses for toxic neurons: it selectively recalibrates a small set of toxic expert neurons via expertise-weighted soft suppression, neutralizing harmful cross-modal activations without any parameter updates. We establish MM-TOXIC-QA, a multimodal toxicity evaluation framework, and compare SGM with existing detoxification techniques. Experiments on open-source MLLMs show that SGM mitigates toxicity in standard and adversarial conditions, cutting harmful rates from 48.2\% to 2.5\% while preserving fluency and multimodal reasoning. SGM is extensible, and its combined defenses, denoted as SGM*, integrate with existing detoxification methods for stronger safety performance, providing an interpretable, low-cost solution for toxicity-controlled multimodal generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Terrence J. Sejnowski</p>
<p>Abstract: In the last century, most sensorimotor studies of cortical neurons relied on average firing rates. Rate coding is efficient for fast sensorimotor processing that occurs within a few seconds. Much less is known about long-term working memory with a time scale of hours (Ericsson and Kintsch, 1995). The discovery of millisecond-precision spike initiation in cortical neurons was unexpected (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995). Even more striking was the precision of spiking in vivo, in response to rapidly fluctuating sensory inputs, suggesting that neural circuits could, in principle, preserve and manipulate sensory information through spike timing, enabling a broader range of neural codes. It could also support spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which is triggered by the relative timing of spikes between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons in the millisecond range. What spike-timing mechanisms could regulate STDP in vivo? Cortical traveling waves have been observed across many frequency bands with high temporal precision. Traveling waves have wave fronts that could link spike timing to STDP. As a wave front passes through a cortical column, excitatory synapses on the dendrites of both pyramidal and basket cells are stimulated synchronously. Inhibitory basket cells form a calyx on pyramidal cell bodies, and inhibitory rebound following a strong transient hyperpolarization can trigger a backpropagating action potential, which arrives shortly after the excitatory inputs on pyramidal dendrites. STDP activated in this way could persist for hours, creating a second-tier network. This temporary network could support long-term working memory, a cognitive network riding above the long-term sensorimotor network. On their own, traveling waves and STDP have not yet yielded new insights into cortical function. Together, they could be responsible for how we think (Sejnowski, 2025).</p>

<p>Abstract: We study how a central bank should dynamically set short-term nominal interest rates to stabilize inflation and unemployment when macroeconomic relationships are uncertain and time-varying. We model monetary policy as a sequential decision-making problem where the central bank observes macroeconomic conditions quarterly and chooses interest rate adjustments. Using publicly accessible historical Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), we construct a linear-Gaussian transition model and implement a discrete-action Markov Decision Process with a quadratic loss reward function. We chose to compare nine different reinforcement learning style approaches against Taylor Rule and naive baselines, including tabular Q-learning variants, SARSA, Actor-Critic, Deep Q-Networks, Bayesian Q-learning with uncertainty quantification, and POMDP formulations with partial observability. Notably, despite its simplicity, standard tabular Q-learning achieved the best performance (-615.13 +- 309.58 mean return), outperforming both enhanced RL methods and traditional policy rules. Our results suggest that while sophisticated RL techniques show promise for monetary policy applications, simpler approaches may be more robust in this domain, highlighting important challenges in applying modern RL to macroeconomic policy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhou Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Empirical power--law scaling has been widely observed across modern deep learning systems, yet its theoretical origins and scope of validity remain incompletely understood. The Generalized Resolution--Shell Dynamics (GRSD) framework models learning as spectral energy transport across logarithmic resolution shells, providing a coarse--grained dynamical description of training. Within GRSD, power--law scaling corresponds to a particularly simple renormalized shell dynamics; however, such behavior is not automatic and requires additional structural properties of the learning process.
  In this work, we identify a set of sufficient conditions under which the GRSD shell dynamics admits a renormalizable coarse--grained description. These conditions constrain the learning configuration at multiple levels, including boundedness of gradient propagation in the computation graph, weak functional incoherence at initialization, controlled Jacobian evolution along training, and log--shift invariance of renormalized shell couplings. We further show that power--law scaling does not follow from renormalizability alone, but instead arises as a rigidity consequence: once log--shift invariance is combined with the intrinsic time--rescaling covariance of gradient flow, the renormalized GRSD velocity field is forced into a power--law form.</p>

<p>Abstract: The key to success in automating prior art search in patent research using artificial intelligence (AI) lies in developing large datasets for machine learning (ML) and ensuring their availability. This work is dedicated to providing a comprehensive solution to the problem of creating infrastructure for research in this field, including datasets and tools for calculating search quality criteria. The paper discusses the concept of semantic clusters of patent documents that determine the state of the art in a given subject, as proposed by the authors. A definition of such semantic clusters is also provided. Prior art search is presented as the task of identifying elements within a semantic cluster of patent documents in the subject area specified by the document under consideration. A generator of user-configurable datasets for ML, based on collections of U.S. and Russian patent documents, is described. The dataset generator creates a database of links to documents in semantic clusters. Then, based on user-defined parameters, it forms a dataset of semantic clusters in JSON format for ML. A collection of publicly available patent documents was created. The collection contains 14 million semantic clusters of US patent documents and 1 million clusters of Russian patent documents. To evaluate ML outcomes, it is proposed to calculate search quality scores that account for semantic clusters of the documents being searched. To automate the evaluation process, the paper describes a utility developed by the authors for assessing the quality of prior art document search.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuzheng Si, Qingyi Wang, Haozhe Zhao, Yuzhuo Bai, Guanqiao Chen, Kangyang Luo, Gang Chen, Fanchao Qi, Minjia Zhang, Baobao Chang, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognizing whether outputs from large language models (LLMs) contain faithfulness hallucination is crucial for real-world applications, e.g., retrieval-augmented generation and summarization. In this paper, we introduce FaithLens, a cost-efficient and effective faithfulness hallucination detection model that can jointly provide binary predictions and corresponding explanations to improve trustworthiness. To achieve this, we first synthesize training data with explanations via advanced LLMs and apply a well-defined data filtering strategy to ensure label correctness, explanation quality, and data diversity. Subsequently, we fine-tune the model on these well-curated training data as a cold start and further optimize it with rule-based reinforcement learning, using rewards for both prediction correctness and explanation quality. Results on 12 diverse tasks show that the 8B-parameter FaithLens outperforms advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and o3. Also, FaithLens can produce high-quality explanations, delivering a distinctive balance of trustworthiness, efficiency, and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenlong Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proposes a multi-agent language framework that enables continual strategy evolution without fine-tuning the language model's parameters. The core idea is to liberate the latent vectors of abstract concepts from traditional static semantic representations, allowing them to be continuously updated through environmental interaction and reinforcement feedback. We construct a dual-loop architecture: the behavior loop adjusts action preferences based on environmental rewards, while the language loop updates the external latent vectors by reflecting on the semantic embeddings of generated text.
  Together, these mechanisms allow agents to develop stable and disentangled strategic styles over long-horizon multi-round interactions. Experiments show that agents' latent spaces exhibit clear convergence trajectories under reflection-driven updates, along with structured shifts at critical moments. Moreover, the system demonstrates an emergent ability to implicitly infer and continually adapt to emotional agents, even without shared rewards. These results indicate that, without modifying model parameters, an external latent space can provide language agents with a low-cost, scalable, and interpretable form of abstract strategic representation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoxi Zhang, Yitong Duan, Yanzhi Zhang, Yiming Xu, Jiyan He, Yunfang Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Locating the files and functions requiring modification in large open-source software (OSS) repositories is challenging due to their scale and structural complexity. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods typically treat this as a repository-level retrieval task and rely on multiple auxiliary tools, which overlook code execution logic and complicate model control. We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool-jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and even the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as Claude-3.7. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as powerful embodied agents. One of the core abilities is autonomous navigation in large-scale three-dimensional environments. Existing navigation policies, however, are typically optimized for low-level objectives such as obstacle avoidance and trajectory smoothness, lacking the ability to incorporate high-level semantics into planning. To bridge this gap, we propose ANWM, an aerial navigation world model that predicts future visual observations conditioned on past frames and actions, thereby enabling agents to rank candidate trajectories by their semantic plausibility and navigational utility. ANWM is trained on 4-DoF UAV trajectories and introduces a physics-inspired module: Future Frame Projection (FFP), which projects past frames into future viewpoints to provide coarse geometric priors. This module mitigates representational uncertainty in long-distance visual generation and captures the mapping between 3D trajectories and egocentric observations. Empirical results demonstrate that ANWM significantly outperforms existing world models in long-distance visual forecasting and improves UAV navigation success rates in large-scale environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gnankan Landry Regis N'guessan</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard neural network architectures employ fixed activation functions (ReLU, tanh, sigmoid) that are poorly suited for approximating functions with singular or fractional power behavior, a structure that arises ubiquitously in physics, including boundary layers, fracture mechanics, and corner singularities. We introduce M\"untz-Sz\'asz Networks (MSN), a novel architecture that replaces fixed smooth activations with learnable fractional power bases grounded in classical approximation theory. Each MSN edge computes $\phi(x) = \sum_k a_k |x|^{\mu_k} + \sum_k b_k \mathrm{sign}(x)|x|^{\lambda_k}$, where the exponents $\{\mu_k, \lambda_k\}$ are learned alongside the coefficients. We prove that MSN inherits universal approximation from the M\"untz-Sz\'asz theorem and establish novel approximation rates: for functions of the form $|x|^\alpha$, MSN achieves error $\mathcal{O}(|\mu - \alpha|^2)$ with a single learned exponent, whereas standard MLPs require $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1/\alpha})$ neurons for comparable accuracy. On supervised regression with singular target functions, MSN achieves 5-8x lower error than MLPs with 10x fewer parameters. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a particularly demanding application for singular function approximation; on PINN benchmarks including a singular ODE and stiff boundary-layer problems, MSN achieves 3-6x improvement while learning interpretable exponents that match the known solution structure. Our results demonstrate that theory-guided architectural design can yield dramatic improvements for scientifically-motivated function classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Chen, Yang Song, Chen Wang, Ziran Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic nose (E-nose) systems face two interconnected challenges in open-set gas recognition: feature distribution shift caused by signal drift and decision boundary failure induced by unknown gas interference. Existing methods predominantly rely on Euclidean distance or conventional classifiers, failing to account for anisotropic feature distributions and dynamic signal intensity variations. To address these issues, this study proposes the Spherical Normalization coupled Mahalanobis (SNM) module, a universal post-processing module for open-set gas recognition. First, it achieves geometric decoupling through cascaded batch and L2 normalization, projecting features onto a unit hypersphere to eliminate signal intensity fluctuations. Second, it utilizes Mahalanobis distance to construct adaptive ellipsoidal decision boundaries that conform to the anisotropic feature geometry. The architecture-agnostic SNM-Module seamlessly integrates with mainstream backbones including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Transformer. Experiments on the public Vergara dataset demonstrate that the Transformer+SNM configuration achieves near-theoretical-limit performance in discriminating among multiple target gases, with an AUROC of 0.9977 and an unknown gas detection rate of 99.57% at 5% false positive rate, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods with a 3.0% AUROC improvement and 91.0% standard deviation reduction compared to Class Anchor Clustering (CAC). The module maintains exceptional robustness across five sensor positions, with standard deviations below 0.0028. This work effectively addresses the critical challenge of simultaneously achieving high accuracy and high stability in open-set gas recognition, providing solid support for industrial E-nose deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humans exhibit adaptive, context-sensitive responses to egocentric visual input. However, faithfully modeling such reactions from egocentric video remains challenging due to the dual requirements of strictly causal generation and precise 3D spatial alignment. To tackle this problem, we first construct the Human Reaction Dataset (HRD) to address data scarcity and misalignment by building a spatially aligned egocentric video-reaction dataset, as existing datasets (e.g., ViMo) suffer from significant spatial inconsistency between the egocentric video and reaction motion, e.g., dynamically moving motions are always paired with fixed-camera videos. Leveraging HRD, we present EgoReAct, the first autoregressive framework that generates 3D-aligned human reaction motions from egocentric video streams in real-time. We first compress the reaction motion into a compact yet expressive latent space via a Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder and then train a Generative Pre-trained Transformer for reaction generation from the visual input. EgoReAct incorporates 3D dynamic features, i.e., metric depth, and head dynamics during the generation, which effectively enhance spatial grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoReAct achieves remarkably higher realism, spatial consistency, and generation efficiency compared with prior methods, while maintaining strict causality during generation. We will release code, models, and data upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dianyun Wang, Qingsen Ma, Yuhu Shang, Zhifeng Lu, Zhenbo Xu, Lechen Ning, Huijia Wu, Zhaofeng He</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety alignment -- training large language models (LLMs) to refuse harmful requests while remaining helpful -- is critical for responsible deployment. Prior work established that safety behaviors are governed by low-rank structures, suggesting parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) should be well-suited for alignment. However, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) consistently underperforms full fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on safety benchmarks. We attribute this gap to semantic entanglement: safety-relevant directions are intertwined with unrelated concepts due to polysemanticity, impeding implicit subspace identification. To address this, we propose SAILS (Safety Alignment via Interpretable Low-rank Subspace), which leverages Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle representations into monosemantic features, constructs an interpretable safety subspace from SAE decoder directions, and uses it to initialize LoRA adapters. Theoretically, we prove that SAE-based identification achieves arbitrarily small recovery error under monosemanticity assumptions, while direct identification suffers an irreducible error floor. Empirically, SAILS achieves up to 99.6% safety rate on Gemma-2-9B -- exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 points and matching RLHF-based models -- while updating only 0.19% of parameters and providing interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anwar Alajmi, Gabriele Pergola</p>
<p>Abstract: Sexist content online increasingly appears in subtle, context-dependent forms that evade traditional detection methods. Its interpretation often depends on overlapping linguistic, psychological, legal, and cultural dimensions, which produce mixed and sometimes contradictory signals, even in annotated datasets. These inconsistencies, combined with label scarcity and class imbalance, result in unstable decision boundaries and cause fine-tuned models to overlook subtler, underrepresented forms of harm. Together, these limitations point to the need for a design that explicitly addresses the combined effects of (i) underrepresentation, (ii) noise, and (iii) conceptual ambiguity in both data and model predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework that unifies (i) targeted training procedures to adapt supervision to scarce and noisy data with (ii) selective, reasoning-based inference to handle ambiguous or borderline cases. Our training setup applies class-balanced focal loss, class-aware batching, and post-hoc threshold calibration to mitigate label imbalance and noisy supervision. At inference time, a dynamic routing mechanism classifies high-confidence cases directly and escalates uncertain instances to a novel \textit{Collaborative Expert Judgment} (CEJ) module, which prompts multiple personas and consolidates their reasoning through a judge model. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmarks, with F1 gains of +4.48% and +1.30% on EDOS Tasks A and B, respectively, and a +2.79% improvement in ICM on EXIST 2025 Task 1.1.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) deliver state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, they frequently suffer from hallucinations, e.g. generating text not grounded in the audio input. We analyze these grounding failures and identify a distinct taxonomy: Event Omission, False Event Identity, Temporal Relation Error, and Quantitative Temporal Error. To address this, we introduce the AHA (Audio Hallucination Alignment) framework. By leveraging counterfactual hard negative mining, our pipeline constructs a high-quality preference dataset that forces models to distinguish strict acoustic evidence from linguistically plausible fabrications. Additionally, we establish AHA-Eval, a diagnostic benchmark designed to rigorously test these fine-grained temporal reasoning capabilities. We apply this data to align Qwen2.5-Omni. The resulting model, Qwen-Audio-AHA, achieves a 13.7% improvement on AHA-Eval. Crucially, this benefit generalizes beyond our diagnostic set. Our model shows substantial gains on public benchmarks, including 1.3% on MMAU-Test and 1.6% on MMAR, outperforming latest SOTA methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rodrigo Pereira David</p>
<p>Abstract: Laplace approximations are among the simplest and most practical methods for approximate Bayesian inference in neural networks, yet their Euclidean formulation struggles with the highly anisotropic, curved loss surfaces and large symmetry groups that characterize modern deep models. Recent work has proposed Riemannian and geometric Gaussian approximations to adapt to this structure. Building on these ideas, we introduce the Tubular Riemannian Laplace (TRL) approximation. TRL explicitly models the posterior as a probabilistic tube that follows a low-loss valley induced by functional symmetries, using a Fisher/Gauss-Newton metric to separate prior-dominated tangential uncertainty from data-dominated transverse uncertainty. We interpret TRL as a scalable reparametrised Gaussian approximation that utilizes implicit curvature estimates to operate in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our empirical evaluation on ResNet-18 (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) demonstrates that TRL achieves excellent calibration, matching or exceeding the reliability of Deep Ensembles (in terms of ECE) while requiring only a fraction (1/5) of the training cost. TRL effectively bridges the gap between single-model efficiency and ensemble-grade reliability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kim Alexander Christensen, Andreas Gudahl Tufte, Alexey Gusev, Rohan Sinha, Milan Ganai, Ole Andreas Alsos, Marco Pavone, Martin Steinert</p>
<p>Abstract: The draft IMO MASS Code requires autonomous and remotely supervised maritime vessels to detect departures from their operational design domain, enter a predefined fallback that notifies the operator, permit immediate human override, and avoid changing the voyage plan without approval. Meeting these obligations in the alert-to-takeover gap calls for a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver. Classical maritime autonomy stacks struggle when the correct action depends on meaning (e.g., diver-down flag means people in the water, fire close by means hazard). We argue (i) that vision-language models (VLMs) provide semantic awareness for such out-of-distribution situations, and (ii) that a fast-slow anomaly pipeline with a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver makes this practical in the handover window. We introduce Semantic Lookout, a camera-only, candidate-constrained VLM fallback maneuver selector that selects one cautious action (or station-keeping) from water-valid, world-anchored trajectories under continuous human authority. On 40 harbor scenes we measure per-call scene understanding and latency, alignment with human consensus (model majority-of-three voting), short-horizon risk-relief on fire hazard scenes, and an on-water alert->fallback maneuver->operator handover. Sub-10 s models retain most of the awareness of slower state-of-the-art models. The fallback maneuver selector outperforms geometry-only baselines and increases standoff distance on fire scenes. A field run verifies end-to-end operation. These results support VLMs as semantic fallback maneuver selectors compatible with the draft IMO MASS Code, within practical latency budgets, and motivate future work on domain-adapted, hybrid autonomy that pairs foundation-model semantics with multi-sensor bird's-eye-view perception and short-horizon replanning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunjun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data remains fundamentally limited by identifiability constraints. Recent work has explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as sources of prior causal knowledge, but existing approaches rely on heuristic integration that lacks theoretical grounding. We introduce HOLOGRAPH, a framework that formalizes LLM-guided causal discovery through sheaf theory--representing local causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf over variable subsets. Our key insight is that coherent global causal structure corresponds to the existence of a global section, while topological obstructions manifest as non-vanishing sheaf cohomology. We propose the Algebraic Latent Projection to handle hidden confounders and Natural Gradient Descent on the belief manifold for principled optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HOLOGRAPH provides rigorous mathematical foundations while achieving competitive performance on causal discovery tasks with 50-100 variables. Our sheaf-theoretic analysis reveals that while Identity, Transitivity, and Gluing axioms are satisfied to numerical precision (<10^{-6}), the Locality axiom fails for larger graphs, suggesting fundamental non-local coupling in latent variable projections.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) apply uniform computation to all tokens, despite language exhibiting highly non-uniform information density. This token-uniform regime wastes capacity on locally predictable spans while under-allocating computation to semantically critical transitions. We propose $\textbf{Dynamic Large Concept Models (DLCM)}$, a hierarchical language modeling framework that learns semantic boundaries from latent representations and shifts computation from tokens to a compressed concept space where reasoning is more efficient. DLCM discovers variable-length concepts end-to-end without relying on predefined linguistic units. Hierarchical compression fundamentally changes scaling behavior. We introduce the first $\textbf{compression-aware scaling law}$, which disentangles token-level capacity, concept-level reasoning capacity, and compression ratio, enabling principled compute allocation under fixed FLOPs. To stably train this heterogeneous architecture, we further develop a $\textbf{decoupled $\mu$P parametrization}$ that supports zero-shot hyperparameter transfer across widths and compression regimes. At a practical setting ($R=4$, corresponding to an average of four tokens per concept), DLCM reallocates roughly one-third of inference compute into a higher-capacity reasoning backbone, achieving a $\textbf{+2.69$\%$ average improvement}$ across 12 zero-shot benchmarks under matched inference FLOPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Cheng, Weitao Zhou, Cheng Jing, Nanshan Deng, Junze Wen, Zhaoyang Liu, Kun Jiang, Diange Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world autonomous driving must adhere to complex human social rules that extend beyond legally codified traffic regulations. Many of these semantic constraints, such as yielding to emergency vehicles, complying with traffic officers' gestures, or stopping for school buses, are intuitive for humans yet difficult to encode explicitly. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) can interpret such semantics, their inference cost makes them impractical for real-time deployment. This work proposes LSRE, a Latent Semantic Rule Encoding framework that converts sparsely sampled VLM judgments into decision boundaries within the latent space of a recurrent world model. By encoding language-defined safety semantics into a lightweight latent classifier, LSRE enables real-time semantic risk assessment at 10 Hz without per-frame VLM queries. Experiments on six semantic-failure scenarios in CARLA demonstrate that LSRE attains semantic risk detection accuracy comparable to a large VLM baseline, while providing substantially earlier hazard anticipation and maintaining low computational latency. LSRE further generalizes to rarely seen semantic-similar test cases, indicating that language-guided latent classification offers an effective and deployable mechanism for semantic safety monitoring in autonomous driving.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, studies exemplified by Hyper-Connections (HC) have extended the ubiquitous residual connection paradigm established over the past decade by expanding the residual stream width and diversifying connectivity patterns. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikhil Garg, Anxiong Song, Niklas Plessnig, Nathan Savoia, Laura B\'egon-Lours</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are strongly affected by non-stationary neural signals that vary across sessions and individuals, limiting the generalization of subject-agnostic models and motivating adaptive and personalized learning on resource-constrained platforms. Programmable memristive hardware offers a promising substrate for such post-deployment adaptation; however, practical realization is challenged by limited weight resolution, device variability, nonlinear programming dynamics, and finite device endurance. In this work, we show that spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be deployed on ferroelectric memristive synaptic devices for adaptive EEG-based motor imagery decoding under realistic device constraints. We fabricate, characterize, and model ferroelectric synapses. We evaluate a convolutional-recurrent SNN architecture under two complementary deployment strategies: (i) device-aware training using a ferroelectric synapse model, and (ii) transfer of software-trained weights followed by low-overhead on-device re-tuning. To enable efficient adaptation, we introduce a device-aware weight-update strategy in which gradient-based updates are accumulated digitally and converted into discrete programming events only when a threshold is exceeded, emulating nonlinear, state-dependent programming dynamics while reducing programming frequency. Both deployment strategies achieve classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art software-based SNNs. Furthermore, subject-specific transfer learning achieved by retraining only the final network layers improves classification accuracy. These results demonstrate that programmable ferroelectric hardware can support robust, low-overhead adaptation in spiking neural networks, opening a practical path toward personalized neuromorphic processing of neural signals.</p>
