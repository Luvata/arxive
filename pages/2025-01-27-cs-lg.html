<p><b>Authors:</b> Baochen Xiong, Xiaoshan Yang, Yaguang Song, Yaowei Wang, Changsheng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore a novel federated multimodal instruction tuning task(FedMIT), which is significant for collaboratively fine-tuning MLLMs on different types of multimodal instruction data on distributed devices. To solve the new task, we propose a federated multimodal instruction tuning framework(Pilot). Our framework integrates two stages of "adapter on adapter" into the connector of the vision encoder and the LLM. In stage 1, we extract task-specific features and client-specific features from visual information. In stage 2, we build the cross-task Mixture-of-Adapters(CT-MoA) module to perform cross-task interaction. Each client can not only capture personalized information of local data and learn task-related multimodal information, but also learn general knowledge from other tasks. In addition, we introduce an adaptive parameter aggregation strategy for text training parameters, which optimizes parameter aggregation by calculating weights based on the euclidean distance between parameters, so that parameter aggregation can benefit from positive effects to the greatest extent while effectively reducing negative effects. Our framework can collaboratively exploit distributed data from different local clients to learn cross-task knowledge without being affected by the task heterogeneity during instruction tuning. The effectiveness of our method is verified in two different cross-task scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivek Bharadwaj, Austin Scott Glover, Aydin Buluc, James Demmel</p>
<p>Abstract: Rotation equivariant graph neural networks, i.e., networks designed to guarantee certain geometric relations between their inputs and outputs, yield state-of-the-art performance on spatial deep learning tasks. They exhibit high data efficiency during training and significantly reduced inference time for interatomic potential calculations compared to classical approaches. Key to these models is the Clebsch-Gordon (CG) tensor product, a kernel that contracts two dense feature vectors with a highly structured sparse tensor to produce a dense output vector. The operation, which may be repeated millions of times for typical equivariant models, is a costly and inefficient bottleneck. We introduce a GPU sparse kernel generator for the CG tensor product that provides significant speedup over the best existing open and closed-source implementations. Our implementation achieves high performance by carefully managing GPU shared memory through static analysis at model compile-time, minimizing reads and writes to global memory. We break the tensor product into a series of kernels with operands that fit entirely into registers, enabling us to emit long arithmetic instruction streams that maximize instruction-level parallelism. By fusing the CG tensor product with a subsequent graph convolution, we reduce both intermediate storage and global memory traffic over naive approaches that duplicate input data. We also provide optimized kernels for the gradient of the CG tensor product and a novel identity for the higher partial derivatives required to predict interatomic forces. Our fused kernels offer up to 4.5x speedup for the forward pass and 3x for the backward pass over NVIDIA cuEquivariance, as well as >10x speedup over the widely-used e3nn package. We offer up to 5.3x inference-time speedup for the MACE chemistry foundation model over the original unoptimized version.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13987">OstQuant: Refining Large Language Model Quantization with Orthogonal and Scaling Transformations for Better Distribution Fitting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xing Hu, Yuan Cheng, Dawei Yang, Zukang Xu, Zhihang Yuan, Jiangyong Yu, Chen Xu, Zhe Jiang, Sifan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing and accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs). The major challenge in LLM quantization is that uneven and heavy-tailed data distributions can expand the quantization range, thereby reducing bit precision for most values. Recent methods attempt to eliminate outliers and balance inter-channel differences by employing linear transformations; however, they remain heuristic and are often overlook optimizing the data distribution across the entire quantization space.In this paper, we introduce Quantization Space Utilization Rate (QSUR), a novel metric that effectively assesses the quantizability of transformed data by measuring the space utilization of the data in the quantization space. We complement QSUR with mathematical derivations that examine the effects and limitations of various transformations, guiding our development of Orthogonal and Scaling Transformation-based Quantization (OSTQuant). OSQuant employs a learnable equivalent transformation, consisting of an orthogonal transformation and a scaling transformation, to optimize the distributions of weights and activations across the entire quantization space. Futhermore, we propose the KL-Top loss function, designed to mitigate noise during optimization while retaining richer semantic information within the limited calibration data imposed by PTQ. OSTQuant outperforms existing work on various LLMs and benchmarks. In the W4-only setting, it retains 99.5\% of the floating-point accuracy. In the more challenging W4A4KV4 configuration, OSTQuant reduces the performance gap by 32\% on the LLaMA-3-8B model compared to state-of-the-art methods. \href{https://github.com/BrotherHappy/OSTQuant}{https://github.com/BrotherHappy/OSTQuant}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenzhen Yue, Yong Liu, Xianghua Ying, Bowei Xing, Ruohao Guo, Ji Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents \textbf{FreEformer}, a simple yet effective model that leverages a \textbf{Fre}quency \textbf{E}nhanced Trans\textbf{former} for multivariate time series forecasting. Our work is based on the assumption that the frequency spectrum provides a global perspective on the composition of series across various frequencies and is highly suitable for robust representation learning. Specifically, we first convert time series into the complex frequency domain using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The Transformer architecture is then applied to the frequency spectra to capture cross-variate dependencies, with the real and imaginary parts processed independently. However, we observe that the vanilla attention matrix exhibits a low-rank characteristic, thus limiting representation diversity. This could be attributed to the inherent sparsity of the frequency domain and the strong-value-focused nature of Softmax in vanilla attention. To address this, we enhance the vanilla attention mechanism by introducing an additional learnable matrix to the original attention matrix, followed by row-wise L1 normalization. Theoretical analysis~demonstrates that this enhanced attention mechanism improves both feature diversity and gradient flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreEformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on eighteen real-world benchmarks covering electricity, traffic, weather, healthcare and finance. Notably, the enhanced attention mechanism also consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art Transformer-based forecasters.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13992">Dual-Branch HNSW Approach with Skip Bridges and LID-Driven Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hy Nguyen, Nguyen Hung Nguyen, Nguyen Linh Bao Nguyen, Srikanth Thudumu, Hung Du, Rajesh Vasa, Kon Mouzakis</p>
<p>Abstract: The Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm is widely used for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, leveraging the principles of navigable small-world graphs. However, it faces some limitations. The first is the local optima problem, which arises from the algorithm's greedy search strategy, selecting neighbors based solely on proximity at each step. This often leads to cluster disconnections. The second limitation is that HNSW frequently fails to achieve logarithmic complexity, particularly in high-dimensional datasets, due to the exhaustive traversal through each layer. To address these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm that mitigates local optima and cluster disconnections while enhancing the construction speed, maintaining inference speed. The first component is a dual-branch HNSW structure with LID-based insertion mechanisms, enabling traversal from multiple directions. This improves outlier node capture, enhances cluster connectivity, accelerates construction speed and reduces the risk of local minima. The second component incorporates a bridge-building technique that bypasses redundant intermediate layers, maintaining inference and making up the additional computational overhead introduced by the dual-branch structure. Experiments on various benchmarks and datasets showed that our algorithm outperforms the original HNSW in both accuracy and speed. We evaluated six datasets across Computer Vision (CV), and Natural Language Processing (NLP), showing recall improvements of 18\% in NLP, and up to 30\% in CV tasks while reducing the construction time by up to 20\% and maintaining the inference speed. We did not observe any trade-offs in our algorithm. Ablation studies revealed that LID-based insertion had the greatest impact on performance, followed by the dual-branch structure and bridge-building components.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13997">Predictive Learning in Energy-based Models with Attractor Structures</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingsi Dong, Pengxiang Yuan, Si Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Predictive models are highly advanced in understanding the mechanisms of brain function. Recent advances in machine learning further underscore the power of prediction for optimal representation in learning. However, there remains a gap in creating a biologically plausible model that explains how the neural system achieves prediction. In this paper, we introduce a framework that employs an energy-based model (EBM) to capture the nuanced processes of predicting observation after action within the neural system, encompassing prediction, learning, and inference. We implement the EBM with a hierarchical structure and integrate a continuous attractor neural network for memory, constructing a biologically plausible model. In experimental evaluations, our model demonstrates efficacy across diverse scenarios. The range of actions includes eye movement, motion in environments, head turning, and static observation while the environment changes. Our model not only makes accurate predictions for environments it was trained on, but also provides reasonable predictions for unseen environments, matching the performances of machine learning methods in multiple tasks. We hope that this study contributes to a deep understanding of how the neural system performs prediction.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14000">Local Control Networks (LCNs): Optimizing Flexibility in Neural Network Data Pattern Capture</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hy Nguyen, Duy Khoa Pham, Srikanth Thudumu, Hung Du, Rajesh Vasa, Kon Mouzakis</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) often relies on a fixed activation function (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh) for all nodes within the hidden layers. While effective in many scenarios, this uniformity may limit the networks ability to capture complex data patterns. We argue that employing the same activation function at every node is suboptimal and propose leveraging different activation functions at each node to increase flexibility and adaptability. To achieve this, we introduce Local Control Networks (LCNs), which leverage B-spline functions to enable distinct activation curves at each node. Our mathematical analysis demonstrates the properties and benefits of LCNs over conventional MLPs. In addition, we demonstrate that more complex architectures, such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), are unnecessary in certain scenarios, and LCNs can be a more efficient alternative. Empirical experiments on various benchmarks and datasets validate our theoretical findings. In computer vision tasks, LCNs achieve marginal improvements over MLPs and outperform KANs by approximately 5\%, while also being more computationally efficient than KANs. In basic machine learning tasks, LCNs show a 1\% improvement over MLPs and a 0.6\% improvement over KANs. For symbolic formula representation tasks, LCNs perform on par with KANs, with both architectures outperforming MLPs. Our findings suggest that diverse activations at the node level can lead to improved performance and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Armand Lacombe, Mich\`ele Sebag</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation, at the heart of counterfactual reasoning, is a crucial challenge for causal modeling both theoretically and applicatively, in domains such as healthcare, sociology, or advertising. Borrowing domain adaptation principles, a popular design maps the sample representation to a latent space that balances control and treated populations while enabling the prediction of the potential outcomes. This paper presents a new CATE estimation approach based on the asymmetrical search for two latent spaces called Asymmetrical Latent Representation for Individual Treatment Effect (ALRITE), where the two latent spaces are respectively intended to optimize the counterfactual prediction accuracy on the control and the treated samples. Under moderate assumptions, ALRITE admits an upper bound on the precision of the estimation of heterogeneous effects (PEHE), and the approach is empirically successfully validated compared to the state-of-the-art</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Parameshwaran, Yue Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing formal verification methods for image-based neural network controllers in autonomous vehicles often struggle with high-dimensional inputs, computational inefficiency, and a lack of explainability. These challenges make it difficult to ensure safety and reliability, as processing high-dimensional image data is computationally intensive and neural networks are typically treated as black boxes. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{SEVIN} (Scalable and Explainable Verification of Image-Based Neural Network Controllers), a framework that leverages a Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to encode high-dimensional images into a lower-dimensional, explainable latent space. By annotating latent variables with corresponding control actions, we generate convex polytopes that serve as structured input spaces for verification, significantly reducing computational complexity and enhancing scalability. Integrating the VAE's decoder with the neural network controller allows for formal and robustness verification using these explainable polytopes. Our approach also incorporates robustness verification under real-world perturbations by augmenting the dataset and retraining the VAE to capture environmental variations. Experimental results demonstrate that SEVIN achieves efficient and scalable verification while providing explainable insights into controller behavior, bridging the gap between formal verification techniques and practical applications in safety-critical systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuaiqun Pan, Diederick Vermetten, Manuel L\'opez-Ib\'a\~nez, Thomas B\"ack, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Surrogate models are frequently employed as efficient substitutes for the costly execution of real-world processes. However, constructing a high-quality surrogate model often demands extensive data acquisition. A solution to this issue is to transfer pre-trained surrogate models for new tasks, provided that certain invariances exist between tasks. This study focuses on transferring non-differentiable surrogate models (e.g., random forest) from a source function to a target function, where we assume their domains are related by an unknown affine transformation, using only a limited amount of transfer data points evaluated on the target. Previous research attempts to tackle this challenge for differentiable models, e.g., Gaussian process regression, which minimizes the empirical loss on the transfer data by tuning the affine transformations. In this paper, we extend the previous work to the random forest model and assess its effectiveness on a widely-used artificial problem set - Black-Box Optimization Benchmark (BBOB) testbed, and on four real-world transfer learning problems. The results highlight the significant practical advantages of the proposed method, particularly in reducing both the data requirements and computational costs of training surrogate models for complex real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Blot, Alexandra Lorenzo de Brionne, Ines Sellami, Olivier Trassard, Isabelle Beau, Charlotte Sonigo, Nicolas J-B. Brunel</p>
<p>Abstract: Image analysis is a key tool for describing the detailed mechanisms of folliculogenesis, such as evaluating the quantity of mouse Primordial ovarian Follicles (PMF) in the ovarian reserve. The development of high-resolution virtual slide scanners offers the possibility of quantifying, robustifying and accelerating the histopathological procedure. A major challenge for machine learning is to control the precision of predictions while enabling a high recall, in order to provide reproducibility. We use a multiple testing procedure that gives an overperforming way to solve the standard Precision-Recall trade-off that gives probabilistic guarantees on the precision. In addition, we significantly improve the overall performance of the models (increase of F1-score) by selecting the decision threshold using contextual biological information or using an auxiliary model. As it is model-agnostic, this contextual selection procedure paves the way to the development of a strategy that can improve the performance of any model without the need of retraining it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sneh Pandya, Purvik Patel, Brian D. Nord, Mike Walmsley, Aleksandra \'Ciprijanovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern neural networks (NNs) often do not generalize well in the presence of a "covariate shift"; that is, in situations where the training and test data distributions differ, but the conditional distribution of classification labels remains unchanged. In such cases, NN generalization can be reduced to a problem of learning more domain-invariant features. Domain adaptation (DA) methods include a range of techniques aimed at achieving this; however, these methods have struggled with the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, which then incurs significant computational costs. In this work, we introduce SIDDA, an out-of-the-box DA training algorithm built upon the Sinkhorn divergence, that can achieve effective domain alignment with minimal hyperparameter tuning and computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple simulated and real datasets of varying complexity, including simple shapes, handwritten digits, and real astronomical observations. SIDDA is compatible with a variety of NN architectures, and it works particularly well in improving classification accuracy and model calibration when paired with equivariant neural networks (ENNs). We find that SIDDA enhances the generalization capabilities of NNs, achieving up to a $\approx40\%$ improvement in classification accuracy on unlabeled target data. We also study the efficacy of DA on ENNs with respect to the varying group orders of the dihedral group $D_N$, and find that the model performance improves as the degree of equivariance increases. Finally, we find that SIDDA enhances model calibration on both source and target data--achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in the ECE and Brier score. SIDDA's versatility, combined with its automated approach to domain alignment, has the potential to advance multi-dataset studies by enabling the development of highly generalizable models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Liang, Yuhui Wang, Changjiang Li, Rongyi Zhu, Tanqiu Jiang, Neil Gong, Ting Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: GraphRAG advances retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by structuring external knowledge as multi-scale knowledge graphs, enabling language models to integrate both broad context and granular details in their reasoning. While GraphRAG has demonstrated success across domains, its security implications remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, this work examines GraphRAG's vulnerability to poisoning attacks, uncovering an intriguing security paradox: compared to conventional RAG, GraphRAG's graph-based indexing and retrieval enhance resilience against simple poisoning attacks; meanwhile, the same features also create new attack surfaces. We present GRAGPoison, a novel attack that exploits shared relations in the knowledge graph to craft poisoning text capable of compromising multiple queries simultaneously. GRAGPoison employs three key strategies: i) relation injection to introduce false knowledge, ii) relation enhancement to amplify poisoning influence, and iii) narrative generation to embed malicious content within coherent text. Empirical evaluation across diverse datasets and models shows that GRAGPoison substantially outperforms existing attacks in terms of effectiveness (up to 98% success rate) and scalability (using less than 68% poisoning text). We also explore potential defensive measures and their limitations, identifying promising directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bolian Li, Ruqi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-tailed classification is challenging due to its heavy imbalance in class probabilities. While existing methods often focus on overall accuracy or accuracy for tail classes, they overlook a critical aspect: certain types of errors can carry greater risks than others in real-world long-tailed problems. For example, misclassifying patients (a tail class) as healthy individuals (a head class) entails far more serious consequences than the reverse scenario. To address this critical issue, we introduce Making Reliable and Flexible Decisions in Long-tailed Classification (RF-DLC), a novel framework aimed at reliable predictions in long-tailed problems. Leveraging Bayesian Decision Theory, we introduce an integrated gain to seamlessly combine long-tailed data distributions and the decision-making procedure. We further propose an efficient variational optimization strategy for the decision risk objective. Our method adapts readily to diverse utility matrices, which can be designed for specific tasks, ensuring its flexibility for different problem settings. In empirical evaluation, we design a new metric, False Head Rate, to quantify tail-sensitivity risk, along with comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world tasks, including large-scale image classification and uncertainty quantification, to demonstrate the reliability and flexibility of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite progresses in data engineering, there are areas with limited consistencies across data validation and documentation procedures causing confusions and technical problems in research involving machine learning. There have been progresses by introducing frameworks like "Datasheets for Datasets", however there are areas for improvements to prepare datasets, ready for ML pipelines. Here, we extend the framework to "Datasheets for AI and medical datasets - DAIMS." Our publicly available solution, DAIMS, provides a checklist including data standardization requirements, a software tool to assist the process of the data preparation, an extended form for data documentation and pose research questions, a table as data dictionary, and a flowchart to suggest ML analyses to address the research questions. The checklist consists of 24 common data standardization requirements, where the tool checks and validate a subset of them. In addition, we provided a flowchart mapping research questions to suggested ML methods. DAIMS can serve as a reference for standardizing datasets and a roadmap for researchers aiming to apply effective ML techniques in their medical research endeavors. DAIMS is available on GitHub and as an online app to automate key aspects of dataset evaluation, facilitating efficient preparation of datasets for ML studies.</p>

We propose a scalable approach to decode linear block codes with $O(n)$ complexity rather than $O(n^2)$ for regular transformers. The architectures' performances are compared to Belief Propagation (BP), the production-level decoding algorithm used for 5G New Radio (NR) LDPC codes. We achieve bit error rate performance that matches a regular Transformer decoder and surpases one iteration BP, also achieving competitive time performance against BP, even for larger block codes. We utilize Sionna, Nvidia's 5G & 6G physical layer research software, for reproducible results.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the realm of online advertising, optimizing conversions is crucial for delivering relevant products to users and enhancing business outcomes. Predicting conversion events is challenging due to variable delays between user interactions, such as impressions or clicks, and the actual conversions. These delays differ significantly across various advertisers and products, necessitating distinct optimization time windows for targeted conversions. To address this, we introduce a novel approach named the \textit{Personalized Interpolation} method, which innovatively builds upon existing fixed conversion window models to estimate flexible conversion windows. This method allows for the accurate estimation of conversions across a variety of delay ranges, thus meeting the diverse needs of advertisers without increasing system complexity. To validate the efficacy of our proposed method, we conducted comprehensive experiments using ads conversion model. Our experiments demonstrate that this method not only achieves high prediction accuracy but also does so more efficiently than other existing solutions. This validation underscores the potential of our Personalized Interpolation method to significantly enhance conversion optimization in real-world online advertising systems, promising improved targeting and effectiveness in advertising strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olivier Mulkin, Miguel Heleno, Mike Ludkovski</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop a new methodology to select scenarios of DER adoption most critical for distribution grids. Anticipating risks of future voltage and line flow violations due to additional PV adopters is central for utility investment planning but continues to rely on deterministic or ad hoc scenario selection. We propose a highly efficient search framework based on multi-objective Bayesian Optimization. We treat underlying grid stress metrics as computationally expensive black-box functions, approximated via Gaussian Process surrogates and design an acquisition function based on probability of scenarios being Pareto-critical across a collection of line- and bus-based violation objectives. Our approach provides a statistical guarantee and offers an order of magnitude speed-up relative to a conservative exhaustive search. Case studies on realistic feeders with 200-400 buses demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumyendu Sarkar, Ashwin Ramesh Babu, Sajad Mousavi, Vineet Gundecha, Sahand Ghorbanpour, Avisek Naug, Ricardo Luna Gutierrez, Antonio Guillen</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a Reinforcement Learning Platform for Adversarial Black-box untargeted and targeted attacks, RLAB, that allows users to select from various distortion filters to create adversarial examples. The platform uses a Reinforcement Learning agent to add minimum distortion to input images while still causing misclassification by the target model. The agent uses a novel dual-action method to explore the input image at each step to identify sensitive regions for adding distortions while removing noises that have less impact on the target model. This dual action leads to faster and more efficient convergence of the attack. The platform can also be used to measure the robustness of image classification models against specific distortion types. Also, retraining the model with adversarial samples significantly improved robustness when evaluated on benchmark datasets. The proposed platform outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of the average number of queries required to cause misclassification. This advances trustworthiness with a positive social impact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonid Schwenke, Martin Atzmueller</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work uncovered potential flaws in \eg attribution or heatmap based saliency methods. A typical flaw is a confirmations bias, where the scores are compared to human expectation. Since measuring the quality of saliency methods is hard due to missing ground truth model reasoning, finding general limitations is also hard. This is further complicated, because masking-based evaluation on complex data can easily introduce a bias, as most methods cannot fully ignore inputs. In this work, we extend our previous analysis on the logical dataset framework ANDOR, where we showed that all analysed saliency methods fail to grasp all needed classification information for all possible scenarios. Specifically, this paper extends our previous work using analysis on more datasets, in order to better understand in which scenarios the saliency methods fail. Further, we apply the Global Coherence Representation as an additional evaluation method in order to enable actual input omission.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitris Bertsimas, Lisa Everest, Vasiliki Stoumpou</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a multimodal deep learning framework, Prescriptive Neural Networks (PNNs), that combines ideas from optimization and machine learning, and is, to the best of our knowledge, the first prescriptive method to handle multimodal data. The PNN is a feedforward neural network trained on embeddings to output an outcome-optimizing prescription. In two real-world multimodal datasets, we demonstrate that PNNs prescribe treatments that are able to significantly improve estimated outcomes in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures by reducing estimated postoperative complication rates by 32% and in liver trauma injuries by reducing estimated mortality rates by over 40%. In four real-world, unimodal tabular datasets, we demonstrate that PNNs outperform or perform comparably to other well-known, state-of-the-art prescriptive models; importantly, on tabular datasets, we also recover interpretability through knowledge distillation, fitting interpretable Optimal Classification Tree models onto the PNN prescriptions as classification targets, which is critical for many real-world applications. Finally, we demonstrate that our multimodal PNN models achieve stability across randomized data splits comparable to other prescriptive methods and produce realistic prescriptions across the different datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yile Gu, Yifan Xiong, Jonathan Mace, Yuting Jiang, Yigong Hu, Baris Kasikci, Peng Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Observability in cloud infrastructure is critical for service providers, driving the widespread adoption of anomaly detection systems for monitoring metrics. However, existing systems often struggle to simultaneously achieve explainability, reproducibility, and autonomy, which are three indispensable properties for production use. We introduce Argos, an agentic system for detecting time-series anomalies in cloud infrastructure by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Argos proposes to use explainable and reproducible anomaly rules as intermediate representation and employs LLMs to autonomously generate such rules. The system will efficiently train error-free and accuracy-guaranteed anomaly rules through multiple collaborative agents and deploy the trained rules for low-cost online anomaly detection. Through evaluation results, we demonstrate that Argos outperforms state-of-the-art methods, increasing $F_1$ scores by up to $9.5\%$ and $28.3\%$ on public anomaly detection datasets and an internal dataset collected from Microsoft, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suresh Babu Nettur, Shanthi Karpurapu, Unnati Nettur, Likhit Sagar Gajja, Sravanthy Myneni, Akhil Dusi, Lalithya Posham</p>
<p>Abstract: Lightweight deep learning approaches for malaria detection have gained attention for their potential to enhance diagnostics in resource constrained environments. For our study, we selected SqueezeNet1.1 as it is one of the most popular lightweight architectures. SqueezeNet1.1 is a later version of SqueezeNet1.0 and is 2.4 times more computationally efficient than the original model. We proposed and implemented three ultra-lightweight architecture variants to SqueezeNet1.1 architecture, namely Variant 1 (one fire module), Variant 2 (two fire modules), and Variant 3 (four fire modules), which are even more compact than SqueezeNetV1.1 (eight fire modules). These models were implemented to evaluate the best performing variant that achieves superior computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy in malaria blood cell classification. The models were trained and evaluated using the NIH Malaria dataset. We assessed each model's performance based on metrics including accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The results show that the SqueezeNet1.1 model achieves the highest performance across all metrics, with a classification accuracy of 97.12%. Variant 3 (four fire modules) offers a competitive alternative, delivering almost identical results (accuracy 96.55%) with a 6x reduction in computational overhead compared to SqueezeNet1.1. Variant 2 and Variant 1 perform slightly lower than Variant 3, with Variant 2 (two fire modules) reducing computational overhead by 28x, and Variant 1 (one fire module) achieving a 54x reduction in trainable parameters compared to SqueezeNet1.1. These findings demonstrate that our SqueezeNet1.1 architecture variants provide a flexible approach to malaria detection, enabling the selection of a variant that balances resource constraints and performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Given that disturbances to the stable and normal operation of power systems have grown phenomenally, particularly in terms of unauthorized access to confidential and critical data, injection of malicious software, and exploitation of security vulnerabilities in a poorly patched software among others; then developing, as a countermeasure, an assessment solutions with machine learning capabilities to match up in real-time, with the growth and fast pace of these cyber-attacks, is not only critical to the security, reliability and safe operation of power system, but also germane to guaranteeing advanced monitoring and efficient threat detection. Using the Mississippi State University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory dataset, the study used an XGB Classifier modeling approach in machine learning to diagnose and assess power system disturbances, in terms of Attack Events, Natural Events and No-Events. As test results show, the model, in all the three sub-datasets, generally demonstrates good performance on all metrics, as it relates to accurately identifying and classifying all the three power system events.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Micah Rentschler, Jesse Roberts</p>
<p>Abstract: What if artificial intelligence could not only solve problems for which it was trained but also learn to teach itself to solve new problems (i.e., meta-learn)? In this study, we demonstrate that a pre-trained transformer fine-tuned with reinforcement learning over multiple episodes develops the ability to solve problems that it has never encountered before - an emergent ability called In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL). This powerful meta-learner not only excels in solving unseen in-distribution environments with remarkable sample efficiency, but also shows strong performance in out-of-distribution environments. In addition, we show that it exhibits robustness to the quality of its training data, seamlessly stitches together behaviors from its context, and adapts to non-stationary environments. These behaviors demonstrate that an RL-trained transformer can iteratively improve upon its own solutions, making it an excellent general-purpose problem solver.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhyeok Kang, Yooju Shin, Jae-Gil Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Variate tokenization, which independently embeds each variate as separate tokens, has achieved remarkable improvements in multivariate time series forecasting. However, employing self-attention with variate tokens incurs a quadratic computational cost with respect to the number of variates, thus limiting its training efficiency for large-scale applications. To address this issue, we propose VarDrop, a simple yet efficient strategy that reduces the token usage by omitting redundant variate tokens during training. VarDrop adaptively excludes redundant tokens within a given batch, thereby reducing the number of tokens used for dot-product attention while preserving essential information. Specifically, we introduce k-dominant frequency hashing (k-DFH), which utilizes the ranked dominant frequencies in the frequency domain as a hash value to efficiently group variate tokens exhibiting similar periodic behaviors. Then, only representative tokens in each group are sampled through stratified sampling. By performing sparse attention with these selected tokens, the computational cost of scaled dot-product attention is significantly alleviated. Experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that VarDrop outperforms existing efficient baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yitong Hao, Enbo He, Yue Zhang, Guisheng Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes from a graph that are significantly different from normal patterns. Most previous studies are model-driven, focusing on enhancing the detection effect by improving the model structure. However, these approaches often treat all nodes equally, neglecting the different contributions of various nodes to the training. Therefore, we introduce graph curriculum learning as a simple and effective plug-and-play module to optimize GAD methods. The existing graph curriculum learning mainly focuses on the homogeneity of graphs and treats nodes with high homogeneity as easy nodes. In fact, GAD models can handle not only graph homogeneity but also heterogeneity, which leads to the unsuitability of these existing methods. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Bi-directional Curriculum Learning strategy (BCL), which considers nodes with higher and lower similarity to neighbor nodes as simple nodes in the direction of focusing on homogeneity and focusing on heterogeneity, respectively, and prioritizes their training. Extensive experiments show that BCL can be quickly integrated into existing detection processes and significantly improves the performance of ten GAD anomaly detection models on seven commonly used datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulong Hu, Tingting Dong, Sen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework, termed Reward-Guided Conservative Q-learning (RG-CQL), to enhance coordination between ride-pooling and public transit within a multimodal transportation network. We model each ride-pooling vehicle as an agent governed by a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose an offline training and online fine-tuning RL framework to learn the optimal operational decisions of the multimodal transportation systems, including rider-vehicle matching, selection of drop-off locations for passengers, and vehicle routing decisions, with improved data efficiency. During the offline training phase, we develop a Conservative Double Deep Q Network (CDDQN) as the action executor and a supervised learning-based reward estimator, termed the Guider Network, to extract valuable insights into action-reward relationships from data batches. In the online fine-tuning phase, the Guider Network serves as an exploration guide, aiding CDDQN in effectively and conservatively exploring unknown state-action pairs. The efficacy of our algorithm is demonstrated through a realistic case study using real-world data from Manhattan. We show that integrating ride-pooling with public transit outperforms two benchmark cases solo rides coordinated with transit and ride-pooling without transit coordination by 17% and 22% in the achieved system rewards, respectively. Furthermore, our innovative offline training and online fine-tuning framework offers a remarkable 81.3% improvement in data efficiency compared to traditional online RL methods with adequate exploration budgets, with a 4.3% increase in total rewards and a 5.6% reduction in overestimation errors. Experimental results further demonstrate that RG-CQL effectively addresses the challenges of transitioning from offline to online RL in large-scale ride-pooling systems integrated with transit.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Chen, Lei Li, Qian Li, Jianghua Wu, Akang Wang, Ruoyu Sun, Xiaodong Luo, Tsung-Hui Chang, Qingjiang Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: A common characteristic in integer linear programs (ILPs) is symmetry, allowing variables to be permuted without altering the underlying problem structure. Recently, GNNs have emerged as a promising approach for solving ILPs. However, a significant challenge arises when applying GNNs to ILPs with symmetry: classic GNN architectures struggle to differentiate between symmetric variables, which limits their predictive accuracy. In this work, we investigate the properties of permutation equivariance and invariance in GNNs, particularly in relation to the inherent symmetry of ILP formulations. We reveal that the interaction between these two factors contributes to the difficulty of distinguishing between symmetric variables. To address this challenge, we explore the potential of feature augmentation and propose several guiding principles for constructing augmented features. Building on these principles, we develop an orbit-based augmentation scheme that first groups symmetric variables and then samples augmented features for each group from a discrete uniform distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly enhances both training efficiency and predictive performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Given an unconditional generative model and a predictor for a target property (e.g., a classifier), the goal of training-free guidance is to generate samples with desirable target properties without additional training. As a highly efficient technique for steering generative models toward flexible outcomes, training-free guidance has gained increasing attention in diffusion models. However, existing methods only handle data in continuous spaces, while many scientific applications involve both continuous and discrete data (referred to as multimodality). Another emerging trend is the growing use of the simple and general flow matching framework in building generative foundation models, where guided generation remains under-explored. To address this, we introduce TFG-Flow, a novel training-free guidance method for multimodal generative flow. TFG-Flow addresses the curse-of-dimensionality while maintaining the property of unbiased sampling in guiding discrete variables. We validate TFG-Flow on four molecular design tasks and show that TFG-Flow has great potential in drug design by generating molecules with desired properties.</p>

<p>Abstract: Renewable energy power is influenced by the atmospheric system, which exhibits nonlinear and time-varying features. To address this, a dynamic temporal correlation modeling framework is proposed for renewable energy scenario generation. A novel decoupled mapping path is employed for joint probability distribution modeling, formulating regression tasks for both marginal distributions and the correlation structure using proper scoring rules to ensure the rationality of the modeling process. The scenario generation process is divided into two stages. Firstly, the dynamic correlation network models temporal correlations based on a dynamic covariance matrix, capturing the time-varying features of renewable energy while enhancing the interpretability of the black-box model. Secondly, the implicit quantile network models the marginal quantile function in a nonparametric, continuous manner, enabling scenario generation through marginal inverse sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed dynamic correlation quantile network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quantifying uncertainty and capturing dynamic correlation for short-term renewable energy scenario generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Benchmarks are important tools for tracking the rapid advancements in large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, benchmarks are not keeping pace in difficulty: LLMs now achieve over 90\% accuracy on popular benchmarks like MMLU, limiting informed measurement of state-of-the-art LLM capabilities. In response, we introduce Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a multi-modal benchmark at the frontier of human knowledge, designed to be the final closed-ended academic benchmark of its kind with broad subject coverage. HLE consists of 3,000 questions across dozens of subjects, including mathematics, humanities, and the natural sciences. HLE is developed globally by subject-matter experts and consists of multiple-choice and short-answer questions suitable for automated grading. Each question has a known solution that is unambiguous and easily verifiable, but cannot be quickly answered via internet retrieval. State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate low accuracy and calibration on HLE, highlighting a significant gap between current LLM capabilities and the expert human frontier on closed-ended academic questions. To inform research and policymaking upon a clear understanding of model capabilities, we publicly release HLE at https://lastexam.ai.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14256">Revisiting Applicable and Comprehensive Knowledge Tracing in Large-Scale Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyun Zhou, Wenkang Han, Jingyuan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a fundamental component of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), enabling the modeling of students' knowledge states to predict future performance. The introduction of Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), the first deep learning-based KT (DLKT) model, has brought significant advantages in terms of applicability and comprehensiveness. However, recent DLKT models, such as Attentive Knowledge Tracing (AKT), have often prioritized predictive performance at the expense of these benefits. While deep sequential models like DKT have shown potential, they face challenges related to parallel computing, storage decision modification, and limited storage capacity. To address these limitations, we propose DKT2, a novel KT model that leverages the recently developed xLSTM architecture. DKT2 enhances input representation using the Rasch model and incorporates Item Response Theory (IRT) for interpretability, allowing for the decomposition of learned knowledge into familiar and unfamiliar knowledge. By integrating this knowledge with predicted questions, DKT2 generates comprehensive knowledge states. Extensive experiments conducted across three large-scale datasets demonstrate that DKT2 consistently outperforms 17 baseline models in various prediction tasks, underscoring its potential for real-world educational applications. This work bridges the gap between theoretical advancements and practical implementation in KT.Our code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/codebase-2025/DKT2.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14266">TrajFlow: A Generative Framework for Occupancy Density Estimation Using Normalizing Flows</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mitch Kosieradzki, Seongjin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: In transportation systems and autonomous vehicles, intelligent agents must understand the future motion of traffic participants to effectively plan motion trajectories. At the same time, the motion of traffic participants is inherently uncertain. In this paper, we propose TrajFlow, a generative framework for estimating the occupancy density of traffic participants. Our framework utilizes a causal encoder to extract semantically meaningful embeddings of the observed trajectory, as well as a normalizing flow to decode these embeddings and determine the most likely future location of traffic participants at some time point in the future. Our formulation differs from existing approaches because we model the marginal distribution of spatial locations instead of the joint distribution of unobserved trajectories. The advantages of a marginal formulation are numerous. First, we demonstrate that the marginal formulation produces higher accuracy on challenging trajectory forecasting benchmarks. Second, the marginal formulation allows for a fully continuous sampling of future locations. Finally, marginal densities are better suited for downstream tasks as they allow for the computation of per-agent motion trajectories and occupancy grids, the two most commonly used representations for motion forecasting. We present a novel architecture based entirely on neural differential equations as an implementation of this framework and provide ablations to demonstrate the advantages of a continuous implementation over a more traditional discrete neural network based approach. The code is available at https://github.com/kosieram21/TrajFlow .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoshihiro Mitsuka, Shadan Golestan, Zahin Sufiyan, Sheila Schoepp, Shotaro Miwa, Osmar R. Za\"iane</p>
<p>Abstract: The scheme of adaptation via meta-learning is seen as an ingredient for solving the problem of data shortage or distribution shift in real-world applications, but it also brings the new risk of inappropriate updates of the model in the user environment, which increases the demand for explainability. Among the various types of XAI methods, establishing a method of explanation based on past experience in meta-learning requires special consideration due to its bi-level structure of training, which has been left unexplored. In this work, we propose influence functions for explaining meta-learning that measure the sensitivities of training tasks to adaptation and inference. We also argue that the approximation of the Hessian using the Gauss-Newton matrix resolves computational barriers peculiar to meta-learning. We demonstrate the adequacy of the method through experiments on task distinction and task distribution distinction using image classification tasks with MAML and Prototypical Network.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14278">Active Learning for Continual Learning: Keeping the Past Alive in the Present</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehyun Park, Dongmin Park, Jae-Gil Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) enables deep neural networks to adapt to ever-changing data distributions. In practice, there may be scenarios where annotation is costly, leading to active continual learning (ACL), which performs active learning (AL) for the CL scenarios when reducing the labeling cost by selecting the most informative subset is preferable. However, conventional AL strategies are not suitable for ACL, as they focus solely on learning the new knowledge, leading to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. Therefore, ACL requires a new AL strategy that can balance the prevention of catastrophic forgetting and the ability to quickly learn new tasks. In this paper, we propose AccuACL, Accumulated informativeness-based Active Continual Learning, by the novel use of the Fisher information matrix as a criterion for sample selection, derived from a theoretical analysis of the Fisher-optimality preservation properties within the framework of ACL, while also addressing the scalability issue of Fisher information-based AL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AccuACL significantly outperforms AL baselines across various CL algorithms, increasing the average accuracy and forgetting by 23.8% and 17.0%, respectively, in average.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14291">Advances in Temporal Point Processes: Bayesian, Deep, and LLM Approaches</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Zhou, Quyu Kong, Yixuan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are stochastic process models used to characterize event sequences occurring in continuous time. Traditional statistical TPPs have a long-standing history, with numerous models proposed and successfully applied across diverse domains. In recent years, advances in deep learning have spurred the development of neural TPPs, enabling greater flexibility and expressiveness in capturing complex temporal dynamics. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further sparked excitement, offering new possibilities for modeling and analyzing event sequences by leveraging their rich contextual understanding. This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent research on TPPs from three perspectives: Bayesian, deep learning, and LLM approaches. We begin with a review of the fundamental concepts of TPPs, followed by an in-depth discussion of model design and parameter estimation techniques in these three frameworks. We also revisit classic application areas of TPPs to highlight their practical relevance. Finally, we outline challenges and promising directions for future research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14310">Permutation-based multi-objective evolutionary feature selection for high-dimensional data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Raquel Espinosa, Gracia S\'anchez, Jos\'e Palma, Fernando Jim\'enez</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature selection is a critical step in the analysis of high-dimensional data, where the number of features often vastly exceeds the number of samples. Effective feature selection not only improves model performance and interpretability but also reduces computational costs and mitigates the risk of overfitting. In this context, we propose a novel feature selection method for high-dimensional data, based on the well-known permutation feature importance approach, but extending it to evaluate subsets of attributes rather than individual features. This extension more effectively captures how interactions among features influence model performance. The proposed method employs a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to search for candidate feature subsets, with the objectives of maximizing the degradation in model performance when the selected features are shuffled, and minimizing the cardinality of the feature subset. The effectiveness of our method has been validated on a set of 24 publicly available high-dimensional datasets for classification and regression tasks, and compared against 9 well-established feature selection methods designed for high-dimensional problems, including the conventional permutation feature importance method. The results demonstrate the ability of our approach in balancing accuracy and computational efficiency, providing a powerful tool for feature selection in complex, high-dimensional datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14311">An Efficient Real Time DDoS Detection Model Using Machine Learning Algorithms</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Debashis Kar Suvra</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed Denial of Service attacks have become a significant threat to industries and governments leading to substantial financial losses. With the growing reliance on internet services, DDoS attacks can disrupt services by overwhelming servers with false traffic causing downtime and data breaches. Although various detection techniques exist, selecting an effective method remains challenging due to trade-offs between time efficiency and accuracy. This research focuses on developing an efficient real-time DDoS detection system using machine learning algorithms leveraging the UNB CICDDoS2019 dataset including various traffic features. The study aims to classify DDoS and non-DDoS traffic through various ML classifiers including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes. The dataset is preprocessed through data cleaning, standardization and feature selection techniques using Principal Component Analysis. The research explores the performance of these algorithms in terms of precision, recall and F1-score as well as time complexity to create a reliable system capable of real-time detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks. The findings indicate that RF, AdaBoost and XGBoost outperform other algorithms in accuracy and efficiency, making them ideal candidates for real-time applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Qi, Fei Guo, Li Zhu, Qiaosheng Zhang, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with graph feedback. Motivated by applications in clinical trials and recommendation systems, we assume that two arms are connected if and only if they are similar (i.e., their means are close to each other). We establish a regret lower bound for this problem under the novel feedback structure and introduce two upper confidence bound (UCB)-based algorithms: Double-UCB, which has problem-independent regret upper bounds, and Conservative-UCB, which has problem-dependent upper bounds. Leveraging the similarity structure, we also explore a scenario where the number of arms increases over time (referred to as the \emph{ballooning setting}). Practical applications of this scenario include Q\&A platforms (e.g., Reddit, Stack Overflow, Quora) and product reviews on platforms like Amazon and Flipkart, where answers (or reviews) continuously appear, and the goal is to display the best ones at the top. We extend these two UCB-based algorithms to the ballooning setting. Under mild assumptions, we provide regret upper bounds for both algorithms and discuss their sub-linearity. Furthermore, we propose a new version of the corresponding algorithms that do not rely on prior knowledge of the graph's structural information and provide regret upper bounds. Finally, we conduct experiments to validate the theoretical results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mann Patel, Divyajyoti Panda, Hilay Mehta, Parth Patel, Dhruv Parikh</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is an efficient alternative to full scale fine-tuning, gaining popularity recently. With pre-trained model sizes growing exponentially, PEFT can be effectively utilized to fine-tune compact modules, Parameter-Efficient Modules (PEMs), trained to be domain experts over diverse domains. In this project, we explore composing such individually fine-tuned PEMs for distribution generalization over the composite domain. To compose PEMs, simple composing functions are used that operate purely on the weight space of the individually fine-tuned PEMs, without requiring any additional fine-tuning. The proposed method is applied to the task of representing the 16 Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) composite personalities via 4 building block dichotomies, comprising of 8 individual traits which can be merged (composed) to yield a unique personality. We evaluate the individual trait PEMs and the composed personality PEMs via an online MBTI personality quiz questionnaire, validating the efficacy of PEFT to fine-tune PEMs and merging PEMs without further fine-tuning for domain composition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Nyiri, Olivier Gibaru</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning methods are solving very successfully a plethora of tasks, but they have the disadvantage of not providing any information about their decision. Consequently, estimating the reasoning of the system provides additional information. For this, Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) is one of the methods in eXplainable Machine Learning (XML). Its purpose is to provide contributions of any neural network output in the domain of its input. The main drawback of current methods is mainly due to division by small values. To overcome this problem, we provide a new definition called Relative LRP where the classical conservation law is satisfied up to a multiplicative factor but without divisions by small values except for Resnet skip connection. In this article, we will focus on image classification. This allows us to visualize the contributions of a pixel to the predictions of a multi-layer neural network. Pixel contributions provide a focus to further analysis on regions of potential interest. R-LRP can be applied for any dense, CNN or residual neural networks. Moreover, R-LRP doesn't need any hyperparameters to tune contrary to other LRP methods. We then compare the R-LRP method on different datasets with simple CNN, VGG16, VGG19 and Resnet50 networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boshko koloski, Nada Lavra\v{c}, Bla\v{z} \v{S}krlj</p>
<p>Abstract: Construction of neural network architectures suitable for learning from both continuous and discrete tabular data is a challenging research endeavor. Contemporary high-dimensional tabular data sets are often characterized by a relatively small instance count, requiring data-efficient learning. We propose HorNets (Horn Networks), a neural network architecture with state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-life data sets from scarce-data tabular domains. HorNets are based on a clipped polynomial-like activation function, extended by a custom discrete-continuous routing mechanism that decides which part of the neural network to optimize based on the input's cardinality. By explicitly modeling parts of the feature combination space or combining whole space in a linear attention-like manner, HorNets dynamically decide which mode of operation is the most suitable for a given piece of data with no explicit supervision. This architecture is one of the few approaches that reliably retrieves logical clauses (including noisy XNOR) and achieves state-of-the-art classification performance on 14 real-life biomedical high-dimensional data sets. HorNets are made freely available under a permissive license alongside a synthetic generator of categorical benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shinsaku Sakaue, Taira Tsuchiya, Han Bao, Taihei Oki</p>
<p>Abstract: We study an online learning problem where, over $T$ rounds, a learner observes both time-varying sets of feasible actions and an agent's optimal actions, selected by solving linear optimization over the feasible actions. The learner sequentially makes predictions of the agent's underlying linear objective function, and their quality is measured by the regret, the cumulative gap between optimal objective values and those achieved by following the learner's predictions. A seminal work by B\"armann et al. (ICML 2017) showed that online learning methods can be applied to this problem to achieve regret bounds of $O(\sqrt{T})$. Recently, Besbes et al. (COLT 2021, Oper. Res. 2023) significantly improved the result by achieving an $O(n^4\ln T)$ regret bound, where $n$ is the dimension of the ambient space of objective vectors. Their method, based on the ellipsoid method, runs in polynomial time but is inefficient for large $n$ and $T$. In this paper, we obtain an $O(n\ln T)$ regret bound, improving upon the previous bound of $O(n^4\ln T)$ by a factor of $n^3$. Our method is simple and efficient: we apply the online Newton step (ONS) to appropriate exp-concave loss functions. Moreover, for the case where the agent's actions are possibly suboptimal, we establish an $O(n\ln T+\sqrt{\Delta_Tn\ln T})$ regret bound, where $\Delta_T$ is the cumulative suboptimality of the agent's actions. This bound is achieved by using MetaGrad, which runs ONS with $\Theta(\ln T)$ different learning rates in parallel. We also provide a simple instance that implies an $\Omega(n)$ lower bound, showing that our $O(n\ln T)$ bound is tight up to an $O(\ln T)$ factor. This gives rise to a natural question: can the $O(\ln T)$ factor in the upper bound be removed? For the special case of $n=2$, we show that an $O(1)$ regret bound is possible, while we delineate challenges in extending this result to higher dimensions.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper we propose to apply copula entropy (CE) to facies classification. In our method, the correlations between geological variables and facies classes are measured with CE and then the variables associated with large negative CEs are selected for classification. We verified the proposed method on a typical facies dataset for facies classification and the experimental results show that the proposed method can select less geological variables for facies classification without sacrificing classification performance. The geological variables such selected are also interpretable to geologists with geological meanings due to the rigorous definition of CE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingwei Zhu, Han Wang, Yukie Nagai</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse continuous policies are distributions that can choose some actions at random yet keep strictly zero probability for the other actions, which are radically different from the Gaussian. They have important real-world implications, e.g. in modeling safety-critical tasks like medicine. The combination of offline reinforcement learning and sparse policies provides a novel paradigm that enables learning completely from logged datasets a safety-aware sparse policy. However, sparse policies can cause difficulty with the existing offline algorithms which require evaluating actions that fall outside of the current support. In this paper, we propose the first offline policy optimization algorithm that tackles this challenge: Fat-to-Thin Policy Optimization (FtTPO). Specifically, we maintain a fat (heavy-tailed) proposal policy that effectively learns from the dataset and injects knowledge to a thin (sparse) policy, which is responsible for interacting with the environment. We instantiate FtTPO with the general $q$-Gaussian family that encompasses both heavy-tailed and sparse policies and verify that it performs favorably in a safety-critical treatment simulation and the standard MuJoCo suite.

<p>Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that impacts motor functions and speech characteristics This study focuses on differentiating individuals with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls through the extraction and classification of speech features. Patients were further divided into 2 groups. Med On represents the patient with medication, while Med Off represents the patient without medication. The dataset consisted of patients and healthy individuals who read a predefined text using the H1N Zoom microphone in a suitable recording environment at F{\i}rat University Neurology Department. Speech recordings from PD patients and healthy controls were analyzed, and 19 key features were extracted, including jitter, luminance, zero-crossing rate (ZCR), root mean square (RMS) energy, entropy, skewness, and kurtosis.These features were visualized in graphs and statistically evaluated to identify distinctive patterns in PD patients. Using MATLAB's Classification Learner toolbox, several machine learning classification algorithm models were applied to classify groups and significant accuracy rates were achieved. The accuracy of our 3-layer artificial neural network architecture was also compared with classical machine learning algorithms. This study highlights the potential of noninvasive voice analysis combined with machine learning for early detection and monitoring of PD patients. Future research can improve diagnostic accuracy by optimizing feature selection and exploring advanced classification techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pascal Linden, Nathalie Paul, Tim Wirtz, Stefan Wrobel</p>
<p>Abstract: In retail warehouses, returned products are typically placed in an intermediate storage until a decision regarding further shipment to stores is made. The longer products are held in storage, the higher the inefficiency and costs of the returns management process, since enough storage area has to be provided and maintained while the products are not placed for sale. To reduce the average product storage time, we consider an alternative solution where reallocation decisions for products can be made instantly upon their arrival in the warehouse allowing only a limited number of products to still be stored simultaneously. We transfer the problem to an online multiple knapsack problem and propose a novel reinforcement learning approach to pack the items (products) into the knapsacks (stores) such that the overall value (expected revenue) is maximized. Empirical evaluations on simulated data demonstrate that, compared to the usual offline decision procedure, our approach comes with a performance gap of only 3% while significantly reducing the average storage time of a product by 96%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Yao, Marc Juarez</p>
<p>Abstract: Differential privacy has emerged as the most studied framework for privacy-preserving machine learning. However, recent studies show that enforcing differential privacy guarantees can not only significantly degrade the utility of the model, but also amplify existing disparities in its predictive performance across demographic groups. Although there is extensive research on the identification of factors that contribute to this phenomenon, we still lack a complete understanding of the mechanisms through which differential privacy exacerbates disparities. The literature on this problem is muddled by varying definitions of fairness, differential privacy mechanisms, and inconsistent experimental settings, often leading to seemingly contradictory results.
  This survey provides the first comprehensive overview of the factors that contribute to the disparate effect of training models with differential privacy guarantees. We discuss their impact and analyze their causal role in such a disparate effect. Our analysis is guided by a taxonomy that categorizes these factors by their position within the machine learning pipeline, allowing us to draw conclusions about their interaction and the feasibility of potential mitigation strategies. We find that factors related to the training dataset and the underlying distribution play a decisive role in the occurrence of disparate impact, highlighting the need for research on these factors to address the issue.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large-scale generative modeling have demonstrated the potential of foundation models in domains such as natural language, computer vision, and protein structure prediction. However, their application in the energy and smart grid sector remains limited due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of high-quality data. In this work, we propose a method for creating high-fidelity electricity consumption time series data for rare and unseen context variables (e.g. location, building type, photovoltaics). Our approach, Context Encoding and Normalizing Time Series Generation, or CENTS, includes three key innovations: (i) A context normalization approach that enables inverse transformation for time series context variables unseen during training, (ii) a novel context encoder to condition any state-of-the-art time-series generator on arbitrary numbers and combinations of context variables, (iii) a framework for training this context encoder jointly with a time-series generator using an auxiliary context classification loss designed to increase expressivity of context embeddings and improve model performance. We further provide a comprehensive overview of different evaluation metrics for generative time series models. Our results highlight the efficacy of the proposed method in generating realistic household-level electricity consumption data, paving the way for training larger foundation models in the energy domain on synthetic as well as real-world data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Chu, Hanlin Xue, Zhijie Tan, Bingce Wang, Tong Mo, Weiping Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various domains has led researchers to apply them to graph-related problems by converting graph data into natural language text. However, unlike graph data, natural language inherently has sequential order. We observe that when the order of nodes or edges in the natural language description of a graph is shuffled, despite describing the same graph, model performance fluctuates between high performance and random guessing. Additionally, due to the limited input context length of LLMs, current methods typically randomly sample neighbors of target nodes as representatives of their neighborhood, which may not always be effective for accurate reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce GraphBC. This novel model framework features an Order Selector Module to ensure proper serialization order of the graph and a Subgraph Sampling Module to sample subgraphs with better structure for better reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Graph CoT obtained through distillation, and enhance LLM's reasoning and zero-shot learning capabilities for graph tasks through instruction tuning. Experiments on multiple datasets for node classification and graph question-answering demonstrate that GraphBC improves LLMs' performance and generalization ability on graph tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for addressing learning problems on graph structures, with a wide range of applications in molecular biology and social networks. However, the theoretical foundations underlying their empirical performance are not well understood. In this article, we examine the convergence of gradient dynamics in the training of linear GNNs. Specifically, we prove that the gradient flow training of a linear GNN with mean squared loss converges to the global minimum at an exponential rate. The convergence rate depends explicitly on the initial weights and the graph shift operator, which we validate on synthetic datasets from well-known graph models and real-world datasets. Furthermore, we discuss the gradient flow that minimizes the total weights at the global minimum. In addition to the gradient flow, we study the convergence of linear GNNs under gradient descent training, an iterative scheme viewed as a discretization of gradient flow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hermanus L. Potgieter, Coenraad Mouton, Marelie H. Davel</p>
<p>Abstract: Batch normalization (BatchNorm) is a popular layer normalization technique used when training deep neural networks. It has been shown to enhance the training speed and accuracy of deep learning models. However, the mechanics by which BatchNorm achieves these benefits is an active area of research, and different perspectives have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the effect of BatchNorm on the resulting hidden representations, that is, the vectors of activation values formed as samples are processed at each hidden layer. Specifically, we consider the sparsity of these representations, as well as their implicit clustering -- the creation of groups of representations that are similar to some extent. We contrast image classification models trained with and without batch normalization and highlight consistent differences observed. These findings highlight that BatchNorm's effect on representational sparsity is not a significant factor affecting generalization, while the representations of models trained with BatchNorm tend to show more advantageous clustering characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Uday Bhaskar, Varul Srivastava, Avyukta Manjunatha Vummintala, Naresh Manwani, Sujit Gujar</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a learning method to enable the server to train models over data distributed among various clients. These clients are protective about their data being leaked to the server, any other client, or an external adversary, and hence, locally train the model and share it with the server rather than sharing the data. The introduction of sophisticated inferencing attacks enabled the leakage of information about data through access to model parameters. To tackle this challenge, privacy-preserving federated learning aims to achieve differential privacy through learning algorithms like DP-SGD. However, such methods involve adding noise to the model, data, or gradients, reducing the model's performance.
  This work provides a theoretical analysis of the tradeoff between model performance and communication complexity of the FL system. We formally prove that training for one local epoch per global round of training gives optimal performance while preserving the same privacy budget. We also investigate the change of utility (tied to privacy) of FL models with a change in the number of clients and observe that when clients are training using DP-SGD and argue that for the same privacy budget, the utility improved with increased clients. We validate our findings through experiments on real-world datasets. The results from this paper aim to improve the performance of privacy-preserving federated learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Wang, Anna Choromanska</p>
<p>Abstract: As data sets grow in size and complexity, it is becoming more difficult to pull useful features from them using hand-crafted feature extractors. For this reason, deep learning (DL) frameworks are now widely popular. The Holy Grail of DL and one of the most mysterious challenges in all of modern ML is to develop a fundamental understanding of DL optimization and generalization. While numerous optimization techniques have been introduced in the literature to navigate the exploration of the highly non-convex DL optimization landscape, many survey papers reviewing them primarily focus on summarizing these methodologies, often overlooking the critical theoretical analyses of these methods. In this paper, we provide an extensive summary of the theoretical foundations of optimization methods in DL, including presenting various methodologies, their convergence analyses, and generalization abilities. This paper not only includes theoretical analysis of popular generic gradient-based first-order and second-order methods, but it also covers the analysis of the optimization techniques adapting to the properties of the DL loss landscape and explicitly encouraging the discovery of well-generalizing optimal points. Additionally, we extend our discussion to distributed optimization methods that facilitate parallel computations, including both centralized and decentralized approaches. We provide both convex and non-convex analysis for the optimization algorithms considered in this survey paper. Finally, this paper aims to serve as a comprehensive theoretical handbook on optimization methods for DL, offering insights and understanding to both novice and seasoned researchers in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taehan Kim, Wonduk Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: Global climate change has reduced crop resilience and pesticide efficacy, making reliance on synthetic pesticides inevitable, even though their widespread use poses significant health and environmental risks. While these pesticides remain a key tool in pest management, previous machine-learning applications in pesticide and agriculture have focused on classification or regression, leaving the fundamental challenge of generating new molecular structures or designing novel candidates unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Pesti-Gen, a novel generative model based on variational auto-encoders, designed to create pesticide candidates with optimized properties for the first time. Specifically, Pesti-Gen leverages a two-stage learning process: an initial pre-training phase that captures a generalized chemical structure representation, followed by a fine-tuning stage that incorporates toxicity-specific information. The model simultaneously optimizes over multiple toxicity metrics, such as (1) livestock toxicity and (2) aqua toxicity to generate environmentally friendly pesticide candidates. Notably, Pesti-Gen achieves approximately 68\% structural validity in generating new molecular structures, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in producing optimized and feasible pesticide candidates, thereby providing a new way for safer and more sustainable pest management solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Providing students with individualized feedback through assignments is a cornerstone of education that supports their learning and development. Studies have shown that timely, high-quality feedback plays a critical role in improving learning outcomes. However, providing personalized feedback on a large scale in classes with large numbers of students is often impractical due to the significant time and effort required. Recent advances in natural language processing and large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by enabling the efficient delivery of personalized feedback. These technologies can reduce the workload of course staff while improving student satisfaction and learning outcomes. Their successful implementation, however, requires thorough evaluation and validation in real classrooms. We present the results of a practical evaluation of LLM-based graders for written assignments in the 2024/25 iteration of the Introduction to Bioinformatics course at the University of Ljubljana. Over the course of the semester, more than 100 students answered 36 text-based questions, most of which were automatically graded using LLMs. In a blind study, students received feedback from both LLMs and human teaching assistants without knowing the source, and later rated the quality of the feedback. We conducted a systematic evaluation of six commercial and open-source LLMs and compared their grading performance with human teaching assistants. Our results show that with well-designed prompts, LLMs can achieve grading accuracy and feedback quality comparable to human graders. Our results also suggest that open-source LLMs perform as well as commercial LLMs, allowing schools to implement their own grading systems while maintaining privacy.</p>

As further miniaturization of digital CMOS processors becomes increasingly challenging, alternative computing paradigms, such as analog computing, are gaining consideration. Particularly for compute-intensive tasks such as matrix multiplication, analog computing presents a promising alternative due to its potential for significantly higher energy efficiency compared to conventional digital technology. However, analog computations are inherently noisy, which makes it challenging to maintain high accuracy on deep neural networks. This work investigates the effectiveness of training neural networks with quantization to increase the robustness against noise. Experimental results across various network architectures show that quantization-aware training with constant scaling factors enhances robustness. We compare these methods with noisy training, which incorporates a noise injection during training that mimics the noise encountered during inference. While both two methods increase tolerance against noise, noisy training emerges as the superior approach for achieving robust neural network performance, especially in complex neural architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenzhang Liu, Lianjun Jin, Lu Ren, Chaoxu Mu, Changyin Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent decision-making within large and redundant action spaces remains challenging in deep reinforcement learning. Considering similar but ineffective actions at each step can lead to repetitive and unproductive trials. Existing methods attempt to improve agent exploration by reducing or penalizing redundant actions, yet they fail to provide quantitative and reliable evidence to determine redundancy. In this paper, we propose a method to improve exploration efficiency by estimating the causal effects of actions. Unlike prior methods, our approach offers quantitative results regarding the causality of actions for one-step transitions. We first pre-train an inverse dynamics model to serve as prior knowledge of the environment. Subsequently, we classify actions across the entire action space at each time step and estimate the causal effect of each action to suppress redundant actions during exploration. We provide a theoretical analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and present empirical results from simulations in environments with redundant actions to evaluate its performance. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/agi-brain/cee.git.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haifeng Wen, Hong Xing, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-hoc calibration of pre-trained models is critical for ensuring reliable inference, especially in safety-critical domains such as healthcare. Conformal Prediction (CP) offers a robust post-hoc calibration framework, providing distribution-free statistical coverage guarantees for prediction sets by leveraging held-out datasets. In this work, we address a decentralized setting where each device has limited calibration data and can communicate only with its neighbors over an arbitrary graph topology. We propose two message-passing-based approaches for achieving reliable inference via CP: quantile-based distributed conformal prediction (Q-DCP) and histogram-based distributed conformal prediction (H-DCP). Q-DCP employs distributed quantile regression enhanced with tailored smoothing and regularization terms to accelerate convergence, while H-DCP uses a consensus-based histogram estimation approach. Through extensive experiments, we investigate the trade-offs between hyperparameter tuning requirements, communication overhead, coverage guarantees, and prediction set sizes across different network topologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Estanislao Claucich, Sara Hooker, Diego H. Milone, Enzo Ferrante, Rodrigo Echeveste</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensembling is commonly regarded as an effective way to improve the general performance of models in machine learning, while also increasing the robustness of predictions. When it comes to algorithmic fairness, heterogeneous ensembles, composed of multiple model types, have been employed to mitigate biases in terms of demographic attributes such as sex, age or ethnicity. Moreover, recent work has shown how in multi-class problems even simple homogeneous ensembles may favor performance of the worst-performing target classes. While homogeneous ensembles are simpler to implement in practice, it is not yet clear whether their benefits translate to groups defined not in terms of their target class, but in terms of demographic or protected attributes, hence improving fairness. In this work we show how this simple and straightforward method is indeed able to mitigate disparities, particularly benefiting under-performing subgroups. Interestingly, this can be achieved without sacrificing overall performance, which is a common trade-off observed in bias mitigation strategies. Moreover, we analyzed the interplay between two factors which may result in biases: sub-group under-representation and the inherent difficulty of the task for each group. These results revealed that, contrary to popular assumptions, having balanced datasets may be suboptimal if the task difficulty varies between subgroups. Indeed, we found that a perfectly balanced dataset may hurt both the overall performance and the gap between groups. This highlights the importance of considering the interaction between multiple forces at play in fairness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuhao Zeng, Jerry Huang, Peng Lu, Gezheng Xu, Boxing Chen, Charles Ling, Boyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Over recent years, the Transformer has become a fundamental building block for sequence modeling architectures. Yet at its core is the use of self-attention, whose memory and computational cost grow quadratically with the sequence length $N$, rendering it prohibitively expensive for long sequences. A promising approach is top-$k$ attention, which selects only the $k$ most relevant tokens and achieves performance comparable to vanilla self-attention while significantly reducing space and computational demands. However, causal masks require the current query token to only attend to past tokens, preventing the existing top-$k$ attention method from efficiently searching for the most relevant tokens in parallel, thereby limiting training efficiency. In this work, we propose ZETA, leveraging \textbf{Z}-Order Curves for \textbf{E}fficient \textbf{T}op-$k$ \textbf{A}ttention, to enable parallel querying of past tokens for entire sequences. % in both space and time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$. We first theoretically show that the choice of key and query dimensions involves a trade-off between the curse of dimensionality and the preservation of relative distances after projection. In light of this insight, we propose reducing the dimensionality of keys and queries in contrast to values and further leverage $Z$-order curves to map low-dimensional keys and queries into \emph{one}-dimensional space, which permits parallel sorting, thereby largely improving the efficiency for top-$k$ token selection. Experimental results demonstrate that ZETA matches the performance of standard attention on the synthetic \textsc{Multi-Query Associative Recall} task and outperforms attention and its variants on \textsc{Long Range Arena} and \textsc{WikiText-103} language modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianzhe Zhao, Feida Zhu, Lingyan He, Zixin Tang, Mingce Gao, Shiyu Yang, Guibing Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of the digital economy, data is increasingly recognized as an essential resource for both work and life. However, due to privacy concerns, data owners tend to maximize the value of data through information flow rather than direct data transfer. Federated learning (FL) provides an effective approach to collaborative training models while preserving privacy. However, different data owners not only have variations in the quantity and quality of their data resources but also face mismatches between data and computing resources as model parameters and training data grow. These challenges hinder data owners' willingness to participate and reduce the effectiveness of data assetization. In this work, we first identify the resource-decoupled FL environment, which includes model owners, data owners, and computing centers. We design a Tripartite Stackelberg Model and theoretically analyze the Stackelberg-Nash Equilibrium (SNE) for participants to optimize global utility. We propose the Quality-aware Dynamic Resources-decoupled FL algorithm (QD-RDFL), in which we derive and solve the optimal strategies of all parties to achieve SHE using backward induction, and a dynamic optimization mechanism is designed to improve the optimal strategy profile by evaluating the contribution of data quality from data owners to the global model during real training. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively encourages the linkage of the three parties involved, maximizing global utility and data asset value.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sankani Sarathchandra, Eslam Eldeeb, Mohammad Shehab, Hirley Alves, Konstantin Mikhaylov, Mohamed-Slim Alouini</p>
<p>Abstract: Age-of-information (AoI) and transmission power are crucial performance metrics in low energy wireless networks, where information freshness is of paramount importance. This study examines a power-limited internet of things (IoT) network supported by a flying unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) that collects data. Our aim is to optimize the UAV flight trajectory and scheduling policy to minimize a varying AoI and transmission power combination. To tackle this variation, this paper proposes a meta-deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach that integrates deep Q-networks (DQNs) with model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). DQNs determine optimal UAV decisions, while MAML enables scalability across varying objective functions. Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithm converges faster and adapts to new objectives more effectively than traditional deep RL methods, achieving minimal AoI and transmission power overall.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoyu Liu, Chris Budd, Carola-Bibiane Sch\"onlieb</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as promising tools for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly through the application of neural operators. Training neural operators typically requires a large amount of training data to ensure accuracy and generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method specifically designed for training neural operators on evolution equations. Our approach utilizes insights from inverse processes of these equations to efficiently generate data from random initialization that are combined with original data. To further enhance the accuracy of the augmented data, we introduce high-order inverse evolution schemes. These schemes consist of only a few explicit computation steps, yet the resulting data pairs can be proven to satisfy the corresponding implicit numerical schemes. In contrast to traditional PDE solvers that require small time steps or implicit schemes to guarantee accuracy, our data augmentation method employs explicit schemes with relatively large time steps, thereby significantly reducing computational costs. Accuracy and efficacy experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we validate our approach through experiments with the Fourier Neural Operator and UNet on three common evolution equations that are Burgers' equation, the Allen-Cahn equation and the Navier-Stokes equation. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the performance and robustness of the Fourier Neural Operator when coupled with our inverse evolution data augmentation method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksandar Vujinovic, Aleksandar Kovacevic</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning efficient representations for decision-making policies is a challenge in imitation learning (IL). Current IL methods require expert demonstrations, which are expensive to collect. Consequently, they often have underdeveloped world models. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers an alternative by allowing models to learn from diverse, unlabeled data, including failures. However, SSL methods often operate in raw input space, making them inefficient. In this work, we propose ACT-JEPA, a novel architecture that integrates IL and SSL to enhance policy representations. We train a policy to predict (1) action sequences and (2) abstract observation sequences. The first objective uses action chunking to improve action prediction and reduce compounding errors. The second objective extends this idea of chunking by predicting abstract observation sequences. We utilize Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture to predict in abstract representation space, allowing the model to filter out irrelevant details, improve efficiency, and develop a robust world model. Our experiments show that ACT-JEPA improves the quality of representations by learning temporal environment dynamics. Additionally, the model's ability to predict abstract observation sequences results in representations that effectively generalize to action sequence prediction. ACT-JEPA performs on par with established baselines across a range of decision-making tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we describe a new data-driven approach for inverse problems that exploits technologies from machine learning, in particular autoencoder network structures. We consider a paired autoencoder framework, where two autoencoders are used to efficiently represent the input and target spaces separately and optimal mappings are learned between latent spaces, thus enabling forward and inverse surrogate mappings. We focus on interpretations using Bayes risk and empirical Bayes risk minimization, and we provide various theoretical results and connections to existing works on low-rank matrix approximations. Similar to end-to-end approaches, our paired approach creates a surrogate model for forward propagation and regularized inversion. However, our approach outperforms existing approaches in scenarios where training data for unsupervised learning are readily available but training pairs for supervised learning are scarce. Furthermore, we show that cheaply computable evaluation metrics are available through this framework and can be used to predict whether the solution for a new sample should be predicted well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiu-Tung Wong, Darrick Lee, Hong Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent space matching, which consists of matching distributions of features in latent space, is a crucial component for tasks such as adversarial attacks and defenses, domain adaptation, and generative modelling. Metrics for probability measures, such as Wasserstein and maximum mean discrepancy, are commonly used to quantify the differences between such distributions. However, these are often costly to compute, or do not appropriately take the geometric and topological features of the distributions into consideration. Persistent homology is a tool from topological data analysis which quantifies the multi-scale topological structure of point clouds, and has recently been used as a topological regularizer in learning tasks. However, computation costs preclude larger scale computations, and discontinuities in the gradient lead to unstable training behavior such as in adversarial tasks. We propose the use of principal persistence measures, based on computing the persistent homology of a large number of small subsamples, as a topological regularizer. We provide a parallelized GPU implementation of this regularizer, and prove that gradients are continuous for smooth densities. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this regularizer on shape matching, image generation, and semi-supervised learning tasks, opening the door towards a scalable regularizer for topological features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angelo Rodio, Zheng Chen, Erik G. Larsson</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized learning enables distributed agents to train a shared machine learning model through local computation and peer-to-peer communication. Although each agent retains its dataset locally, the communication of local models can still expose private information to adversaries. To mitigate these threats, local differential privacy (LDP) injects independent noise per agent, but it suffers a larger utility gap than central differential privacy (CDP). We introduce Whisper D-SGD, a novel covariance-based approach that generates correlated privacy noise across agents, unifying several state-of-the-art methods as special cases. By leveraging network topology and mixing weights, Whisper D-SGD optimizes the noise covariance to achieve network-wide noise cancellation. Experimental results show that Whisper D-SGD cancels more noise than existing pairwise-correlation schemes, substantially narrowing the CDP-LDP gap and improving model performance under the same privacy guarantees.</p>

<p>Abstract: We focus on reducing communication overhead in multiplayer games, where frequently exchanging strategies between players is not feasible and players have noisy or outdated strategies of the other players. We introduce Decoupled SGDA, a novel adaptation of Stochastic Gradient Descent Ascent (SGDA). In this approach, players independently update their strategies based on outdated opponent strategies, with periodic synchronization to align strategies. For Strongly-Convex-Strongly-Concave (SCSC) games, we demonstrate that Decoupled SGDA achieves near-optimal communication complexity comparable to the best-known GDA rates. For weakly coupled games where the interaction between players is lower relative to the non-interactive part of the game, Decoupled SGDA significantly reduces communication costs compared to standard SGDA. Our findings extend to multi-player games. To provide insights into the effect of communication frequency and convergence, we extensively study the convergence of Decoupled SGDA for quadratic minimax problems. Lastly, in settings where the noise over the players is imbalanced, Decoupled SGDA significantly outperforms federated minimax methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to learn from multiple known source domains a model that can generalize well to unknown target domains. One of the key approaches in DG is training an encoder which generates domain-invariant representations. However, this approach is not applicable in Federated Domain Generalization (FDG), where data from various domains are distributed across different clients. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, dubbed Federated Learning via On-server Matching Gradient (FedOMG), which can \emph{efficiently leverage domain information from distributed domains}. Specifically, we utilize the local gradients as information about the distributed models to find an invariant gradient direction across all domains through gradient inner product maximization. The advantages are two-fold: 1) FedOMG can aggregate the characteristics of distributed models on the centralized server without incurring any additional communication cost, and 2) FedOMG is orthogonal to many existing FL/FDG methods, allowing for additional performance improvements by being seamlessly integrated with them. Extensive experimental evaluations on various settings to demonstrate the robustness of FedOMG compared to other FL/FDG baselines. Our method outperforms recent SOTA baselines on four FL benchmark datasets (MNIST, EMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100), and three FDG benchmark datasets (PACS, VLCS, and OfficeHome).</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements, particularly in their ability to serve as agents thereby surpassing their traditional role as chatbots. These agents can leverage their planning and tool utilization capabilities to address tasks specified at a high level. However, a standardized dataset to benchmark the agent capabilities of LLMs in medical applications is currently lacking, making the evaluation of LLMs on complex tasks in interactive healthcare environments challenging. To address this gap, we introduce MedAgentBench, a broad evaluation suite designed to assess the agent capabilities of large language models within medical records contexts. MedAgentBench encompasses 100 patient-specific clinically-derived tasks from 10 categories written by human physicians, realistic profiles of 100 patients with over 700,000 data elements, a FHIR-compliant interactive environment, and an accompanying codebase. The environment uses the standard APIs and communication infrastructure used in modern EMR systems, so it can be easily migrated into live EMR systems. MedAgentBench presents an unsaturated agent-oriented benchmark that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit some ability to succeed at. The best model (GPT-4o) achieves a success rate of 72%. However, there is still substantial space for improvement to give the community a next direction to optimize. Furthermore, there is significant variation in performance across task categories. MedAgentBench establishes this and is publicly available at https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/MedAgentBench , offering a valuable framework for model developers to track progress and drive continuous improvements in the agent capabilities of large language models within the medical domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: Complex Query Answering (CQA) over incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is a challenging task. Recently, a line of message-passing-based research has been proposed to solve CQA. However, they perform unsatisfactorily on negative queries and fail to address the noisy messages between variable nodes in the query graph. Moreover, they offer little interpretability and require complex query data and resource-intensive training. In this paper, we propose a Neural-Symbolic Message Passing (NSMP) framework based on pre-trained neural link predictors. By introducing symbolic reasoning and fuzzy logic, NSMP can generalize to arbitrary existential first order logic queries without requiring training while providing interpretable answers. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic pruning strategy to filter out noisy messages between variable nodes. Experimental results show that NSMP achieves a strong performance. Additionally, through complexity analysis and empirical verification, we demonstrate the superiority of NSMP in inference time over the current state-of-the-art neural-symbolic method. Compared to this approach, NSMP demonstrates faster inference times across all query types on benchmark datasets, with speedup ranging from 2$\times$ to over 150$\times$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simran Ketha, Venkatakrishnan Ramaswamy</p>
<p>Abstract: Overparameterized Deep Neural Networks that generalize well have been key to the dramatic success of Deep Learning in recent years. The reasons for their remarkable ability to generalize are not well understood yet. It has also been known that deep networks possess the ability to memorize training data, as evidenced by perfect or high training accuracies on models trained with corrupted data that have class labels shuffled to varying degrees. Concomitantly, such models are known to generalize poorly, i.e. they suffer from poor test accuracies, due to which it is thought that the act of memorizing substantially degrades the ability to generalize. It has, however, been unclear why the poor generalization that accompanies such memorization, comes about. One possibility is that in the process of training with corrupted data, the layers of the network irretrievably reorganize their representations in a manner that makes generalization difficult. The other possibility is that the network retains significant ability to generalize, but the trained network somehow chooses to readout in a manner that is detrimental to generalization. Here, we provide evidence for the latter possibility by demonstrating, empirically, that such models possess information in their representations for substantially improved generalization, even in the face of memorization. Furthermore, such generalization abilities can be easily decoded from the internals of the trained model, and we build a technique to do so from the outputs of specific layers of the network. We demonstrate results on multiple models trained with a number of standard datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhong Li, Yuhang Wang, Matthijs van Leeuwen</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an emerging paradigm that exploits supervisory signals generated from the data itself, and many recent studies have leveraged SSL to conduct graph anomaly detection. However, we empirically found that three important factors can substantially impact detection performance across datasets: 1) the specific SSL strategy employed; 2) the tuning of the strategy's hyperparameters; and 3) the allocation of combination weights when using multiple strategies. Most SSL-based graph anomaly detection methods circumvent these issues by arbitrarily or selectively (i.e., guided by label information) choosing SSL strategies, hyperparameter settings, and combination weights. While an arbitrary choice may lead to subpar performance, using label information in an unsupervised setting is label information leakage and leads to severe overestimation of a method's performance. Leakage has been criticized as "one of the top ten data mining mistakes", yet many recent studies on SSL-based graph anomaly detection have been using label information to select hyperparameters. To mitigate this issue, we propose to use an internal evaluation strategy (with theoretical analysis) to select hyperparameters in SSL for unsupervised anomaly detection. We perform extensive experiments using 10 recent SSL-based graph anomaly detection algorithms on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating both the prior issues with hyperparameter selection and the effectiveness of our proposed strategy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilya Orson Sandoval, Isaac Symes Thompson, Vasilios Mavroudis, Chris Hicks</p>
<p>Abstract: As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, reinforcement learning is emerging as a promising technique to create intelligent, self-improving defensive systems. However, most existing autonomous defensive agents have overlooked the inherent graph structure of computer networks subject to cyber attacks, potentially missing critical information. To address this gap, we developed a custom version of the Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) environment that encodes the observable network state as a directed graph, utilizing realistic and interpretable low-level features. %, like number of open ports and unexpected detected connections. We leverage a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture to process node, edge, and global features, and modify its output to be compatible with policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning. GAT policies offer several advantages over standard approaches based on simplistic flattened state observations. They can handle the changes in network topology that occur at runtime when dynamic connections between hosts appear. Policies can be deployed to networks that differ in size to the ones seen during training, enabling a degree of generalisation inaccessible with alternative approaches. Furthermore, the graph neural network policies outputs are explainable in terms of tangible network properties, providing enhanced interpretability of defensive actions. We verify that our low-level graph observations are meaningful enough to train GAT defensive policies that are able to adapt to changing topologies. We evaluate how our trained policies perform when deployed on networks of varying sizes with the same subnetwork structure, comparing them against policies specifically trained for each network configuration. Our study contributes to the development of robust cyber defence systems that can better adapt to real-world network security challenges.</p>

The reductions vary in difficulty, ranging from simple exercises of undergraduate courses to more challenging reductions from academic papers. We compare the performance of state-of-the-art models on this task and demonstrate the effect of fine-tuning with the Karp dataset on reasoning capacity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Ehrlich, Bradley Brown, Jordan Juravsky, Ronald Clark, Christopher R\'e, Azalia Mirhoseini</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling test-time compute is a promising axis for improving LLM capabilities. However, test-time compute can be scaled in a variety of ways, and effectively combining different approaches remains an active area of research. Here, we explore this problem in the context of solving real-world GitHub issues from the SWE-bench dataset. Our system, named CodeMonkeys, allows models to iteratively edit a codebase by jointly generating and running a testing script alongside their draft edit. We sample many of these multi-turn trajectories for every issue to generate a collection of candidate edits. This approach lets us scale "serial" test-time compute by increasing the number of iterations per trajectory and "parallel" test-time compute by increasing the number of trajectories per problem. With parallel scaling, we can amortize up-front costs across multiple downstream samples, allowing us to identify relevant codebase context using the simple method of letting an LLM read every file. In order to select between candidate edits, we combine voting using model-generated tests with a final multi-turn trajectory dedicated to selection. Overall, CodeMonkeys resolves 57.4% of issues from SWE-bench Verified using a budget of approximately 2300 USD. Our selection method can also be used to combine candidates from different sources. Selecting over an ensemble of edits from existing top SWE-bench Verified submissions obtains a score of 66.2% and outperforms the best member of the ensemble on its own. We fully release our code and data at https://scalingintelligence.stanford.edu/pubs/codemonkeys.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14724">MLPs at the EOC: Concentration of the NTK</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> D\'avid Terj\'ek, Diego Gonz\'alez-S\'anchez</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the concentration of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) $K_\theta : \mathbb{R}^{m_0} \times \mathbb{R}^{m_0} \to \mathbb{R}^{m_l \times m_l}$ of $l$-layer Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) $N : \mathbb{R}^{m_0} \times \Theta \to \mathbb{R}^{m_l}$ equipped with activation functions $\phi(s) = a s + b \vert s \vert$ for some $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ with the parameter $\theta \in \Theta$ being initialized at the Edge Of Chaos (EOC). Without relying on the gradient independence assumption that has only been shown to hold asymptotically in the infinitely wide limit, we prove that an approximate version of gradient independence holds at finite width. Showing that the NTK entries $K_\theta(x_{i_1},x_{i_2})$ for $i_1,i_2 \in [1:n]$ over a dataset $\{x_1,\cdots,x_n\} \subset \mathbb{R}^{m_0}$ concentrate simultaneously via maximal inequalities, we prove that the NTK matrix $K(\theta) = [\frac{1}{n} K_\theta(x_{i_1},x_{i_2}) : i_1,i_2 \in [1:n]] \in \mathbb{R}^{nm_l \times nm_l}$ concentrates around its infinitely wide limit $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle\infty}{K} \in \mathbb{R}^{nm_l \times nm_l}$ without the need for linear overparameterization. Our results imply that in order to accurately approximate the limit, hidden layer widths have to grow quadratically as $m_k = k^2 m$ for some $m \in \mathbb{N}+1$ for sufficient concentration. For such MLPs, we obtain the concentration bound $\mathbb{P}( \Vert K(\theta) - \overset{\scriptscriptstyle\infty}{K} \Vert \leq O((\Delta_\phi^{-2} + m_l^{\frac{1}{2}} l) \kappa_\phi^2 m^{-\frac{1}{2}})) \geq 1-O(m^{-1})$ modulo logarithmic terms, where we denoted $\Delta_\phi = \frac{b^2}{a^2+b^2}$ and $\kappa_\phi = \frac{\vert a \vert + \vert b \vert}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}$. This reveals in particular that the absolute value ($\Delta_\phi=1$, $\kappa_\phi=1$) beats the ReLU ($\Delta_\phi=\frac{1}{2}$, $\kappa_\phi=\sqrt{2}$) in terms of the concentration of the NTK.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arjun R. Malghan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in the healthcare sector, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, their proficiency in numerical reasoning, particularly in high-stakes domains like in clinical applications, remains underexplored. Numerical reasoning is critical in healthcare applications, influencing patient outcomes, treatment planning, and resource allocation. This study investigates the computational accuracy of LLMs in numerical reasoning tasks within healthcare contexts. Using a curated dataset of 1,000 numerical problems, encompassing real-world scenarios such as dosage calculations and lab result interpretations, the performance of a refined LLM based on the GPT-3 architecture was evaluated. The methodology includes prompt engineering, integration of fact-checking pipelines, and application of regularization techniques to enhance model accuracy and generalization. Key metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were utilized to assess the model's efficacy. The results indicate an overall accuracy of 84.10%, with improved performance in straightforward numerical tasks and challenges in multi-step reasoning. The integration of a fact-checking pipeline improved accuracy by 11%, underscoring the importance of validation mechanisms. This research highlights the potential of LLMs in healthcare numerical reasoning and identifies avenues for further refinement to support critical decision-making in clinical environments. The findings aim to contribute to the development of reliable, interpretable, and contextually relevant AI tools for healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Block, Ayush Sekhari, Alexander Rakhlin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant improvements in natural language processing tasks, but their ability to generate human-quality text raises significant ethical and operational concerns in settings where it is important to recognize whether or not a given text was generated by a human. Thus, recent work has focused on developing techniques for watermarking LLM-generated text, i.e., introducing an almost imperceptible signal that allows a provider equipped with a secret key to determine if given text was generated by their model. Current watermarking techniques are often not practical due to concerns with generation latency, detection time, degradation in text quality, or robustness. Many of these drawbacks come from the focus on token-level watermarking, which ignores the inherent structure of text. In this work, we introduce a new scheme, GaussMark, that is simple and efficient to implement, has formal statistical guarantees on its efficacy, comes at no cost in generation latency, and embeds the watermark into the weights of the model itself, providing a structural watermark. Our approach is based on Gaussian independence testing and is motivated by recent empirical observations that minor additive corruptions to LLM weights can result in models of identical (or even improved) quality. We show that by adding a small amount of Gaussian noise to the weights of a given LLM, we can watermark the model in a way that is statistically detectable by a provider who retains the secret key. We provide formal statistical bounds on the validity and power of our procedure. Through an extensive suite of experiments, we demonstrate that GaussMark is reliable, efficient, and relatively robust to corruptions such as insertions, deletions, substitutions, and roundtrip translations and can be instantiated with essentially no loss in model quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Liu, Zihan Zhou, Yuanhao Liu, Jing Zhang, Hong Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis aims to infer students' mastery levels based on their historical response logs. However, existing cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs), which rely on ID embeddings, often have to train specific models on specific domains. This limitation may hinder their directly practical application in various target domains, such as different subjects (e.g., Math, English and Physics) or different education platforms (e.g., ASSISTments, Junyi Academy and Khan Academy). To address this issue, this paper proposes the language representation favored zero-shot cross-domain cognitive diagnosis (LRCD). Specifically, LRCD first analyzes the behavior patterns of students, exercises and concepts in different domains, and then describes the profiles of students, exercises and concepts using textual descriptions. Via recent advanced text-embedding modules, these profiles can be transformed to vectors in the unified language space. Moreover, to address the discrepancy between the language space and the cognitive diagnosis space, we propose language-cognitive mappers in LRCD to learn the mapping from the former to the latter. Then, these profiles can be easily and efficiently integrated and trained with existing CDMs. Extensive experiments show that training LRCD on real-world datasets can achieve commendable zero-shot performance across different target domains, and in some cases, it can even achieve competitive performance with some classic CDMs trained on the full response data on target domains. Notably, we surprisingly find that LRCD can also provide interesting insights into the differences between various subjects (such as humanities and sciences) and sources (such as primary and secondary education).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Afrah Gueriani, Hamza Kheddar, Ahmed Cherif Mazari</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of the industrial Internet of things (IIoT) has introduced new challenges in securing critical infrastructures against sophisticated cyberthreats. This study presents the development and evaluation of an advanced Intrusion detection (IDS) based on a hybrid LSTM-convolution neural network (CNN)-Attention architecture, specifically designed to detect and classify cyberattacks in IIoT environments. The research focuses on two key classification tasks: binary and multi-class classification. The proposed models was rigorously tested using the Edge-IIoTset dataset. To mitigate the class imbalance in the dataset, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was employed to generate synthetic samples for the underrepresented classes. This ensured that the model could learn effectively from all classes, thereby improving the overall classification performance. Through systematic experimentation, various deep learning (DL) models were compared, ultimately demonstrating that the LSTM-CNN-Attention model consistently outperformed others across key performance metrics. In binary classification, the model achieved near-perfect accuracy, while in multi-class classification, it maintained a high accuracy level (99.04%), effectively categorizing different attack types with a loss value of 0.0220%.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces a robust framework for generating procedural 3D models of maize (Zea mays) plants from LiDAR point cloud data, offering a scalable alternative to traditional field-based phenotyping. Our framework leverages Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces to model the leaves of maize plants, combining Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for an initial approximation of the surface and a differentiable programming framework for precise refinement of the surface to fit the point cloud data. In the first optimization phase, PSO generates an approximate NURBS surface by optimizing its control points, aligning the surface with the LiDAR data, and providing a reliable starting point for refinement. The second phase uses NURBS-Diff, a differentiable programming framework, to enhance the accuracy of the initial fit by refining the surface geometry and capturing intricate leaf details. Our results demonstrate that, while PSO establishes a robust initial fit, the integration of differentiable NURBS significantly improves the overall quality and fidelity of the reconstructed surface. This hierarchical optimization strategy enables accurate 3D reconstruction of maize leaves across diverse genotypes, facilitating the subsequent extraction of complex traits like phyllotaxy. We demonstrate our approach on diverse genotypes of field-grown maize plants. All our codes are open-source to democratize these phenotyping approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bidhan Roy, Peter Potash, Marcos Villagra</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted method for customizing large-scale language models. In distributed, untrusted training environments, an open source base model user may want to use LoRA weights created by an external contributor, leading to two requirements: (1) the base model user must confirm that the LoRA weights are effective when paired with the intended base model, and (2) the LoRA contributor must keep their proprietary weights private until compensation is assured.
  We present ZKLoRA, a zero-knowledge verification protocol that relies on succinct proofs and our novel Multi-Party Inference procedure to verify LoRA-base model compatibility without exposing LoRA weights. ZKLoRA produces deterministic correctness guarantees and validates each LoRA module in only 1-2 seconds on state-of-the-art large language models. This low-latency approach enables nearly real-time verification and promotes secure collaboration among geographically decentralized teams and contract-based training pipelines. The protocol ensures that the delivered LoRA module works as claimed, safeguarding the contributor's intellectual property while providing the base model user with verification of compatibility and lineage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenta Uesugi, Naoki Saito, Keisuke Maeda, Takahiro Ogawa, Miki Haseyama</p>
<p>Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) provides an effective way to manage and access large-scale visual data. Construction of the CIR model utilizes triplets that consist of a reference image, modification text describing desired changes, and a target image that reflects these changes. For effectively training CIR models, extensive manual annotation to construct high-quality training datasets, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, is required. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a novel triplet synthesis method by leveraging counterfactual image generation. By controlling visual feature modifications via counterfactual image generation, our approach automatically generates diverse training triplets without any manual intervention. This approach facilitates the creation of larger and more expressive datasets, leading to the improvement of CIR model's performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating high-quality textures for 3D scenes is crucial for applications in interior design, gaming, and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR). Although recent advancements in 3D generative models have enhanced content creation, significant challenges remain in achieving broad generalization and maintaining style consistency across multiple viewpoints. Current methods, such as 2D diffusion models adapted for 3D texturing, suffer from lengthy processing times and visual artifacts, while approaches driven by 3D data often fail to generalize effectively. To overcome these challenges, we introduce InsTex, a two-stage architecture designed to generate high-quality, style-consistent textures for 3D indoor scenes. InsTex utilizes depth-to-image diffusion priors in a coarse-to-fine pipeline, first generating multi-view images with a pre-trained 2D diffusion model and subsequently refining the textures for consistency. Our method supports both textual and visual prompts, achieving state-of-the-art results in visual quality and quantitative metrics, and demonstrates its effectiveness across various 3D texturing applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khaled Al-Saih, Fares Al-Shargie, Mohammed Isam Al-hiyali, Reham Alhejaili</p>
<p>Abstract: Worldwide, sight loss is commonly occurred by retinal diseases, with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) being a notable facet that affects elderly patients. Approaching 170 million persons wide-ranging have been spotted with AMD, a figure anticipated to rise to 288 million by 2040. For visualizing retinal layers, optical coherence tomography (OCT) dispenses the most compelling non-invasive method. Frequent patient visits have increased the demand for automated analysis of retinal diseases, and deep learning networks have shown promising results in both image and pixel-level 2D scan classification. However, when relying solely on 2D data, accuracy may be impaired, especially when localizing fluid volume diseases. The goal of automatic techniques is to outperform humans in manually recognizing illnesses in medical data. In order to further understand the benefit of deep learning models, we studied the effects of the input size. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) metric showed a human performance score of 0.71 for segmenting various retinal diseases. Yet, the deep models surpassed human performance to establish a new era of advancement of segmenting the diseases on medical images. However, to further improve the performance of the models, overlapping patches enhanced the performance of the deep models compared to feeding the full image. The highest score for a patch-based model in the DSC metric was 0.88 in comparison to the score of 0.71 for the same model in non-patch-based for SRF fluid segmentation. The objective of this article is to show a fair comparison between deep learning models in relation to the input (Patch-Based vs. NonPatch-Based).</p>

<p>Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyi Cai, Zesheng Ye, Lei Feng, Jianzhong Qi, Feng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual reprogramming (VR) reuses pre-trained vision models for downstream image classification tasks by adding trainable noise patterns to inputs. When applied to vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), existing VR approaches follow the same pipeline used in vision models (e.g., ResNet, ViT), where ground-truth class labels are inserted into fixed text templates to guide the optimization of VR patterns. This label-based approach, however, overlooks the rich information and diverse attribute-guided textual representations that CLIP can exploit, which may lead to the misclassification of samples. In this paper, we propose Attribute-based Visual Reprogramming (AttrVR) for CLIP, utilizing descriptive attributes (DesAttrs) and distinctive attributes (DistAttrs), which respectively represent common and unique feature descriptions for different classes. Besides, as images of the same class may reflect different attributes after VR, AttrVR iteratively refines patterns using the $k$-nearest DesAttrs and DistAttrs for each image sample, enabling more dynamic and sample-specific optimization. Theoretically, AttrVR is shown to reduce intra-class variance and increase inter-class separation. Empirically, it achieves superior performance in 12 downstream tasks for both ViT-based and ResNet-based CLIP. The success of AttrVR facilitates more effective integration of VR from unimodal vision models into vision-language models. Our code is available at https://github.com/tmlr-group/AttrVR.</p>

<p>Abstract: The updated recommendations on diagnostic procedures and treatment pathways for a medical condition are documented as graphical flows in Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs). For effective use of the CPGs in helping medical professionals in the treatment decision process, it is necessary to fully capture the guideline knowledge, particularly the contexts and their relationships in the graph. While several existing works have utilized these guidelines to create rule bases for Clinical Decision Support Systems, limited work has been done toward directly capturing the full medical knowledge contained in CPGs. This work proposes an approach to create a contextually enriched, faithful digital representation of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Cancer CPGs in the form of graphs using automated extraction and node & relationship classification. We also implement semantic enrichment of the model by using Large Language Models (LLMs) for node classification, achieving an accuracy of 80.86% and 88.47% with zero-shot learning and few-shot learning, respectively. Additionally, we introduce a methodology for answering natural language questions with constraints to guideline text by leveraging LLMs to extract the relevant subgraph from the guideline knowledge base. By generating natural language answers based on subgraph paths and semantic information, we mitigate the risk of incorrect answers and hallucination associated with LLMs, ensuring factual accuracy in medical domain Question Answering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ioannis Nasios</p>
<p>Abstract: Kelp forests, as foundation species, are vital to marine ecosystems, providing essential food and habitat for numerous organisms. This study explores the integration of crowdsourced labels with advanced artificial intelligence models to develop a fast and accurate kelp canopy detection pipeline using Landsat images. Building on the success of a machine learning competition, where this approach ranked third and performed consistently well on both local validation and public and private leaderboards, the research highlights the effectiveness of combining Mixed Vision Transformers (MIT) with ConvNeXt models. Training these models on various image sizes significantly enhanced the accuracy of the ensemble results. U-Net emerged as the best segmentation architecture, with UpperNet also contributing to the final ensemble. Key Landsat bands, such as ShortWave InfraRed (SWIR1) and Near-InfraRed (NIR), were crucial while altitude data was used in postprocessing to eliminate false positives on land. The methodology achieved a high detection rate, accurately identifying about three out of four pixels containing kelp canopy while keeping false positives low. Despite the medium resolution of Landsat satellites, their extensive historical coverage makes them effective for studying kelp forests. This work also underscores the potential of combining machine learning models with crowdsourced data for effective and scalable environmental monitoring.

However, common CLIP-based approaches need large amounts of samples and do not natively support 3D or tabular data, both of which are crucial in the medical domain. To address these issues, we revisit CLIP-style alignment by training a domain-specific 3D foundation model as an image encoder and demonstrate that modality alignment is feasible with only 62 MRI scans. Our approach is enabled by a simple embedding accumulation strategy required for training in 3D, which scales the amount of negative pairs across batches in order to stabilize training. We perform a thorough evaluation of various design choices, including the choice of backbone and loss functions, and evaluate the proposed methodology on zero-shot classification and image-retrieval tasks. While zero-shot image-retrieval remains challenging, zero-shot classification results demonstrate that the proposed approach can meaningfully align the representations of 3D MRI with tabular data.</p>

<p>Abstract: The state-of-the-art in biometric recognition algorithms and operational systems has advanced quickly in recent years providing high accuracy and robustness in more challenging collection environments and consumer applications. However, the technology still suffers greatly when applied to non-conventional settings such as those seen when performing identification at extreme distances or from elevated cameras on buildings or mounted to UAVs. This paper summarizes an extension to the largest dataset currently focused on addressing these operational challenges, and describes its composition as well as methodologies of collection, curation, and annotation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vignav Ramesh, Kenneth Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Communication between multiple language model (LM) agents has been shown to scale up the reasoning ability of LMs. While natural language has been the dominant medium for inter-LM communication, it is not obvious this should be the standard: not only does natural language communication incur high inference costs that scale quickly with the number of both agents and messages, but also the decoding process abstracts away too much rich information that could be otherwise accessed from the internal activations. In this work, we propose a simple technique whereby LMs communicate via activations; concretely, we pause an LM $\textit{B}$'s computation at an intermediate layer, combine its current activation with another LM $\textit{A}$'s intermediate activation via some function $\textit{f}$, then pass $\textit{f}$'s output into the next layer of $\textit{B}$ and continue the forward pass till decoding is complete. This approach scales up LMs on new tasks with zero additional parameters and data, and saves a substantial amount of compute over natural language communication. We test our method with various functional forms $\textit{f}$ on two experimental setups--multi-player coordination games and reasoning benchmarks--and find that it achieves up to $27.0\%$ improvement over natural language communication across datasets with $<$$1/4$ the compute, illustrating the superiority and robustness of activations as an alternative "language" for communication between LMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kelly Ramsay, Dylan Spicker</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop a univariate, differentially private mean estimator, called the private modified winsorized mean designed to be used as the aggregator in subsample-and-aggregate. We demonstrate, via real data analysis, that common differentially private multivariate mean estimators may not perform well as the aggregator, even with a dataset with 8000 observations, motivating our developments. We show that the modified winsorized mean is minimax optimal for several, large classes of distributions, even under adversarial contamination. We also demonstrate that, empirically, the modified winsorized mean performs well compared to other private mean estimates. We consider the modified winsorized mean as the aggregator in subsample-and-aggregate, deriving a finite sample deviations bound for a subsample-and-aggregate estimate generated with the new aggregator. This result yields two important insights: (i) the optimal choice of subsamples depends on the bias of the estimator computed on the subsamples, and (ii) the rate of convergence of the subsample-and-aggregate estimator depends on the robustness of the estimator computed on the subsamples.</p>

<p>Abstract: Extracting sections from clinical notes is crucial for downstream analysis but is challenging due to variability in formatting and labor-intensive nature of manual sectioning. While proprietary large language models (LLMs) have shown promise, privacy concerns limit their accessibility. This study develops a pipeline for automated note sectioning using open-source LLMs, focusing on three sections: History of Present Illness, Interval History, and Assessment and Plan. We fine-tuned three open-source LLMs to extract sections using a curated dataset of 487 progress notes, comparing results relative to proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini). Internal and external validity were assessed via precision, recall and F1 score. Fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B outperformed GPT-4o (F1=0.92). On the external validity test set, performance remained high (F1= 0.85). Fine-tuned open-source LLMs can surpass proprietary models in clinical note sectioning, offering advantages in cost, performance, and accessibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianhong Chen, Shihao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter estimation and trajectory reconstruction for data-driven dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are essential tasks in fields such as biology, engineering, and physics. These inverse problems -- estimating ODE parameters from observational data -- are particularly challenging when the data are noisy, sparse, and the dynamics are nonlinear. We propose the Eigen-Fourier Physics-Informed Gaussian Process (EFiGP), an algorithm that integrates Fourier transformation and eigen-decomposition into a physics-informed Gaussian Process framework. This approach eliminates the need for numerical integration, significantly enhancing computational efficiency and accuracy. Built on a principled Bayesian framework, EFiGP incorporates the ODE system through probabilistic conditioning, enforcing governing equations in the Fourier domain while truncating high-frequency terms to achieve denoising and computational savings. The use of eigen-decomposition further simplifies Gaussian Process covariance operations, enabling efficient recovery of trajectories and parameters even in dense-grid settings. We validate the practical effectiveness of EFiGP on three benchmark examples, demonstrating its potential for reliable and interpretable modeling of complex dynamical systems while addressing key challenges in trajectory recovery and computational cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ultrasonic testing is a common Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) method used in aerospace manufacturing. However, the complexity and size of the ultrasonic scans make it challenging to identify defects through visual inspection or machine learning models. Using computer vision techniques to identify defects from ultrasonic scans is an evolving research area. In this study, we used instance segmentation to identify the presence of defects in the ultrasonic scan images of composite panels that are representative of real components manufactured in aerospace. We used two models based on Mask-RCNN (Detectron 2) and YOLO 11 respectively. Additionally, we implemented a simple statistical pre-processing technique that reduces the burden of requiring custom-tailored pre-processing techniques. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using instance segmentation in the NDI pipeline by significantly reducing data pre-processing time, inspection time, and overall costs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the dynamic pricing problem with knapsack, addressing the challenge of balancing exploration and exploitation under resource constraints. We introduce three algorithms tailored to different informational settings: a Boundary Attracted Re-solve Method for full information, an online learning algorithm for scenarios with no prior information, and an estimate-then-select re-solve algorithm that leverages machine-learned informed prices with known upper bound of estimation errors. The Boundary Attracted Re-solve Method achieves logarithmic regret without requiring the non-degeneracy condition, while the online learning algorithm attains an optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Our estimate-then-select approach bridges the gap between these settings, providing improved regret bounds when reliable offline data is available. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithms across various scenarios. This work advances the understanding of online resource allocation and dynamic pricing, offering practical solutions adaptable to different informational structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyeob Baek, Yi-Fu Wu, Gautam Singh, Sungjin Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans have an innate ability to decompose their perceptions of the world into objects and their attributes, such as colors, shapes, and movement patterns. This cognitive process enables us to imagine novel futures by recombining familiar concepts. However, replicating this ability in artificial intelligence systems has proven challenging, particularly when it comes to modeling videos into compositional concepts and generating unseen, recomposed futures without relying on auxiliary data, such as text, masks, or bounding boxes. In this paper, we propose Dreamweaver, a neural architecture designed to discover hierarchical and compositional representations from raw videos and generate compositional future simulations. Our approach leverages a novel Recurrent Block-Slot Unit (RBSU) to decompose videos into their constituent objects and attributes. In addition, Dreamweaver uses a multi-future-frame prediction objective to capture disentangled representations for dynamic concepts more effectively as well as static concepts. In experiments, we demonstrate our model outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines for world modeling when evaluated under the DCI framework across multiple datasets. Furthermore, we show how the modularized concept representations of our model enable compositional imagination, allowing the generation of novel videos by recombining attributes from different objects.</p>

<p>Abstract: Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) offer a powerful framework for multi-agent coordination but often rely on labor-intensive, manual problem construction. To address this, we introduce VL-DCOPs, a framework that takes advantage of large multimodal foundation models (LFMs) to automatically generate constraints from both visual and linguistic instructions. We then introduce a spectrum of agent archetypes for solving VL-DCOPs: from a neuro-symbolic agent that delegates some of the algorithmic decisions to an LFM, to a fully neural agent that depends entirely on an LFM for coordination. We evaluate these agent archetypes using state-of-the-art LLMs (large language models) and VLMs (vision language models) on three novel VL-DCOP tasks and compare their respective advantages and drawbacks. Lastly, we discuss how this work extends to broader frontier challenges in the DCOP literature.</p>

<p>Abstract: The task of predicting time and location from images is challenging and requires complex human-like puzzle-solving ability over different clues. In this work, we formalize this ability into core skills and implement them using different modules in an expert pipeline called PuzzleGPT. PuzzleGPT consists of a perceiver to identify visual clues, a reasoner to deduce prediction candidates, a combiner to combinatorially combine information from different clues, a web retriever to get external knowledge if the task can't be solved locally, and a noise filter for robustness. This results in a zero-shot, interpretable, and robust approach that records state-of-the-art performance on two datasets -- TARA and WikiTilo. PuzzleGPT outperforms large VLMs such as BLIP-2, InstructBLIP, LLaVA, and even GPT-4V, as well as automatically generated reasoning pipelines like VisProg, by at least 32% and 38%, respectively.

<p>Abstract: Graph databases (GDBs) like Neo4j and TigerGraph excel at handling interconnected data but lack advanced inference capabilities. Neural Graph Databases (NGDBs) address this by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predictive analysis and reasoning over incomplete or noisy data. However, NGDBs rely on predefined queries and lack autonomy and adaptability. This paper introduces Agentic Neural Graph Databases (Agentic NGDBs), which extend NGDBs with three core functionalities: autonomous query construction, neural query execution, and continuous learning. We identify ten key challenges in realizing Agentic NGDBs: semantic unit representation, abductive reasoning, scalable query execution, and integration with foundation models like large language models (LLMs). By addressing these challenges, Agentic NGDBs can enable intelligent, self-improving systems for modern data-driven applications, paving the way for adaptable and autonomous data management solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanrui Wang, Ching-Chun Chang, Chun-Shien Lu, Christopher Leckie, Isao Echizen</p>
<p>Abstract: A critical requirement for deep learning models is ensuring their robustness against adversarial attacks. These attacks commonly introduce noticeable perturbations, compromising the visual fidelity of adversarial examples. Another key challenge is that while white-box algorithms can generate effective adversarial perturbations, they require access to the model gradients, limiting their practicality in many real-world scenarios. Existing attack mechanisms struggle to achieve similar efficacy without access to these gradients. In this paper, we introduce GreedyPixel, a novel pixel-wise greedy algorithm designed to generate high-quality adversarial examples using only query-based feedback from the target model. GreedyPixel improves computational efficiency in what is typically a brute-force process by perturbing individual pixels in sequence, guided by a pixel-wise priority map. This priority map is constructed by ranking gradients obtained from a surrogate model, providing a structured path for perturbation. Our results demonstrate that GreedyPixel achieves attack success rates comparable to white-box methods without the need for gradient information, and surpasses existing algorithms in black-box settings, offering higher success rates, reduced computational time, and imperceptible perturbations. These findings underscore the advantages of GreedyPixel in terms of attack efficacy, time efficiency, and visual quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, numerous neuroscientific studies have shown that human emotions are closely linked to specific brain regions, with these regions exhibiting variability across individuals and emotional states. To fully leverage these neural patterns, we propose an Adaptive Progressive Attention Graph Neural Network (APAGNN), which dynamically captures the spatial relationships among brain regions during emotional processing. The APAGNN employs three specialized experts that progressively analyze brain topology. The first expert captures global brain patterns, the second focuses on region-specific features, and the third examines emotion-related channels. This hierarchical approach enables increasingly refined analysis of neural activity. Additionally, a weight generator integrates the outputs of all three experts, balancing their contributions to produce the final predictive label. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets (SEED, SEED-IV and MPED) demonstrate that the proposed method enhances EEG emotion recognition performance, achieving superior results compared to baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Coreset selection, which involves selecting a small subset from an existing training dataset, is an approach to reducing training data, and various approaches have been proposed for this method. In practical situations where these methods are employed, it is often the case that the data distributions differ between the development phase and the deployment phase, with the latter being unknown. Thus, it is challenging to select an effective subset of training data that performs well across all deployment scenarios. We therefore propose Distributionally Robust Coreset Selection (DRCS). DRCS theoretically derives an estimate of the upper bound for the worst-case test error, assuming that the future covariate distribution may deviate within a defined range from the training distribution. Furthermore, by selecting instances in a way that suppresses the estimate of the upper bound for the worst-case test error, DRCS achieves distributionally robust training instance selection. This study is primarily applicable to convex training computation, but we demonstrate that it can also be applied to deep learning under appropriate approximations. In this paper, we focus on covariate shift, a type of data distribution shift, and demonstrate the effectiveness of DRCS through experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their ability to solve Olympiad-level math problems. However, the training and evaluation of these models are constrained by the limited size and quality of available datasets, as creating large-scale data for such advanced problems requires extensive effort from human experts. In addition, current benchmarks are prone to contamination, leading to unreliable evaluations. In this paper, we present an automated pipeline that leverages the rich resources of the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) forum, which predominantly features Olympiad-level problems and community-driven solutions. Using open-source LLMs, we develop a method to extract question-answer pairs from the forum, resulting in AoPS-Instruct, a dataset of more than 600,000 high-quality QA pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on AoPS-Instruct improves their reasoning abilities across various benchmarks. Moreover, we build an automatic pipeline that introduces LiveAoPSBench, an evolving evaluation set with timestamps, derived from the latest forum data, providing a contamination-resistant benchmark for assessing LLM performance. Notably, we observe a significant decline in LLM performance over time, suggesting their success on older examples may stem from pre-training exposure rather than true reasoning ability. Our work presents a scalable approach to creating and maintaining large-scale, high-quality datasets for advanced math reasoning, offering valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in this domain.

<p>Abstract: Multi-spectral imaging, which simultaneously captures the spatial and spectral information of a scene, is widely used across diverse fields, including remote sensing, biomedical imaging, and agricultural monitoring. Here, we introduce a snapshot multi-spectral imaging approach employing a standard monochrome image sensor with no additional spectral filters or customized components. Our system leverages the inherent chromatic aberration of wavelength-dependent defocusing as a natural source of physical encoding of multi-spectral information; this encoded image information is rapidly decoded via a deep learning-based multi-spectral Fourier Imager Network (mFIN). We experimentally tested our method with six illumination bands and demonstrated an overall accuracy of 92.98% for predicting the illumination channels at the input and achieved a robust multi-spectral image reconstruction on various test objects. This deep learning-powered framework achieves high-quality multi-spectral image reconstruction using snapshot image acquisition with a monochrome image sensor and could be useful for applications in biomedicine, industrial quality control, and agriculture, among others.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GRAG) is a novel paradigm that takes the naive RAG system a step further by integrating graph information, such as knowledge graph (KGs), into large-scale language models (LLMs) to mitigate hallucination. However, existing GRAG still encounter limitations: 1) simple paradigms usually fail with the complex problems due to the narrow and shallow correlations capture from KGs 2) methods of strong coupling with KGs tend to be high computation cost and time consuming if the graph is dense. In this paper, we propose the Fast Think-on-Graph (FastToG), an innovative paradigm for enabling LLMs to think ``community by community" within KGs. To do this, FastToG employs community detection for deeper correlation capture and two stages community pruning - coarse and fine pruning for faster retrieval. Furthermore, we also develop two Community-to-Text methods to convert the graph structure of communities into textual form for better understanding by LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FastToG, showcasing higher accuracy, faster reasoning, and better explainability compared to the previous works.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference workload dominates a wide variety of modern AI applications, ranging from multi-turn conversation to document analysis. Balancing fairness and efficiency is critical for managing diverse client workloads with varying prefix patterns. Unfortunately, existing fair scheduling algorithms for LLM serving, such as Virtual Token Counter (VTC), fail to take prefix locality into consideration and thus suffer from poor performance. On the other hand, locality-aware scheduling algorithms in existing LLM serving frameworks tend to maximize the prefix cache hit rate without considering fair sharing among clients.
  This paper introduces the first locality-aware fair scheduling algorithm, Deficit Longest Prefix Match (DLPM), which can maintain a high degree of prefix locality with a fairness guarantee. We also introduce a novel algorithm, Double Deficit LPM (D$^2$LPM), extending DLPM for the distributed setup that can find a balance point among fairness, locality, and load-balancing. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of DLPM and D$^2$LPM in ensuring fairness while maintaining high throughput (up to 2.87$\times$ higher than VTC) and low per-client (up to 7.18$\times$ lower than state-of-the-art distributed LLM serving system) latency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is a leading cause of vision loss among older adults, where disease activity detection and progression prediction are critical for nAMD management in terms of timely drug administration and improving patient outcomes. Recent advancements in deep learning offer a promising solution for predicting changes in AMD from optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal volumes. In this work, we proposed deep learning models for the two tasks of the public MARIO Challenge at MICCAI 2024, designed to detect and forecast changes in nAMD severity with longitudinal retinal OCT. For the first task, we employ a Vision Transformer (ViT) based Siamese Network to detect changes in AMD severity by comparing scan embeddings of a patient from different time points. To train a model to forecast the change after 3 months, we exploit, for the first time, an Earth Mover (Wasserstein) Distance-based loss to harness the ordinal relation within the severity change classes. Both models ranked high on the preliminary leaderboard, demonstrating that their predictive capabilities could facilitate nAMD treatment management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cl\'ement Desroches, Martin Chauvin, Louis Ladan, Caroline Vateau, Simon Gosset, Philippe Cordier</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has raised concerns regarding its global environmental impact that extends beyond greenhouse gas emissions to include consideration of hardware fabrication and end-of-life processes. The opacity from major providers hinders companies' abilities to evaluate their AI-related environmental impacts and achieve net-zero targets.In this paper, we propose a methodology to estimate the environmental impact of a company's AI portfolio, providing actionable insights without necessitating extensive AI and Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) expertise. Results confirm that large generative AI models consume up to 4600x more energy than traditional models. Our modelling approach, which accounts for increased AI usage, hardware computing efficiency, and changes in electricity mix in line with IPCC scenarios, forecasts AI electricity use up to 2030. Under a high adoption scenario, driven by widespread Generative AI and agents adoption associated to increasingly complex models and frameworks, AI electricity use is projected to rise by a factor of 24.4.Mitigating the environmental impact of Generative AI by 2030 requires coordinated efforts across the AI value chain. Isolated measures in hardware efficiency, model efficiency, or grid improvements alone are insufficient. We advocate for standardized environmental assessment frameworks, greater transparency from the all actors of the value chain and the introduction of a "Return on Environment" metric to align AI development with net-zero goals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Ma, Yifeng Xu, Yang Lin, Tianlong Wang, Xu Chu, Xin Gao, Junfeng Zhao, Yasha Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce DRESS, a novel approach for generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses through representation editing. Existing methods like prompting and fine-tuning are either insufficient for complex style adaptation or computationally expensive, particularly in tasks like NPC creation or character role-playing. Our approach leverages the over-parameterized nature of LLMs to disentangle a style-relevant subspace within the model's representation space to conduct representation editing, ensuring a minimal impact on the original semantics. By applying adaptive editing strengths, we dynamically adjust the steering vectors in the style subspace to maintain both stylistic fidelity and semantic integrity. We develop two stylized QA benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of DRESS, and the results demonstrate significant improvements compared to baseline methods such as prompting and ITI. In short, DRESS is a lightweight, train-free solution for enhancing LLMs with flexible and effective style control, making it particularly useful for developing stylized conversational agents.

<p>Abstract: Recommender systems are pivotal in delivering personalised user experiences across various domains. However, capturing the heterophily patterns and the multi-dimensional nature of user-item interactions poses significant challenges. To address this, we introduce FWHDNN (Fusion-based Wavelet Hypergraph Diffusion Neural Networks), an innovative framework aimed at advancing representation learning in hypergraph-based recommendation tasks. The model incorporates three key components: (1) a cross-difference relation encoder leveraging heterophily-aware hypergraph diffusion to adapt message-passing for diverse class labels, (2) a multi-level cluster-wise encoder employing wavelet transform-based hypergraph neural network layers to capture multi-scale topological relationships, and (3) an integrated multi-modal fusion mechanism that combines structural and textual information through intermediate and late-fusion strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FWHDNN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and scalability in capturing high-order interconnections between users and items.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Wu, Jia Hu, Geyong Min, Shiqiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated their superiority and versatility in modern Natural Language Processing (NLP), effectively adapting to various downstream tasks through further fine-tuning. Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) has emerged as a promising solution to address privacy and efficiency challenges in distributed training for PLMs on mobile devices. However, our measurements reveal two key limitations of FedPEFT: heterogeneous data leads to significant performance degradation, and a fixed parameter configuration results in communication inefficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose FedARA, a novel Federated Adaptive Rank Allocation for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of language models. Specifically, FedARA employs truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) adaptation to enhance flexibility and expressiveness, significantly mitigating the adverse effects of data heterogeneity. Subsequently, it utilizes dynamic rank allocation to progressively identify critical ranks, effectively improving communication efficiency. Lastly, it leverages rank-based module pruning to remove inactive modules, steadily reducing local training time and peak memory usage in each round. Extensive experiments show that FedARA consistently outperforms weak baselines by an average of 8.49\% and strong baselines by 6.95\% across various datasets under data heterogeneity while significantly improving communication efficiency by 2.40\(\times\). Moreover, experiments on AGX Orin, Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi 5 devices demonstrate substantial decreases in total training time and energy consumption by up to 48.90\% and 46.95\%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Chu, Zhijie Tan, Hanlin Xue, Guanyu Wang, Tong Mo, Weiping Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely applied to downstream domains. However, current LLMs for high-stakes domain tasks, such as financial investment and legal QA, typically generate brief answers without reasoning processes and explanations. This limits users' confidence in making decisions based on their responses. While original CoT shows promise, it lacks self-correction mechanisms during reasoning. This work introduces Domain$o1$s, which enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities on domain tasks through supervised fine-tuning and tree search. We construct CoT-stock-2k and CoT-legal-2k datasets for fine-tuning models that activate domain-specific reasoning steps based on their judgment. Additionally, we propose Selective Tree Exploration to spontaneously explore solution spaces and sample optimal reasoning paths to improve performance. We also introduce PROOF-Score, a new metric for evaluating domain models' explainability, complementing traditional accuracy metrics with richer assessment dimensions. Extensive experiments on stock investment recommendation and legal reasoning QA tasks demonstrate Domaino1s's leading performance and explainability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Goksenin Yuksel, David Rau, Jaap Kamps</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense retrievers have demonstrated significant potential for neural information retrieval; however, they exhibit a lack of robustness to domain shifts, thereby limiting their efficacy in zero-shot settings across diverse domains. A state-of-the-art domain adaptation technique is Generative Pseudo Labeling (GPL). GPL uses synthetic query generation and initially mined hard negatives to distill knowledge from cross-encoder to dense retrievers in the target domain. In this paper, we analyze the documents retrieved by the domain-adapted model and discover that these are more relevant to the target queries than those of the non-domain-adapted model. We then propose refreshing the hard-negative index during the knowledge distillation phase to mine better hard negatives. Our remining R-GPL approach boosts ranking performance in 13/14 BEIR datasets and 9/12 LoTTe datasets. Our contributions are (i) analyzing hard negatives returned by domain-adapted and non-domain-adapted models and (ii) applying the GPL training with and without hard-negative re-mining in LoTTE and BEIR datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunting Liu, Riyadh Baghdadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Performance models are essential for automatic code optimization, enabling compilers to predict the effects of code transformations on performance and guide search for optimal transformations. Building state-of-the-art performance models with deep learning, however, requires vast labeled datasets of random programs -- an expensive and time-consuming process, stretching over months. This paper introduces a self-supervised pre-training scheme with autoencoders to reduce the need for labeled data. By pre-training on a large dataset of random programs, the autoencoder learns representations of code and transformations, which are then used to embed programs for the performance model. Implemented in the Tiramisu autoscheduler, our approach improves model accuracy with less data. For example, to achieve a MAPE of 20.72%, the original model requires 18 million data points, whereas our method achieves a similar MAPE of 22.44% with only 3.6 million data points, reducing data requirements by 5x.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Duetting, Michal Feldman, Tomasz Ponitka, Ermis Soumalias</p>
<p>Abstract: Algorithmic contract design studies scenarios where a principal incentivizes an agent to exert effort on her behalf. In this work, we focus on settings where the agent's type is drawn from an unknown distribution, and formalize an offline learning framework for learning near-optimal contracts from sample agent types. A central tool in our analysis is the notion of pseudo-dimension from statistical learning theory. Beyond its role in establishing upper bounds on the sample complexity, pseudo-dimension measures the intrinsic complexity of a class of contracts, offering a new perspective on the tradeoffs between simplicity and optimality in contract design. Our main results provide essentially optimal tradeoffs between pseudo-dimension and representation error (defined as the loss in principal's utility) with respect to linear and bounded contracts. Using these tradeoffs, we derive sample- and time-efficient learning algorithms, and demonstrate their near-optimality by providing almost matching lower bounds on the sample complexity. Conversely, for unbounded contracts, we prove an impossibility result showing that no learning algorithm exists.
  Finally, we extend our techniques in three important ways. First, we provide refined pseudo-dimension and sample complexity guarantees for the combinatorial actions model, revealing a novel connection between the number of critical values and sample complexity. Second, we extend our results to menus of contracts, showing that their pseudo-dimension scales linearly with the menu size. Third, we adapt our algorithms to the online learning setting, where we show that, a polynomial number of type samples suffice to learn near-optimal bounded contracts. Combined with prior work, this establishes a formal separation between expert advice and bandit feedback for this setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyang Tang, Ziniu Li, Zhenyang Xiao, Tian Ding, Ruoyu Sun, Benyou Wang, Dayiheng Liu, Fei Huang, Tianyu Liu, Bowen Yu, Junyang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Critiques are important for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling both self-improvement and constructive feedback for others by identifying flaws and suggesting improvements. However, evaluating the critique capabilities of LLMs presents a significant challenge due to the open-ended nature of the task. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark designed to assess the critique capabilities of LLMs. Unlike existing benchmarks, which typically function in an open-loop fashion, our approach employs a closed-loop methodology that evaluates the quality of corrections generated from critiques. Moreover, the benchmark incorporates features such as self-critique, cross-critique, and iterative critique, which are crucial for distinguishing the abilities of advanced reasoning models from more classical ones. We implement this benchmark using eight challenging reasoning tasks. We have several interesting findings. First, despite demonstrating comparable performance in direct chain-of-thought generation, classical LLMs significantly lag behind the advanced reasoning-based model o1-mini across all critique scenarios. Second, in self-critique and iterative critique settings, classical LLMs may even underperform relative to their baseline capabilities. We hope that this benchmark will serve as a valuable resource to guide future advancements. The code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/tangzhy/RealCritic}.</p>

<p>Abstract: This note documents an implementation issue in recent adaptive attacks (Zhang et al. [2024]) against the multi-resolution self-ensemble defense (Fort and Lakshminarayanan [2024]). The implementation allowed adversarial perturbations to exceed the standard $L_\infty = 8/255$ bound by up to a factor of 20$\times$, reaching magnitudes of up to $L_\infty = 160/255$. When attacks are properly constrained within the intended bounds, the defense maintains non-trivial robustness. Beyond highlighting the importance of careful validation in adversarial machine learning research, our analysis reveals an intriguing finding: properly bounded adaptive attacks against strong multi-resolution self-ensembles often align with human perception, suggesting the need to reconsider how we measure adversarial robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: This research addresses the challenge of camera calibration and distortion parameter prediction from a single image using deep learning models. The main contributions of this work are: (1) demonstrating that a deep learning model, trained on a mix of real and synthetic images, can accurately predict camera and lens parameters from a single image, and (2) developing a comprehensive synthetic dataset using the AILiveSim simulation platform. This dataset includes variations in focal length and lens distortion parameters, providing a robust foundation for model training and testing. The training process predominantly relied on these synthetic images, complemented by a small subset of real images, to explore how well models trained on synthetic data can perform calibration tasks on real-world images. Traditional calibration methods require multiple images of a calibration object from various orientations, which is often not feasible due to the lack of such images in publicly available datasets. A deep learning network based on the ResNet architecture was trained on this synthetic dataset to predict camera calibration parameters following the Brown-Conrady lens model. The ResNet architecture, adapted for regression tasks, is capable of predicting continuous values essential for accurate camera calibration in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.

<p>Abstract: Using the exact gradients of the rewards to directly optimize policy parameters via backpropagation-through-time (BPTT) enables high training performance for quadrotor tasks. However, designing a fully differentiable reward architecture is often challenging. Partially differentiable rewards will result in biased gradient propagation that degrades training performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose Amended Backpropagation-through-Time (ABPT), a novel approach that mitigates gradient bias while preserving the training efficiency of BPTT. ABPT combines 0-step and N-step returns, effectively reducing the bias by leveraging value gradients from the learned Q-value function. Additionally, it adopts entropy regularization and state initialization mechanisms to encourage exploration during training. We evaluate ABPT on four representative quadrotor flight tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ABPT converges significantly faster and achieves higher ultimate rewards than existing learning algorithms, particularly in tasks involving partially differentiable rewards.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common and persistent sinus imflammation that affects 5 - 12\% of the general population. It significantly impacts quality of life and is often difficult to assess due to its subjective nature in clinical evaluation. We introduce PARASIDE, an automatic tool for segmenting air and soft tissue volumes of the structures of the sinus maxillaris, frontalis, sphenodalis and ethmoidalis in T1 MRI. By utilizing that segmentation, we can quantify feature relations that have been observed only manually and subjectively before. We performed an exemplary study and showed both volume and intensity relations between structures and radiology reports. While the soft tissue segmentation is good, the automated annotations of the air volumes are excellent. The average intensity over air structures are consistently below those of the soft tissues, close to perfect separability. Healthy subjects exhibit lower soft tissue volumes and lower intensities. Our developed system is the first automated whole nasal segmentation of 16 structures, and capable of calculating medical relevant features such as the Lund-Mackay score.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingchao Yu, Yaochu Jin, Yuchen Xiao, Yuping Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Schema, a form of structured knowledge that promotes transfer learning, is attracting growing attention in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI). Current schema research in neural computation is largely constrained to a single behavioral paradigm and relies heavily on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which lack the neural plausibility and biological interpretability. To address these limitations, this work first constructs a generalized behavioral paradigm framework for schema learning and introduces three novel cognitive tasks, thus supporting a comprehensive schema exploration. Second, we propose a new model using recurrent spiking neural networks with hierarchical intrinsic excitability modulation (HM-RSNNs). The top level of the model selects excitability properties for task-specific demands, while the bottom level fine-tunes these properties for intra-task problems. Finally, extensive visualization analyses of HM-RSNNs are conducted to showcase their computational advantages, track the intrinsic excitability evolution during schema learning, and examine neural coordination differences across tasks. Biologically inspired lesion studies further uncover task-specific distributions of intrinsic excitability within schemas. Experimental results show that HM-RSNNs significantly outperform RSNN baselines across all tasks and exceed RNNs in three novel cognitive tasks. Additionally, HM-RSNNs offer deeper insights into neural dynamics underlying schema learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction provides a framework for uncertainty quantification, specifically in the forms of prediction intervals and sets with distribution-free guaranteed coverage. While recent cross-conformal techniques such as CV+ and Jackknife+-after-bootstrap achieve better data efficiency than traditional split conformal methods, they incur substantial computational costs due to required pairwise comparisons between training and test samples' out-of-bag scores. Observing that these methods naturally extend from ensemble models, particularly random forests, we leverage existing optimized random forest implementations to enable efficient cross-conformal predictions.
  We present coverforest, a Python package that implements efficient conformal prediction methods specifically optimized for random forests. coverforest supports both regression and classification tasks through various conformal prediction methods, including split conformal, CV+, Jackknife+-after-bootstrap, and adaptive prediction sets. Our package leverages parallel computing and Cython optimizations to speed up out-of-bag calculations. Our experiments demonstrate that coverforest's predictions achieve the desired level of coverage. In addition, its training and prediction times can be faster than an existing implementation by 2--9 times.

<p>Abstract: Automated segmentation plays a pivotal role in medical image analysis and computer-assisted interventions. Despite the promising performance of existing methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), they neglect useful equivariant properties for images, such as rotational and reflection equivariance. This limitation can decrease performance and lead to inconsistent predictions, especially in applications like vessel segmentation where explicit orientation is absent. While existing equivariant learning approaches attempt to mitigate these issues, they substantially increase learning cost, model size, or both. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel application of an efficient symmetric rotation-equivariant (SRE) convolutional (SRE-Conv) kernel implementation to the U-Net architecture, to learn rotation and reflection-equivariant features, while also reducing the model size dramatically. We validate the effectiveness of our method through improved segmentation performance on retina vessel fundus imaging. Our proposed SRE U-Net not only significantly surpasses standard U-Net in handling rotated images, but also outperforms existing equivariant learning methods and does so with a reduced number of trainable parameters and smaller memory cost.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jordi Abante, Angelo Piga, Berta Ros, Clara F L\'opez-Le\'on, Josep M Canals, Jordi Soriano</p>
<p>Abstract: Calcium imaging has become a powerful alternative to electrophysiology for studying neuronal activity, offering spatial resolution and the ability to measure large populations of neurons in a minimally invasive manner. This technique has broad applications in neuroscience, neuroengineering, and medicine, enabling researchers to explore the relationship between neuron location and activity. Recent advancements in deep generative models (DGMs) have facilitated the modeling of neuronal population dynamics, uncovering latent representations that provide insights into behavior prediction and neuronal variance. However, these models often rely on spike inference algorithms and primarily focus on population-level dynamics, limiting their applicability for single-neuron analyses. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for single-neuron representation learning using autoregressive variational autoencoders (AVAEs). Our approach embeds individual neurons' spatiotemporal signals into a reduced-dimensional space without the need for spike inference algorithms. The AVAE excels over traditional linear methods by generating more informative and discriminative latent representations, improving tasks such as visualization, clustering, and the understanding of neuronal activity. Additionally, the reconstruction performance of the AVAE outperforms the state of the art, demonstrating its ability to accurately recover the original fluorescence signal from the learned representation. Using realistic simulations, we show that our model captures underlying physical properties and connectivity patterns, enabling it to distinguish between different firing and connectivity types. These findings position the AVAE as a versatile and powerful tool for advancing single-neuron analysis and lays the groundwork for future integration of multimodal single-cell datasets in neuroscience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Huang, Francisco Marmolejo-Coss\'io, Edwin Lock, David Parkes</p>
<p>Abstract: Bidders in combinatorial auctions face significant challenges when describing their preferences to an auctioneer. Classical work on preference elicitation focuses on query-based techniques inspired from proper learning--often via proxies that interface between bidders and an auction mechanism--to incrementally learn bidder preferences as needed to compute efficient allocations. Although such elicitation mechanisms enjoy theoretical query efficiency, the amount of communication required may still be too cognitively taxing in practice.
  We propose a family of efficient LLM-based proxy designs for eliciting preferences from bidders using natural language. Our proposed mechanism combines LLM pipelines and DNF-proper-learning techniques to quickly approximate preferences when communication is limited. To validate our approach, we create a testing sandbox for elicitation mechanisms that communicate in natural language. In our experiments, our most promising LLM proxy design reaches approximately efficient outcomes with five times fewer queries than classical proper learning based elicitation mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaheon Kim, Rentian Yao, Changbo Zhu, Xiaohui Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The optimal transport barycenter (a.k.a. Wasserstein barycenter) is a fundamental notion of averaging that extends from the Euclidean space to the Wasserstein space of probability distributions. Computation of the unregularized barycenter for discretized probability distributions on point clouds is a challenging task when the domain dimension $d > 1$. Most practical algorithms for approximating the barycenter problem are based on entropic regularization. In this paper, we introduce a nearly linear time $O(m \log{m})$ and linear space complexity $O(m)$ primal-dual algorithm, the Wasserstein-Descent $\dot{\mathbb{H}}^1$-Ascent (WDHA) algorithm, for computing the exact barycenter when the input probability density functions are discretized on an $m$-point grid. The key success of the WDHA algorithm hinges on alternating between two different yet closely related Wasserstein and Sobolev optimization geometries for the primal barycenter and dual Kantorovich potential subproblems. Under reasonable assumptions, we establish the convergence rate and iteration complexity of WDHA to its stationary point when the step size is appropriately chosen. Superior computational efficacy, scalability, and accuracy over the existing Sinkhorn-type algorithms are demonstrated on high-resolution (e.g., $1024 \times 1024$ images) 2D synthetic and real data.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present an end-to-end workflow for superconducting qubit readout that embeds co-designed Neural Networks (NNs) into the Quantum Instrumentation Control Kit (QICK). Capitalizing on the custom firmware and software of the QICK platform, which is built on Xilinx RFSoC FPGAs, we aim to leverage machine learning (ML) to address critical challenges in qubit readout accuracy and scalability. The workflow utilizes the hls4ml package and employs quantization-aware training to translate ML models into hardware-efficient FPGA implementations via user-friendly Python APIs. We experimentally demonstrate the design, optimization, and integration of an ML algorithm for single transmon qubit readout, achieving 96% single-shot fidelity with a latency of 32ns and less than 16% FPGA look-up table resource utilization. Our results offer the community an accessible workflow to advance ML-driven readout and adaptive control in quantum information processing applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models are widely employed in medical image analysis, due to their high adaptability and generalizability for downstream tasks. With the increasing number of foundation models being released, model selection has become an important issue. In this work, we study the capabilities of foundation models in medical image classification tasks by conducting a benchmark study on the MedMNIST dataset. Specifically, we adopt various foundation models ranging from convolutional to Transformer-based models and implement both end-to-end training and linear probing for all classification tasks. The results demonstrate the significant potential of these pre-trained models when transferred for medical image classification. We further conduct experiments with different image sizes and various sizes of training data. By analyzing all the results, we provide preliminary, yet useful insights and conclusions on this topic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vittorio Torri, Annamaria Bottelli, Michele Ercolanoni, Olivia Leoni, Francesca Ieva</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: This study proposes a Natural Language Processing pipeline to evaluate prescription appropriateness in Italian referrals, where reasons for prescriptions are recorded only as free text, complicating automated comparisons with guidelines. The pipeline aims to derive, for the first time, a comprehensive summary of the reasons behind these referrals and a quantification of their appropriateness. While demonstrated in a specific case study, the approach is designed to generalize to other types of examinations.
  Methods: Leveraging embeddings from a transformer-based model, the proposed approach clusters referral texts, maps clusters to labels, and aligns these labels with existing guidelines. We present a case study on a dataset of 496,971 referrals, consisting of all referrals for venous echocolordopplers of the lower limbs between 2019 and 2021 in the Lombardy Region. A sample of 1,000 referrals was manually annotated to validate the results.
  Results: The pipeline exhibited high performance for referrals' reasons (Prec=92.43%, Rec=83.28%) and excellent results for referrals' appropriateness (Prec=93.58%, Rec=91.52%) on the annotated subset. Analysis of the entire dataset identified clusters matching guideline-defined reasons - both appropriate and inappropriate - as well as clusters not addressed in the guidelines. Overall, 34.32% of referrals were marked as appropriate, 34.07% inappropriate, 14.37% likely inappropriate, and 17.24% could not be mapped to guidelines.
  Conclusions: The proposed pipeline effectively assessed prescription appropriateness across a large dataset, serving as a valuable tool for health authorities. Findings have informed the Lombardy Region's efforts to strengthen recommendations and reduce the burden of inappropriate referrals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pietro Favaro, Jean-Fran\c{c}ois Toubeau, Fran\c{c}ois Vall\'ee, Yury Dvorkin</p>
<p>Abstract: As opposed to conventional training methods tailored to minimize a given statistical metric or task-agnostic loss (e.g., mean squared error), Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) trains machine learning models for optimal performance in downstream decision-making tools. We argue that DFL can be leveraged to learn the parameters of system dynamics, expressed as constraint of the convex optimization control policy, while the system control signal is being optimized, thus creating an end-to-end learning framework. This is particularly relevant for systems in which behavior changes once the control policy is applied, hence rendering historical data less applicable. The proposed approach can perform system identification - i.e., determine appropriate parameters for the system analytical model - and control simultaneously to ensure that the model's accuracy is focused on areas most relevant to control. Furthermore, because black-box systems are non-differentiable, we design a loss function that requires solely to measure the system response. We propose pre-training on historical data and constraint relaxation to stabilize the DFL and deal with potential infeasibilities in learning. We demonstrate the usefulness of the method on a building Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning day-ahead management system for a realistic 15-zone building located in Denver, US. The results show that the conventional RC building model, with the parameters obtained from historical data using supervised learning, underestimates HVAC electrical power consumption. For our case study, the ex-post cost is on average six times higher than the expected one. Meanwhile, the same RC model with parameters obtained via DFL underestimates the ex-post cost only by 3%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charlotte Leininger, Simon Rittel, Ludwig Bothmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Training machine learning models for fair decisions faces two key challenges: The \emph{fairness-accuracy trade-off} results from enforcing fairness which weakens its predictive performance in contrast to an unconstrained model. The incompatibility of different fairness metrics poses another trade-off -- also known as the \emph{impossibility theorem}. Recent work identifies the bias within the observed data as a possible root cause and shows that fairness and predictive performance are in fact in accord when predictive performance is measured on unbiased data. We offer a causal explanation for these findings using the framework of the FiND (fictitious and normatively desired) world, a "fair" world, where protected attributes have no causal effects on the target variable. We show theoretically that (i) classical fairness metrics deemed to be incompatible are naturally satisfied in the FiND world, while (ii) fairness aligns with high predictive performance. We extend our analysis by suggesting how one can benefit from these theoretical insights in practice, using causal pre-processing methods that approximate the FiND world. Additionally, we propose a method for evaluating the approximation of the FiND world via pre-processing in practical use cases where we do not have access to the FiND world. In simulations and empirical studies, we demonstrate that these pre-processing methods are successful in approximating the FiND world and resolve both trade-offs. Our results provide actionable solutions for practitioners to achieve fairness and high predictive performance simultaneously.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Seale Smith, Chi-Heng Lin, Shikhar Tuli, Haris Jeelani, Shangqian Gao, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin, Yen-Chang Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) has created a critical need for techniques that enable efficient deployment on memory-constrained devices without compromising performance. We present a method to prune LLMs that selectively prunes model blocks based on an importance score and replaces them with a low-parameter replacement strategy. Specifically, we propose a principled metric to replace each pruned block using a weight-sharing mechanism that leverages unpruned counterparts from the model and block-specific low-rank adapters. Furthermore, we facilitate the learning of these replacement blocks with output feature normalization and an adapter initialization scheme built on low-rank SVD reconstructions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial performance gains over existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 5/6 benchmarks for a compression rate of 30% and 6/6 benchmarks for a compression rate of 40%. We also demonstrate that our approach can extend smaller models, boosting performance on 6/6 benchmarks using only ~0.3% tokens of extended training with minimal additional parameter costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Schumacher, Markus Strohmaier, Florian Lemmerich</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantification represents the problem of estimating the distribution of class labels on unseen data. It also represents a growing research field in supervised machine learning, for which a large variety of different algorithms has been proposed in recent years. However, a comprehensive empirical comparison of quantification methods that supports algorithm selection is not available yet. In this work, we close this research gap by conducting a thorough empirical performance comparison of 24 different quantification methods on overall more than 40 data sets, considering binary as well as multiclass quantification settings. We observe that no single algorithm generally outperforms all competitors, but identify a group of methods including the threshold selection-based Median Sweep and TSMax methods, the DyS framework including the HDy method, Forman's mixture model, and Friedman's method that performs best in the binary setting. For the multiclass setting, we observe that a different, broad group of algorithms yields good performance, including the HDx method, the Generalized Probabilistic Adjusted Count, the readme method, the energy distance minimization method, the EM algorithm for quantification, and Friedman's method. We also find that tuning the underlying classifiers has in most cases only a limited impact on the quantification performance. More generally, we find that the performance on multiclass quantification is inferior to the results obtained in the binary setting. Our results can guide practitioners who intend to apply quantification algorithms and help researchers to identify opportunities for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiongye Xiao, Defu Cao, Ruochen Yang, Gaurav Gupta, Gengshuo Liu, Chenzhong Yin, Radu Balan, Paul Bogdan</p>
<p>Abstract: Coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) are key tasks in modeling the complex dynamics of many physical processes. Recently, neural operators have shown the ability to solve PDEs by learning the integral kernel directly in Fourier/Wavelet space, so the difficulty for solving the coupled PDEs depends on dealing with the coupled mappings between the functions. Towards this end, we propose a \textit{coupled multiwavelets neural operator} (CMWNO) learning scheme by decoupling the coupled integral kernels during the multiwavelet decomposition and reconstruction procedures in the Wavelet space. The proposed model achieves significantly higher accuracy compared to previous learning-based solvers in solving the coupled PDEs including Gray-Scott (GS) equations and the non-local mean field game (MFG) problem. According to our experimental results, the proposed model exhibits a $2\times \sim 4\times$ improvement relative $L$2 error compared to the best results from the state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Umang Bhatt, Valerie Chen, Katherine M. Collins, Parameswaran Kamalaruban, Emma Kallina, Adrian Weller, Ameet Talwalkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Individual human decision-makers may benefit from different forms of support to improve decision outcomes, but when each form of support will yield better outcomes? In this work, we posit that personalizing access to decision support tools can be an effective mechanism for instantiating the appropriate use of AI assistance. Specifically, we propose the general problem of learning a decision support policy that, for a given input, chooses which form of support to provide to decision-makers for whom we initially have no prior information. We develop $\texttt{Modiste}$, an interactive tool to learn personalized decision support policies. $\texttt{Modiste}$ leverages stochastic contextual bandit techniques to personalize a decision support policy for each decision-maker and supports extensions to the multi-objective setting to account for auxiliary objectives like the cost of support. We find that personalized policies outperform offline policies, and, in the cost-aware setting, reduce the incurred cost with minimal degradation to performance. Our experiments include various realistic forms of support (e.g., expert consensus and predictions from a large language model) on vision and language tasks. Our human subject experiments validate our computational experiments, demonstrating that personalization can yield benefits in practice for real users, who interact with $\texttt{Modiste}$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Inae, Gang Liu, Meng Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Attribute reconstruction is used to predict node or edge features in the pre-training of graph neural networks. Given a large number of molecules, they learn to capture structural knowledge, which is transferable for various downstream property prediction tasks and vital in chemistry, biomedicine, and material science. Previous strategies that randomly select nodes to do attribute masking leverage the information of local neighbors However, the over-reliance of these neighbors inhibits the model's ability to learn from higher-level substructures. For example, the model would learn little from predicting three carbon atoms in a benzene ring based on the other three but could learn more from the inter-connections between the functional groups, or called chemical motifs. In this work, we propose and investigate motif-aware attribute masking strategies to capture inter-motif structures by leveraging the information of atoms in neighboring motifs. Once each graph is decomposed into disjoint motifs, the features for every node within a sample motif are masked. The graph decoder then predicts the masked features of each node within the motif for reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on eight molecular property prediction datasets and demonstrate its advantages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Sayeed Faruk, Elena Zheleva</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender systems relying on contextual multi-armed bandits continuously improve relevant item recommendations by taking into account the contextual information. The objective of bandit algorithms is to learn the best arm (e.g., best item to recommend) for each user and thus maximize the cumulative rewards from user engagement with the recommendations. The context that these algorithms typically consider are the user and item attributes. However, in the context of social networks where $\textit{the action of one user can influence the actions and rewards of other users,}$ neighbors' actions are also a very important context, as they can have not only predictive power but also can impact future rewards through spillover. Moreover, influence susceptibility can vary for different people based on their preferences and the closeness of ties to other users which leads to heterogeneity in the spillover effects. Here, we present a framework that allows contextual multi-armed bandits to account for such heterogeneous spillovers when choosing the best arm for each user. Our experiments on several semi-synthetic and real-world datasets show that our framework leads to significantly higher rewards than existing state-of-the-art solutions that ignore the network information and potential spillover.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ngoc Bui, Duy Nguyen, Man-Chung Yue, Viet Anh Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Algorithmic recourse emerges as a prominent technique to promote the explainability, transparency, and ethics of machine learning models. Existing algorithmic recourse approaches often assume an invariant predictive model; however, the predictive model is usually updated upon the arrival of new data. Thus, a recourse that is valid respective to the present model may become invalid for the future model. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework to generate a model-agnostic recourse that exhibits robustness to model shifts. Our framework first builds a coverage-validity-aware linear surrogate of the nonlinear (black-box) model; then, the recourse is generated with respect to the linear surrogate. We establish a theoretical connection between our coverage-validity-aware linear surrogate and the minimax probability machines (MPM). We then prove that by prescribing different covariance robustness, the proposed framework recovers popular regularizations for MPM, including the $\ell_2$-regularization and class-reweighting. Furthermore, we show that our surrogate pushes the approximate hyperplane intuitively, facilitating not only robust but also interpretable recourses. The numerical results demonstrate the usefulness and robustness of our framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: In real-world machine learning (ML) pipelines, datasets are continuously growing. Models must incorporate this new training data to improve generalization and adapt to potential distribution shifts. The cost of model retraining is proportional to how frequently the model is retrained and how much data it is trained on, which makes the naive approach of retraining from scratch each time impractical.
  We present Modyn, a data-centric end-to-end machine learning platform. Modyn's ML pipeline abstraction enables users to declaratively describe policies for continuously training a model on a growing dataset. Modyn pipelines allow users to apply data selection policies (to reduce the number of data points) and triggering policies (to reduce the number of trainings). Modyn executes and orchestrates these continuous ML training pipelines. The system is open-source and comes with an ecosystem of benchmark datasets, models, and tooling. We formally discuss how to measure the performance of ML pipelines by introducing the concept of composite models, enabling fair comparison of pipelines with different data selection and triggering policies. We empirically analyze how various data selection and triggering policies impact model accuracy, and also show that Modyn enables high throughput training with sample-level data selection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Wang, Zhe Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational efficiency and robustness are essential in process modeling, optimization, and control for real-world engineering applications. While neural network-based approaches have gained significant attention in recent years, conventional neural networks often fail to address these two critical aspects simultaneously or even independently. Inspired by natural physical systems and established literature, input convex architectures are known to enhance computational efficiency in optimization tasks, whereas Lipschitz-constrained architectures improve robustness. However, combining these properties within a single model requires careful review, as inappropriate methods for enforcing one property can undermine the other. To overcome this, we introduce a novel network architecture, termed Input Convex Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Networks (ICLRNNs). This architecture seamlessly integrates the benefits of convexity and Lipschitz continuity, enabling fast and robust neural network-based modeling and optimization. The ICLRNN outperforms existing recurrent units in both computational efficiency and robustness. Additionally, it has been successfully applied to practical engineering scenarios, such as modeling and control of chemical process and the modeling and real-world solar irradiance prediction for solar PV system planning at LHT Holdings in Singapore.

<p>Abstract: Despite the widespread success of deep learning, its intense requirements for vast amounts of data and extensive training make it impractical for various real-world applications where data is scarce. In recent years, Few-Shot Learning (FSL) has emerged as a learning paradigm that aims to address these limitations by leveraging prior knowledge to enable rapid adaptation to novel learning tasks. Due to its properties that highly complement deep learning's data-intensive needs, FSL has seen significant growth in the past few years. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of both well-established methods as well as recent advancements in the FSL field. The presented taxonomy extends previously proposed ones by incorporating emerging FSL paradigms, such as in-context learning, along with novel categories within the meta-learning paradigm for FSL, including neural processes and probabilistic meta-learning. Furthermore, a holistic overview of FSL is provided by discussing hybrid FSL approaches that extend FSL beyond the typically examined supervised learning setting. The survey also explores FSL's diverse applications across various domains. Finally, recent trends shaping the field, outstanding challenges, and promising future research directions are discussed.</p>

<p>Abstract: Statistical heterogeneity of clients' local data is an important characteristic in federated learning, motivating personalized algorithms tailored to the local data statistics. Though there has been a plethora of algorithms proposed for personalized supervised learning, discovering the structure of local data through personalized unsupervised learning is less explored. We initiate a systematic study of such personalized unsupervised learning by developing algorithms based on optimization criteria inspired by a hierarchical Bayesian statistical framework. We develop adaptive algorithms that discover the balance between using limited local data and collaborative information. We do this in the context of two unsupervised learning tasks: personalized dimensionality reduction and personalized diffusion models. We develop convergence analyses for our adaptive algorithms which illustrate the dependence on problem parameters (e.g., heterogeneity, local sample size). We also develop a theoretical framework for personalized diffusion models, which shows the benefits of collaboration even under heterogeneity. We finally evaluate our proposed algorithms using synthetic and real data, demonstrating the effective sample amplification for personalized tasks, induced through collaboration, despite data heterogeneity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep extreme classification (XC) aims to train an encoder architecture and an accompanying classifier architecture to tag a data point with the most relevant subset of labels from a very large universe of labels. XC applications in ranking, recommendation and tagging routinely encounter tail labels for which the amount of training data is exceedingly small. Graph convolutional networks (GCN) present a convenient but computationally expensive way to leverage task metadata and enhance model accuracies in these settings. This paper formally establishes that in several use cases, the steep computational cost of GCNs is entirely avoidable by replacing GCNs with non-GCN architectures. The paper notices that in these settings, it is much more effective to use graph data to regularize encoder training than to implement a GCN. Based on these insights, an alternative paradigm RAMEN is presented to utilize graph metadata in XC settings that offers significant performance boosts with zero increase in inference computational costs. RAMEN scales to datasets with up to 1M labels and offers prediction accuracy up to 15% higher on benchmark datasets than state of the art methods, including those that use graph metadata to train GCNs. RAMEN also offers 10% higher accuracy over the best baseline on a proprietary recommendation dataset sourced from click logs of a popular search engine. Code for RAMEN will be released publicly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangchen Lan, Dong-Jun Han, Abolfazl Hashemi, Vaneet Aggarwal, Christopher G. Brinton</p>
<p>Abstract: To improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), we propose a novel asynchronous federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework termed AFedPG, which constructs a global model through collaboration among $N$ agents using policy gradient (PG) updates. To address the challenge of lagged policies in asynchronous settings, we design a delay-adaptive lookahead technique \textit{specifically for FedRL} that can effectively handle heterogeneous arrival times of policy gradients. We analyze the theoretical global convergence bound of AFedPG, and characterize the advantage of the proposed algorithm in terms of both the sample complexity and time complexity. Specifically, our AFedPG method achieves $O(\frac{{\epsilon}^{-2.5}}{N})$ sample complexity for global convergence at each agent on average. Compared to the single agent setting with $O(\epsilon^{-2.5})$ sample complexity, it enjoys a linear speedup with respect to the number of agents. Moreover, compared to synchronous FedPG, AFedPG improves the time complexity from $O(\frac{t_{\max}}{N})$ to $O({\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{t_{i}}})^{-1}$, where $t_{i}$ denotes the time consumption in each iteration at agent $i$, and $t_{\max}$ is the largest one. The latter complexity $O({\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{t_{i}}})^{-1}$ is always smaller than the former one, and this improvement becomes significant in large-scale federated settings with heterogeneous computing powers ($t_{\max}\gg t_{\min}$). Finally, we empirically verify the improved performance of AFedPG in four widely used MuJoCo environments with varying numbers of agents. We also demonstrate the advantages of AFedPG in various computing heterogeneity scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Josefina Catoni, Domonkos Martos, Ferenc Csikor, Enzo Ferrante, Diego H. Milone, Bal\'azs Mesz\'ena, Gerg\H{o} Orb\'an, Rodrigo Echeveste</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Generative Models (DGMs) can learn flexible latent variable representations of images while avoiding intractable computations, common in Bayesian inference. However, investigating the properties of inference in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), a major class of DGMs, reveals severe problems in their uncertainty representations. Here we draw inspiration from classical computer vision to introduce an inductive bias into the VAE by incorporating a global explaining-away latent variable, which remedies defective inference in VAEs. Unlike standard VAEs, the Explaing-Away VAE (EA-VAE) provides uncertainty estimates that align with normative requirements across a wide spectrum of perceptual tasks, including image corruption, interpolation, and out-of-distribution detection. We find that restored inference capabilities are delivered by developing a motif in the inference network (the encoder) which is widespread in biological neural networks: divisive normalization. Our results establish EA-VAEs as reliable tools to perform inference under deep generative models with appropriate estimates of uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kexin Li, Aastha Mehta, David Lie</p>
<p>Abstract: The adoption of large cloud-based models for inference in privacy-sensitive domains, such as homeless care systems and medical imaging, raises concerns about end-user data privacy. A common solution is adding locally differentially private (LDP) noise to queries before transmission, but this often reduces utility. LDPKiT, which stands for Local Differentially-Private and Utility-Preserving Inference via Knowledge Transfer, addresses the concern by generating a privacy-preserving inference dataset aligned with the private data distribution. This dataset is used to train a reliable local model for inference on sensitive inputs. LDPKiT employs a two-layer noise injection framework that leverages LDP and its post-processing property to create a privacy-protected inference dataset. The first layer ensures privacy, while the second layer helps to recover utility by creating a sufficiently large dataset for subsequent local model extraction using noisy labels returned from a cloud model on privacy-protected noisy inputs. Our experiments on Fashion-MNIST, SVHN and PathMNIST medical datasets demonstrate that LDPKiT effectively improves utility while preserving privacy. Moreover, the benefits of using LDPKiT increase at higher, more privacy-protective noise levels. For instance, on SVHN, LDPKiT achieves similar inference accuracy with $\epsilon=1.25$ as it does with $\epsilon=2.0$, providing stronger privacy guarantees with less than a 2% drop in accuracy. Furthermore, we perform extensive sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of dataset sizes on LDPKiT's effectiveness and systematically analyze the latent space representations to offer a theoretical explanation for its accuracy improvements. Lastly, we qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that the type of knowledge distillation performed by LDPKiT is ethical and fundamentally distinct from adversarial model extraction attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungho Jeon, Xinyue Ma, Kwang In Kim, Myeongjae Jeon</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent rehearsal-free methods, guided by prompts, generally excel in vision-related continual learning (CL) scenarios with continuously drifting data. To be deployable on real-world devices, these methods must contain high resource efficiency during training. In this paper, we introduce Resource-Efficient Prompting (REP), which targets improving the resource efficiency of prompt-based rehearsal-free methods. Our key focus is on avoiding catastrophic trade-offs with accuracy while trimming computational and memory costs during prompt learning. We achieve this by exploiting swift prompt selection that enhances input data using a carefully provisioned model, and by developing adaptive token merging (AToM) and layer dropping (ALD) algorithms for the prompt updating stage. AToM and ALD perform selective skipping across the data and model dimensions without compromising task-specific features while learning new tasks. We validate REP's superior resource efficiency over current state-of-the-art ViT- and CNN-based methods through extensive experiments on three image classification datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series data are ubiquitous across a wide range of real-world domains. While real-world time series analysis (TSA) requires human experts to integrate numerical series data with multimodal domain-specific knowledge, most existing TSA models rely solely on numerical data, overlooking the significance of information beyond numerical series. This oversight is due to the untapped potential of textual series data and the absence of a comprehensive, high-quality multimodal dataset. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce Time-MMD, the first multi-domain, multimodal time series dataset covering 9 primary data domains. Time-MMD ensures fine-grained modality alignment, eliminates data contamination, and provides high usability. Additionally, we develop MM-TSFlib, the first-cut multimodal time-series forecasting (TSF) library, seamlessly pipelining multimodal TSF evaluations based on Time-MMD for in-depth analyses. Extensive experiments conducted on Time-MMD through MM-TSFlib demonstrate significant performance enhancements by extending unimodal TSF to multimodality, evidenced by over 15% mean squared error reduction in general, and up to 40% in domains with rich textual data. More importantly, our datasets and library revolutionize broader applications, impacts, research topics to advance TSA. The dataset is available at https://github.com/AdityaLab/Time-MMD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcello Massimo Negri, Jonathan Aellen, Volker Roth</p>
<p>Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) are powerful and efficient models for density estimation. When modeling densities on manifolds, NFs can be generalized to injective flows but the Jacobian determinant becomes computationally prohibitive. Current approaches either consider bounds on the log-likelihood or rely on some approximations of the Jacobian determinant. In contrast, we propose injective flows for star-like manifolds and show that for such manifolds we can compute the Jacobian determinant exactly and efficiently, with the same cost as NFs. This aspect is particularly relevant for variational inference settings, where no samples are available and only some unnormalized target is known. Among many, we showcase the relevance of modeling densities on star-like manifolds in two settings. Firstly, we introduce a novel Objective Bayesian approach for penalized likelihood models by interpreting level-sets of the penalty as star-like manifolds. Secondly, we consider probabilistic mixing models and introduce a general method for variational inference by defining the posterior of mixture weights on the probability simplex.</p>

<p>Abstract: In continual learning, knowledge must be preserved and re-used between tasks, maintaining good transfer to future tasks and minimizing forgetting of previously learned ones. While several practical algorithms have been devised for this setting, there have been few theoretical works aiming to quantify and bound the degree of Forgetting in general settings. We provide both data-dependent and oracle upper bounds that apply regardless of model and algorithm choice, as well as bounds for Gibbs posteriors. We derive an algorithm based on our bounds and demonstrate empirically that our approach yields tight bounds on forgetting for several continual learning problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Errica, Giuseppe Siracusano, Davide Sanvito, Roberto Bifulco</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) changed the way we design and interact with software systems. Their ability to process and extract information from text has drastically improved productivity in a number of routine tasks. Developers that want to include these models in their software stack, however, face a dreadful challenge: debugging LLMs' inconsistent behavior across minor variations of the prompt. We therefore introduce two metrics for classification tasks, namely sensitivity and consistency, which are complementary to task performance. First, sensitivity measures changes of predictions across rephrasings of the prompt, and does not require access to ground truth labels. Instead, consistency measures how predictions vary across rephrasings for elements of the same class. We perform an empirical comparison of these metrics on text classification tasks, using them as guideline for understanding failure modes of the LLM. Our hope is that sensitivity and consistency will be helpful to guide prompt engineering and obtain LLMs that balance robustness with performance.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14058">On the Causal Sufficiency and Necessity of Multi-Modal Representation Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyao Wang, Siyu Zhao, Wenwen Qiang, Jiangmeng Li, Fuchun Sun, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Modal Learning (MML) aims to learn effective representations across modalities for accurate predictions. Existing methods typically focus on modality consistency and specificity to learn effective representations. However, from a causal perspective, they may lead to representations that contain insufficient and unnecessary information. To address this, we propose that effective MML representations should be causally sufficient and necessary. Considering practical issues like spurious correlations and modality conflicts, we relax the exogeneity and monotonicity assumptions prevalent in prior works and explore the concepts specific to MML, i.e., Causal Complete Cause (\(C^3\)). We begin by defining \(C^3\), which quantifies the probability of representations being causally sufficient and necessary. We then discuss the identifiability of \(C^3\) and introduce an instrumental variable to support identifying \(C^3\) with non-exogeneity and non-monotonicity. Building on this, we conduct the $C^3$ measurement, i.e., \(C^3\) risk. We propose a twin network to estimate it through (i) the real-world branch: utilizing the instrumental variable for sufficiency, and (ii) the hypothetical-world branch: applying gradient-based counterfactual modeling for necessity. Theoretical analyses confirm its reliability. Based on these results, we propose $C^3$ Regularization, a plug-and-play method that enforces the causal completeness of the learned representations by minimizing \(C^3\) risk. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04498">Model-Based Transfer Learning for Contextual Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jung-Hoon Cho, Vindula Jayawardana, Sirui Li, Cathy Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach to complex decision making. However, one issue that limits its practical application is its brittleness, sometimes failing to train in the presence of small changes in the environment. Motivated by the success of zero-shot transfer-where pre-trained models perform well on related tasks-we consider the problem of selecting a good set of training tasks to maximize generalization performance across a range of tasks. Given the high cost of training, it is critical to select training tasks strategically, but not well understood how to do so. We hence introduce Model-Based Transfer Learning (MBTL), which layers on top of existing RL methods to effectively solve contextual RL problems. MBTL models the generalization performance in two parts: 1) the performance set point, modeled using Gaussian processes, and 2) performance loss (generalization gap), modeled as a linear function of contextual similarity. MBTL combines these two pieces of information within a Bayesian optimization (BO) framework to strategically select training tasks. We show theoretically that the method exhibits sublinear regret in the number of training tasks and discuss conditions to further tighten regret bounds. We experimentally validate our methods using urban traffic and standard continuous control benchmarks. The experimental results suggest that MBTL can achieve up to 43x improved sample efficiency compared with canonical independent training and multi-task training. Further experiments demonstrate the efficacy of BO and the insensitivity to the underlying RL algorithm and hyperparameters. This work lays the foundations for investigating explicit modeling of generalization, thereby enabling principled yet effective methods for contextual RL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Policy optimization methods benefit from a simple and tractable policy parametrization, usually the Gaussian for continuous action spaces. In this paper, we consider a broader policy family that remains tractable: the $q$-exponential family. This family of policies is flexible, allowing the specification of both heavy-tailed policies ($q>1$) and light-tailed policies ($q<1$). This paper examines the interplay between $q$-exponential policies for several actor-critic algorithms conducted on both online and offline problems. We find that heavy-tailed policies are more effective in general and can consistently improve on Gaussian. In particular, we find the Student's t-distribution to be more stable than the Gaussian across settings and that a heavy-tailed $q$-Gaussian for Tsallis Advantage Weighted Actor-Critic consistently performs well in offline benchmark problems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinze Sun, Yongpan Sheng, Lirong He, Yongbin Qin, Ming Liu, Tao Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) is increasingly gaining attention for its ability to extrapolate new events from historical data, thereby enriching the inherently incomplete temporal knowledge graphs. Existing graph-based representation learning frameworks have made significant strides in developing evolving representations for both entities and relational embeddings. Despite these achievements, there's a notable tendency in these models to inadvertently learn biased data representations and mine spurious correlations, consequently failing to discern the causal relationships between events. This often leads to incorrect predictions based on these false correlations. To address this, we propose an innovative Causal Enhanced Graph Representation Learning framework for TKGR (named CEGRL-TKGR). This framework introduces causal structures in graph-based representation learning to unveil the essential causal relationships between events, ultimately enhancing the performance of the TKGR task. Specifically, we first disentangle the evolutionary representations of entities and relations in a temporal knowledge graph sequence into two distinct components, namely causal representations and confounding representations. Then, drawing on causal intervention theory, we advocate the utilization of causal representations for predictions, aiming to mitigate the effects of erroneous correlations caused by confounding features, thus achieving more robust and accurate predictions. Finally, extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model in the link prediction task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning structured state space models, especially the Mamba architecture, have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements while maintaining linear complexity. In this study, we introduce functional spatiotemporal Mamba (FST-Mamba), a Mamba-based model designed for discovering neurological biomarkers using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We focus on dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) derived from fMRI and propose a hierarchical spatiotemporal Mamba-based network that processes spatial and temporal information separately using Mamba-based encoders. Leveraging the topological uniqueness of the FNC matrix, we introduce a component-wise varied-scale aggregation (CVA) mechanism to aggregate connectivity across individual components within brain networks, enabling the model to capture component-level and network-level information. Additionally, we propose symmetric rotary position encoding (SymRope) to encode the relative positions of each functional connection while considering the symmetric nature of the FNC matrix. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the proposed FST-Mamba model on various brain-based classification and regression tasks. We further show brain connectivities and dynamics that are crucial for the prediction. Our work reveals the substantial potential of attention-free sequence modeling in brain discovery.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15386">Coverage and Bias of Street View Imagery in Mapping the Urban Environment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zicheng Fan, Chen-Chieh Feng, Filip Biljecki</p>
<p>Abstract: Street View Imagery (SVI) has emerged as a valuable data form in urban studies, enabling new ways to map and sense urban environments. However, fundamental concerns regarding the representativeness, quality, and reliability of SVI remain underexplored, e.g. to what extent can cities be captured by such data and do data gaps result in bias. This research, positioned at the intersection of spatial data quality and urban analytics, addresses these concerns by proposing a novel and effective method to estimate SVI's element-level coverage in the urban environment. The method integrates the positional relationships between SVI and target elements, as well as the impact of physical obstructions. Expanding the domain of data quality to SVI, we introduce an indicator system that evaluates the extent of coverage, focusing on the completeness and frequency dimensions. Taking London as a case study, three experiments are conducted to identify potential biases in SVI's ability to cover and represent urban environmental elements, using building facades as an example. It is found that despite their high availability along urban road networks, Google Street View covers only 62.4 % of buildings in the case study area. The average facade coverage per building is 12.4 %. SVI tends to over-represent non-residential buildings, thus possibly resulting in biased analyses, and its coverage of environmental elements is position-dependent. The research also highlights the variability of SVI coverage under different data acquisition practices and proposes an optimal sampling interval range of 50-60 m for SVI collection. The findings suggest that while SVI offers valuable insights, it is no panacea - its application in urban research requires careful consideration of data coverage and element-level representativeness to ensure reliable results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elizaveta Tennant, Stephen Hailes, Mirco Musolesi</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision-making agents based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across various domains of human activity. While their applications are currently rather specialized, several research efforts are under way to develop more generalist agents. As LLM-based systems become more agentic, their influence on human activity will grow and the transparency of this will decrease. Consequently, developing effective methods for aligning them to human values is vital.
  The prevailing practice in alignment often relies on human preference data (e.g., in RLHF or DPO), in which values are implicit and are essentially deduced from relative preferences over different model outputs. In this work, instead of relying on human feedback, we introduce the design of reward functions that explicitly encode core human values for Reinforcement Learning-based fine-tuning of foundation agent models. Specifically, we use intrinsic rewards for the moral alignment of LLM agents.
  We evaluate our approach using the traditional philosophical frameworks of Deontological Ethics and Utilitarianism, quantifying moral rewards for agents in terms of actions and consequences on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) environment. We also show how moral fine-tuning can be deployed to enable an agent to unlearn a previously developed selfish strategy. Finally, we find that certain moral strategies learned on the IPD game generalize to several other matrix game environments. In summary, we demonstrate that fine-tuning with intrinsic rewards is a promising general solution for aligning LLM agents to human values, and it might represent a more transparent and cost-effective alternative to currently predominant alignment techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sayan Biswas, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Rishi Sharma, Thibaud Trinca, Martijn de Vos</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized learning (DL) is an emerging approach that enables nodes to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing raw data. In many application domains, such as healthcare, this approach faces challenges due to the high level of heterogeneity in the training data's feature space. Such feature heterogeneity lowers model utility and negatively impacts fairness, particularly for nodes with under-represented training data. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{Facade}, a clustering-based DL algorithm specifically designed for fair model training when the training data exhibits several distinct features. The challenge of \textsc{Facade} is to assign nodes to clusters, one for each feature, based on the similarity in the features of their local data, without requiring individual nodes to know apriori which cluster they belong to. \textsc{Facade} (1) dynamically assigns nodes to their appropriate clusters over time, and (2) enables nodes to collaboratively train a specialized model for each cluster in a fully decentralized manner. We theoretically prove the convergence of \textsc{Facade}, implement our algorithm, and compare it against three state-of-the-art baselines. Our experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of model accuracy and fairness compared to all three competitors. Compared to the best-performing baseline, \textsc{Facade} on the CIFAR-10 dataset also reduces communication costs by 32.3\% to reach a target accuracy when cluster sizes are imbalanced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiyuan Huang, Zengfeng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by applications in online bidding and sleeping bandits, we examine the problem of contextual bandits with cross learning, where the learner observes the loss associated with the action across all possible contexts, not just the current round's context. Our focus is on a setting where losses are chosen adversarially, and contexts are sampled i.i.d. from a specific distribution. This problem was first studied by Balseiro et al. (2019), who proposed an algorithm that achieves near-optimal regret under the assumption that the context distribution is known in advance. However, this assumption is often unrealistic. To address this issue, Schneider and Zimmert (2023) recently proposed a new algorithm that achieves nearly optimal expected regret. It is well-known that expected regret can be significantly weaker than high-probability bounds. In this paper, we present a novel, in-depth analysis of their algorithm and demonstrate that it actually achieves near-optimal regret with high probability. There are steps in the original analysis by Schneider and Zimmert (2023) that lead only to an expected bound by nature. In our analysis, we introduce several new insights. Specifically, we make extensive use of the weak dependency structure between different epochs, which was overlooked in previous analyses. Additionally, standard martingale inequalities are not directly applicable, so we refine martingale inequalities to complete our analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giovanni De Toni, Stefano Teso, Bruno Lepri, Andrea Passerini</p>
<p>Abstract: Algorithmic Recourse (AR) aims to provide users with actionable steps to overturn unfavourable decisions made by machine learning predictors. However, these actions often take time to implement (e.g., getting a degree can take years), and their effects may vary as the world evolves. Thus, it is natural to ask for recourse that remains valid in a dynamic environment. In this paper, we study the robustness of algorithmic recourse over time by casting the problem through the lens of causality. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that (even robust) causal AR methods can fail over time except in the -- unlikely -- case that the world is stationary. Even more critically, unless the world is fully deterministic, counterfactual AR cannot be solved optimally. To account for this, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm for temporal AR that explicitly accounts for time under the assumption of having access to an estimator approximating the stochastic process. Our simulations on synthetic and realistic datasets show how considering time produces more resilient solutions to potential trends in the data distribution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pin-Lun Hsu, Yun Dai, Vignesh Kothapalli, Qingquan Song, Shao Tang, Siyu Zhu, Steven Shimizu, Shivam Sahni, Haowen Ning, Yanning Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently at scale presents a formidable challenge, driven by their ever-increasing computational demands and the need for enhanced performance. In this work, we introduce Liger-Kernel, an open-sourced set of Triton kernels developed specifically for LLM training. With kernel optimization techniques like kernel operation fusing and input chunking, our kernels achieve on average a 20% increase in training throughput and a 60% reduction in GPU memory usage for popular LLMs compared to HuggingFace implementations. In addition, Liger-Kernel is designed with modularity, accessibility, and adaptability in mind, catering to both casual and expert users. Comprehensive benchmarks and integration tests are built in to ensure compatibility, performance, correctness, and convergence across diverse computing environments and model architectures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jirui Yang, Peng Chen, Zhihui Lu, Ruijun Deng, Qiang Duan, Jianping Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Graph Neural Network (FedGNN) integrate federated learning (FL) with graph neural networks (GNNs) to enable privacy-preserving training on distributed graph data. Vertical Federated Graph Neural Network (VFGNN), a key branch of FedGNN, handles scenarios where data features and labels are distributed among participants. Despite the robust privacy-preserving design of VFGNN, we have found that it still faces the risk of backdoor attacks, even in situations where labels are inaccessible. This paper proposes BVG, a novel backdoor attack method that leverages multi-hop triggers and backdoor retention, requiring only four target-class nodes to execute effective attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that BVG achieves nearly 100% attack success rates across three commonly used datasets and three GNN models, with minimal impact on the main task accuracy. We also evaluated various defense methods, and the BVG method maintained high attack effectiveness even under existing defenses. This finding highlights the need for advanced defense mechanisms to counter sophisticated backdoor attacks in practical VFGNN applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isaac Symes Thompson, Alberto Caron, Chris Hicks, Vasilios Mavroudis</p>
<p>Abstract: A significant challenge for autonomous cyber defence is ensuring a defensive agent's ability to generalise across diverse network topologies and configurations. This capability is necessary for agents to remain effective when deployed in dynamically changing environments, such as an enterprise network where devices may frequently join and leave. Standard approaches to deep reinforcement learning, where policies are parameterised using a fixed-input multi-layer perceptron (MLP) expect fixed-size observation and action spaces. In autonomous cyber defence, this makes it hard to develop agents that generalise to environments with network topologies different from those trained on, as the number of nodes affects the natural size of the observation and action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we reframe the problem of autonomous network defence using entity-based reinforcement learning, where the observation and action space of an agent are decomposed into a collection of discrete entities. This framework enables the use of policy parameterisations specialised in compositional generalisation. We train a Transformer-based policy on the Yawning Titan cyber-security simulation environment and test its generalisation capabilities across various network topologies. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms an MLP-based policy when training across fixed-size networks of varying topologies, and matches performance when training on a single network. We also demonstrate the potential for zero-shot generalisation to networks of a different size to those seen in training. These findings highlight the potential for entity-based reinforcement learning to advance the field of autonomous cyber defence by providing more generalisable policies capable of handling variations in real-world network environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed A. Elhag, T. Konstantin Rusch, Francesco Di Giovanni, Michael Bronstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Incorporating equivariance as an inductive bias into deep learning architectures to take advantage of the data symmetry has been successful in multiple applications, such as chemistry and dynamical systems. In particular, roto-translations are crucial for effectively modeling geometric graphs and molecules, where understanding the 3D structures enhances generalization. However, equivariant models often pose challenges due to their high computational complexity. In this paper, we introduce REMUL, a training procedure for approximating equivariance with multitask learning. We show that unconstrained models (which do not build equivariance into the architecture) can learn approximate symmetries by minimizing an additional simple equivariance loss. By formulating equivariance as a new learning objective, we can control the level of approximate equivariance in the model. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to equivariant baselines while being $10 \times$ faster at inference and $2.5 \times$ at training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ola R{\o}nning, Eric Nalisnick, Christophe Ley, Padhraic Smyth, Thomas Hamelryck</p>
<p>Abstract: Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) [Liu and Wang, 2016] performs approximate Bayesian inference by representing the posterior with a set of particles. However, SVGD suffers from variance collapse, i.e. poor predictions due to underestimating uncertainty [Ba et al., 2021], even for moderately-dimensional models such as small Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). To address this issue, we generalize SVGD by letting each particle parameterize a component distribution in a mixture model. Our method, Stein Mixture Inference (SMI), optimizes a lower bound to the evidence (ELBO) and introduces user-specified guides parameterized by particles. SMI extends the Nonlinear SVGD framework [Wang and Liu, 2019] to the case of variational Bayes. SMI effectively avoids variance collapse, judging by a previously described test developed for this purpose, and performs well on standard data sets. In addition, SMI requires considerably fewer particles than SVGD to accurately estimate uncertainty for small BNNs. The synergistic combination of NSVGD, ELBO optimization and user-specified guides establishes a promising approach towards variational Bayesian inference in the case of tall and wide data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huy Thong Nguyen, En-Hung Chu, Lenord Melvix, Jazon Jiao, Chunglin Wen, Benjamin Louie</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Teacher2Task, a novel framework for multi-teacher learning that eliminates the need for manual aggregation heuristics. Existing multi-teacher methods typically rely on such heuristics to combine predictions from multiple teachers, often resulting in sub-optimal aggregated labels and the propagation of aggregation errors. Teacher2Task addresses these limitations by introducing teacher-specific input tokens and reformulating the training process. Instead of relying on aggregated labels, the framework transforms the training data, consisting of ground truth labels and annotations from N teachers, into N+1 distinct tasks: N auxiliary tasks that predict the labeling styles of the N individual teachers, and one primary task that focuses on the ground truth labels. This approach, drawing upon principles from multiple learning paradigms, demonstrates strong empirical results across a range of architectures, modalities, and tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arash Behboodi, Gabriele Cesa</p>
<p>Abstract: Weight sharing, equivariance, and local filters, as in convolutional neural networks, are believed to contribute to the sample efficiency of neural networks. However, it is not clear how each one of these design choices contributes to the generalization error. Through the lens of statistical learning theory, we aim to provide insight into this question by characterizing the relative impact of each choice on the sample complexity. We obtain lower and upper sample complexity bounds for a class of single hidden layer networks. For a large class of activation functions, the bounds depend merely on the norm of filters and are dimension-independent. We also provide bounds for max-pooling and an extension to multi-layer networks, both with mild dimension dependence. We provide a few takeaways from the theoretical results. It can be shown that depending on the weight-sharing mechanism, the non-equivariant weight-sharing can yield a similar generalization bound as the equivariant one. We show that locality has generalization benefits, however the uncertainty principle implies a trade-off between locality and expressivity. We conduct extensive experiments and highlight some consistent trends for these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> RuiZhe Jiang, Haotian Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: Over-parameterized neural network models often lead to significant performance discrepancies between training and test sets, a phenomenon known as overfitting. To address this, researchers have proposed numerous regularization techniques tailored to various tasks and model architectures. In this paper, we introduce a simple perspective on overfitting: models learn different representations in different i.i.d. datasets. Based on this viewpoint, we propose an adaptive method, ConsistentFeature, that regularizes the model by constraining feature differences across random subsets of the same training set. Due to minimal prior assumptions, this approach is applicable to almost any architecture and task. Our experiments show that it effectively reduces overfitting, with low sensitivity to hyperparameters and minimal computational cost. It demonstrates particularly strong memory suppression and promotes normal convergence, even when the model has already started to overfit. Even in the absence of significant overfitting, our method consistently improves accuracy and reduces validation loss.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongxu Ma, Kai Tian, Tao Zhang, Xuefeng Zhang, Chunjie Chen, Han Li, Jihong Guan, Shuigeng Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Continuous value prediction (CVP) plays a crucial role in short video recommendation, capturing user preferences through precise numerical estimations. However, traditional regression-based methods often struggle with challenges like wide value ranges and imbalanced data, leading to prediction bias. While ordinal classification approaches have been introduced to address these issues, their reliance on discretization reduces accuracy and overlooks inherent relationships between intervals. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel Generative Regression (GR) framework for CVP, inspired by sequence generation techniques in language modeling. Our method transforms numerical values into token sequences through structural discretization, preserving original data fidelity while improving prediction precision. Leveraging a carefully crafted vocabulary and label encoding, GR employs curriculum learning with an embedding mixup strategy to bridge training-inference gaps. Experimental evaluations on four public datasets and one large-scale industrial dataset validate the superiority of GR over existing methods. Real-world A/B tests on Kuaishou, a leading video platform, further demonstrate its practical effectiveness. Additionally, GR proves adaptable to other regression tasks, such as Lifetime Value (LTV) prediction, showcasing its potential as a robust solution for diverse CVP challenges.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-adaptive large language models (LLMs) aim to solve the challenges posed by traditional fine-tuning methods, which are often computationally intensive and static in their ability to handle diverse tasks. We introduce Transformer-Squared, a novel self-adaptation framework that adapts LLMs for unseen tasks in real-time by selectively adjusting only the singular components of their weight matrices. During inference, Transformer-Squared employs a two-pass mechanism: first, a dispatch system identifies the task properties, and then task-specific 'expert' vectors, trained using reinforcement learning, are dynamically mixed to obtain targeted behavior for the incoming prompt. Our method consistently outperforms ubiquitous approaches such as LoRA, with fewer parameters and greater efficiency. Furthermore, Transformer-Squared demonstrates versatility across different LLM architectures and modalities, including vision-language tasks. Transformer-Squared represents a significant leap forward, offering a scalable, efficient solution for enhancing the adaptability and task-specific performance of LLMs, paving the way for truly dynamic, self-organizing AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal fake news detection is essential for maintaining the authenticity of Internet multimedia information. Significant differences in form and content of multimodal information lead to intensified optimization conflicts, hindering effective model training as well as reducing the effectiveness of existing fusion methods for bimodal. To address this problem, we propose the MTPareto framework to optimize multimodal fusion, using a Targeted Pareto(TPareto) optimization algorithm for fusion-level-specific objective learning with a certain focus. Based on the designed hierarchical fusion network, the algorithm defines three fusion levels with corresponding losses and implements all-modal-oriented Pareto gradient integration for each. This approach accomplishes superior multimodal fusion by utilizing the information obtained from intermediate fusion to provide positive effects to the entire process. Experiment results on FakeSV and FVC datasets show that the proposed framework outperforms baselines and the TPareto optimization algorithm achieves 2.40% and 1.89% accuracy improvement respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel masked pre-training technique for graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems. By randomly masking up to 40\% of input mesh nodes during pre-training, we force the model to learn robust representations of complex fluid dynamics. We pair this masking strategy with an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture and gated multi-layer perceptrons to further enhance performance. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on seven CFD datasets, including a new challenging dataset of 3D intracranial aneurysm simulations with over 250,000 nodes per mesh. Moreover, it significantly improves model performance and training efficiency across such diverse range of fluid simulation tasks. We demonstrate improvements of up to 60\% in long-term prediction accuracy compared to previous best models, while maintaining similar computational costs. Notably, our approach enables effective pre-training on multiple datasets simultaneously, significantly reducing the time and data required to achieve high performance on new tasks. Through extensive ablation studies, we provide insights into the optimal masking ratio, architectural choices, and training strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evgeny Saveliev, Jiashuo Liu, Nabeel Seedat, Anders Boyd, Mihaela van der Schaar</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has the potential to revolutionize various domains, but its adoption is often hindered by the disconnect between the needs of domain experts and translating these needs into robust and valid ML tools. Despite recent advances in LLM-based co-pilots to democratize ML for non-technical domain experts, these systems remain predominantly focused on model-centric aspects while overlooking critical data-centric challenges. This limitation is problematic in complex real-world settings where raw data often contains complex issues, such as missing values, label noise, and domain-specific nuances requiring tailored handling. To address this we introduce CliMB-DC, a human-guided, data-centric framework for LLM co-pilots that combines advanced data-centric tools with LLM-driven reasoning to enable robust, context-aware data processing. At its core, CliMB-DC introduces a novel, multi-agent reasoning system that combines a strategic coordinator for dynamic planning and adaptation with a specialized worker agent for precise execution. Domain expertise is then systematically incorporated to guide the reasoning process using a human-in-the-loop approach. To guide development, we formalize a taxonomy of key data-centric challenges that co-pilots must address. Thereafter, to address the dimensions of the taxonomy, we integrate state-of-the-art data-centric tools into an extensible, open-source architecture, facilitating the addition of new tools from the research community. Empirically, using real-world healthcare datasets we demonstrate CliMB-DC's ability to transform uncurated datasets into ML-ready formats, significantly outperforming existing co-pilot baselines for handling data-centric challenges. CliMB-DC promises to empower domain experts from diverse domains -- healthcare, finance, social sciences and more -- to actively participate in driving real-world impact using ML.</p>

<p>Abstract: Credit risk management within supply chains has emerged as a critical research area due to its significant implications for operational stability and financial sustainability. The intricate interdependencies among supply chain participants mean that credit risks can propagate across networks, with impacts varying by industry. This study explores the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance credit risk identification in supply chains. GANs enable the generation of synthetic credit risk scenarios, addressing challenges related to data scarcity and imbalanced datasets. By leveraging GAN-generated data, the model improves predictive accuracy while effectively capturing dynamic and temporal dependencies in supply chain data. The research focuses on three representative industries-manufacturing (steel), distribution (pharmaceuticals), and services (e-commerce) to assess industry-specific credit risk contagion. Experimental results demonstrate that the GAN-based model outperforms traditional methods, including logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks, achieving superior accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. The findings underscore the potential of GANs in proactive risk management, offering robust tools for mitigating financial disruptions in supply chains. Future research could expand the model by incorporating external market factors and supplier relationships to further enhance predictive capabilities.

The intersection of these two fields, termed diffusion models for anomaly detection (DMAD), offers promising solutions for identifying deviations in increasingly complex and high-dimensional data. In this survey, we review recent advances in DMAD research. We begin by presenting the fundamental concepts of AD and DMs, followed by a comprehensive analysis of classic DM architectures including DDPMs, DDIMs, and Score SDEs. We further categorize existing DMAD methods into reconstruction-based, density-based, and hybrid approaches, providing detailed examinations of their methodological innovations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zahraa Al Sahili, Ioannis Patras, Matthew Purver</p>
<p>Abstract: As large scale vision language models become increasingly central to modern AI applications, understanding and mitigating social biases in these systems has never been more critical. We investigate how dataset composition, model size, and multilingual training affect gender and racial bias in a popular VLM, CLIP, and its open source variants. In particular, we systematically evaluate models trained on varying dataset scales and architectures, as well as multilingual versions encompassing English along with Persian, Turkish, and Finnish,languages with minimal gender marking. To assess social perception bias, we measure the zero-shot performance on face images featuring socially charged terms rooted in the psychological constructs of communion and agency, and demographic labeling bias using both the FairFace and PATA datasets.
  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, while larger training datasets can mitigate some biases, they may also introduce or amplify others when the data composition is imbalanced. Second, although increasing model size generally improves performance, it does not consistently reduce bias and can, in certain cases, exacerbate it. Finally, while multilingual training broadens linguistic coverage, it does not inherently neutralize bias and can transfer or intensify inequities across languages. Taken together, these results highlight the necessity of inclusive, carefully curated training data to foster fairness rather than relying solely on model scaling or language expansion. We provide a systematic evaluation for vision language bias across diverse demographics, underscoring the urgent need for intentional bias mitigation strategies in next-generation AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional Incremental Learning (IL) targets to handle sequential fully-supervised learning problems where novel classes emerge from time to time. However, due to inherent annotation uncertainty and ambiguity, collecting high-quality annotated data in a dynamic learning system can be extremely expensive. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel weakly-supervised learning paradigm called Incremental Partial Label Learning (IPLL), where the sequentially arrived data relate to a set of candidate labels rather than the ground truth. Technically, we develop the Prototype-Guided Disambiguation and Replay Algorithm (PGDR) which leverages the class prototypes as a proxy to mitigate two intertwined challenges in IPLL, i.e., label ambiguity and catastrophic forgetting. To handle the former, PGDR encapsulates a momentum-based pseudo-labeling algorithm along with prototype-guided initialization, resulting in a balanced perception of classes. To alleviate forgetting, we develop a memory replay technique that collects well-disambiguated samples while maintaining representativeness and diversity. By jointly distilling knowledge from curated memory data, our framework exhibits a great disambiguation ability for samples of new tasks and achieves less forgetting of knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PGDR achieves superior</p>

<p>Abstract: Spectral clustering is a powerful technique for clustering high-dimensional data, utilizing graph-based representations to detect complex, non-linear structures and non-convex clusters. The construction of a similarity graph is essential for ensuring accurate and effective clustering, making graph structure learning (GSL) central for enhancing spectral clustering performance in response to the growing demand for scalable solutions. Despite advancements in GSL, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys specifically addressing its role within spectral clustering. To bridge this gap, this survey presents a comprehensive review of spectral clustering methods, emphasizing on the critical role of GSL. We explore various graph construction techniques, including pairwise, anchor, and hypergraph-based methods, in both fixed and adaptive settings. Additionally, we categorize spectral clustering approaches into single-view and multi-view frameworks, examining their applications within one-step and two-step clustering processes. We also discuss multi-view information fusion techniques and their impact on clustering data. By addressing current challenges and proposing future research directions, this survey provides valuable insights for advancing spectral clustering methodologies and highlights the pivotal role of GSL in tackling large-scale and high-dimensional data clustering tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shinsaku Sakaue, Han Bao, Taira Tsuchiya</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper revisits the online learning approach to inverse linear optimization studied by B\"armann et al. (2017), where the goal is to infer an unknown linear objective function of an agent from sequential observations of the agent's input-output pairs. First, we provide a simple understanding of the online learning approach through its connection to online convex optimization of \emph{Fenchel--Young losses}. As a byproduct, we present an offline guarantee on the \emph{suboptimality loss}, which measures how well predicted objectives explain the agent's choices, without assuming the optimality of the agent's choices. Second, assuming that there is a gap between optimal and suboptimal objective values in the agent's decision problems, we obtain an upper bound independent of the time horizon $T$ on the sum of suboptimality and \emph{estimate losses}, where the latter measures the quality of solutions recommended by predicted objectives. Interestingly, our gap-dependent analysis achieves a faster rate than the standard $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound by exploiting structures specific to inverse linear optimization, even though neither the loss functions nor their domains enjoy desirable properties, such as strong convexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex psychiatric disorder that affects the lives of hundreds of millions of individuals around the globe. Even today, researchers debate if morphological alterations in the brain are linked to MDD, likely due to the heterogeneity of this disorder. The application of deep learning tools to neuroimaging data, capable of capturing complex non-linear patterns, has the potential to provide diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for MDD. However, previous attempts to demarcate MDD patients and healthy controls (HC) based on segmented cortical features via linear machine learning approaches have reported low accuracies. Here, we used globally representative data from the ENIGMA-MDD working group containing 7,012 participants from 30 sites (N=2,772 MDD and N=4,240 HC), which allows a comprehensive analysis with generalizable results. Based on the hypothesis that integration of vertex-wise cortical features can improve classification performance, we evaluated the classification of a DenseNet and a Support Vector Machine (SVM), with the expectation that the former would outperform the latter. We found that both classifiers exhibited close to chance performance (balanced accuracy DenseNet: 51%; SVM: 53%), when estimated on unseen sites. Slightly higher classification performance (balanced accuracy DenseNet: 58%; SVM: 55%) was found when the cross-validation folds contained subjects from all sites, indicating site effect. In conclusion, the integration of vertex-wise morphometric features and the use of the non-linear classifier did not lead to the differentiability between MDD and HC. Our results support the notion that MDD classification on this combination of such features and classifiers is unfeasible. Perhaps more sophisticated integration of multimodal information may lead to a higher performance in this diagnostic task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenbang Xiao, Yu Wang, Shunyu Liu, Bingde Hu, Huiqiong Wang, Mingli Song, Tongya Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph condensation has emerged as an intriguing technique to save the expensive training costs of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by substituting a condensed small graph with the original graph. Despite the promising results achieved, previous methods usually employ an entangled paradigm of redundant parameters (nodes, edges, GNNs), which incurs complex joint optimization during condensation. This paradigm has considerably impeded the scalability of graph condensation, making it challenging to condense extremely large-scale graphs and generate high-fidelity condensed graphs. Therefore, we propose to disentangle the condensation process into a two-stage GNN-free paradigm, independently condensing nodes and generating edges while eliminating the need to optimize GNNs at the same time. The node condensation module avoids the complexity of GNNs by focusing on node feature alignment with anchors of the original graph, while the edge translation module constructs the edges of the condensed nodes by transferring the original structure knowledge with neighborhood anchors. This simple yet effective approach achieves at least 10 times faster than state-of-the-art methods with comparable accuracy on medium-scale graphs. Moreover, the proposed DisCo can successfully scale up to the Ogbn-papers100M graph containing over 100 million nodes with flexible reduction rates and improves performance on the second-largest Ogbn-products dataset by over 5%. Extensive downstream tasks and ablation study on five common datasets further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DisCo framework.

<p>Abstract: We employ an audit design to investigate biases in state-of-the-art large language models, including GPT-4. In our study, we prompt the models for advice involving a named individual across a variety of scenarios, such as during car purchase negotiations or election outcome predictions. We find that the advice systematically disadvantages names that are commonly associated with racial minorities and women. Names associated with Black women receive the least advantageous outcomes. The biases are consistent across 42 prompt templates and several models, indicating a systemic issue rather than isolated incidents. While providing numerical, decision-relevant anchors in the prompt can successfully counteract the biases, qualitative details have inconsistent effects and may even increase disparities. Our findings underscore the importance of conducting audits at the point of LLM deployment and implementation to mitigate their potential for harm against marginalized communities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Casadio, Tanvi Dinkar, Ekaterina Komendantskaya, Luca Arnaboldi, Matthew L. Daggitt, Omri Isac, Guy Katz, Verena Rieser, Oliver Lemon</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has exhibited substantial success in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). For example large language models have empirically proven to be capable of producing text of high complexity and cohesion. However, they are prone to inaccuracies and hallucinations. As these systems are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, ensuring their safety and reliability becomes a primary concern. There are safety critical contexts where such models must be robust to variability or attack, and give guarantees over their output. Computer Vision had pioneered the use of formal verification of neural networks for such scenarios and developed common verification standards and pipelines, leveraging precise formal reasoning about geometric properties of data manifolds. In contrast, NLP verification methods have only recently appeared in the literature. While presenting sophisticated algorithms, these papers have not yet crystallised into a common methodology. They are often light on the pragmatical issues of NLP verification and the area remains fragmented. In this paper, we attempt to distil and evaluate general components of an NLP verification pipeline, that emerges from the progress in the field to date. Our contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we propose a general methodology to analyse the effect of the embedding gap, a problem that refers to the discrepancy between verification of geometric subspaces and the semantic meaning of sentences, which the geometric subspaces are supposed to represent. We propose a number of practical NLP methods that can help to quantify the effects of the embedding gap. Secondly, we give a general method for training and verification of neural networks that leverages a more precise geometric estimation of semantic similarity of sentences in the embedding space and helps to overcome the effects of the embedding gap in practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: We prove new convergence rates for a generalized version of stochastic Nesterov acceleration under interpolation conditions. Unlike previous analyses, our approach accelerates any stochastic gradient method which makes sufficient progress in expectation. The proof, which proceeds using the estimating sequences framework, applies to both convex and strongly convex functions and is easily specialized to accelerated SGD under the strong growth condition. In this special case, our analysis reduces the dependence on the strong growth constant from $\rho$ to $\sqrt{\rho}$ as compared to prior work. This improvement is comparable to a square-root of the condition number in the worst case and address criticism that guarantees for stochastic acceleration could be worse than those for SGD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengyu Cheng, Tianhao Hu, Han Xu, Zhisong Zhang, Zheng Yuan, Yong Dai, Lei Han, Nan Du, Xiaolong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the potential of self-play training for large language models (LLMs) in a two-player adversarial language game called Adversarial Taboo. In this game, an attacker and a defender communicate around a target word only visible to the attacker. The attacker aims to induce the defender to speak the target word unconsciously, while the defender tries to infer the target word from the attacker's utterances. To win the game, both players must have sufficient knowledge about the target word and high-level reasoning ability to infer and express in this information-reserved conversation. Hence, we are curious about whether LLMs' reasoning ability can be further enhanced by Self-Playing this Adversarial language Game (SPAG). With this goal, we select several open-source LLMs and let each act as the attacker and play with a copy of itself as the defender on an extensive range of target words. Through reinforcement learning on the game outcomes, we observe that the LLMs' performances uniformly improve on a broad range of reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, iteratively adopting this self-play process can continuously promote LLMs' reasoning abilities. The code is available at https://github.com/Linear95/SPAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Shmakov, Kevin Greif, Michael James Fenton, Aishik Ghosh, Pierre Baldi, Daniel Whiteson</p>
<p>Abstract: The measurements performed by particle physics experiments must account for the imperfect response of the detectors used to observe the interactions. One approach, unfolding, statistically adjusts the experimental data for detector effects. Recently, generative machine learning models have shown promise for performing unbinned unfolding in a high number of dimensions. However, all current generative approaches are limited to unfolding a fixed set of observables, making them unable to perform full-event unfolding in the variable dimensional environment of collider data. A novel modification to the variational latent diffusion model (VLD) approach to generative unfolding is presented, which allows for unfolding of high- and variable-dimensional feature spaces. The performance of this method is evaluated in the context of semi-leptonic top quark pair production at the Large Hadron Collider.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoming Li, Jian Yang, Shangsong Liang, Dongsheng Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Spectral graph neural networks are proposed to harness spectral information inherent in graph-structured data through the application of polynomial-defined graph filters, recently achieving notable success in graph-based web applications. Existing studies reveal that various polynomial choices greatly impact spectral GNN performance, underscoring the importance of polynomial selection. However, this selection process remains a critical and unresolved challenge. Although prior work suggests a connection between the approximation capabilities of polynomials and the efficacy of spectral GNNs, there is a lack of theoretical insights into this relationship, rendering polynomial selection a largely heuristic process.
  To address the issue, this paper examines polynomial selection from an error-sum of function slices perspective. Inspired by the conventional signal decomposition, we represent graph filters as a sum of disjoint function slices. Building on this, we then bridge the polynomial capability and spectral GNN efficacy by proving that the construction error of graph convolution layer is bounded by the sum of polynomial approximation errors on function slices. This result leads us to develop an advanced filter based on trigonometric polynomials, a widely adopted option for approximating narrow signal slices. The proposed filter remains provable parameter efficiency, with a novel Taylor-based parameter decomposition that achieves streamlined, effective implementation. With this foundation, we propose TFGNN, a scalable spectral GNN operating in a decoupled paradigm. We validate the efficacy of TFGNN via benchmark node classification tasks, along with an example graph anomaly detection application to show its practical utility.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14318">Adaptive Retention &amp; Correction: Test-Time Training for Continual Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Chen, Micah Goldblum, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning, also known as lifelong learning or incremental learning, refers to the process by which a model learns from a stream of incoming data over time. A common problem in continual learning is the classification layer's bias towards the most recent task. Traditionally, methods have relied on incorporating data from past tasks during training to mitigate this issue. However, the recent shift in continual learning to memory-free environments has rendered these approaches infeasible. In this study, we propose a solution focused on the testing phase. We first introduce a simple Out-of-Task Detection method, OTD, designed to accurately identify samples from past tasks during testing. Leveraging OTD, we then propose: (1) an Adaptive Retention mechanism for dynamically tuning the classifier layer on past task data; (2) an Adaptive Correction mechanism for revising predictions when the model classifies data from previous tasks into classes from the current task. We name our approach Adaptive Retention & Correction (ARC). While designed for memory-free environments, ARC also proves effective in memory-based settings. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method can be plugged in to virtually any existing continual learning approach without requiring any modifications to its training procedure. Specifically, when integrated with state-of-the-art approaches, ARC achieves an average performance increase of 2.7% and 2.6% on the CIFAR-100 and Imagenet-R datasets, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Garima Chhikara, Anurag Sharma, V. Gurucharan, Kripabandhu Ghosh, Abhijnan Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Citizen reporting platforms like Safe City in India help the public and authorities stay informed about sexual harassment incidents. However, the high volume of data shared on these platforms makes reviewing each individual case challenging. Therefore, a summarization algorithm capable of processing and understanding various Indian code-mixed languages is essential. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance in NLP tasks, including summarization. LLMs inherently produce abstractive summaries by paraphrasing the original text, while the generation of extractive summaries - selecting specific subsets from the original text - through LLMs remains largely unexplored. Moreover, LLMs have a limited context window size, restricting the amount of data that can be processed at once. We tackle these challenge by introducing LaMSUM, a novel multi-level framework designed to generate extractive summaries for large collections of Safe City posts using LLMs. LaMSUM integrates summarization with different voting methods to achieve robust summaries. Extensive evaluation using three popular LLMs (Llama, Mistral and GPT-4o) demonstrates that LaMSUM outperforms state-of-the-art extractive summarization methods for Safe City posts. Overall, this work represents one of the first attempts to achieve extractive summarization through LLMs, and is likely to support stakeholders by offering a comprehensive overview and enabling them to develop effective policies to minimize incidents of unwarranted harassment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Missael Barco, Alexandre Adam, Connor Stone, Yashar Hezaveh, Laurence Perreault-Levasseur</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian inference for inverse problems hinges critically on the choice of priors. In the absence of specific prior information, population-level distributions can serve as effective priors for parameters of interest. With the advent of machine learning, the use of data-driven population-level distributions (encoded, e.g., in a trained deep neural network) as priors is emerging as an appealing alternative to simple parametric priors in a variety of inverse problems. However, in many astrophysical applications, it is often difficult or even impossible to acquire independent and identically distributed samples from the underlying data-generating process of interest to train these models. In these cases, corrupted data or a surrogate, e.g. a simulator, is often used to produce training samples, meaning that there is a risk of obtaining misspecified priors. This, in turn, can bias the inferred posteriors in ways that are difficult to quantify, which limits the potential applicability of these models in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose addressing this issue by iteratively updating the population-level distributions by retraining the model with posterior samples from different sets of observations, and we showcase the potential of this method on the problem of background image reconstruction in strong gravitational lensing when score-based models are used as data-driven priors. We show that, starting from a misspecified prior distribution, the updated distribution becomes progressively closer to the underlying population-level distribution, and the resulting posterior samples exhibit reduced bias after several updates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasaman Etesam, Hyunmin Cheong, Mohammadmehdi Ataei, Pradeep Kumar Jayaraman</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI has made remarkable progress in addressing various design challenges. One prominent area where generative AI could bring significant value is in engineering design. In particular, selecting an optimal set of components and their interfaces to create a mechanical system that meets design requirements is one of the most challenging and time-consuming tasks for engineers. This configuration design task is inherently challenging due to its categorical nature, multiple design requirements a solution must satisfy, and the reliance on physics simulations for evaluating potential solutions. These characteristics entail solving a combinatorial optimization problem with multiple constraints involving black-box functions. To address this challenge, we propose a deep generative model to predict the optimal combination of components and interfaces for a given design problem. To demonstrate our approach, we solve a gear train synthesis problem by first creating a synthetic dataset using a grammar, a parts catalogue, and a physics simulator. We then train a Transformer using this dataset, named GearFormer, which can not only generate quality solutions on its own, but also augment search methods such as an evolutionary algorithm and Monte Carlo tree search. We show that GearFormer outperforms such search methods on their own in terms of satisfying the specified design requirements with orders of magnitude faster generation time. Additionally, we showcase the benefit of hybrid methods that leverage both GearFormer and search methods, which further improve the quality of the solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Vision Token Turing Machines (ViTTM), an efficient, low-latency, memory-augmented Vision Transformer (ViT). Our approach builds on Neural Turing Machines and Token Turing Machines, which were applied to NLP and sequential visual understanding tasks. ViTTMs are designed for non-sequential computer vision tasks such as image classification and segmentation. Our model creates two sets of tokens: process tokens and memory tokens; process tokens pass through encoder blocks and read-write from memory tokens at each encoder block in the network, allowing them to store and retrieve information from memory. By ensuring that there are fewer process tokens than memory tokens, we are able to reduce the inference time of the network while maintaining its accuracy. On ImageNet-1K, the state-of-the-art ViT-B has median latency of 529.5ms and 81.0% accuracy, while our ViTTM-B is 56% faster (234.1ms), with 2.4 times fewer FLOPs, with an accuracy of 82.9%. On ADE20K semantic segmentation, ViT-B achieves 45.65mIoU at 13.8 frame-per-second (FPS) whereas our ViTTM-B model acheives a 45.17 mIoU with 26.8 FPS (+94%).</p>

<p>Abstract: Resource-constrained IoT devices increasingly rely on deep learning models for inference tasks in remote environments. However, these models experience significant accuracy drops due to domain shifts when encountering variations in lighting, weather, and seasonal conditions. While cloud-based retraining can address this issue, many IoT deployments operate with limited connectivity and energy constraints, making traditional fine-tuning approaches impractical. We explore this challenge through the lens of wildlife ecology, where camera traps must maintain accurate species classification across changing seasons, weather, and habitats without reliable connectivity. We introduce WildFit, an autonomous in-situ adaptation framework that leverages the key insight that background scenes change more frequently than the visual characteristics of monitored species. WildFit combines background-aware synthesis to generate training samples on-device with drift-aware fine-tuning that triggers model updates only when necessary to conserve resources. Through extensive evaluation on multiple camera trap deployments, we demonstrate that WildFit significantly improves accuracy while greatly reducing adaptation overhead compared to traditional approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vinitra Swamy, Davide Romano, Bhargav Srinivasa Desikan, Oana-Maria Camburu, Tanja K\"aser</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in eXplainable AI (XAI) for education have highlighted a critical challenge: ensuring that explanations for state-of-the-art AI models are understandable for non-technical users such as educators and students. In response, we introduce iLLuMinaTE, a zero-shot, chain-of-prompts LLM-XAI pipeline inspired by Miller's cognitive model of explanation. iLLuMinaTE is designed to deliver theory-driven, actionable feedback to students in online courses. iLLuMinaTE navigates three main stages - causal connection, explanation selection, and explanation presentation - with variations drawing from eight social science theories (e.g. Abnormal Conditions, Pearl's Model of Explanation, Necessity and Robustness Selection, Contrastive Explanation). We extensively evaluate 21,915 natural language explanations of iLLuMinaTE extracted from three LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemma2-9B, Llama3-70B), with three different underlying XAI methods (LIME, Counterfactuals, MC-LIME), across students from three diverse online courses. Our evaluation involves analyses of explanation alignment to the social science theory, understandability of the explanation, and a real-world user preference study with 114 university students containing a novel actionability simulation. We find that students prefer iLLuMinaTE explanations over traditional explainers 89.52% of the time. Our work provides a robust, ready-to-use framework for effectively communicating hybrid XAI-driven insights in education, with significant generalization potential for other human-centric fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmood Hegazy</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language generation but often confidently produce incorrect responses, especially in tasks like mathematical reasoning. Chain-of-thought prompting, self-verification, and multi-agent debate are among the strategies proposed to improve the reasoning and factual accuracy of LLMs. Building on Du et al.'s multi-agent debate framework, we find that multi-agent debate helps at any model scale, and that diversity of thought elicits stronger reasoning in debating LLMs. Across various model sizes, performance on mathematical reasoning tasks benefits most when diverse trained models are used. Remarkably, after 4 rounds of debate, a diverse set of medium-capacity models (Gemini-Pro, Mixtral 7BX8, and PaLM 2-M) outperforms GPT-4 on the GSM-8K benchmark, scoring 91% accuracy. By comparison, when 3 instances of Gemini-Pro are used, performance only reaches 82%. Finally, this diverse set of medium-capacity models sets a new state-of-the-art performance on the ASDiv benchmark (94%). These results underscore the idea that the future of AI is agentic, with diverse cooperating agents yielding emergent capabilities beyond even the most powerful individual models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dominik Eckert, Ludwig Ritschl, Christopher Syben, Christian H\"ummer, Julia Wicklein, Marcel Beister, Steffen Kappler, Sebastian Stober</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiologists have preferred visual impressions or 'styles' of X-ray images that are manually adjusted to their needs to support their diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose an automatic and interpretable X-ray style transfer by introducing a trainable version of the Local Laplacian Filter (LLF). From the shape of the LLF's optimized remap function, the characteristics of the style transfer can be inferred and reliability of the algorithm can be ensured. Moreover, we enable the LLF to capture complex X-ray style features by replacing the remap function with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and adding a trainable normalization layer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by transforming unprocessed mammographic X-ray images into images that match the style of target mammograms and achieve a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.94 compared to 0.82 of the baseline LLF style transfer method from Aubry et al.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moran Yanuka, Assaf Ben Kish, Yonatan Bitton, Idan Szpektor, Raja Giryes</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research increasingly focuses on training vision-language models (VLMs) with long, detailed image captions. However, small-scale VLMs often struggle to balance the richness of these captions with the risk of hallucinating content during fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore how well VLMs adapt to such captions. To quantify caption quality, we propose Decomposed NLI (DNLI), an evaluation framework that breaks down generated captions into individual propositions, assessing each in isolation. This fine-grained analysis reveals a critical balance between capturing descriptive details and preventing hallucinations. Our findings show that simply reducing caption complexity or employing standard data curation techniques does not effectively resolve this issue. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Knowledge Adapted (KnowAda) fine-tuning, a data-centric approach that automatically adapts training data with the model's existing knowledge and visual understanding. KnowAda minimizes hallucinations while preserving high descriptiveness. We validate this approach across several small-scale VLMs (up to 7B parameters) and dense caption datasets, demonstrating that KnowAda effectively balances hallucination reduction and descriptiveness. Our results show that KnowAda outperforms various baselines in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We will release our code and models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aman Tiwari, Shiva Krishna Reddy Malay, Vikas Yadav, Masoud Hashemi, Sathwik Tejaswi Madhusudhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph databases like Neo4j are gaining popularity for handling complex, interconnected data, over traditional relational databases in modeling and querying relationships. While translating natural language into SQL queries is well-researched, generating Cypher queries for Neo4j remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we present an automated, LLM-Supervised, pipeline to generate high-quality synthetic data for Text2Cypher. Our Cypher data generation pipeline introduces LLM-As-Database-Filler, a novel strategy for ensuring Cypher query correctness, thus resulting in high quality generations. Using our pipeline, we generate high quality Text2Cypher data - SynthCypher containing 29.8k instances across various domains and queries with varying complexities. Training open-source LLMs like LLaMa-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and QWEN-7B on SynthCypher results in performance gains of up to 40% on the Text2Cypher test split and 30% on the SPIDER benchmark, adapted for graph databases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hisayoshi Nanmo, Manabu Kuroki</p>
<p>Abstract: For a data-generating process for random variables that can be described with a linear structural equation model, we consider a situation in which (i) a set of covariates satisfying the back-door criterion cannot be observed or (ii) such a set can be observed, but standard statistical estimation methods cannot be applied to estimate causal effects because of multicollinearity/high-dimensional data problems. We propose a novel two-stage penalized regression approach, the penalized covariate-mediator selection operator (PCM Selector), to estimate the causal effects in such scenarios. Unlike existing penalized regression analyses, when a set of intermediate variables is available, PCM Selector provides a consistent or less biased estimator of the causal effect. In addition, PCM Selector provides a variable selection procedure for intermediate variables to obtain better estimation accuracy of the causal effects than does the back-door criterion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Our society increasingly benefits from Artificial Intelligence (AI). Unfortunately, more and more evidence shows that AI is also used for offensive purposes. Prior works have revealed various examples of use cases in which the deployment of AI can lead to violation of security and privacy objectives. No extant work, however, has been able to draw a holistic picture of the offensive potential of AI. In this SoK paper we seek to lay the ground for a systematic analysis of the heterogeneous capabilities of offensive AI. In particular we (i) account for AI risks to both humans and systems while (ii) consolidating and distilling knowledge from academic literature, expert opinions, industrial venues, as well as laypeople -- all of which being valuable sources of information on offensive AI.
  To enable alignment of such diverse sources of knowledge, we devise a common set of criteria reflecting essential technological factors related to offensive AI. With the help of such criteria, we systematically analyze: 95 research papers; 38 InfoSec briefings (from, e.g., BlackHat); the responses of a user study (N=549) entailing individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise; and the opinion of 12 experts. Our contributions not only reveal concerning ways (some of which overlooked by prior work) in which AI can be offensively used today, but also represent a foothold to address this threat in the years to come.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19289">ViPCap: Retrieval Text-Based Visual Prompts for Lightweight Image Captioning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Taewhan Kim, Soeun Lee, Si-Woo Kim, Dong-Jin Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent lightweight image captioning models using retrieved data mainly focus on text prompts. However, previous works only utilize the retrieved text as text prompts, and the visual information relies only on the CLIP visual embedding. Because of this issue, there is a limitation that the image descriptions inherent in the prompt are not sufficiently reflected in the visual embedding space. To tackle this issue, we propose ViPCap, a novel retrieval text-based visual prompt for lightweight image captioning. ViPCap leverages the retrieved text with image information as visual prompts to enhance the ability of the model to capture relevant visual information. By mapping text prompts into the CLIP space and generating multiple randomized Gaussian distributions, our method leverages sampling to explore randomly augmented distributions and effectively retrieves the semantic features that contain image information. These retrieved features are integrated into the image and designated as the visual prompt, leading to performance improvements on the datasets such as COCO, Flickr30k, and NoCaps. Experimental results demonstrate that ViPCap significantly outperforms prior lightweight captioning models in efficiency and effectiveness, demonstrating the potential for a plug-and-play solution.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dian Jin, Yuqian Zhang, Qiaosheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of network information and node attribute information has recently gained significant attention in the community detection literature. In this work, we consider community detection in the Contextual Labeled Stochastic Block Model (CLSBM), where the network follows an LSBM and node attributes follow a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Our primary focus is the misclassification rate, which measures the expected number of nodes misclassified by community detection algorithms. We first establish a lower bound on the optimal misclassification rate that holds for any algorithm. When we specialize our setting to the LSBM (which preserves only network information) or the GMM (which preserves only node attribute information), our lower bound recovers prior results. Moreover, we present an efficient spectral-based algorithm tailored for the CLSBM and derive an upper bound on its misclassification rate. Although the algorithm does not attain the lower bound, it serves as a reliable starting point for designing more accurate community detection algorithms (as many algorithms use spectral method as an initial step, followed by refinement procedures to enhance accuracy).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zhu, Wenqi Jiang, Gustavo Alonso</p>
<p>Abstract: Keeping ML-based recommender models up-to-date as data drifts and evolves is essential to maintain accuracy. As a result, online data preprocessing plays an increasingly important role in serving recommender systems. Existing solutions employ multiple CPU workers to saturate the input bandwidth of a single training node. Such an approach results in high deployment costs and energy consumption. For instance, a recent report from industrial deployments shows that data storage and ingestion pipelines can account for over 60\% of the power consumption in a recommender system. In this paper, we tackle the issue from a hardware perspective by introducing Piper, a flexible and network-attached accelerator that executes data loading and preprocessing pipelines in a streaming fashion. As part of the design, we define MiniPipe, the smallest pipeline unit enabling multi-pipeline implementation by executing various data preprocessing tasks across the single board, giving Piper the ability to be reconfigured at runtime. Our results, using publicly released commercial pipelines, show that Piper, prototyped on a power-efficient FPGA, achieves a 39$\sim$105$\times$ speedup over a server-grade, 128-core CPU and 3$\sim$17$\times$ speedup over GPUs like RTX 3090 and A100 in multiple pipelines. The experimental analysis demonstrates that Piper provides advantages in both latency and energy efficiency for preprocessing tasks in recommender systems, providing an alternative design point for systems that today are in very high demand.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianchuan Liu, Tao Chen, Sheng Mao, Mohan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Tungsten-copper (W-Cu) compounds are widely utilized in various industrial fields due to their exceptional mechanical properties. In this study, we have developed a neural-network-based deep potential (DP) model that covers a wide range of temperatures, ranging from 0 to 3,000 K, and pressures, varying from 0 to 10 GPa. This study presents a model trained using density functional theory data for full concentration CuxW100-x compounds. Through this model, we systematically investigate the structural and mechanical properties of W-Cu alloys and have the following findings. First, the bulk modulus (B) and Young's modulus (E) of W-Cu alloys exhibit a linear decline as the Cu content increases, indicating a softening trend in the CuxW100-x compounds as the Cu concentration rises. Second, a higher Cu content results in higher critical strain and lower critical stress for these compounds. A brittle-to-ductile transition in the deformation mode predicted is predicted at around 37.5 at. % Cu content. Third, tensile loading tests in the W-Cu gradient structure reveal that Cu-poor region serves as a barrier, hindering shear band propagation while promoting new shear band formation in the Cu-rich region. The above results from the DP model are anticipated to aid in exploring the physical mechanisms underlying the complex phenomena of W-Cu systems and contribute to the advancement of methodologies for materials simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangjie Zheng, Junwei Yang, Siyue Liang, Bin Feng, Zequn Liu, Wei Ju, Zhiping Xiao, Ming Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked Language Models (MLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many self-supervised representation learning tasks. MLMs are trained by randomly replacing some tokens in the input sentences with [MASK] tokens and predicting the original tokens based on the remaining context. This paper explores the impact of [MASK] tokens on MLMs. Analytical studies show that masking tokens can introduce the corrupted semantics problem, wherein the corrupted context may convey multiple, ambiguous meanings. This problem is also a key factor affecting the performance of MLMs on downstream tasks. Based on these findings, we propose a novel enhanced-context MLM, ExLM. Our approach expands [MASK] tokens in the input context and models the dependencies between these expanded states. This expansion increases context capacity and enables the model to capture richer semantic information, effectively mitigating the corrupted semantics problem during pre-training. Experimental results demonstrate that ExLM achieves significant performance improvements in both text modeling and SMILES modeling tasks. Further analysis confirms that ExLM enhances semantic representations through context enhancement, and effectively reduces the multimodality problem commonly observed in MLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Liu, Kai Wang, Senmao Li, Joost van de Weijer, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Shiqi Yang, Yaxing Wang, Jian Yang, Ming-Ming Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generation models can create high-quality images from input prompts. However, they struggle to support the consistent generation of identity-preserving requirements for storytelling. Existing approaches to this problem typically require extensive training in large datasets or additional modifications to the original model architectures. This limits their applicability across different domains and diverse diffusion model configurations. In this paper, we first observe the inherent capability of language models, coined context consistency, to comprehend identity through context with a single prompt. Drawing inspiration from the inherent context consistency, we propose a novel training-free method for consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation, termed "One-Prompt-One-Story" (1Prompt1Story). Our approach 1Prompt1Story concatenates all prompts into a single input for T2I diffusion models, initially preserving character identities. We then refine the generation process using two novel techniques: Singular-Value Reweighting and Identity-Preserving Cross-Attention, ensuring better alignment with the input description for each frame. In our experiments, we compare our method against various existing consistent T2I generation approaches to demonstrate its effectiveness through quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments.
