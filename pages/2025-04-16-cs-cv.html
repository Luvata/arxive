<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Liang, Ming Li, Chenrui Fan, Ziyue Li, Dang Nguyen, Kwesi Cobbina, Shweta Bhardwaj, Jiuhai Chen, Fuxiao Liu, Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Color plays an important role in human perception and usually provides critical clues in visual reasoning. However, it is unclear whether and how vision-language models (VLMs) can perceive, understand, and leverage color as humans. This paper introduces ColorBench, an innovative benchmark meticulously crafted to assess the capabilities of VLMs in color understanding, including color perception, reasoning, and robustness. By curating a suite of diverse test scenarios, with grounding in real applications, ColorBench evaluates how these models perceive colors, infer meanings from color-based cues, and maintain consistent performance under varying color transformations. Through an extensive evaluation of 32 VLMs with varying language models and vision encoders, our paper reveals some undiscovered findings: (i) The scaling law (larger models are better) still holds on ColorBench, while the language model plays a more important role than the vision encoder. (ii) However, the performance gaps across models are relatively small, indicating that color understanding has been largely neglected by existing VLMs. (iii) CoT reasoning improves color understanding accuracies and robustness, though they are vision-centric tasks. (iv) Color clues are indeed leveraged by VLMs on ColorBench but they can also mislead models in some tasks. These findings highlight the critical limitations of current VLMs and underscore the need to enhance color comprehension. Our ColorBenchcan serve as a foundational tool for advancing the study of human-level color understanding of multimodal AI.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10558">Enhancing Image Restoration through Learning Context-Rich and Detail-Accurate Features</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hu Gao, Depeng Dang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image restoration involves recovering high-quality images from their corrupted versions, requiring a nuanced balance between spatial details and contextual information. While certain methods address this balance, they predominantly emphasize spatial aspects, neglecting frequency variation comprehension. In this paper, we present a multi-scale design that optimally balances these competing objectives, seamlessly integrating spatial and frequency domain knowledge to selectively recover the most informative information. Specifically, we develop a hybrid scale frequency selection block (HSFSBlock), which not only captures multi-scale information from the spatial domain, but also selects the most informative components for image restoration in the frequency domain. Furthermore, to mitigate the inherent noise introduced by skip connections employing only addition or concatenation, we introduce a skip connection attention mechanism (SCAM) to selectively determines the information that should propagate through skip connections. The resulting tightly interlinked architecture, named as LCDNet. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse image restoration tasks showcase that our model attains performance levels that are either superior or comparable to those of state-of-the-art algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qikai Yang, Cheng Ji, Huaiying Luo, Panfeng Li, Zhicheng Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique that combines the advantages of style augmentation and random erasing by selectively replacing image subregions with style-transferred patches. Our approach first applies a random style transfer to training images, then randomly substitutes selected areas of these images with patches derived from the style-transferred versions. This method is able to seamlessly accommodate a wide range of existing style transfer algorithms and can be readily integrated into diverse data augmentation pipelines. By incorporating our strategy, the training process becomes more robust and less prone to overfitting. Comparative experiments demonstrate that, relative to previous style augmentation methods, our technique achieves superior performance and faster convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yushu Wu, Yanyu Li, Ivan Skorokhodov, Anil Kag, Willi Menapace, Sharath Girish, Aliaksandr Siarohin, Yanzhi Wang, Sergey Tulyakov</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoencoder (AE) is the key to the success of latent diffusion models for image and video generation, reducing the denoising resolution and improving efficiency. However, the power of AE has long been underexplored in terms of network design, compression ratio, and training strategy. In this work, we systematically examine the architecture design choices and optimize the computation distribution to obtain a series of efficient and high-compression video AEs that can decode in real time on mobile devices. We also unify the design of plain Autoencoder and image-conditioned I2V VAE, achieving multifunctionality in a single network. In addition, we find that the widely adopted discriminative losses, i.e., GAN, LPIPS, and DWT losses, provide no significant improvements when training AEs at scale. We propose a novel latent consistency loss that does not require complicated discriminator design or hyperparameter tuning, but provides stable improvements in reconstruction quality. Our AE achieves an ultra-high compression ratio and real-time decoding speed on mobile while outperforming prior art in terms of reconstruction metrics by a large margin. We finally validate our AE by training a DiT on its latent space and demonstrate fast, high-quality text-to-video generation capability.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10568">AgMMU: A Comprehensive Agricultural Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aruna Gauba, Irene Pi, Yunze Man, Ziqi Pang, Vikram S. Adve, Yu-Xiong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We curate a dataset AgMMU for evaluating and developing vision-language models (VLMs) to produce factually accurate answers for knowledge-intensive expert domains. Our AgMMU concentrates on one of the most socially beneficial domains, agriculture, which requires connecting detailed visual observation with precise knowledge to diagnose, e.g., pest identification, management instructions, etc. As a core uniqueness of our dataset, all facts, questions, and answers are extracted from 116,231 conversations between real-world users and authorized agricultural experts. After a three-step dataset curation pipeline with GPT-4o, LLaMA models, and human verification, AgMMU features an evaluation set of 5,460 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and open-ended questions (OEQs). We also provide a development set that contains 205,399 pieces of agricultural knowledge information, including disease identification, symptoms descriptions, management instructions, insect and pest identification, and species identification. As a multimodal factual dataset, it reveals that existing VLMs face significant challenges with questions requiring both detailed perception and factual knowledge. Moreover, open-source VLMs still demonstrate a substantial performance gap compared to proprietary ones. To advance knowledge-intensive VLMs, we conduct fine-tuning experiments using our development set, which improves LLaVA-1.5 evaluation accuracy by up to 3.1%. We hope that AgMMU can serve both as an evaluation benchmark dedicated to agriculture and a development suite for incorporating knowledge-intensive expertise into general-purpose VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunzhuo Wang, Zhewen Xue, T. Sunil Kumar, Guido Camps, Hans Hallez, Bart Vanrumste</p>
<p>Abstract: Overweight and obesity have emerged as widespread societal challenges, frequently linked to unhealthy eating patterns. A promising approach to enhance dietary monitoring in everyday life involves automated detection of food intake gestures. This study introduces a skeleton based approach using a model that combines a dilated spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) with a bidirectional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM) framework, as called ST-GCN-BiLSTM, to detect intake gestures. The skeleton-based method provides key benefits, including environmental robustness, reduced data dependency, and enhanced privacy preservation. Two datasets were employed for model validation. The OREBA dataset, which consists of laboratory-recorded videos, achieved segmental F1-scores of 86.18% and 74.84% for identifying eating and drinking gestures. Additionally, a self-collected dataset using smartphone recordings in more adaptable experimental conditions was evaluated with the model trained on OREBA, yielding F1-scores of 85.40% and 67.80% for detecting eating and drinking gestures. The results not only confirm the feasibility of utilizing skeleton data for intake gesture detection but also highlight the robustness of the proposed approach in cross-dataset validation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tan-Hanh Pham, Chris Ngo, Trong-Duong Bui, Minh Luu Quang, Tan-Huong Pham, Truong-Son Hy</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical Visual Language Models have shown great potential in various healthcare applications, including medical image captioning and diagnostic assistance. However, most existing models rely on text-based instructions, limiting their usability in real-world clinical environments especially in scenarios such as surgery, text-based interaction is often impractical for physicians. In addition, current medical image analysis models typically lack comprehensive reasoning behind their predictions, which reduces their reliability for clinical decision-making. Given that medical diagnosis errors can have life-changing consequences, there is a critical need for interpretable and rational medical assistance. To address these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end speech-driven medical VLM, SilVar-Med, a multimodal medical image assistant that integrates speech interaction with VLMs, pioneering the task of voice-based communication for medical image analysis. In addition, we focus on the interpretation of the reasoning behind each prediction of medical abnormalities with a proposed reasoning dataset. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept study for reasoning-driven medical image interpretation with end-to-end speech interaction. We believe this work will advance the field of medical AI by fostering more transparent, interactive, and clinically viable diagnostic support systems. Our code and dataset are publicly available at SiVar-Med.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10659">Relation-Rich Visual Document Generator for Visual Information Extraction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zi-Han Jiang, Chien-Wei Lin, Wei-Hua Li, Hsuan-Tung Liu, Yi-Ren Yeh, Chu-Song Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for visual document understanding (VDU), visual information extraction (VIE) from relation-rich documents remains challenging due to the layout diversity and limited training data. While existing synthetic document generators attempt to address data scarcity, they either rely on manually designed layouts and templates, or adopt rule-based approaches that limit layout diversity. Besides, current layout generation methods focus solely on topological patterns without considering textual content, making them impractical for generating documents with complex associations between the contents and layouts. In this paper, we propose a Relation-rIch visual Document GEnerator (RIDGE) that addresses these limitations through a two-stage approach: (1) Content Generation, which leverages LLMs to generate document content using a carefully designed Hierarchical Structure Text format which captures entity categories and relationships, and (2) Content-driven Layout Generation, which learns to create diverse, plausible document layouts solely from easily available Optical Character Recognition (OCR) results, requiring no human labeling or annotations efforts. Experimental results have demonstrated that our method significantly enhances the performance of document understanding models on various VIE benchmarks. The code and model will be available at https://github.com/AI-Application-and-Integration-Lab/RIDGE .</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10669">Perturbed State Space Feature Encoders for Optical Flow with Event Cameras</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Gokul Raju Govinda Raju, Nikola Zubi\'c, Marco Cannici, Davide Scaramuzza</p>
<p>Abstract: With their motion-responsive nature, event-based cameras offer significant advantages over traditional cameras for optical flow estimation. While deep learning has improved upon traditional methods, current neural networks adopted for event-based optical flow still face temporal and spatial reasoning limitations. We propose Perturbed State Space Feature Encoders (P-SSE) for multi-frame optical flow with event cameras to address these challenges. P-SSE adaptively processes spatiotemporal features with a large receptive field akin to Transformer-based methods, while maintaining the linear computational complexity characteristic of SSMs. However, the key innovation that enables the state-of-the-art performance of our model lies in our perturbation technique applied to the state dynamics matrix governing the SSM system. This approach significantly improves the stability and performance of our model. We integrate P-SSE into a framework that leverages bi-directional flows and recurrent connections, expanding the temporal context of flow prediction. Evaluations on DSEC-Flow and MVSEC datasets showcase P-SSE's superiority, with 8.48% and 11.86% improvements in EPE performance, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanbo Huang, Xiaoming Liu, Yu Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose H-MoRe, a novel pipeline for learning precise human-centric motion representation. Our approach dynamically preserves relevant human motion while filtering out background movement. Notably, unlike previous methods relying on fully supervised learning from synthetic data, H-MoRe learns directly from real-world scenarios in a self-supervised manner, incorporating both human pose and body shape information. Inspired by kinematics, H-MoRe represents absolute and relative movements of each body point in a matrix format that captures nuanced motion details, termed world-local flows. H-MoRe offers refined insights into human motion, which can be integrated seamlessly into various action-related applications. Experimental results demonstrate that H-MoRe brings substantial improvements across various downstream tasks, including gait recognition(CL@R1: +16.01%), action recognition(Acc@1: +8.92%), and video generation(FVD: -67.07%). Additionally, H-MoRe exhibits high inference efficiency (34 fps), making it suitable for most real-time scenarios. Models and code will be released upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stathis Galanakis, Alexandros Lattas, Stylianos Moschoglou, Bernhard Kainz, Stefanos Zafeiriou</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent progress in diffusion models, generating realistic head portraits from novel viewpoints remains a significant challenge. Most current approaches are constrained to limited angular ranges, predominantly focusing on frontal or near-frontal views. Moreover, although the recent emerging large-scale diffusion models have been proven robust in handling 3D scenes, they underperform on facial data, given their complex structure and the uncanny valley pitfalls. In this paper, we propose SpinMeRound, a diffusion-based approach designed to generate consistent and accurate head portraits from novel viewpoints. By leveraging a number of input views alongside an identity embedding, our method effectively synthesizes diverse viewpoints of a subject whilst robustly maintaining its unique identity features. Through experimentation, we showcase our model's generation capabilities in 360 head synthesis, while beating current state-of-the-art multiview diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Darryl Hannan, John Cooper, Dylan White, Timothy Doster, Henry Kvinge, Yijing Watkins</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have altered the landscape of computer vision, obtaining impressive results across a wide range of tasks, especially in zero-shot settings. Unfortunately, their strong performance does not always transfer to out-of-distribution domains, such as earth observation (EO) imagery. Prior work has demonstrated that MLLMs excel at some EO tasks, such as image captioning and scene understanding, while failing at tasks that require more fine-grained spatial reasoning, such as object localization. However, MLLMs are advancing rapidly and insights quickly become out-dated. In this work, we analyze more recent MLLMs that have been explicitly trained to include fine-grained spatial reasoning capabilities, benchmarking them on EO object localization tasks. We demonstrate that these models are performant in certain settings, making them well suited for zero-shot scenarios. Additionally, we provide a detailed discussion focused on prompt selection, ground sample distance (GSD) optimization, and analyzing failure cases. We hope that this work will prove valuable as others evaluate whether an MLLM is well suited for a given EO localization task and how to optimize it.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) and integrated vehicle-road-cloud systems has increased the demand for accurate, real-time HD map updates. However, ensuring map reliability remains challenging due to inconsistencies in crowdsourced data, which suffer from motion blur, lighting variations, adverse weather, and lane marking degradation. This paper introduces CleanMAP, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based distillation framework designed to filter and refine crowdsourced data for high-confidence HD map updates. CleanMAP leverages an MLLM-driven lane visibility scoring model that systematically quantifies key visual parameters, assigning confidence scores (0-10) based on their impact on lane detection. A novel dynamic piecewise confidence-scoring function adapts scores based on lane visibility, ensuring strong alignment with human evaluations while effectively filtering unreliable data. To further optimize map accuracy, a confidence-driven local map fusion strategy ranks and selects the top-k highest-scoring local maps within an optimal confidence range (best score minus 10%), striking a balance between data quality and quantity. Experimental evaluations on a real-world autonomous vehicle dataset validate CleanMAP's effectiveness, demonstrating that fusing the top three local maps achieves the lowest mean map update error of 0.28m, outperforming the baseline (0.37m) and meeting stringent accuracy thresholds (<= 0.32m). Further validation with real-vehicle data confirms 84.88% alignment with human evaluators, reinforcing the model's robustness and reliability. This work establishes CleanMAP as a scalable and deployable solution for crowdsourced HD map updates, ensuring more precise and reliable autonomous navigation.

<p>Abstract: In mixed reality applications, a realistic acoustic experience in spatial environments is as crucial as the visual experience for achieving true immersion. Despite recent advances in neural approaches for Room Impulse Response (RIR) estimation, most existing methods are limited to the single environment on which they are trained, lacking the ability to generalize to new rooms with different geometries and surface materials. We aim to develop a unified model capable of reconstructing the spatial acoustic experience of any environment with minimum additional measurements. To this end, we present xRIR, a framework for cross-room RIR prediction. The core of our generalizable approach lies in combining a geometric feature extractor, which captures spatial context from panorama depth images, with a RIR encoder that extracts detailed acoustic features from only a few reference RIR samples. To evaluate our method, we introduce ACOUSTICROOMS, a new dataset featuring high-fidelity simulation of over 300,000 RIRs from 260 rooms. Experiments show that our method strongly outperforms a series of baselines. Furthermore, we successfully perform sim-to-real transfer by evaluating our model on four real-world environments, demonstrating the generalizability of our approach and the realism of our dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michele Grimaldi, Nouf Alkaabi, Francesco Ruscio, Sebastian Realpe Rua, Rafael Garcia, Nuno Gracias</p>
<p>Abstract: Posidonia oceanica meadows are a species of seagrass highly dependent on rocks for their survival and conservation. In recent years, there has been a concerning global decline in this species, emphasizing the critical need for efficient monitoring and assessment tools. While deep learning-based semantic segmentation and visual automated monitoring systems have shown promise in a variety of applications, their performance in underwater environments remains challenging due to complex water conditions and limited datasets. This paper introduces a framework that combines machine learning and computer vision techniques to enable an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to inspect the boundaries of Posidonia oceanica meadows autonomously. The framework incorporates an image segmentation module using an existing Mask R-CNN model and a strategy for Posidonia oceanica meadow boundary tracking. Furthermore, a new class dedicated to rocks is introduced to enhance the existing model, aiming to contribute to a comprehensive monitoring approach and provide a deeper understanding of the intricate interactions between the meadow and its surrounding environment. The image segmentation model is validated using real underwater images, while the overall inspection framework is evaluated in a realistic simulation environment, replicating actual monitoring scenarios with real underwater images. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables the AUV to autonomously accomplish the main tasks of underwater inspection and segmentation of rocks. Consequently, this work holds significant potential for the conservation and protection of marine environments, providing valuable insights into the status of Posidonia oceanica meadows and supporting targeted preservation efforts</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhosein Chahe, Lifeng Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) show promise for autonomous driving but often lack transparent reasoning capabilities that are critical for safety. We investigate whether explicitly modeling reasoning during fine-tuning enhances VLM performance on driving decision tasks. Using GPT-4o, we generate structured reasoning chains for driving scenarios from the DriveLM benchmark with category-specific prompting strategies. We compare reasoning-based fine-tuning, answer-only fine-tuning, and baseline instruction-tuned models across multiple small VLM families (Llama 3.2, Llava 1.5, and Qwen 2.5VL). Our results demonstrate that reasoning-based fine-tuning consistently outperforms alternatives, with Llama3.2-11B-reason achieving the highest performance. Models fine-tuned with reasoning show substantial improvements in accuracy and text generation quality, suggesting explicit reasoning enhances internal representations for driving decisions. These findings highlight the importance of transparent decision processes in safety-critical domains and offer a promising direction for developing more interpretable autonomous driving systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jostan Brown, Cindy Grimm, Joseph R. Davidson</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate localization is an important functional requirement for precision orchard management. However, there are few off-the-shelf commercial solutions available to growers. In this paper, we present SeeTree, a modular, open source embedded system for tree trunk detection and orchard localization that is deployable on any vehicle. Building on our prior work on vision-based in-row localization using particle filters, SeeTree includes several new capabilities. First, it provides capacity for full orchard localization including out-of-row headland turning. Second, it includes the flexibility to integrate either visual, GNSS, or wheel odometry in the motion model. During field experiments in a commercial orchard, the system converged to the correct location 99% of the time over 800 trials, even when starting with large uncertainty in the initial particle locations. When turning out of row, the system correctly tracked 99% of the turns (860 trials representing 43 unique row changes). To help support adoption and future research and development, we make our dataset, design files, and source code freely available to the community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy Klotz, Shree K. Nayar</p>
<p>Abstract: A solar panel harvests the most energy when pointing in the direction that maximizes the total illumination (irradiance) falling on it. Given an arbitrary orientation of a panel and an arbitrary environmental illumination, we address the problem of finding the direction of maximum total irradiance. We develop a minimal sensing approach where measurements from just four photodetectors are used to iteratively vary the tilt of the panel to maximize the irradiance. Many environments produce irradiance functions with multiple local maxima. As a result, simply measuring the gradient of the irradiance function and applying gradient ascent will not work. We show that a larger, optimized tilt between the detectors and the panel is equivalent to blurring the irradiance function. This has the effect of eliminating local maxima and turning the irradiance function into a unimodal one, whose maximum can be found using gradient ascent. We show that there is a close relationship between our approach and scale space theory. We have collected a large dataset of high-dynamic range lighting environments in New York City, called \textit{UrbanSky}. We used this dataset to conduct simulations to verify the robustness of our approach. Finally, we have built a portable solar panel with four compact detectors and an actuator to conduct experiments in various real-world settings: direct sunlight, cloudy sky, urban settings with occlusions and shadows, and complex indoor lighting. In all cases, we show significant improvements in harvested energy compared to standard approaches for controlling the orientation of a solar panel.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Yu, Hanqing Chen, Mohd Yamani Idna Idris, Pei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Precipitation plays a critical role in the Earth's hydrological cycle, directly affecting ecosystems, agriculture, and water resource management. Accurate precipitation estimation and prediction are crucial for understanding climate dynamics, disaster preparedness, and environmental monitoring. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained increasing attention in quantitative remote sensing (QRS), enabling more advanced data analysis and improving precipitation estimation accuracy. Although traditional methods have been widely used for precipitation estimation, they face limitations due to the difficulty of data acquisition and the challenge of capturing complex feature relationships. Furthermore, the lack of standardized multi-source satellite datasets, and in most cases, the exclusive reliance on station data, significantly hinders the effective application of advanced AI models. To address these challenges, we propose the Rainy dataset, a multi-source spatio-temporal dataset that integrates pure satellite data with station data, and propose Taper Loss, designed to fill the gap in tasks where only in-situ data is available without area-wide support. The Rainy dataset supports five main tasks: (1) satellite calibration, (2) precipitation event prediction, (3) precipitation level prediction, (4) spatiotemporal prediction, and (5) precipitation downscaling. For each task, we selected benchmark models and evaluation metrics to provide valuable references for researchers. Using precipitation as an example, the Rainy dataset and Taper Loss demonstrate the seamless collaboration between QRS and computer vision, offering data support for AI for Science in the field of QRS and providing valuable insights for interdisciplinary collaboration and integration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gene Tangtartharakul, Katherine R. Storrs</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) show remarkable performance in visual reasoning tasks, successfully tackling college-level challenges that require high-level understanding of images. However, some recent reports of VLMs struggling to reason about elemental visual concepts like orientation, position, continuity, and occlusion suggest a potential gulf between human and VLM vision. Here we use the toolkit of neuropsychology to systematically assess the capabilities of three state-of-the-art VLMs across visual domains. Using 51 tests drawn from six clinical and experimental batteries, we characterise the visual abilities of leading VLMs relative to normative performance in healthy adults. While the models excel in straightforward object recognition tasks, we find widespread deficits in low- and mid-level visual abilities that would be considered clinically significant in humans. These selective deficits, profiled through validated test batteries, suggest that an artificial system can achieve complex object recognition without developing foundational visual concepts that in humans require no explicit training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guandong Li, Mengxia Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks face numerous challenges in hyperspectral image classification, including high-dimensional data, sparse ground object distributions, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification overfitting and limited generalization capability. To better adapt to ground object distributions while expanding receptive fields without introducing excessive parameters and skipping redundant information, this paper proposes WCNet, an improved 3D-DenseNet model integrated with wavelet transforms. We introduce wavelet transforms to effectively extend convolutional receptive fields and guide CNNs to better respond to low frequencies through cascading, termed wavelet convolution. Each convolution focuses on different frequency bands of the input signal with gradually increasing effective ranges. This process enables greater emphasis on low-frequency components while adding only a small number of trainable parameters. This dynamic approach allows the model to flexibly focus on critical spatial structures when processing different regions, rather than relying on fixed receptive fields of single static kernels. The Wavelet Conv module enhances model representation capability by expanding receptive fields through 3D wavelet transforms without increasing network depth or width. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance on the IN, UP, and KSC datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiani Liu, Zhiyuan Wang, Zeliang Zhang, Chao Huang, Susan Liang, Yunlong Tang, Chenliang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a range of applications, including many safety-critical tasks. However, their unique architectural properties raise new challenges and opportunities in adversarial robustness. In particular, we observe that adversarial examples crafted on ViTs exhibit higher transferability compared to those crafted on CNNs, suggesting that ViTs contain structural characteristics favorable for transferable attacks. In this work, we investigate the role of computational redundancy in ViTs and its impact on adversarial transferability. Unlike prior studies that aim to reduce computation for efficiency, we propose to exploit this redundancy to improve the quality and transferability of adversarial examples. Through a detailed analysis, we identify two forms of redundancy, including the data-level and model-level, that can be harnessed to amplify attack effectiveness. Building on this insight, we design a suite of techniques, including attention sparsity manipulation, attention head permutation, clean token regularization, ghost MoE diversification, and test-time adversarial training. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet-1k dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that our methods significantly outperform existing baselines in both transferability and generality across diverse model architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Rakibul Hasan, Shafin Rahman, Md Zakir Hossain, Aneesh Krishna, Tom Gedeon</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting empathy from video interactions is an emerging area of research. Video datasets, however, are often released as extracted features (i.e., tabular data) rather than raw footage due to privacy and ethical concerns. Prior research on such tabular datasets established tree-based classical machine learning approaches as the best-performing models. Motivated by the recent success of textual foundation models (i.e., large language models), we explore the use of tabular foundation models in empathy detection from tabular visual features. We experiment with two recent tabular foundation models $-$ TabPFN v2 and TabICL $-$ through in-context learning and fine-tuning setups. Our experiments on a public human-robot interaction benchmark demonstrate a significant boost in cross-subject empathy detection accuracy over several strong baselines (accuracy: $0.590 \rightarrow 0.730$; AUC: $0.564 \rightarrow 0.669$). In addition to performance improvement, we contribute novel insights and an evaluation setup to ensure generalisation on unseen subjects in this public benchmark. As the practice of releasing video features as tabular datasets is likely to persist due to privacy constraints, our findings will be widely applicable to future empathy detection video datasets as well.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present GaSLight, a method that generates spatially-varying lighting from regular images. Our method proposes using HDR Gaussian Splats as light source representation, marking the first time regular images can serve as light sources in a 3D renderer. Our two-stage process first enhances the dynamic range of images plausibly and accurately by leveraging the priors embedded in diffusion models. Next, we employ Gaussian Splats to model 3D lighting, achieving spatially variant lighting. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results on HDR estimations and their applications in illuminating virtual objects and scenes. To facilitate the benchmarking of images as light sources, we introduce a novel dataset of calibrated and unsaturated HDR to evaluate images as light sources. We assess our method using a combination of this novel dataset and an existing dataset from the literature. The code to reproduce our method will be available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anmol Singhal Navya Singhal</p>
<p>Abstract: Adoption of AI driven techniques in public services remains low due to challenges related to accuracy and speed of information at population scale. Computer vision techniques for traffic monitoring have not gained much popularity despite their relative strength in areas such as autonomous driving. Despite large number of academic methods for Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) systems, very few provide an end to end solution for patrolling in the city. This paper presents a novel prototype for a low power GPU based patrolling system to be deployed in an urban environment on surveillance vehicles for automated vehicle detection, recognition and tracking. In this work, we propose a complete ALPR system for Singapore license plates having both single and double line creating our own YOLO based network. We focus on unconstrained capture scenarios as would be the case in real world application, where the license plate (LP) might be considerably distorted due to oblique views. In this work, we first detect the license plate from the full image using RFB-Net and rectify multiple distorted license plates in a single image. After that, the detected license plate image is fed to our network for character recognition. We evaluate the performance of our proposed system on a newly built dataset covering more than 16,000 images. The system was able to correctly detect license plates with 86\% precision and recognize characters of a license plate in 67\% of the test set, and 89\% accuracy with one incorrect character (partial match). We also test latency of our system and achieve 64FPS on Tesla P4 GPU</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Janna Bruner, Amit Moryossef, Lior Wolf</p>
<p>Abstract: Sign languages are dynamic visual languages that involve hand gestures, in combination with non manual elements such as facial expressions. While video recordings of sign language are commonly used for education and documentation, the dynamic nature of signs can make it challenging to study them in detail, especially for new learners and educators. This work aims to convert sign language video footage into static illustrations, which serve as an additional educational resource to complement video content. This process is usually done by an artist, and is therefore quite costly. We propose a method that illustrates sign language videos by leveraging generative models' ability to understand both the semantic and geometric aspects of images. Our approach focuses on transferring a sketch like illustration style to video footage of sign language, combining the start and end frames of a sign into a single illustration, and using arrows to highlight the hand's direction and motion. While many style transfer methods address domain adaptation at varying levels of abstraction, applying a sketch like style to sign languages, especially for hand gestures and facial expressions, poses a significant challenge. To tackle this, we intervene in the denoising process of a diffusion model, injecting style as keys and values into high resolution attention layers, and fusing geometric information from the image and edges as queries. For the final illustration, we use the attention mechanism to combine the attention weights from both the start and end illustrations, resulting in a soft combination. Our method offers a cost effective solution for generating sign language illustrations at inference time, addressing the lack of such resources in educational materials.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dianbing Xi, Jiepeng Wang, Yuanzhi Liang, Xi Qiu, Yuchi Huo, Rui Wang, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for controllable video diffusion, OmniVDiff, aiming to synthesize and comprehend multiple video visual content in a single diffusion model. To achieve this, OmniVDiff treats all video visual modalities in the color space to learn a joint distribution, while employing an adaptive control strategy that dynamically adjusts the role of each visual modality during the diffusion process, either as a generation modality or a conditioning modality. This allows flexible manipulation of each modality's role, enabling support for a wide range of tasks. Consequently, our model supports three key functionalities: (1) Text-conditioned video generation: multi-modal visual video sequences (i.e., rgb, depth, canny, segmentaion) are generated based on the text conditions in one diffusion process; (2) Video understanding: OmniVDiff can estimate the depth, canny map, and semantic segmentation across the input rgb frames while ensuring coherence with the rgb input; and (3) X-conditioned video generation: OmniVDiff generates videos conditioned on fine-grained attributes (e.g., depth maps or segmentation maps). By integrating these diverse tasks into a unified video diffusion framework, OmniVDiff enhances the flexibility and scalability for controllable video diffusion, making it an effective tool for a variety of downstream applications, such as video-to-video translation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential for various video-related applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengyu Shi, Junhao Su, Huansheng Ning, Xiaoming Wei, Jialin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional layout generation aims to automatically generate visually appealing and semantically coherent layouts from user-defined constraints. While recent methods based on generative models have shown promising results, they typically require substantial amounts of training data or extensive fine-tuning, limiting their versatility and practical applicability. Alternatively, some training-free approaches leveraging in-context learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged, but they often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities and overly simplistic ranking mechanisms, which restrict their ability to generate consistently high-quality layouts. To this end, we propose LayoutCoT, a novel approach that leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through a combination of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. Specifically, LayoutCoT transforms layout representations into a standardized serialized format suitable for processing by LLMs. A Layout-aware RAG is used to facilitate effective retrieval and generate a coarse layout by LLMs. This preliminary layout, together with the selected exemplars, is then fed into a specially designed CoT reasoning module for iterative refinement, significantly enhancing both semantic coherence and visual quality. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets spanning three conditional layout generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LayoutCoT achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring training or fine-tuning. Notably, our CoT reasoning module enables standard LLMs, even those without explicit deep reasoning abilities, to outperform specialized deep-reasoning models such as deepseek-R1, highlighting the potential of our approach in unleashing the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs for layout generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihang Chen, Lijun Yun, Ze Liu, JianFeng Zhu, Jie Chen, Hui Wang, Yueping Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning techniques have achieved remarkable success in the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images and in land-use change detection. Nevertheless, their real-time deployment on edge platforms remains constrained by decoder complexity. Herein, we introduce LightFormer, a lightweight decoder for time-critical tasks that involve unstructured targets, such as disaster assessment, unmanned aerial vehicle search-and-rescue, and cultural heritage monitoring. LightFormer employs a feature-fusion and refinement module built on channel processing and a learnable gating mechanism to aggregate multi-scale, multi-range information efficiently, which drastically curtails model complexity. Furthermore, we propose a spatial information selection module (SISM) that integrates long-range attention with a detail preservation branch to capture spatial dependencies across multiple scales, thereby substantially improving the recognition of unstructured targets in complex scenes. On the ISPRS Vaihingen benchmark, LightFormer attains 99.9% of GLFFNet's mIoU (83.9% vs. 84.0%) while requiring only 14.7% of its FLOPs and 15.9% of its parameters, thus achieving an excellent accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Consistent results on LoveDA, ISPRS Potsdam, RescueNet, and FloodNet further demonstrate its robustness and superior perception of unstructured objects. These findings highlight LightFormer as a practical solution for remote sensing applications where both computational economy and high-precision segmentation are imperative.</p>

<p>Abstract: Wetlands constitute critical ecosystems that support both biodiversity and human well-being; however, they have experienced a significant decline since the 20th century. Back in the 1970s, researchers began to employ remote sensing technologies for wetland classification and mapping to elucidate the extent and variations of wetlands. Although some review articles summarized the development of this field, there is a lack of a thorough and in-depth understanding of wetland classification and mapping: (1) the scientific importance of wetlands, (2) major data, methods used in wetland classification and mapping, (3) driving factors of wetland changes, (4) current research paradigm and limitations, (5) challenges and opportunities in wetland classification and mapping under the context of technological innovation and global environmental change. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive perspective and new insights into wetland classification and mapping for readers to answer these questions. First, we conduct a meta-analysis of over 1,200 papers, encompassing wetland types, methods, sensor types, and study sites, examining prevailing trends in wetland classification and mapping. Next, we review and synthesize the wetland features and existing data and methods in wetland classification and mapping. We also summarize typical wetland mapping products and explore the intrinsic driving factors of wetland changes across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Finally, we discuss current limitations and propose future directions in response to global environmental change and technological innovation. This review consolidates our understanding of wetland remote sensing and offers scientific recommendations that foster transformative progress in wetland science.</p>

However, the need for linguistic data is not applicable to all practical tasks. In this study, we aim to explore using large vision models (LVMs) or visual foundation models (VFMs) to enhance long-tailed data features without any language information. Specifically, we extract features from the LVM and fuse them with features in the baseline network's map and latent space to obtain the augmented features. Moreover, we design several prototype-based losses in the latent space to further exploit the potential of the augmented features. In the experimental section, we validate our approach on two benchmark datasets: ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist2018.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanning Chen, Yang Ni, Wenjun Huang, Hyunwoo Oh, Yezi Liu, Tamoghno Das, Mohsen Imani</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have been widely adopted to guide vision foundation models in performing reasoning segmentation tasks, achieving impressive performance. However, the substantial computational overhead associated with LVLMs presents a new challenge. The primary source of this computational cost arises from processing hundreds of image tokens. Therefore, an effective strategy to mitigate such overhead is to reduce the number of image tokens, a process known as image token pruning. Previous studies on image token pruning for LVLMs have primarily focused on high level visual understanding tasks, such as visual question answering and image captioning. In contrast, guiding vision foundation models to generate accurate visual masks based on textual queries demands precise semantic and spatial reasoning capabilities. Consequently, pruning methods must carefully control individual image tokens throughout the LVLM reasoning process. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing methods struggle to adequately balance reductions in computational overhead with the necessity to maintain high segmentation accuracy. In this work, we propose LVLM_CSP, a novel training free visual token pruning method specifically designed for LVLM based reasoning segmentation tasks. LVLM_CSP consists of three stages: clustering, scattering, and pruning. Initially, the LVLM performs coarse-grained visual reasoning using a subset of selected image tokens. Next, fine grained reasoning is conducted, and finally, most visual tokens are pruned in the last stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LVLM_CSP achieves a 65% reduction in image token inference FLOPs with virtually no accuracy degradation, and a 70% reduction with only a minor 1% drop in accuracy on the 7B LVLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianpei Zhang, Jufeng Zhao, Yiming Zhu, Guangmang Cui, Yuxin Jing, Yuhan Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion(IVIF) algorithms often prioritize high-quality images, neglecting image degradation such as low light and noise, which limits the practical potential. This paper propose Degradation-Aware Adaptive image Fusion (DAAF), which achieves unified modeling of adaptive degradation optimization and image fusion. Specifically, DAAF comprises an auxiliary Adaptive Degradation Optimization Network (ADON) and a Feature Interactive Local-Global Fusion (FILGF) Network. Firstly, ADON includes infrared and visible-light branches. Within the infrared branch, frequency-domain feature decomposition and extraction are employed to isolate Gaussian and stripe noise. In the visible-light branch, Retinex decomposition is applied to extract illumination and reflectance components, enabling complementary enhancement of detail and illumination distribution. Subsequently, FILGF performs interactive multi-scale local-global feature fusion. Local feature fusion consists of intra-inter model feature complement, while global feature fusion is achieved through a interactive cross-model attention. Extensive experiments have shown that DAAF outperforms current IVIF algorithms in normal and complex degradation scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tonko E. W. Bossen, Andreas M{\o}gelmose, Ross Greer</p>
<p>Abstract: In autonomous driving, it is crucial to correctly interpret traffic gestures (TGs), such as those of an authority figure providing orders or instructions, or a pedestrian signaling the driver, to ensure a safe and pleasant traffic environment for all road users. This study investigates the capabilities of state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) in zero-shot interpretation, focusing on their ability to caption and classify human gestures in traffic contexts. We create and publicly share two custom datasets with varying formal and informal TGs, such as 'Stop', 'Reverse', 'Hail', etc. The datasets are "Acted TG (ATG)" and "Instructive TG In-The-Wild (ITGI)". They are annotated with natural language, describing the pedestrian's body position and gesture. We evaluate models using three methods utilizing expert-generated captions as baseline and control: (1) caption similarity, (2) gesture classification, and (3) pose sequence reconstruction similarity. Results show that current VLMs struggle with gesture understanding: sentence similarity averages below 0.59, and classification F1 scores reach only 0.14-0.39, well below the expert baseline of 0.70. While pose reconstruction shows potential, it requires more data and refined metrics to be reliable. Our findings reveal that although some SOTA VLMs can interpret zero-shot human traffic gestures, none are accurate and robust enough to be trustworthy, emphasizing the need for further research in this domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: RT-DETRs have shown strong performance across various computer vision tasks but are known to degrade under challenging weather conditions such as fog. In this work, we investigate three novel approaches to enhance RT-DETR robustness in foggy environments: (1) Domain Adaptation via Perceptual Loss, which distills domain-invariant features from a teacher network to a student using perceptual supervision; (2) Weather Adaptive Attention, which augments the attention mechanism with fog-sensitive scaling by introducing an auxiliary foggy image stream; and (3) Weather Fusion Encoder, which integrates a dual-stream encoder architecture that fuses clear and foggy image features via multi-head self and cross-attention. Despite the architectural innovations, none of the proposed methods consistently outperform the baseline RT-DETR. We analyze the limitations and potential causes, offering insights for future research in weather-aware object detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilang Peng, Sijia Qian, Yingdan Lu, Cuihua Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's visually dominated social media landscape, predicting the perceived credibility of visual content and understanding what drives human judgment are crucial for countering misinformation. However, these tasks are challenging due to the diversity and richness of visual features. We introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-informed feature discovery framework that leverages multimodal LLMs, such as GPT-4o, to evaluate content credibility and explain its reasoning. We extract and quantify interpretable features using targeted prompts and integrate them into machine learning models to improve credibility predictions. We tested this approach on 4,191 visual social media posts across eight topics in science, health, and politics, using credibility ratings from 5,355 crowdsourced workers. Our method outperformed zero-shot GPT-based predictions by 13 percent in R2, and revealed key features like information concreteness and image format. We discuss the implications for misinformation mitigation, visual credibility, and the role of LLMs in social science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aviral Chharia, Tianyu Ren, Tomotake Furuhata, Kenji Shimada</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognizing safety violations in construction environments is critical yet remains underexplored in computer vision. Existing models predominantly rely on 2D object detection, which fails to capture the complexities of real-world violations due to: (i) an oversimplified task formulation treating violation recognition merely as object detection, (ii) inadequate validation under realistic conditions, (iii) absence of standardized baselines, and (iv) limited scalability from the unavailability of synthetic dataset generators for diverse construction scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce Safe-Construct, the first framework that reformulates violation recognition as a 3D multi-view engagement task, leveraging scene-level worker-object context and 3D spatial understanding. We also propose the Synthetic Indoor Construction Site Generator (SICSG) to create diverse, scalable training data, overcoming data limitations. Safe-Construct achieves a 7.6% improvement over state-of-the-art methods across four violation types. We rigorously evaluate our approach in near-realistic settings, incorporating four violations, four workers, 14 objects, and challenging conditions like occlusions (worker-object, worker-worker) and variable illumination (back-lighting, overexposure, sunlight). By integrating 3D multi-view spatial understanding and synthetic data generation, Safe-Construct sets a new benchmark for scalable and robust safety monitoring in high-risk industries.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karan Jain, Mohammad Nayeem Teli</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained state of the art performance on many image generation tasks. However, most models require significant computational resources to achieve this. This becomes apparent in the application of medical image synthesis due to the 3D nature of medical datasets like CT-scans, MRIs, electron microscope, etc. In this paper we propose a novel architecture for a single GPU memory-efficient training for diffusion models for high dimensional medical datasets. The proposed model is built by using an invertible UNet architecture with invertible attention modules. This leads to the following two contributions: 1. denoising diffusion models and thus enabling memory usage to be independent of the dimensionality of the dataset, and 2. reducing the energy usage during training. While this new model can be applied to a multitude of image generation tasks, we showcase its memory-efficiency on the 3D BraTS2020 dataset leading to up to 15\% decrease in peak memory consumption during training with comparable results to SOTA while maintaining the image quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Zhang, Zijian Chen, Zicheng Zhang, Yuze Sun, Yuan Tian, Ziheng Jia, Chunyi Li, Xiaohong Liu, Xiongkuo Min, Guangtao Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of multimodal tasks, achieving ever-increasing performance on various evaluation benchmarks. However, existing benchmarks are typically static and often overlap with pre-training datasets, leading to fixed complexity constraints and substantial data contamination issues. Meanwhile, manually annotated datasets are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and subject to human bias and inconsistency, leading to reliability and reproducibility issues. To address these problems, we propose a fully dynamic multimodal evaluation framework, named Open-ended Visual Puzzle Generation (OVPG), which aims to generate fresh, diverse, and verifiable evaluation data automatically in puzzle-solving tasks. Specifically, the OVPG pipeline consists of a raw material sampling module, a visual content generation module, and a puzzle rule design module, which ensures that each evaluation instance is primitive, highly randomized, and uniquely solvable, enabling continual adaptation to the evolving capabilities of LMMs. Built upon OVPG, we construct PuzzleBench, a dynamic and scalable benchmark comprising 11,840 VQA samples. It features six carefully designed puzzle tasks targeting three core LMM competencies, visual recognition, logical reasoning, and context understanding. PuzzleBench differs from static benchmarks that quickly become outdated. It enables ongoing dataset refreshing through OVPG and a rich set of open-ended puzzle designs, allowing seamless adaptation to the evolving capabilities of LMMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahuan Long, Wen Yao, Tingsong Jiang, Chao Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial patches are widely used to evaluate the robustness of object detection systems in real-world scenarios. These patches were initially designed to deceive single-modal detectors (e.g., visible or infrared) and have recently been extended to target visible-infrared dual-modal detectors. However, existing dual-modal adversarial patch attacks have limited attack effectiveness across diverse physical scenarios. To address this, we propose CDUPatch, a universal cross-modal patch attack against visible-infrared object detectors across scales, views, and scenarios. Specifically, we observe that color variations lead to different levels of thermal absorption, resulting in temperature differences in infrared imaging. Leveraging this property, we propose an RGB-to-infrared adapter that maps RGB patches to infrared patches, enabling unified optimization of cross-modal patches. By learning an optimal color distribution on the adversarial patch, we can manipulate its thermal response and generate an adversarial infrared texture. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale clipping strategy and construct a new visible-infrared dataset, MSDrone, which contains aerial vehicle images in varying scales and perspectives. These data augmentation strategies enhance the robustness of our patch in real-world conditions. Experiments on four benchmark datasets (e.g., DroneVehicle, LLVIP, VisDrone, MSDrone) show that our method outperforms existing patch attacks in the digital domain. Extensive physical tests further confirm strong transferability across scales, views, and scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shripad Pate, Aiman Farooq, Suvrankar Dutta, Musadiq Aadil Sheikh, Atin Kumar, Deepak Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate rib fracture identification and classification are essential for treatment planning. However, existing datasets often lack fine-grained annotations, particularly regarding rib fracture characterization, type, and precise anatomical location on individual ribs. To address this, we introduce a novel rib fracture annotation protocol tailored for fracture classification. Further, we enhance fracture classification by leveraging cross-modal embeddings that bridge radiological images and clinical descriptions. Our approach employs hyperbolic embeddings to capture the hierarchical nature of fracture, mapping visual features and textual descriptions into a shared non-Euclidean manifold. This framework enables more nuanced similarity computations between imaging characteristics and clinical descriptions, accounting for the inherent hierarchical relationships in fracture taxonomy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods across multiple classification tasks, with average recall improvements of 6% on the AirRib dataset and 17.5% on the public RibFrac dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukang Lin, Yan Hong, Zunnan Xu, Xindi Li, Chao Xu, Chuanbiao Song, Ronghui Li, Haoxing Chen, Jun Lan, Huijia Zhu, Weiqiang Wang, Jianfu Zhang, Xiu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent video generation research has focused heavily on isolated actions, leaving interactive motions-such as hand-face interactions-largely unexamined. These interactions are essential for emerging biometric authentication systems, which rely on interactive motion-based anti-spoofing approaches. From a security perspective, there is a growing need for large-scale, high-quality interactive videos to train and strengthen authentication models. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for animating realistic hand-face interactions. Our approach simultaneously learns spatio-temporal contact dynamics and biomechanically plausible deformation effects, enabling natural interactions where hand movements induce anatomically accurate facial deformations while maintaining collision-free contact. To facilitate this research, we present InterHF, a large-scale hand-face interaction dataset featuring 18 interaction patterns and 90,000 annotated videos. Additionally, we propose InterAnimate, a region-aware diffusion model designed specifically for interaction animation. InterAnimate leverages learnable spatial and temporal latents to effectively capture dynamic interaction priors and integrates a region-aware interaction mechanism that injects these priors into the denoising process. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first large-scale effort to systematically study human hand-face interactions. Qualitative and quantitative results show InterAnimate produces highly realistic animations, setting a new benchmark. Code and data will be made public to advance research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10920">Towards Efficient Partially Relevant Video Retrieval with Active Moment Discovering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Peipei Song, Long Zhang, Long Lan, Weidong Chen, Dan Guo, Xun Yang, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task in text-to-video retrieval, where videos are untrimmed and contain much background content. The pursuit here is of both effective and efficient solutions to capture the partial correspondence between text queries and untrimmed videos. Existing PRVR methods, which typically focus on modeling multi-scale clip representations, however, suffer from content independence and information redundancy, impairing retrieval performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective approach with active moment discovering (AMDNet). We are committed to discovering video moments that are semantically consistent with their queries. By using learnable span anchors to capture distinct moments and applying masked multi-moment attention to emphasize salient moments while suppressing redundant backgrounds, we achieve more compact and informative video representations. To further enhance moment modeling, we introduce a moment diversity loss to encourage different moments of distinct regions and a moment relevance loss to promote semantically query-relevant moments, which cooperate with a partially relevant retrieval loss for end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on two large-scale video datasets (\ie, TVR and ActivityNet Captions) demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our AMDNet. In particular, AMDNet is about 15.5 times smaller (\#parameters) while 6.0 points higher (SumR) than the up-to-date method GMMFormer on TVR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Yu, Yisi Luo, Kai Ye, Xile Zhao, Deyu Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for visual data representation. However, classical INR methods represent data in the original space mixed with different frequency components, and several feature encoding parameters (e.g., the frequency parameter $\omega$ or the rank $R$) need manual configurations. In this work, we propose a self-evolving cross-frequency INR using the Haar wavelet transform (termed CF-INR), which decouples data into four frequency components and employs INRs in the wavelet space. CF-INR allows the characterization of different frequency components separately, thus enabling higher accuracy for data representation. To more precisely characterize cross-frequency components, we propose a cross-frequency tensor decomposition paradigm for CF-INR with self-evolving parameters, which automatically updates the rank parameter $R$ and the frequency parameter $\omega$ for each frequency component through self-evolving optimization. This self-evolution paradigm eliminates the laborious manual tuning of these parameters, and learns a customized cross-frequency feature encoding configuration for each dataset. We evaluate CF-INR on a variety of visual data representation and recovery tasks, including image regression, inpainting, denoising, and cloud removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CF-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in each case.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubin Gu, Yuan Meng, Kaihang Zheng, Xiaoshuai Sun, Jiayi Ji, Weijian Ruan, Liujuan Cao, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Image restoration~(IR), as a fundamental multimedia data processing task, has a significant impact on downstream visual applications. In recent years, researchers have focused on developing general-purpose IR models capable of handling diverse degradation types, thereby reducing the cost and complexity of model development. Current mainstream approaches are based on three architectural paradigms: CNNs, Transformers, and Mambas. CNNs excel in efficient inference, whereas Transformers and Mamba excel at capturing long-range dependencies and modeling global contexts. While each architecture has demonstrated success in specialized, single-task settings, limited efforts have been made to effectively integrate heterogeneous architectures to jointly address diverse IR challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose RestorMixer, an efficient and general-purpose IR model based on mixed-architecture fusion. RestorMixer adopts a three-stage encoder-decoder structure, where each stage is tailored to the resolution and feature characteristics of the input. In the initial high-resolution stage, CNN-based blocks are employed to rapidly extract shallow local features. In the subsequent stages, we integrate a refined multi-directional scanning Mamba module with a multi-scale window-based self-attention mechanism. This hierarchical and adaptive design enables the model to leverage the strengths of CNNs in local feature extraction, Mamba in global context modeling, and attention mechanisms in dynamic feature refinement. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RestorMixer achieves leading performance across multiple IR tasks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihang Liu, Lianghua He, Ying Wen, Longzhen Yang, Hongzhou Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Current self-supervised methods, such as contrastive learning, predominantly focus on global discrimination, neglecting the critical fine-grained anatomical details required for accurate radiographic analysis. To address this challenge, we propose an Anatomy-driven self-supervised framework for enhancing Fine-grained Representation in radiographic image analysis (AFiRe). The core idea of AFiRe is to align the anatomical consistency with the unique token-processing characteristics of Vision Transformer. Specifically, AFiRe synergistically performs two self-supervised schemes: (i) Token-wise anatomy-guided contrastive learning, which aligns image tokens based on structural and categorical consistency, thereby enhancing fine-grained spatial-anatomical discrimination; (ii) Pixel-level anomaly-removal restoration, which particularly focuses on local anomalies, thereby refining the learned discrimination with detailed geometrical information. Additionally, we propose Synthetic Lesion Mask to enhance anatomical diversity while preserving intra-consistency, which is typically corrupted by traditional data augmentations, such as Cropping and Affine transformations. Experimental results show that AFiRe: (i) provides robust anatomical discrimination, achieving more cohesive feature clusters compared to state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods; (ii) demonstrates superior generalization, surpassing 7 radiography-specific self-supervised methods in multi-label classification tasks with limited labeling; and (iii) integrates fine-grained information, enabling precise anomaly detection using only image-level annotations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhisheng Zhang, Peng Zhang, Fengxiang Wang, Liangli Ma, Fuchun Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Enhancing forward-looking sonar images is critical for accurate underwater target detection. Current deep learning methods mainly rely on supervised training with simulated data, but the difficulty in obtaining high-quality real-world paired data limits their practical use and generalization. Although self-supervised approaches from remote sensing partially alleviate data shortages, they neglect the cross-modal degradation gap between sonar and remote sensing images. Directly transferring pretrained weights often leads to overly smooth sonar images, detail loss, and insufficient brightness. To address this, we propose a feature-space transformation that maps sonar images from the pixel domain to a robust feature domain, effectively bridging the degradation gap. Additionally, our self-supervised multi-frame fusion strategy leverages complementary inter-frame information to naturally remove speckle noise and enhance target-region brightness. Experiments on three self-collected real-world forward-looking sonar datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, effectively suppressing noise, preserving detailed edges, and substantially improving brightness, demonstrating strong potential for underwater target detection applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linhao Li, Yongzhang Tan, Siyuan Yang, Hao Cheng, Yongfeng Dong, Liang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) aims to continuously learn new classes from a limited set of training samples without forgetting knowledge of previously learned classes. Conventional FSCIL methods typically build a robust feature extractor during the base training session with abundant training samples and subsequently freeze this extractor, only fine-tuning the classifier in subsequent incremental phases. However, current strategies primarily focus on preventing catastrophic forgetting, considering only the relationship between novel and base classes, without paying attention to the specific decision spaces of each class. To address this challenge, we propose a plug-and-play Adaptive Decision Boundary Strategy (ADBS), which is compatible with most FSCIL methods. Specifically, we assign a specific decision boundary to each class and adaptively adjust these boundaries during training to optimally refine the decision spaces for the classes in each session. Furthermore, to amplify the distinctiveness between classes, we employ a novel inter-class constraint loss that optimizes the decision boundaries and prototypes for each class. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks, namely CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CUB200, demonstrate that incorporating our ADBS method with existing FSCIL techniques significantly improves performance, achieving overall state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning is developing rapidly and handling common computer vision tasks well. It is time to pay attention to more complex vision tasks, as model size, knowledge, and reasoning capabilities continue to improve. In this paper, we introduce and review a family of complex tasks, termed Concealed Dense Prediction (CDP), which has great value in agriculture, industry, etc. CDP's intrinsic trait is that the targets are concealed in their surroundings, thus fully perceiving them requires fine-grained representations, prior knowledge, auxiliary reasoning, etc. The contributions of this review are three-fold: (i) We introduce the scope, characteristics, and challenges specific to CDP tasks and emphasize their essential differences from generic vision tasks. (ii) We develop a taxonomy based on concealment counteracting to summarize deep learning efforts in CDP through experiments on three tasks. We compare 25 state-of-the-art methods across 12 widely used concealed datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sami Arja, Nimrod Kruger, Alexandre Marcireau, Nicholas Owen Ralph, Saeed Afshar, Gregory Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: Cephalopods exhibit unique colour discrimination capabilities despite having one type of photoreceptor, relying instead on chromatic aberration induced by their ocular optics and pupil shapes to perceive spectral information. We took inspiration from this biological mechanism to design a spectral imaging system that combines a ball lens with an event-based camera. Our approach relies on a motorised system that shifts the focal position, mirroring the adaptive lens motion in cephalopods. This approach has enabled us to achieve wavelength-dependent focusing across the visible light and near-infrared spectrum, making the event a spectral sensor. We characterise chromatic aberration effects, using both event-based and conventional frame-based sensors, validating the effectiveness of bio-inspired spectral discrimination both in simulation and in a real setup as well as assessing the spectral discrimination performance. Our proposed approach provides a robust spectral sensing capability without conventional colour filters or computational demosaicing. This approach opens new pathways toward new spectral sensing systems inspired by nature's evolutionary solutions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghui Lin, Shu Wang, Xiang Wang, Jianhua Tang, Longbin Fu, Zhengrong Zuo, Nong Sang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current multi-modal object re-identification approaches based on large-scale pre-trained backbones (i.e., ViT) have displayed remarkable progress and achieved excellent performance. However, these methods usually adopt the standard full fine-tuning paradigm, which requires the optimization of considerable backbone parameters, causing extensive computational and storage requirements. In this work, we propose an efficient prompt-tuning framework tailored for multi-modal object re-identification, dubbed DMPT, which freezes the main backbone and only optimizes several newly added decoupled modality-aware parameters. Specifically, we explicitly decouple the visual prompts into modality-specific prompts which leverage prior modality knowledge from a powerful text encoder and modality-independent semantic prompts which extract semantic information from multi-modal inputs, such as visible, near-infrared, and thermal-infrared. Built upon the extracted features, we further design a Prompt Inverse Bind (PromptIBind) strategy that employs bind prompts as a medium to connect the semantic prompt tokens of different modalities and facilitates the exchange of complementary multi-modal information, boosting final re-identification results. Experimental results on multiple common benchmarks demonstrate that our DMPT can achieve competitive results to existing state-of-the-art methods while requiring only 6.5% fine-tuning of the backbone parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo-Cheng Hu, Ge-Peng Ji, Dian Shao, Deng-Ping Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation is essential for effective diagnosis and treatment. Previously, PraNet-V1 was proposed to enhance polyp segmentation by introducing a reverse attention (RA) module that utilizes background information. However, PraNet-V1 struggles with multi-class segmentation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose PraNet-V2, which, compared to PraNet-V1, effectively performs a broader range of tasks including multi-class segmentation. At the core of PraNet-V2 is the Dual-Supervised Reverse Attention (DSRA) module, which incorporates explicit background supervision, independent background modeling, and semantically enriched attention fusion. Our PraNet-V2 framework demonstrates strong performance on four polyp segmentation datasets. Additionally, by integrating DSRA to iteratively enhance foreground segmentation results in three state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models, we achieve up to a 1.36% improvement in mean Dice score.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoyang Wang, Zeyu Zhang, Long Teng, Zijun Li, Shichao Kan</p>
<p>Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves target images using a multi-modal query that combines a reference image with text describing desired modifications. The primary challenge is effectively fusing this visual and textual information. Current cross-modal feature fusion approaches for CIR exhibit an inherent bias in intention interpretation. These methods tend to disproportionately emphasize either the reference image features (visual-dominant fusion) or the textual modification intent (text-dominant fusion through image-to-text conversion). Such an imbalanced representation often fails to accurately capture and reflect the actual search intent of the user in the retrieval results. To address this challenge, we propose TMCIR, a novel framework that advances composed image retrieval through two key innovations: 1) Intent-Aware Cross-Modal Alignment. We first fine-tune CLIP encoders contrastively using intent-reflecting pseudo-target images, synthesized from reference images and textual descriptions via a diffusion model. This step enhances the encoder ability of text to capture nuanced intents in textual descriptions. 2) Adaptive Token Fusion. We further fine-tune all encoders contrastively by comparing adaptive token-fusion features with the target image. This mechanism dynamically balances visual and textual representations within the contrastive learning pipeline, optimizing the composed feature for retrieval. Extensive experiments on Fashion-IQ and CIRR datasets demonstrate that TMCIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing nuanced user intent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinyue Tong, Ziqian Lu, Jun Liu, Yangming Zheng, Zheming Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in pixel-level medical image perception, existing methods are either limited to specific tasks or heavily rely on accurate bounding boxes or text labels as input prompts. However, the medical knowledge required for input is a huge obstacle for general public, which greatly reduces the universality of these methods. Compared with these domain-specialized auxiliary information, general users tend to rely on oral queries that require logical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a novel medical vision task: Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MedSD), which aims to comprehend implicit queries about medical images and generate the corresponding segmentation mask and bounding box for the target object. To accomplish this task, we first introduce a Multi-perspective, Logic-driven Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MLMR-SD) dataset, which encompasses a substantial collection of medical entity targets along with their corresponding reasoning. Furthermore, we propose MediSee, an effective baseline model designed for medical reasoning segmentation and detection. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively address MedSD with implicit colloquial queries and outperform traditional medical referring segmentation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eunsoo Im, Jung Kwon Lee, Changhyun Jee</p>
<p>Abstract: The emerging trend in computer vision emphasizes developing universal models capable of simultaneously addressing multiple diverse tasks. Such universality typically requires joint training across multi-domain datasets to ensure effective generalization. However, monocular 3D object detection presents unique challenges in multi-domain training due to the scarcity of datasets annotated with accurate 3D ground-truth labels, especially beyond typical road-based autonomous driving contexts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel weakly supervised framework leveraging pseudo-labels. Current pretrained models often struggle to accurately detect pedestrians in non-road environments due to inherent dataset biases. Unlike generalized image-based 2D object detection models, achieving similar generalization in monocular 3D detection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose GATE3D, a novel framework designed specifically for generalized monocular 3D object detection via weak supervision. GATE3D effectively bridges domain gaps by employing consistency losses between 2D and 3D predictions. Remarkably, our model achieves competitive performance on the KITTI benchmark as well as on an indoor-office dataset collected by us to evaluate the generalization capabilities of our framework. Our results demonstrate that GATE3D significantly accelerates learning from limited annotated data through effective pre-training strategies, highlighting substantial potential for broader impacts in robotics, augmented reality, and virtual reality applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyang Zhu, Xing Zhang, Yuyang Sun, Ching-Chun Chang, Isao Echizen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in image generation, particularly diffusion models, have significantly lowered the barrier for creating sophisticated forgeries, making image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) increasingly challenging. While prior work in IMDL has focused largely on natural images, the anime domain remains underexplored-despite its growing vulnerability to AI-generated forgeries. Misrepresentations of AI-generated images as hand-drawn artwork, copyright violations, and inappropriate content modifications pose serious threats to the anime community and industry. To address this gap, we propose AnimeDL-2M, the first large-scale benchmark for anime IMDL with comprehensive annotations. It comprises over two million images including real, partially manipulated, and fully AI-generated samples. Experiments indicate that models trained on existing IMDL datasets of natural images perform poorly when applied to anime images, highlighting a clear domain gap between anime and natural images. To better handle IMDL tasks in anime domain, we further propose AniXplore, a novel model tailored to the visual characteristics of anime imagery. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AniXplore achieves superior performance compared to existing methods. Dataset and code can be found in https://flytweety.github.io/AnimeDL2M/.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reliable traffic data are essential for understanding urban mobility and developing effective traffic management strategies. This study introduces the DRone-derived Intelligence For Traffic analysis (DRIFT) dataset, a large-scale urban traffic dataset collected systematically from synchronized drone videos at approximately 250 meters altitude, covering nine interconnected intersections in Daejeon, South Korea. DRIFT provides high-resolution vehicle trajectories that include directional information, processed through video synchronization and orthomap alignment, resulting in a comprehensive dataset of 81,699 vehicle trajectories. Through our DRIFT dataset, researchers can simultaneously analyze traffic at multiple scales - from individual vehicle maneuvers like lane-changes and safety metrics such as time-to-collision to aggregate network flow dynamics across interconnected urban intersections. The DRIFT dataset is structured to enable immediate use without additional preprocessing, complemented by open-source models for object detection and trajectory extraction, as well as associated analytical tools. DRIFT is expected to significantly contribute to academic research and practical applications, such as traffic flow analysis and simulation studies.

<p>Abstract: The increasing availability of digital 3D environments, whether through image-based 3D reconstruction, generation, or scans obtained by robots, is driving innovation across various applications. These come with a significant demand for 3D interaction, such as 3D Interactive Segmentation, which is useful for tasks like object selection and manipulation. Additionally, there is a persistent need for solutions that are efficient, precise, and performing well across diverse settings, particularly in unseen environments and with unfamiliar objects. In this work, we introduce a 3D interactive segmentation method that consistently surpasses previous state-of-the-art techniques on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Our simple approach integrates a voxel-based sparse encoder with a lightweight transformer-based decoder that implements implicit click fusion, achieving superior performance and maximizing efficiency. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements on benchmark datasets, including ScanNet, ScanNet++, S3DIS, and KITTI-360, and also on unseen geometric distributions such as the ones obtained by Gaussian Splatting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fatemeh Amerehi, Patrick Healy</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial training is a common strategy for enhancing model robustness against adversarial attacks. However, it is typically tailored to the specific attack types it is trained on, limiting its ability to generalize to unseen threat models. Adversarial purification offers an alternative by leveraging a generative model to remove perturbations before classification. Since the purifier is trained independently of both the classifier and the threat models, it is better equipped to handle previously unseen attack scenarios. Diffusion models have proven highly effective for noise purification, not only in countering pixel-wise adversarial perturbations but also in addressing non-adversarial data shifts. In this study, we broaden the focus beyond pixel-wise robustness to explore the extent to which purification can mitigate both spectral and spatial adversarial attacks. Our findings highlight its effectiveness in handling diverse distortion patterns across low- to high-frequency regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yudong Zhang, Ruobing Xie, Jiansheng Chen, Xingwu Sun, Zhanhui Kang, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In typical multimodal tasks, such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), adversarial attacks targeting a specific image and question can lead large vision-language models (LVLMs) to provide incorrect answers. However, it is common for a single image to be associated with multiple questions, and LVLMs may still answer other questions correctly even for an adversarial image attacked by a specific question. To address this, we introduce the query-agnostic visual attack (QAVA), which aims to create robust adversarial examples that generate incorrect responses to unspecified and unknown questions. Compared to traditional adversarial attacks focused on specific images and questions, QAVA significantly enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of attacks on images when the question is unknown, achieving performance comparable to attacks on known target questions. Our research broadens the scope of visual adversarial attacks on LVLMs in practical settings, uncovering previously overlooked vulnerabilities, particularly in the context of visual adversarial threats.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11050">Leveraging LLMs and attention-mechanism for automatic annotation of historical maps</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunshuang Yuan, Monika Sester</p>
<p>Abstract: Historical maps are essential resources that provide insights into the geographical landscapes of the past. They serve as valuable tools for researchers across disciplines such as history, geography, and urban studies, facilitating the reconstruction of historical environments and the analysis of spatial transformations over time. However, when constrained to analogue or scanned formats, their interpretation is limited to humans and therefore not scalable. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly in computer vision and large language models (LLMs), have opened new avenues for automating the recognition and classification of features and objects in historical maps. In this paper, we propose a novel distillation method that leverages LLMs and attention mechanisms for the automatic annotation of historical maps. LLMs are employed to generate coarse classification labels for low-resolution historical image patches, while attention mechanisms are utilized to refine these labels to higher resolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that the refined labels achieve a high recall of more than 90%. Additionally, the intersection over union (IoU) scores--84.2% for Wood and 72.0% for Settlement--along with precision scores of 87.1% and 79.5%, respectively, indicate that most labels are well-aligned with ground-truth annotations. Notably, these results were achieved without the use of fine-grained manual labels during training, underscoring the potential of our approach for efficient and scalable historical map analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Salehi, Mohammadreza Salehi, Reshad Hosseini, Cees G. M. Snoek, Makoto Yamada, Mohammad Sabokrou</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) involves identifying deviations from normal data distributions and is critical in fields such as medical diagnostics and industrial defect detection. Traditional AD methods typically require the availability of normal training samples; however, this assumption is not always feasible, as collecting such data can be impractical. Additionally, these methods often struggle to generalize across different domains. Recent advancements, such as AnomalyCLIP and AdaCLIP, utilize the zero-shot generalization capabilities of CLIP but still face a performance gap between image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that conditions the prompts of the text encoder based on image context extracted from the vision encoder. Also, to capture fine-grained variations more effectively, we have modified the CLIP vision encoder and altered the extraction of dense features. These changes ensure that the features retain richer spatial and structural information for both normal and anomalous prompts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving performance by 2% to 29% across different metrics on 14 datasets. This demonstrates its effectiveness in both image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11066">Improving fingerprint presentation attack detection by an approach integrated into the personal verification stage</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Micheletto, Giulia Orr\`u, Luca Ghiani, Gian Luca Marcialis</p>
<p>Abstract: Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) systems are usually designed independently of the fingerprint verification system. While this can be acceptable for use cases where specific user templates are not predetermined, it represents a missed opportunity to enhance security in scenarios where integrating PAD with the fingerprint verification system could significantly leverage users' templates, which are the real target of a potential presentation attack. This does not mean that a PAD should be specifically designed for such users; that would imply the availability of many enrolled users' PAI and, consequently, complexity, time, and cost increase. On the contrary, we propose to equip a basic PAD, designed according to the state of the art, with an innovative add-on module called the Closeness Binary Code (CC) module. The term "closeness" refers to a peculiar property of the bona fide-related features: in an Euclidean feature space, genuine fingerprints tend to cluster in a specific pattern. First, samples from the same finger are close to each other, then samples from other fingers of the same user and finally, samples from fingers of other users. This property is statistically verified in our previous publication, and further confirmed in this paper. It is independent of the user population and the feature set class, which can be handcrafted or deep network-based (embeddings). Therefore, the add-on can be designed without the need for the targeted user samples; moreover, it exploits her/his samples' "closeness" property during the verification stage. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art PAD methods confirm the benefits of the proposed add-on, which can be easily coupled with the main PAD module integrated into the fingerprint verification system.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite their frequent use for change detection, both ConvNets and Vision transformers (ViT) exhibit well-known limitations, namely the former struggle to model long-range dependencies while the latter are computationally inefficient, rendering them challenging to train on large-scale datasets. Vision Mamba, an architecture based on State Space Models has emerged as an alternative addressing the aforementioned deficiencies and has been already applied to remote sensing change detection, though mostly as a feature extracting backbone. In this article the Change State Space Model is introduced, that has been specifically designed for change detection by focusing on the relevant changes between bi-temporal images, effectively filtering out irrelevant information. By concentrating solely on the changed features, the number of network parameters is reduced, enhancing significantly computational efficiency while maintaining high detection performance and robustness against input degradation. The proposed model has been evaluated via three benchmark datasets, where it outperformed ConvNets, ViTs, and Mamba-based counterparts at a fraction of their computational complexity.

<p>Abstract: Reconstructing 4D dynamic scenes from casually captured monocular videos is valuable but highly challenging, as each timestamp is observed from a single viewpoint. We introduce Vivid4D, a novel approach that enhances 4D monocular video synthesis by augmenting observation views - synthesizing multi-view videos from a monocular input. Unlike existing methods that either solely leverage geometric priors for supervision or use generative priors while overlooking geometry, we integrate both. This reformulates view augmentation as a video inpainting task, where observed views are warped into new viewpoints based on monocular depth priors. To achieve this, we train a video inpainting model on unposed web videos with synthetically generated masks that mimic warping occlusions, ensuring spatially and temporally consistent completion of missing regions. To further mitigate inaccuracies in monocular depth priors, we introduce an iterative view augmentation strategy and a robust reconstruction loss. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively improves monocular 4D scene reconstruction and completion.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Optical Character Recognition (OCR) task is important for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and providing high-quality data sources for LLM training data. While state-of-the-art VLMs show improved average OCR accuracy, they still struggle with sample-level quality degradation and lack reliable automatic detection of low-quality outputs. We introduce Consensus Entropy (CE), a training-free post-inference method that quantifies OCR uncertainty by aggregating outputs from multiple VLMs. Our approach exploits a key insight: correct VLM OCR predictions converge in output space while errors diverge. We develop a lightweight multi-model framework that effectively identifies problematic samples, selects the best outputs and combines model strengths. Experiments across multiple OCR benchmarks and VLMs demonstrate that CE outperforms VLM-as-judge approaches and single-model baselines at the same cost and achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple metrics. For instance, our solution demonstrates: achieving 15.2\% higher F1 scores than VLM-as-judge methods in quality verification, delivering 6.0\% accuracy gains on mathematical calculation tasks, and requiring rephrasing only 7.3\% of inputs while maintaining overall performance. Notably, the entire process requires neither training nor supervision while maintaining plug-and-play functionality throughout.</p>

In this work, we propose TCBS-Attack, a novel query-based black-box jailbreak attack that searches for tokens located near the decision boundaries defined by text and image checkers. By iteratively optimizing tokens near these boundaries, TCBS-Attack generates semantically coherent adversarial prompts capable of bypassing multiple defensive layers in T2I models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks across various T2I models, including securely trained open-source models and commercial online services like DALL-E 3. TCBS-Attack achieves an ASR-4 of 45\% and an ASR-1 of 21\% on jailbreaking full-chain T2I models, significantly surpassing baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Lin, Jianghang Lin, Kai Ye, You Shen, Yan Zhang, Shengchuan Zhang, Liujuan Cao, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Although fully-supervised oriented object detection has made significant progress in multimodal remote sensing image understanding, it comes at the cost of labor-intensive annotation. Recent studies have explored weakly and semi-supervised learning to alleviate this burden. However, these methods overlook the difficulties posed by dense annotations in complex remote sensing scenes. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting called sparsely annotated oriented object detection (SAOOD), which only labels partial instances, and propose a solution to address its challenges. Specifically, we focus on two key issues in the setting: (1) sparse labeling leading to overfitting on limited foreground representations, and (2) unlabeled objects (false negatives) confusing feature learning. To this end, we propose the S$^2$Teacher, a novel method that progressively mines pseudo-labels for unlabeled objects, from easy to hard, to enhance foreground representations. Additionally, it reweights the loss of unlabeled objects to mitigate their impact during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S$^2$Teacher not only significantly improves detector performance across different sparse annotation levels but also achieves near-fully-supervised performance on the DOTA dataset with only 10% annotation instances, effectively balancing detection accuracy with annotation efficiency. The code will be public.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo M. Joao, Jancarlo F. Gomes, Silvio J. F. Guimaraes, Ewa Kijak, Alexandre X. Falcao</p>
<p>Abstract: Salient Object Detection (SOD) with deep learning often requires substantial computational resources and large annotated datasets, making it impractical for resource-constrained applications. Lightweight models address computational demands but typically strive in complex and scarce labeled-data scenarios. Feature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM) learns an encoder's convolutional kernels among image patches extracted from discriminative regions marked on a few representative images, dismissing large annotated datasets, pretraining, and backpropagation. Such a methodology exploits information redundancy commonly found in biomedical image applications. This study presents methods to learn dilated-separable convolutional kernels and multi-dilation layers without backpropagation for FLIM networks. It also proposes a novel network simplification method to reduce kernel redundancy and encoder size. By combining a FLIM encoder with an adaptive decoder, a concept recently introduced to estimate a pointwise convolution per image, this study presents very efficient (named flyweight) SOD models for biomedical images. Experimental results in challenging datasets demonstrate superior efficiency and effectiveness to lightweight models. By requiring significantly fewer parameters and floating-point operations, the results show competitive effectiveness to heavyweight models. These advances highlight the potential of FLIM networks for data-limited and resource-constrained applications with information redundancy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> P. Tomkiewicz, J. Jaworski, P. Zielonka, A. Wilinski</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel computational approach for evaluating urban metrics through density gradient analysis using multi-modal satellite imagery, with applications including public transport and other urban systems. By combining optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, we develop a method to segment urban areas, identify urban centers, and quantify density gradients. Our approach calculates two key metrics: the density gradient coefficient ($\alpha$) and the minimum effective distance (LD) at which density reaches a target threshold. We further employ machine learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering, to objectively identify uniform and high-variability regions within density gradient plots. We demonstrate that these metrics provide an effective screening tool for public transport analyses by revealing the underlying urban structure. Through comparative analysis of two representative cities with contrasting urban morphologies (monocentric vs polycentric), we establish relationships between density gradient characteristics and public transport network topologies. Cities with clear density peaks in their gradient plots indicate distinct urban centers requiring different transport strategies than those with more uniform density distributions. This methodology offers urban planners a cost-effective, globally applicable approach to preliminary public transport assessment using freely available satellite data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gustav Hanning, Gabrielle Flood, Viktor Larsson</p>
<p>Abstract: The standard approach for visual place recognition is to use global image descriptors to retrieve the most similar database images for a given query image. The results can then be further improved with re-ranking methods that re-order the top scoring images. However, existing methods focus on re-ranking based on the same image descriptors that were used for the initial retrieval, which we argue provides limited additional signal.
  In this work we propose Generalized Contextual Similarity Aggregation (GCSA), which is a graph neural network-based re-ranking method that, in addition to the visual descriptors, can leverage other types of available side information. This can for example be other sensor data (such as signal strength of nearby WiFi or BlueTooth endpoints) or geometric properties such as camera poses for database images. In many applications this information is already present or can be acquired with low effort. Our architecture leverages the concept of affinity vectors to allow for a shared encoding of the heterogeneous multi-modal input. Two large-scale datasets, covering both outdoor and indoor localization scenarios, are utilized for training and evaluation. In experiments we show significant improvement not only on image retrieval metrics, but also for the downstream visual localization task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Wang, Shiwei Zhang, Hangjie Yuan, Yujie Wei, Yingya Zhang, Changxin Gao, Yuehuan Wang, Nong Sang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in human image animation have been propelled by video diffusion models, yet their reliance on numerous iterative denoising steps results in high inference costs and slow speeds. An intuitive solution involves adopting consistency models, which serve as an effective acceleration paradigm through consistency distillation. However, simply employing this strategy in human image animation often leads to quality decline, including visual blurring, motion degradation, and facial distortion, particularly in dynamic regions. In this paper, we propose the DanceLCM approach complemented by several enhancements to improve visual quality and motion continuity at low-step regime: (1) segmented consistency distillation with an auxiliary light-weight head to incorporate supervision from real video latents, mitigating cumulative errors resulting from single full-trajectory generation; (2) a motion-focused loss to centre on motion regions, and explicit injection of facial fidelity features to improve face authenticity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DanceLCM achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art video diffusion models with a mere 2-4 inference steps, significantly reducing the inference burden without compromising video quality. The code and models will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahir Gulzar, Yar Muhammad, Naveed Muhammad</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting future trajectories of surrounding vehicles heavily relies on what contextual information is given to a motion prediction model. The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaan Aydin, Joelle Hanna, Damian Borth</p>
<p>Abstract: Earth observation satellites like Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) provide complementary remote sensing (RS) data, but S2 images are often unavailable due to cloud cover or data gaps. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)-based approach for SAR-to-RGB translation, generating synthetic optical images from SAR inputs. We explore three different setups: two using Standard Diffusion, which reconstruct S2 images by adding and removing noise (one without and one with class conditioning), and one using Cold Diffusion, which blends S2 with S1 before removing the SAR signal. We evaluate the generated images in downstream tasks, including land cover classification and cloud removal. While generated images may not perfectly replicate real S2 data, they still provide valuable information. Our results show that class conditioning improves classification accuracy, while cloud removal performance remains competitive despite our approach not being optimized for it. Interestingly, despite exhibiting lower perceptual quality, the Cold Diffusion setup performs well in land cover classification, suggesting that traditional quantitative evaluation metrics may not fully reflect the practical utility of generated images. Our findings highlight the potential of DMs for SAR-to-RGB translation in RS applications where RGB images are missing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haohan Chen, Hongjia Liu, Shiyong Lan, Wenwu Wang, Yixin Qiao, Yao Li, Guonan Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaze estimation, which predicts gaze direction, commonly faces the challenge of interference from complex gaze-irrelevant information in face images. In this work, we propose DMAGaze, a novel gaze estimation framework that exploits information from facial images in three aspects: gaze-relevant global features (disentangled from facial image), local eye features (extracted from cropped eye patch), and head pose estimation features, to improve overall performance. Firstly, we design a new continuous mask-based Disentangler to accurately disentangle gaze-relevant and gaze-irrelevant information in facial images by achieving the dual-branch disentanglement goal through separately reconstructing the eye and non-eye regions. Furthermore, we introduce a new cascaded attention module named Multi-Scale Global Local Attention Module (MS-GLAM). Through a customized cascaded attention structure, it effectively focuses on global and local information at multiple scales, further enhancing the information from the Disentangler. Finally, the global gaze-relevant features disentangled by the upper face branch, combined with head pose and local eye features, are passed through the detection head for high-precision gaze estimation. Our proposed DMAGaze has been extensively validated on two mainstream public datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenming Li, Chengxu Liu, Yuanting Fan, Xiao Jin, Xingsong Hou, Xueming Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently supervised learning rapidly develops in scene text segmentation. However, the lack of high-quality datasets and the high cost of pixel annotation greatly limit the development of them. Considering the well-performed few-shot learning methods for downstream tasks, we investigate the application of the few-shot learning method to scene text segmentation. We propose TSAL, which leverages CLIP's prior knowledge to learn text attributes for segmentation. To fully utilize the semantic and texture information in the image, a visual-guided branch is proposed to separately extract text and background features. To reduce data dependency and improve text detection accuracy, the adaptive prompt-guided branch employs effective adaptive prompt templates to capture various text attributes. To enable adaptive prompts capture distinctive text features and complex background distribution, we propose Adaptive Feature Alignment module(AFA). By aligning learnable tokens of different attributes with visual features and prompt prototypes, AFA enables adaptive prompts to capture both general and distinctive attribute information. TSAL can capture the unique attributes of text and achieve precise segmentation using only few images. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance on multiple text segmentation datasets under few-shot settings and show great potential in text-related domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linlin Xiao, Zhang Tiancong, Yutong Jia, Xinyu Nie, Mengyao Wang, Xiaohang Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, crop classification and health detection based on deep learning have gradually become a research hotspot. However, the existing target detection methods show poor performance when dealing with small targets in remote sensing images, especially in the case of complex background and image mixing, which is difficult to meet the practical application requirementsite. To address this problem, a novel target detection model YOLO-RS is proposed in this paper. The model is based on the latest Yolov11 which significantly enhances the detection of small targets by introducing the Context Anchor Attention (CAA) mechanism and an efficient multi-field multi-scale feature fusion network. YOLO-RS adopts a bidirectional feature fusion strategy in the feature fusion process, which effectively enhances the model's performance in the detection of small targets. Small target detection. Meanwhile, the ACmix module at the end of the model backbone network solves the category imbalance problem by adaptively adjusting the contrast and sample mixing, thus enhancing the detection accuracy in complex scenes. In the experiments on the PDT remote sensing crop health detection dataset and the CWC crop classification dataset, YOLO-RS improves both the recall and the mean average precision (mAP) by about 2-3\% or so compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, while the F1-score is also significantly improved. Moreover, the computational complexity of the model only increases by about 5.2 GFLOPs, indicating its significant advantages in both performance and efficiency. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and application potential of YOLO-RS in the task of detecting small targets in remote sensing images.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present TerraMind, the first any-to-any generative, multimodal foundation model for Earth observation (EO). Unlike other multimodal models, TerraMind is pretrained on dual-scale representations combining both token-level and pixel-level data across modalities. On a token level, TerraMind encodes high-level contextual information to learn cross-modal relationships, while on a pixel level, TerraMind leverages fine-grained representations to capture critical spatial nuances. We pretrained TerraMind on nine geospatial modalities of a global, large-scale dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that (i) TerraMind's dual-scale early fusion approach unlocks a range of zero-shot and few-shot applications for Earth observation, (ii) TerraMind introduces "Thinking-in-Modalities" (TiM) -- the capability of generating additional artificial data during finetuning and inference to improve the model output -- and (iii) TerraMind achieves beyond state-of-the-art performance in community-standard benchmarks for EO like PANGAEA.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Min Jung Lee, Dayoung Gong, Minsu Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: The exponential increase in video content poses significant challenges in terms of efficient navigation, search, and retrieval, thus requiring advanced video summarization techniques. Existing video summarization methods, which heavily rely on visual features and temporal dynamics, often fail to capture the semantics of video content, resulting in incomplete or incoherent summaries. To tackle the challenge, we propose a new video summarization framework that leverages the capabilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs), expecting that the knowledge learned from massive data enables LLMs to evaluate video frames in a manner that better aligns with diverse semantics and human judgments, effectively addressing the inherent subjectivity in defining keyframes. Our method, dubbed LLM-based Video Summarization (LLMVS), translates video frames into a sequence of captions using a Muti-modal Large Language Model (M-LLM) and then assesses the importance of each frame using an LLM, based on the captions in its local context. These local importance scores are refined through a global attention mechanism in the entire context of video captions, ensuring that our summaries effectively reflect both the details and the overarching narrative. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing ones in standard benchmarks, highlighting the potential of LLMs in the processing of multimedia content.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Focal Split, a handheld, snapshot depth camera with fully onboard power and computing based on depth-from-differential-defocus (DfDD). Focal Split is passive, avoiding power consumption of light sources. Its achromatic optical system simultaneously forms two differentially defocused images of the scene, which can be independently captured using two photosensors in a snapshot. The data processing is based on the DfDD theory, which efficiently computes a depth and a confidence value for each pixel with only 500 floating point operations (FLOPs) per pixel from the camera measurements. We demonstrate a Focal Split prototype, which comprises a handheld custom camera system connected to a Raspberry Pi 5 for real-time data processing. The system consumes 4.9 W and is powered on a 5 V, 10,000 mAh battery. The prototype can measure objects with distances from 0.4 m to 1.2 m, outputting 480$\times$360 sparse depth maps at 2.1 frames per second (FPS) using unoptimized Python scripts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeming wei, Junyi Lin, Yang Liu, Weixing Chen, Jingzhou Luo, Guanbin Li, Liang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning is essential in associating human instructions with the functional regions of 3D objects, facilitating precise, task-oriented manipulations in embodied AI. However, current methods, which predominantly depend on sparse 3D point clouds, exhibit limited generalizability and robustness due to their sensitivity to coordinate variations and the inherent sparsity of the data. By contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers high-fidelity, real-time rendering with minimal computational overhead by representing scenes as dense, continuous distributions. This positions 3DGS as a highly effective approach for capturing fine-grained affordance details and improving recognition accuracy. Nevertheless, its full potential remains largely untapped due to the absence of large-scale, 3DGS-specific affordance datasets. To overcome these limitations, we present 3DAffordSplat, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset tailored for 3DGS-based affordance reasoning. This dataset includes 23,677 Gaussian instances, 8,354 point cloud instances, and 6,631 manually annotated affordance labels, encompassing 21 object categories and 18 affordance types. Building upon this dataset, we introduce AffordSplatNet, a novel model specifically designed for affordance reasoning using 3DGS representations. AffordSplatNet features an innovative cross-modal structure alignment module that exploits structural consistency priors to align 3D point cloud and 3DGS representations, resulting in enhanced affordance recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the 3DAffordSplat dataset significantly advances affordance learning within the 3DGS domain, while AffordSplatNet consistently outperforms existing methods across both seen and unseen settings, highlighting its robust generalization capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingshun Huang, Haitao Lin, Tianyu Wang, Yanwei Fu, Xiangyang Xue, Yi Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper tackles category-level pose estimation of articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks and introduces a new benchmark dataset. While recent methods estimate part poses and sizes at the category level, they often rely on geometric cues and complex multi-stage pipelines that first segment parts from the point cloud, followed by Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) estimation for 6D poses. These approaches overlook dense semantic cues from RGB images, leading to suboptimal accuracy, particularly for objects with small parts. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage Network, CAP-Net, for estimating the 6D poses and sizes of Categorical Articulated Parts. This method combines RGB-D features to generate instance segmentation and NPCS representations for each part in an end-to-end manner. CAP-Net uses a unified network to simultaneously predict point-wise class labels, centroid offsets, and NPCS maps. A clustering algorithm then groups points of the same predicted class based on their estimated centroid distances to isolate each part. Finally, the NPCS region of each part is aligned with the point cloud to recover its final pose and size. To bridge the sim-to-real domain gap, we introduce the RGBD-Art dataset, the largest RGB-D articulated dataset to date, featuring photorealistic RGB images and depth noise simulated from real sensors. Experimental evaluations on the RGBD-Art dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach. Real-world deployments of our model in robotic tasks underscore its robustness and exceptional sim-to-real transfer capabilities, confirming its substantial practical utility. Our dataset, code and pre-trained models are available on the project page.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of information technology, modern warfare increasingly relies on intelligence, making small target detection critical in military applications. The growing demand for efficient, real-time detection has created challenges in identifying small targets in complex environments due to interference. To address this, we propose a small target detection method based on multi-modal image fusion and attention mechanisms.

The process begins with multi-modal dataset registration using feature point matching, ensuring accurate network training. By combining infrared and visible light features with attention mechanisms, the model improves detection accuracy and robustness. Experimental results on anti-UAV and Visdrone datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach, achieving superior detection results for small and dim targets.</p>

Prior work has solely focused on constrained multi-task settings where there is a one-to-one mapping between a sample and a task, overlooking the paradigm where multiple tasks may operate on the same sample, e.g., scene understanding. In this paper, we focus on the multi-task setting with single-input-multiple-outputs (SIMO) and show that it qualitatively differs from the single-input-single-output model merging settings studied in the literature due to the existence of task-specific decoders and diverse loss objectives. We identify that existing model merging methods lead to significant performance degradation, primarily due to representation misalignment between the merged encoder and task-specific decoders. We propose two simple and efficient fixes for the SIMO setting to re-align the feature representation after merging. Compared to joint fine-tuning, our approach is computationally effective and flexible, and sheds light into identifying task relationships in an offline manner. Experiments on NYUv2, Cityscapes, and a subset of the Taskonomy dataset demonstrate: (1) task arithmetic suffices to enable multi-task capabilities; however, the representations generated by the merged encoder has to be re-aligned with the task-specific heads; (2) the proposed architecture rivals traditional multi-task learning in performance but requires fewer samples and training steps by leveraging the existence of task-specific models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinning Chai, Yao Zhang, Yuxuan Zhang, Zhengxue Cheng, Yingsheng Qin, Yucai Yang, Li Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in efficient image super-resolution. However, for CNN-based methods, performance gains often require deeper networks and larger feature maps, which increase complexity and inference costs. Inspired by LoRA's success in fine-tuning large language models, we explore its application to lightweight models and propose Distillation-Supervised Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (DSCLoRA), which improves model performance without increasing architectural complexity or inference costs. Specifically, we integrate ConvLoRA into the efficient SR network SPAN by replacing the SPAB module with the proposed SConvLB module and incorporating ConvLoRA layers into both the pixel shuffle block and its preceding convolutional layer. DSCLoRA leverages low-rank decomposition for parameter updates and employs a spatial feature affinity-based knowledge distillation strategy to transfer second-order statistical information from teacher models (pre-trained SPAN) to student models (ours). This method preserves the core knowledge of lightweight models and facilitates optimal solution discovery under certain conditions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that DSCLoRA improves PSNR and SSIM over SPAN while maintaining its efficiency and competitive image quality. Notably, DSCLoRA ranked first in the Overall Performance Track of the NTIRE 2025 Efficient Super-Resolution Challenge.

<p>Abstract: This report presents UniAnimate-DiT, an advanced project that leverages the cutting-edge and powerful capabilities of the open-source Wan2.1 model for consistent human image animation. Specifically, to preserve the robust generative capabilities of the original Wan2.1 model, we implement Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique to fine-tune a minimal set of parameters, significantly reducing training memory overhead. A lightweight pose encoder consisting of multiple stacked 3D convolutional layers is designed to encode motion information of driving poses. Furthermore, we adopt a simple concatenation operation to integrate the reference appearance into the model and incorporate the pose information of the reference image for enhanced pose alignment. Experimental results show that our approach achieves visually appearing and temporally consistent high-fidelity animations. Trained on 480p (832x480) videos, UniAnimate-DiT demonstrates strong generalization capabilities to seamlessly upscale to 720P (1280x720) during inference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeongmin Kim, Sotiris Anagnostidis, Yuming Du, Edgar Sch\"onfeld, Jonas Kohler, Markos Georgopoulos, Albert Pumarola, Ali Thabet, Artsiom Sanakoyeu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models with transformer architectures have demonstrated promising capabilities in generating high-fidelity images and scalability for high resolution. However, iterative sampling process required for synthesis is very resource-intensive. A line of work has focused on distilling solutions to probability flow ODEs into few-step student models. Nevertheless, existing methods have been limited by their reliance on the most recent denoised samples as input, rendering them susceptible to exposure bias. To address this limitation, we propose AutoRegressive Distillation (ARD), a novel approach that leverages the historical trajectory of the ODE to predict future steps. ARD offers two key benefits: 1) it mitigates exposure bias by utilizing a predicted historical trajectory that is less susceptible to accumulated errors, and 2) it leverages the previous history of the ODE trajectory as a more effective source of coarse-grained information. ARD modifies the teacher transformer architecture by adding token-wise time embedding to mark each input from the trajectory history and employs a block-wise causal attention mask for training. Furthermore, incorporating historical inputs only in lower transformer layers enhances performance and efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of ARD in a class-conditioned generation on ImageNet and T2I synthesis. Our model achieves a $5\times$ reduction in FID degradation compared to the baseline methods while requiring only 1.1\% extra FLOPs on ImageNet-256. Moreover, ARD reaches FID of 1.84 on ImageNet-256 in merely 4 steps and outperforms the publicly available 1024p text-to-image distilled models in prompt adherence score with a minimal drop in FID compared to the teacher.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jincheng Kang, Yi Cen, Yigang Cen, Ke Wang, Yuhan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Wood defect detection is critical for ensuring quality control in the wood processing industry. However, current industrial applications face two major challenges: traditional methods are costly, subjective, and labor-intensive, while mainstream deep learning models often struggle to balance detection accuracy and computational efficiency for edge deployment. To address these issues, this study proposes CFIS-YOLO, a lightweight object detection model optimized for edge devices. The model introduces an enhanced C2f structure, a dynamic feature recombination module, and a novel loss function that incorporates auxiliary bounding boxes and angular constraints. These innovations improve multi-scale feature fusion and small object localization while significantly reducing computational overhead. Evaluated on a public wood defect dataset, CFIS-YOLO achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 77.5\%, outperforming the baseline YOLOv10s by 4 percentage points. On SOPHON BM1684X edge devices, CFIS-YOLO delivers 135 FPS, reduces power consumption to 17.3\% of the original implementation, and incurs only a 0.5 percentage point drop in mAP. These results demonstrate that CFIS-YOLO is a practical and effective solution for real-world wood defect detection in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trinnhallen Brisley, Aryan Gandhi, Joseph Magen</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new approach to matching mechanism for palmprint recognition by introducing a Relative Similarity Metric (RSM) that enhances the robustness and discriminability of existing matching frameworks. While conventional systems rely on direct pairwise similarity measures, such as cosine or Euclidean distances, these metrics fail to capture how a pairwise similarity compares within the context of the entire dataset. Our method addresses this by evaluating the relative consistency of similarity scores across up to all identities, allowing for better suppression of false positives and negatives. Applied atop the CCNet architecture, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art 0.000036% Equal Error Rate (EER) on the Tongji dataset, outperforming previous methods and demonstrating the efficacy of incorporating relational structure into the palmprint matching process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sonia Laguna, Lin Zhang, Can Deniz Bezek, Monika Farkas, Dieter Schweizer, Rahel A. Kubik-Huch, Orcun Goksel</p>
<p>Abstract: Speed-of-sound (SoS) is a biomechanical characteristic of tissue, and its imaging can provide a promising biomarker for diagnosis. Reconstructing SoS images from ultrasound acquisitions can be cast as a limited-angle computed-tomography problem, with Variational Networks being a promising model-based deep learning solution. Some acquired data frames may, however, get corrupted by noise due to, e.g., motion, lack of contact, and acoustic shadows, which in turn negatively affects the resulting SoS reconstructions. We propose to use the uncertainty in SoS reconstructions to attribute trust to each individual acquired frame. Given multiple acquisitions, we then use an uncertainty based automatic selection among these retrospectively, to improve diagnostic decisions. We investigate uncertainty estimation based on Monte Carlo Dropout and Bayesian Variational Inference. We assess our automatic frame selection method for differential diagnosis of breast cancer, distinguishing between benign fibroadenoma and malignant carcinoma. We evaluate 21 lesions classified as BI-RADS~4, which represents suspicious cases for probable malignancy. The most trustworthy frame among four acquisitions of each lesion was identified using uncertainty based criteria. Selecting a frame informed by uncertainty achieved an area under curve of 76% and 80% for Monte Carlo Dropout and Bayesian Variational Inference, respectively, superior to any uncertainty-uninformed baselines with the best one achieving 64%. A novel use of uncertainty estimation is proposed for selecting one of multiple data acquisitions for further processing and decision making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongbo Li, Shangchao Yang, Ruiyang Xia, Lin Yuan, Xinbo Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: As deepfake technologies continue to advance, passive detection methods struggle to generalize with various forgery manipulations and datasets. Proactive defense techniques have been actively studied with the primary aim of preventing deepfake operation effectively working. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between passive detection and proactive defense, and seek to solve the detection problem utilizing a proactive methodology. Inspired by several watermarking-based forensic methods, we explore a novel detection framework based on the concept of ``hiding a learnable face within a face''. Specifically, relying on a semi-fragile invertible steganography network, a secret template image is embedded into a host image imperceptibly, acting as an indicator monitoring for any malicious image forgery when being restored by the inverse steganography process. Instead of being manually specified, the secret template is optimized during training to resemble a neutral facial appearance, just like a ``big brother'' hidden in the image to be protected. By incorporating a self-blending mechanism and robustness learning strategy with a simulative transmission channel, a robust detector is built to accurately distinguish if the steganographic image is maliciously tampered or benignly processed. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over competing passive and proactive detection methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayong Liu, Qingrui Zhang, Zeyang Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-target tracking and detection tasks, it is necessary to continuously track multiple targets, such as vehicles, pedestrians, etc. To achieve this goal, the system must be able to continuously acquire and process image frames containing these targets. These consecutive frame images enable the algorithm to update the position and state of the target in real-time in each frame of the image. How to accurately associate the detected target with the target in the previous or next frame to form a stable trajectory is a complex problem. Therefore, a multi object tracking and detection method for intelligent driving vehicles based on YOLOv5 and point cloud 3D projection is proposed. Using Retinex algorithm to enhance the image of the environment in front of the vehicle, remove light interference in the image, and build an intelligent detection model based on YOLOv5 network structure. The enhanced image is input into the model, and multiple targets in front of the vehicle are identified through feature extraction and target localization. By combining point cloud 3D projection technology, the correlation between the position changes of adjacent frame images in the projection coordinate system can be inferred. By sequentially projecting the multi-target recognition results of multiple consecutive frame images into the 3D laser point cloud environment, effective tracking of the motion trajectories of all targets in front of the vehicle can be achieved. The experimental results show that the application of this method for intelligent driving vehicle front multi-target tracking and detection yields a MOTA (Tracking Accuracy) value greater than 30, demonstrating its superior tracking and detection performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Seedream 3.0, a high-performance Chinese-English bilingual image generation foundation model. We develop several technical improvements to address existing challenges in Seedream 2.0, including alignment with complicated prompts, fine-grained typography generation, suboptimal visual aesthetics and fidelity, and limited image resolutions. Specifically, the advancements of Seedream 3.0 stem from improvements across the entire pipeline, from data construction to model deployment. At the data stratum, we double the dataset using a defect-aware training paradigm and a dual-axis collaborative data-sampling framework. Furthermore, we adopt several effective techniques such as mixed-resolution training, cross-modality RoPE, representation alignment loss, and resolution-aware timestep sampling in the pre-training phase. During the post-training stage, we utilize diversified aesthetic captions in SFT, and a VLM-based reward model with scaling, thereby achieving outputs that well align with human preferences. Furthermore, Seedream 3.0 pioneers a novel acceleration paradigm. By employing consistent noise expectation and importance-aware timestep sampling, we achieve a 4 to 8 times speedup while maintaining image quality. Seedream 3.0 demonstrates significant improvements over Seedream 2.0: it enhances overall capabilities, in particular for text-rendering in complicated Chinese characters which is important to professional typography generation. In addition, it provides native high-resolution output (up to 2K), allowing it to generate images with high visual quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soyoung Yoo, Namwoo Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven design is emerging as a powerful strategy to accelerate engineering innovation. However, its application to vehicle wheel design remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets that include 3D geometry and physical performance metrics. To address this gap, this study proposes a synthetic design-performance dataset generation framework using generative AI. The proposed framework first generates 2D rendered images using Stable Diffusion, and then reconstructs the 3D geometry through 2.5D depth estimation. Structural simulations are subsequently performed to extract engineering performance data. To further expand the design and performance space, topology optimization is applied, enabling the generation of a more diverse set of wheel designs. The final dataset, named DeepWheel, consists of over 6,000 photo-realistic images and 900 structurally analyzed 3D models. This multi-modal dataset serves as a valuable resource for surrogate model training, data-driven inverse design, and design space exploration. The proposed methodology is also applicable to other complex design domains.

<p>Abstract: Wheat accounts for approximately 20% of the world's caloric intake, making it a vital component of global food security. Given this importance, mapping wheat fields plays a crucial role in enabling various stakeholders, including policy makers, researchers, and agricultural organizations, to make informed decisions regarding food security, supply chain management, and resource allocation. In this paper, we tackle the problem of accurately mapping wheat fields out of satellite images by introducing an improved pipeline for winter wheat segmentation, as well as presenting a case study on a decade-long analysis of wheat mapping in Lebanon. We integrate a Temporal Spatial Vision Transformer (TSViT) with Parameter-Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) and a novel post-processing pipeline based on the Fields of The World (FTW) framework. Our proposed pipeline addresses key challenges encountered in existing approaches, such as the clustering of small agricultural parcels in a single large field. By merging wheat segmentation with precise field boundary extraction, our method produces geometrically coherent and semantically rich maps that enable us to perform in-depth analysis such as tracking crop rotation pattern over years. Extensive evaluations demonstrate improved boundary delineation and field-level precision, establishing the potential of the proposed framework in operational agricultural monitoring and historical trend analysis. By allowing for accurate mapping of wheat fields, this work lays the foundation for a range of critical studies and future advances, including crop monitoring and yield estimation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11368">From Gaze to Insight: Bridging Human Visual Attention and Vision Language Model Explanation for Weakly-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingkun Chen, Haoran Duan, Xiao Zhang, Boyan Gao, Tao Tan, Vicente Grau, Jungong Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation remains challenging due to the high cost of pixel-level annotations for training. In the context of weak supervision, clinician gaze data captures regions of diagnostic interest; however, its sparsity limits its use for segmentation. In contrast, vision-language models (VLMs) provide semantic context through textual descriptions but lack the explanation precision required. Recognizing that neither source alone suffices, we propose a teacher-student framework that integrates both gaze and language supervision, leveraging their complementary strengths. Our key insight is that gaze data indicates where clinicians focus during diagnosis, while VLMs explain why those regions are significant. To implement this, the teacher model first learns from gaze points enhanced by VLM-generated descriptions of lesion morphology, establishing a foundation for guiding the student model. The teacher then directs the student through three strategies: (1) Multi-scale feature alignment to fuse visual cues with textual semantics; (2) Confidence-weighted consistency constraints to focus on reliable predictions; (3) Adaptive masking to limit error propagation in uncertain areas. Experiments on the Kvasir-SEG, NCI-ISBI, and ISIC datasets show that our method achieves Dice scores of 80.78%, 80.53%, and 84.22%, respectively-improving 3-5% over gaze baselines without increasing the annotation burden. By preserving correlations among predictions, gaze data, and lesion descriptions, our framework also maintains clinical interpretability. This work illustrates how integrating human visual attention with AI-generated semantic context can effectively overcome the limitations of individual weak supervision signals, thereby advancing the development of deployable, annotation-efficient medical AI systems.

<p>Abstract: $360^{\circ}$ omnidirectional images (ODIs) have gained considerable attention recently, and are widely used in various virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications. However, capturing such images is expensive and requires specialized equipment, making ODI synthesis increasingly important. While common 2D image generation and editing methods are rapidly advancing, these models struggle to deliver satisfactory results when generating or editing ODIs due to the unique format and broad 360$^{\circ}$ Field-of-View (FoV) of ODIs. To bridge this gap, we construct \textbf{\textit{Any2Omni}}, the first comprehensive ODI generation-editing dataset comprises 60,000+ training data covering diverse input conditions and up to 9 ODI generation and editing tasks. Built upon Any2Omni, we propose an \textbf{\underline{Omni}} model for \textbf{\underline{Omni}}-directional image generation and editing (\textbf{\textit{Omni$^2$}}), with the capability of handling various ODI generation and editing tasks under diverse input conditions using one model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed Omni$^2$ model for both the ODI generation and editing tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felipe Crispim Salvagnini, Jancarlo F. Gomes, Cid A. N. Santos, Silvio Jamil F. Guimar\~aes, Alexandre X. Falc\~ao</p>
<p>Abstract: The necessity of abundant annotated data and complex network architectures presents a significant challenge in deep-learning Salient Object Detection (deep SOD) and across the broader deep-learning landscape. This challenge is particularly acute in medical applications in developing countries with limited computational resources. Combining modern and classical techniques offers a path to maintaining competitive performance while enabling practical applications. Feature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM) methodology empowers experts to design convolutional encoders through user-drawn markers, with filters learned directly from these annotations. Recent findings demonstrate that coupling a FLIM encoder with an adaptive decoder creates a flyweight network suitable for SOD, requiring significantly fewer parameters than lightweight models and eliminating the need for backpropagation. Cellular Automata (CA) methods have proven successful in data-scarce scenarios but require proper initialization -- typically through user input, priors, or randomness. We propose a practical intersection of these approaches: using FLIM networks to initialize CA states with expert knowledge without requiring user interaction for each image. By decoding features from each level of a FLIM network, we can initialize multiple CAs simultaneously, creating a multi-level framework. Our method leverages the hierarchical knowledge encoded across different network layers, merging multiple saliency maps into a high-quality final output that functions as a CA ensemble. Benchmarks across two challenging medical datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of our multi-level CA approach compared to established models in the deep SOD literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolette Pedersen, Regitze Sydendal, Andreas Wulff, Ralf Raumanns, Eike Petersen, Veronika Cheplygina</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has been reported to achieve high performances in the detection of skin cancer, yet many challenges regarding the reproducibility of results and biases remain. This study is a replication (different data, same analysis) of a study on Alzheimer's disease [28] which studied robustness of logistic regression (LR) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) across patient sexes. We explore sex bias in skin cancer detection, using the PAD-UFES-20 dataset with LR trained on handcrafted features reflecting dermatological guidelines (ABCDE and the 7-point checklist), and a pre-trained ResNet-50 model. We evaluate these models in alignment with [28]: across multiple training datasets with varied sex composition to determine their robustness. Our results show that both the LR and the CNN were robust to the sex distributions, but the results also revealed that the CNN had a significantly higher accuracy (ACC) and area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) for male patients than for female patients. We hope these findings to contribute to the growing field of investigating potential bias in popular medical machine learning methods. The data and relevant scripts to reproduce our results can be found in our Github.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Panagiotis Agrafiotis, Beg\"um Demir</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and high-frequent bathymetry is crucial for shallow seabed areas facing intense climatological and anthropogenic pressures. Current methods utilizing airborne or satellite optical imagery to derive bathymetry primarily rely on either SfM-MVS with refraction correction or Spectrally Derived Bathymetry (SDB). However, SDB methods often require extensive manual fieldwork or costly reference data, while SfM-MVS approaches face challenges even after refraction correction. These include depth data gaps and noise in environments with homogeneous visual textures, which hinder the creation of accurate and complete Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of the seabed. To address these challenges, this work introduces a methodology that combines the high-fidelity 3D reconstruction capabilities of the SfM-MVS methods with state-of-the-art refraction correction techniques, along with the spectral analysis capabilities of a new deep learning-based method for bathymetry prediction. This integration enables a synergistic approach where SfM-MVS derived DSMs with data gaps are used as training data to generate complete bathymetric maps. In this context, we propose Swin-BathyUNet that combines U-Net with Swin Transformer self-attention layers and a cross-attention mechanism, specifically tailored for SDB. Swin-BathyUNet is designed to improve bathymetric accuracy by capturing long-range spatial relationships and can also function as a standalone solution for standard SDB with various training depth data, independent of the SfM-MVS output. Experimental results in two completely different test sites in the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through extensive experiments that demonstrate improvements in bathymetric accuracy, detail, coverage, and noise reduction in the predicted DSM.

<p>Abstract: The increasing availability of intraoral scanning devices has heightened their importance in modern clinical orthodontics. Clinicians utilize advanced Computer-Aided Design techniques to create patient-specific treatment plans that include laboriously identifying crucial landmarks such as cusps, mesial-distal locations, facial axis points, and tooth-gingiva boundaries. Detecting such landmarks automatically presents challenges, including limited dataset sizes, significant anatomical variability among subjects, and the geometric nature of the data. We present our experiments from the 3DTeethLand Grand Challenge at MICCAI 2024. Our method leverages recent advancements in point cloud learning through transformer architectures. We designed a Point Transformer v3 inspired module to capture meaningful geometric and anatomical features, which are processed by a lightweight decoder to predict per-point distances, further processed by graph-based non-minima suppression. We report promising results and discuss insights on learned feature interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dazhong Shen, Guanglu Song, Yi Zhang, Bingqi Ma, Lujundong Li, Dongzhi Jiang, Zhuofan Zong, Yu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved outstanding image generation by reversing a forward noising process to approximate true data distributions. During training, these models predict diffusion scores from noised versions of true samples in a single forward pass, while inference requires iterative denoising starting from white noise. This training-inference divergences hinder the alignment between inference and training data distributions, due to potential prediction biases and cumulative error accumulation. To address this problem, we propose an intuitive but effective fine-tuning framework, called Adversarial Diffusion Tuning (ADT), by stimulating the inference process during optimization and aligning the final outputs with training data by adversarial supervision. Specifically, to achieve robust adversarial training, ADT features a siamese-network discriminator with a fixed pre-trained backbone and lightweight trainable parameters, incorporates an image-to-image sampling strategy to smooth discriminative difficulties, and preserves the original diffusion loss to prevent discriminator hacking. In addition, we carefully constrain the backward-flowing path for back-propagating gradients along the inference path without incurring memory overload or gradient explosion. Finally, extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion models (v1.5, XL, and v3), demonstrate that ADT significantly improves both distribution alignment and image quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Surface normal estimation serves as a cornerstone for a spectrum of computer vision applications. While numerous efforts have been devoted to static image scenarios, ensuring temporal coherence in video-based normal estimation remains a formidable challenge. Instead of merely augmenting existing methods with temporal components, we present NormalCrafter to leverage the inherent temporal priors of video diffusion models. To secure high-fidelity normal estimation across sequences, we propose Semantic Feature Regularization (SFR), which aligns diffusion features with semantic cues, encouraging the model to concentrate on the intrinsic semantics of the scene. Moreover, we introduce a two-stage training protocol that leverages both latent and pixel space learning to preserve spatial accuracy while maintaining long temporal context. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our method, showcasing a superior performance in generating temporally consistent normal sequences with intricate details from diverse videos.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Ding, Xixi Liu, Jonas Unger, Gabriel Eilertsen</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the safe deployment of machine learning models. Recent advances have explored improved classification losses and representation learning strategies to enhance OOD detection. However, these methods are often tailored to specific post-hoc detection techniques, limiting their generalizability. In this work, we identify a critical issue in Logit Normalization (LogitNorm), which inhibits its effectiveness in improving certain post-hoc OOD detection methods. To address this, we propose Extended Logit Normalization ($\textbf{ELogitNorm}$), a novel hyperparameter-free formulation that significantly benefits a wide range of post-hoc detection methods. By incorporating feature distance-awareness to LogitNorm, $\textbf{ELogitNorm}$ shows more robust OOD separability and in-distribution (ID) confidence calibration than its predecessor. Extensive experiments across standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art training-time methods in OOD detection while maintaining strong ID classification accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elizabeth Fons, Rachneet Kaur, Zhen Zeng, Soham Palande, Tucker Balch, Svitlana Vyetrenko, Manuela Veloso</p>
<p>Abstract: While image captioning has gained significant attention, the potential of captioning time-series images, prevalent in areas like finance and healthcare, remains largely untapped. Existing time-series captioning methods typically offer generic, domain-agnostic descriptions of time-series shapes and struggle to adapt to new domains without substantial retraining. To address these limitations, we introduce TADACap, a retrieval-based framework to generate domain-aware captions for time-series images, capable of adapting to new domains without retraining. Building on TADACap, we propose a novel retrieval strategy that retrieves diverse image-caption pairs from a target domain database, namely TADACap-diverse. We benchmarked TADACap-diverse against state-of-the-art methods and ablation variants. TADACap-diverse demonstrates comparable semantic accuracy while requiring significantly less annotation effort.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> An Zhaol, Shengyuan Zhang, Ling Yang, Zejian Li, Jiale Wu, Haoran Xu, AnYang Wei, Perry Pengyun GU Lingyun Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of diffusion models in 3D LiDAR scene completion is limited due to diffusion's slow sampling speed. Score distillation accelerates diffusion sampling but with performance degradation, while post-training with direct policy optimization (DPO) boosts performance using preference data. This paper proposes Distillation-DPO, a novel diffusion distillation framework for LiDAR scene completion with preference aligment. First, the student model generates paired completion scenes with different initial noises. Second, using LiDAR scene evaluation metrics as preference, we construct winning and losing sample pairs. Such construction is reasonable, since most LiDAR scene metrics are informative but non-differentiable to be optimized directly. Third, Distillation-DPO optimizes the student model by exploiting the difference in score functions between the teacher and student models on the paired completion scenes. Such procedure is repeated until convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art LiDAR scene completion diffusion models, Distillation-DPO achieves higher-quality scene completion while accelerating the completion speed by more than 5-fold. Our method is the first to explore adopting preference learning in distillation to the best of our knowledge and provide insights into preference-aligned distillation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghua Liu, Mikaela Angelina Uy, Donglai Xiang, Hao Su, Sanja Fidler, Nicholas Sharp, Jun Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose PartField, a feedforward approach for learning part-based 3D features, which captures the general concept of parts and their hierarchy without relying on predefined templates or text-based names, and can be applied to open-world 3D shapes across various modalities. PartField requires only a 3D feedforward pass at inference time, significantly improving runtime and robustness compared to prior approaches. Our model is trained by distilling 2D and 3D part proposals from a mix of labeled datasets and image segmentations on large unsupervised datasets, via a contrastive learning formulation. It produces a continuous feature field which can be clustered to yield a hierarchical part decomposition. Comparisons show that PartField is up to 20% more accurate and often orders of magnitude faster than other recent class-agnostic part-segmentation methods. Beyond single-shape part decomposition, consistency in the learned field emerges across shapes, enabling tasks such as co-segmentation and correspondence, which we demonstrate in several applications of these general-purpose, hierarchical, and consistent 3D feature fields.

<p>Abstract: This work presents SimpleAR, a vanilla autoregressive visual generation framework without complex architecure modifications. Through careful exploration of training and inference optimization, we demonstrate that: 1) with only 0.5B parameters, our model can generate 1024x1024 resolution images with high fidelity, and achieve competitive results on challenging text-to-image benchmarks, e.g., 0.59 on GenEval and 79.66 on DPG; 2) both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training could lead to significant improvements on generation aesthectics and prompt alignment; and 3) when optimized with inference acceleraton techniques like vLLM, the time for SimpleAR to generate an 1024x1024 image could be reduced to around 14 seconds.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Pang, Xin Xu, Yu-Xiong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the success of image generation, generative diffusion models are increasingly adopted for discriminative tasks, as pixel generation provides a unified perception interface. However, directly repurposing the generative denoising process for discriminative objectives reveals critical gaps rarely addressed previously. Generative models tolerate intermediate sampling errors if the final distribution remains plausible, but discriminative tasks require rigorous accuracy throughout, as evidenced in challenging multi-modal tasks like referring image segmentation. Motivated by this gap, we analyze and enhance alignment between generative diffusion processes and perception tasks, focusing on how perception quality evolves during denoising. We find: (1) earlier denoising steps contribute disproportionately to perception quality, prompting us to propose tailored learning objectives reflecting varying timestep contributions; (2) later denoising steps show unexpected perception degradation, highlighting sensitivity to training-denoising distribution shifts, addressed by our diffusion-tailored data augmentation; and (3) generative processes uniquely enable interactivity, serving as controllable user interfaces adaptable to correctional prompts in multi-round interactions. Our insights significantly improve diffusion-based perception models without architectural changes, achieving state-of-the-art performance on depth estimation, referring image segmentation, and generalist perception tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangru Zhu, Penglei Sun, Yaoxian Song, Yanghua Xiao, Zhixu Li, Chengyu Wang, Jun Huang, Bei Yang, Xiaoxiao Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate interpretation and visualization of human instructions are crucial for text-to-image (T2I) synthesis. However, current models struggle to capture semantic variations from word order changes, and existing evaluations, relying on indirect metrics like text-image similarity, fail to reliably assess these challenges. This often obscures poor performance on complex or uncommon linguistic patterns by the focus on frequent word combinations. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel metric called SemVarEffect and a benchmark named SemVarBench, designed to evaluate the causality between semantic variations in inputs and outputs in T2I synthesis. Semantic variations are achieved through two types of linguistic permutations, while avoiding easily predictable literal variations. Experiments reveal that the CogView-3-Plus and Ideogram 2 performed the best, achieving a score of 0.2/1. Semantic variations in object relations are less understood than attributes, scoring 0.07/1 compared to 0.17-0.19/1. We found that cross-modal alignment in UNet or Transformers plays a crucial role in handling semantic variations, a factor previously overlooked by a focus on textual encoders. Our work establishes an effective evaluation framework that advances the T2I synthesis community's exploration of human instruction understanding. Our benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/zhuxiangru/SemVarBench .</p>

<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a predominant health concern globally, emphasizing the need for advanced diagnostic techniques. In our research, we present an avant-garde methodology that synergistically integrates ECG readings and retinal fundus images to facilitate the early disease tagging as well as triaging of the CVDs in the order of disease priority. Recognizing the intricate vascular network of the retina as a reflection of the cardiovascular system, alongwith the dynamic cardiac insights from ECG, we sought to provide a holistic diagnostic perspective. Initially, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to both the ECG and fundus images, transforming the data into the frequency domain. Subsequently, the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) was computed for the frequency-domain features of both modalities. These EMD values were then concatenated, forming a comprehensive feature set that was fed into a Neural Network classifier. This approach, leveraging the FFT's spectral insights and EMD's capability to capture nuanced data differences, offers a robust representation for CVD classification. Preliminary tests yielded a commendable accuracy of 84 percent, underscoring the potential of this combined diagnostic strategy. As we continue our research, we anticipate refining and validating the model further to enhance its clinical applicability in resource limited healthcare ecosystems prevalent across the Indian sub-continent and also the world at large.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image retrieval remains a challenging task due to the complex interaction between human visual perception, memory, and computational processes. Current image search engines often struggle to efficiently retrieve images based on natural language descriptions, as they rely on time-consuming preprocessing, tagging, and machine learning pipelines. This paper introduces the Human-Oriented Retrieval Search Engine for Images (HORSE), a novel approach that leverages neuro-symbolic indexing to improve image retrieval by focusing on human-oriented indexing. By integrating cognitive science insights with advanced computational techniques, HORSE enhances the retrieval process, making it more aligned with how humans perceive, store, and recall visual information. The neuro-symbolic framework combines the strengths of neural networks and symbolic reasoning, mitigating their individual limitations. The proposed system optimizes image retrieval, offering a more intuitive and efficient solution for users. We discuss the design and implementation of HORSE, highlight its potential applications in fields such as design error detection and knowledge management, and suggest future directions for research to further refine the system's metrics and capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural networks are fundamental in artificial intelligence, driving progress in computer vision and natural language processing. High-quality datasets are crucial for their development, and there is growing interest in datasets composed of neural networks themselves to support benchmarking, automated machine learning (AutoML), and model analysis. We introduce LEMUR, an open source dataset of neural network models with well-structured code for diverse architectures across tasks such as object detection, image classification, segmentation, and natural language processing. LEMUR is primarily designed to enable fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) for AutoML tasks, providing a rich source of structured model representations and associated performance data. Leveraging Python and PyTorch, LEMUR enables seamless extension to new datasets and models while maintaining consistency. It integrates an Optuna-powered framework for evaluation, hyperparameter optimization, statistical analysis, and graphical insights. LEMUR provides an extension that enables models to run efficiently on edge devices, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments. Providing tools for model evaluation, preprocessing, and database management, LEMUR supports researchers and practitioners in developing, testing, and analyzing neural networks. Additionally, it offers an API that delivers comprehensive information about neural network models and their complete performance statistics with a single request, which can be used in experiments with code-generating large language models. The LEMUR will be released as an open source project under the MIT license upon acceptance of the paper.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-resolution, near-ground wind-speed data are critical for improving the accuracy of weather predictions and climate models,$^{1-3}$ supporting wildfire control efforts,$^{4-7}$ and ensuring the safe passage of airplanes during takeoff and landing maneouvers.$^{8,9}$ Quantitative wind speed anemometry generally employs on-site instrumentation for accurate single-position data or sophisticated remote techniques such as Doppler radar for quantitative field measurements. It is widely recognized that the wind-induced motion of vegetation depends in a complex manner on their structure and mechanical properties, obviating their use in quantitative anemometry.$^{10-14}$ We analyze measurements on a host of different vegetation showing that leaf motion can be decoupled from the leaf's branch and support structure, at low-to-moderate wind speed, $U_{wind}$. This wind speed range is characterized by a leaf Reynolds number, enabling the development of a remote, quantitative anemometry method based on the formula, $U_{wind}\approx740\sqrt{{\mu}U_{leaf}/{\rho}D}$, that relies only on the leaf size $D$, its measured fluctuating (RMS) speed $U_{leaf}$, the air viscosity $\mu$, and its mass density $\rho$. This formula is corroborated by a first-principles model and validated using a host of laboratory and field tests on diverse vegetation types, ranging from oak, olive, and magnolia trees through to camphor and bullgrass. The findings of this study open the door to a new paradigm in anemometry, using natural vegetation to enable remote and rapid quantitative field measurements at global locations with minimal cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: Explanations for computer vision models are important tools for interpreting how the underlying models work. However, they are often presented in static formats, which pose challenges for users, including information overload, a gap between semantic and pixel-level information, and limited opportunities for exploration. We investigate interactivity as a mechanism for tackling these issues in three common explanation types: heatmap-based, concept-based, and prototype-based explanations. We conducted a study (N=24), using a bird identification task, involving participants with diverse technical and domain expertise. We found that while interactivity enhances user control, facilitates rapid convergence to relevant information, and allows users to expand their understanding of the model and explanation, it also introduces new challenges. To address these, we provide design recommendations for interactive computer vision explanations, including carefully selected default views, independent input controls, and constrained output spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huseyin Tuna Erdinc, Yunlin Zeng, Abhinav Prakash Gahlot, Felix J. Herrmann</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a score-based generative algorithm for sampling from power-scaled priors and likelihoods within the Bayesian inference framework. Our algorithm enables flexible control over prior-likelihood influence without requiring retraining for different power-scaling configurations. Specifically, we focus on synthesizing seismic velocity models conditioned on imaged seismic. Our method enables sensitivity analysis by sampling from intermediate power posteriors, allowing us to assess the relative influence of the prior and likelihood on samples of the posterior distribution. Through a comprehensive set of experiments, we evaluate the effects of varying the power parameter in different settings: applying it solely to the prior, to the likelihood of a Bayesian formulation, and to both simultaneously. The results show that increasing the power of the likelihood up to a certain threshold improves the fidelity of posterior samples to the conditioning data (e.g., seismic images), while decreasing the prior power promotes greater structural diversity among samples. Moreover, we find that moderate scaling of the likelihood leads to a reduced shot data residual, confirming its utility in posterior refinement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kelum Gajamannage, Dilhani I. Jayathilake, Maria Vasilyeva</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing images are widely utilized in many disciplines such as feature recognition and scene semantic segmentation. However, due to environmental factors and the issues of the imaging system, the image quality is often degraded which may impair subsequent visual tasks. Even though denoising remote sensing images plays an essential role before applications, the current denoising algorithms fail to attain optimum performance since these images possess complex features in the texture. Denoising frameworks based on artificial neural networks have shown better performance; however, they require exhaustive training with heterogeneous samples that extensively consume resources like power, memory, computation, and latency. Thus, here we present a computationally efficient and robust remote sensing image denoising method that doesn't require additional training samples. This method partitions patches of a remote-sensing image in which a low-rank manifold, representing the noise-free version of the image, underlies the patch space. An efficient and robust approach to revealing this manifold is a randomized approximation of the singular value spectrum of the geodesics' Gramian matrix of the patch space. The method asserts a unique emphasis on each color channel during denoising so the three denoised channels are merged to produce the final image.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubham Kumar, Dwip Dalal, Narendra Ahuja</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-hoc, unsupervised concept-based explanation methods (U-CBEMs) are a promising tool for generating semantic explanations of the decision-making processes in deep neural networks, having applications in both model improvement and understanding. It is vital that the explanation is accurate, or faithful, to the model, yet we identify several limitations of prior faithfulness metrics that inhibit an accurate evaluation; most notably, prior metrics involve only the set of concepts present, ignoring how they may be spatially distributed. We address these limitations with Surrogate Faithfulness (SF), an evaluation method that introduces a spatially-aware surrogate and two novel faithfulness metrics. Using SF, we produce Optimally Faithful (OF) explanations, where concepts are found that maximize faithfulness. Our experiments show that (1) adding spatial-awareness to prior U-CBEMs increases faithfulness in all cases; (2) OF produces significantly more faithful explanations than prior U-CBEMs (30% or higher improvement in error); (3) OF's learned concepts generalize well to out-of-domain data and are more robust to adversarial examples, where prior U-CBEMs struggle.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robotic grasping is a cornerstone capability of embodied systems. Many methods directly output grasps from partial information without modeling the geometry of the scene, leading to suboptimal motion and even collisions. To address these issues, we introduce ZeroGrasp, a novel framework that simultaneously performs 3D reconstruction and grasp pose prediction in near real-time. A key insight of our method is that occlusion reasoning and modeling the spatial relationships between objects is beneficial for both accurate reconstruction and grasping. We couple our method with a novel large-scale synthetic dataset, which comprises 1M photo-realistic images, high-resolution 3D reconstructions and 11.3B physically-valid grasp pose annotations for 12K objects from the Objaverse-LVIS dataset. We evaluate ZeroGrasp on the GraspNet-1B benchmark as well as through real-world robot experiments. ZeroGrasp achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes to novel real-world objects by leveraging synthetic data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Yang, Haiming Zhu, Rihui Zhang, Haipeng Zhang, Jianliang Wang, Chunhao Wang, Minbin Chen, Fang-Fang Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Deep learning has significantly advanced medical image analysis, with Vision Transformers (ViTs) offering a powerful alternative to convolutional models by modeling long-range dependencies through self-attention. However, ViTs are inherently data-intensive and lack domain-specific inductive biases, limiting their applicability in medical imaging. In contrast, radiomics provides interpretable, handcrafted descriptors of tissue heterogeneity but suffers from limited scalability and integration into end-to-end learning frameworks. In this work, we propose the Radiomics-Embedded Vision Transformer (RE-ViT) that combines radiomic features with data-driven visual embeddings within a ViT backbone.
  Purpose: To develop a hybrid RE-ViT framework that integrates radiomics and patch-wise ViT embeddings through early fusion, enhancing robustness and performance in medical image classification.
  Methods: Following the standard ViT pipeline, images were divided into patches. For each patch, handcrafted radiomic features were extracted and fused with linearly projected pixel embeddings. The fused representations were normalized, positionally encoded, and passed to the ViT encoder. A learnable [CLS] token aggregated patch-level information for classification. We evaluated RE-ViT on three public datasets (including BUSI, ChestXray2017, and Retinal OCT) using accuracy, macro AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. RE-ViT was benchmarked against CNN-based (VGG-16, ResNet) and hybrid (TransMed) models.
  Results: RE-ViT achieved state-of-the-art results: on BUSI, AUC=0.950+/-0.011; on ChestXray2017, AUC=0.989+/-0.004; on Retinal OCT, AUC=0.986+/-0.001, which outperforms other comparison models.
  Conclusions: The RE-ViT framework effectively integrates radiomics with ViT architectures, demonstrating improved performance and generalizability across multimodal medical image classification tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Since human and environmental factors interfere, captured polyp images usually suffer from issues such as dim lighting, blur, and overexposure, which pose challenges for downstream polyp segmentation tasks. To address the challenges of noise-induced degradation in polyp images, we present AgentPolyp, a novel framework integrating CLIP-based semantic guidance and dynamic image enhancement with a lightweight neural network for segmentation. The agent first evaluates image quality using CLIP-driven semantic analysis (e.g., identifying ``low-contrast polyps with vascular textures") and adapts reinforcement learning strategies to dynamically apply multi-modal enhancement operations (e.g., denoising, contrast adjustment). A quality assessment feedback loop optimizes pixel-level enhancement and segmentation focus in a collaborative manner, ensuring robust preprocessing before neural network segmentation. This modular architecture supports plug-and-play extensions for various enhancement algorithms and segmentation networks, meeting deployment requirements for endoscopic devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joana Reuss, Jan Macdonald, Simon Becker, Konrad Schultka, Lorenz Richter, Marco K\"orner</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial imbalances in crop type data pose significant challenges for accurate classification in remote sensing applications. Algorithms aiming at transferring knowledge from data-rich to data-scarce tasks have thus surged in popularity. However, despite their effectiveness in previous evaluations, their performance in challenging real-world applications is unclear and needs to be evaluated. This study benchmarks transfer learning and several meta-learning algorithms, including (First-Order) Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning ((FO)-MAML), Almost No Inner Loop (ANIL), and Task-Informed Meta-Learning (TIML), on the real-world EuroCropsML time series dataset, which combines farmer-reported crop data with Sentinel-2 satellite observations from Estonia, Latvia, and Portugal. Our findings indicate that MAML-based meta-learning algorithms achieve slightly higher accuracy compared to simpler transfer learning methods when applied to crop type classification tasks in Estonia after pre-training on data from Latvia. However, this improvement comes at the cost of increased computational demands and training time. Moreover, we find that the transfer of knowledge between geographically disparate regions, such as Estonia and Portugal, poses significant challenges to all investigated algorithms. These insights underscore the trade-offs between accuracy and computational resource requirements in selecting machine learning methods for real-world crop type classification tasks and highlight the difficulties of transferring knowledge between different regions of the Earth. To facilitate future research in this domain, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating transfer and meta-learning methods for crop type classification under real-world conditions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timm Linder, Kadir Yilmaz, David B. Adrian, Bastian Leibe</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate intrinsic and extrinsic camera calibration can be an important prerequisite for robotic applications that rely on vision as input. While there is ongoing research on enabling camera calibration using natural images, many systems in practice still rely on using designated calibration targets with e.g. checkerboard patterns or April tag grids. Once calibration images from different perspectives have been acquired and feature descriptors detected, those are typically used in an optimization process to minimize the geometric reprojection error. For this optimization to converge, input images need to be of sufficient quality and particularly sharpness; they should neither contain motion blur nor rolling-shutter artifacts that can arise when the calibration board was not static during image capture. In this work, we present a novel calibration image acquisition technique controlled via voice commands recorded with a clip-on microphone, that can be more robust and user-friendly than e.g. triggering capture with a remote control, or filtering out blurry frames from a video sequence in postprocessing. To achieve this, we use a state-of-the-art speech-to-text transcription model with accurate per-word timestamping to capture trigger words with precise temporal alignment. Our experiments show that the proposed method improves user experience by being fast and efficient, allowing us to successfully calibrate complex multi-camera setups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fuyin Lai, Edith Heiter, Guillaume Bied, Jefrey Lijffijt</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing an understanding of high-dimensional data can be facilitated by visualizing that data using dimensionality reduction. However, the low-dimensional embeddings are often difficult to interpret. To facilitate the exploration and interpretation of low-dimensional embeddings, we introduce a new concept named partitioning with explanations. The idea is to partition the data shown through the embedding into groups, each of which is given a sparse explanation using the original high-dimensional attributes. We introduce an objective function that quantifies how much we can learn through observing the explanations of the data partitioning, using information theory, and also how complex the explanations are. Through parameterization of the complexity, we can tune the solutions towards the desired granularity. We propose InfoClus, which optimizes the partitioning and explanations jointly, through greedy search constrained over a hierarchical clustering. We conduct a qualitative and quantitative analysis of InfoClus on three data sets. We contrast the results on the Cytometry data with published manual analysis results, and compare with two other recent methods for explaining embeddings (RVX and VERA). These comparisons highlight that InfoClus has distinct advantages over existing procedures and methods. We find that InfoClus can automatically create good starting points for the analysis of dimensionality-reduction-based scatter plots.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ren\'e Peinl</p>
<p>Abstract: This study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) can reduce biases in text-to-image generation systems by modifying user prompts. We define bias as a model's unfair deviation from population statistics given neutral prompts. Our experiments with Stable Diffusion XL, 3.5 and Flux demonstrate that LLM-modified prompts significantly increase image diversity and reduce bias without the need to change the image generators themselves. While occasionally producing results that diverge from original user intent for elaborate prompts, this approach generally provides more varied interpretations of underspecified requests rather than superficial variations. The method works particularly well for less advanced image generators, though limitations persist for certain contexts like disability representation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henrik Krauss, Takehisa Yairi</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a novel method for revealing human covert attention patterns using gameplay data alone, utilizing offline attention techniques from reinforcement learning (RL). We propose the contextualized, task-relevant (CTR) attention network, which generates attention maps from both human and RL agent gameplay in Atari environments. These maps are sparse yet retain the necessary information for the current player's decision making. We compare the CTR-derived attention maps with a temporally integrated overt attention (TIOA) model based on eye-tracking data, serving as a point of comparison and discussion. Visual inspection reveals distinct attention patterns: human CTR maps focus on the player and rather nearby opponents, occasionally shifting between stronger focus and broader views - sometimes even attending to empty space ahead. In contrast, agent maps maintain a consistent broad focus on most objects, including distant ones and the player. Quantitative analysis further demonstrates that human CTR maps align more closely with TIOA than agent maps do. Our findings indicate that the CTR attention network can effectively reveal human covert attention patterns from gameplay alone, without the need for additional data like brain activity recordings. This work contributes to understanding human-agent attention differences and enables the development of RL agents augmented with human covert attention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lijun Sheng, Jian Liang, Zilei Wang, Ran He</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have gained significant popularity as foundation models, with numerous fine-tuning methods developed to enhance performance on downstream tasks. However, due to their inherent vulnerability and the common practice of selecting from a limited set of open-source models, VLMs suffer from a higher risk of adversarial attacks than traditional vision models. Existing defense techniques typically rely on adversarial fine-tuning during training, which requires labeled data and lacks of flexibility for downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose robust test-time prompt tuning (R-TPT), which mitigates the impact of adversarial attacks during the inference stage. We first reformulate the classic marginal entropy objective by eliminating the term that introduces conflicts under adversarial conditions, retaining only the pointwise entropy minimization. Furthermore, we introduce a plug-and-play reliability-based weighted ensembling strategy, which aggregates useful information from reliable augmented views to strengthen the defense. R-TPT enhances defense against adversarial attacks without requiring labeled training data while offering high flexibility for inference tasks. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks with various attacks demonstrate the effectiveness of R-TPT. The code is available in https://github.com/TomSheng21/R-TPT.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) is widely regarded as the state-of-the-art algorithm for achieving sample-efficient multi-goal reinforcement learning (RL) in robotic manipulation tasks with binary rewards. HER facilitates learning from failed attempts by replaying trajectories with redefined goals. However, it relies on a heuristic-based replay method that lacks a principled framework. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel replay strategy, "Next-Future", which focuses on rewarding single-step transitions. This approach significantly enhances sample efficiency and accuracy in learning multi-goal Markov decision processes (MDPs), particularly under stringent accuracy requirements -- a critical aspect for performing complex and precise robotic-arm tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by highlighting how single-step learning enables improved value approximation within the multi-goal RL framework. The performance of the proposed replay strategy is evaluated across eight challenging robotic manipulation tasks, using ten random seeds for training. Our results indicate substantial improvements in sample efficiency for seven out of eight tasks and higher success rates in six tasks. Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the practical feasibility of the learned policies, demonstrating the potential of "Next-Future" in solving complex robotic-arm tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for cryo-electron microscopy, employing neural networks in methods like CryoSBI to infer biomolecular conformations via learned latent representations. This latent space represents a rich opportunity, encoding valuable information about the physical system and the inference process. Harnessing this potential hinges on understanding the underlying geometric structure of these representations. We investigate this structure by applying manifold learning techniques to CryoSBI representations of hemagglutinin (simulated and experimental). We reveal that these high-dimensional data inherently populate low-dimensional, smooth manifolds, with simulated data effectively covering the experimental counterpart. By characterizing the manifold's geometry using Diffusion Maps and identifying its principal axes of variation via coordinate interpretation methods, we establish a direct link between the latent structure and key physical parameters. Discovering this intrinsic low-dimensionality and interpretable geometric organization not only validates the CryoSBI approach but enables us to learn more from the data structure and provides opportunities for improving future inference strategies by exploiting this revealed manifold geometry.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models are accelerating the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents that utilize human-like vision perception capabilities to enhance productivity on digital devices. Compared to approaches predicated on GUI metadata, which are platform-dependent and vulnerable to implementation variations, vision-based approaches offer broader applicability. In this vision-based paradigm, the GUI instruction grounding, which maps user instruction to the location of corresponding element on the given screenshot, remains a critical challenge, particularly due to limited public training dataset and resource-intensive manual instruction data annotation.In this paper, we delve into unexplored challenges in this task including element-to-screen ratio, unbalanced element type, and implicit instruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale data synthesis pipeline UI-E2I-Synth for generating varying complex instruction datasets using GPT-4o instead of human annotators. Furthermore, we propose a new GUI instruction grounding benchmark UI-I2E-Bench, which is designed to address the limitations of existing benchmarks by incorporating diverse annotation aspects. Our model, trained on the synthesized data, achieves superior performance in GUI instruction grounding, demonstrating the advancements of proposed data synthesis pipeline. The proposed benchmark, accompanied by extensive analyses, provides practical insights for future research in GUI grounding.

<p>Abstract: Medical image restoration tasks aim to recover high-quality images from degraded observations, exhibiting emergent desires in many clinical scenarios, such as low-dose CT image denoising, MRI super-resolution, and MRI artifact removal. Despite the success achieved by existing deep learning-based restoration methods with sophisticated modules, they struggle with rendering computationally-efficient reconstruction results. Moreover, they usually ignore the reliability of the restoration results, which is much more urgent in medical systems. To alleviate these issues, we present LRformer, a Lightweight Transformer-based method via Reliability-guided learning in the frequency domain. Specifically, inspired by the uncertainty quantification in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), we develop a Reliable Lesion-Semantic Prior Producer (RLPP). RLPP leverages Monte Carlo (MC) estimators with stochastic sampling operations to generate sufficiently-reliable priors by performing multiple inferences on the foundational medical image segmentation model, MedSAM. Additionally, instead of directly incorporating the priors in the spatial domain, we decompose the cross-attention (CA) mechanism into real symmetric and imaginary anti-symmetric parts via fast Fourier transform (FFT), resulting in the design of the Guided Frequency Cross-Attention (GFCA) solver. By leveraging the conjugated symmetric property of FFT, GFCA reduces the computational complexity of naive CA by nearly half. Extensive experimental results in various tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LRformer in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: High resolution panoramic video content is paramount for immersive experiences in Virtual Reality, but is non-trivial to collect as it requires specialized equipment and intricate camera setups. In this work, we introduce VideoPanda, a novel approach for synthesizing 360$^\circ$ videos conditioned on text or single-view video data. VideoPanda leverages multi-view attention layers to augment a video diffusion model, enabling it to generate consistent multi-view videos that can be combined into immersive panoramic content. VideoPanda is trained jointly using two conditions: text-only and single-view video, and supports autoregressive generation of long-videos. To overcome the computational burden of multi-view video generation, we randomly subsample the duration and camera views used during training and show that the model is able to gracefully generalize to generating more frames during inference. Extensive evaluations on both real-world and synthetic video datasets demonstrate that VideoPanda generates more realistic and coherent 360$^\circ$ panoramas across all input conditions compared to existing methods.

<p>Abstract: White blood cell (WBC) classification assists in assessing immune health and diagnosing various diseases, yet manual classification is labor-intensive and prone to inconsistencies. Recent advancements in deep learning have shown promise over traditional methods; however, challenges such as data imbalance and the computational demands of modern technologies, such as Transformer-based models which do not scale well with input size, limit their practical application. This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages Mamba models integrated with ensemble learning to improve WBC classification. Mamba models, known for their linear complexity, provide a scalable alternative to Transformer-based approaches, making them suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, we introduce a new WBC dataset, Chula-WBC-8, for benchmarking.

<p>Abstract: Garments are important to humans. A visual system that can estimate and track the complete garment pose can be useful for many downstream tasks and real-world applications. In this work, we present a complete package to address the category-level garment pose tracking task: (1) A recording system VR-Garment, with which users can manipulate virtual garment models in simulation through a VR interface. (2) A large-scale dataset VR-Folding, with complex garment pose configurations in manipulation like flattening and folding. (3) An end-to-end online tracking framework GarmentTracking, which predicts complete garment pose both in canonical space and task space given a point cloud sequence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GarmentTracking achieves great performance even when the garment has large non-rigid deformation. It outperforms the baseline approach on both speed and accuracy. We hope our proposed solution can serve as a platform for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyi Zhu, Honghui Yang, Xiaoyang Wu, Di Huang, Sha Zhang, Xianglong He, Hengshuang Zhao, Chunhua Shen, Yu Qiao, Tong He, Wanli Ouyang</p>
<p>Abstract: In contrast to numerous NLP and 2D vision foundational models, learning a 3D foundational model poses considerably greater challenges. This is primarily due to the inherent data variability and diversity of downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel universal 3D pre-training framework designed to facilitate the acquisition of efficient 3D representation, thereby establishing a pathway to 3D foundational models. Considering that informative 3D features should encode rich geometry and appearance cues that can be utilized to render realistic images, we propose to learn 3D representations by differentiable neural rendering. We train a 3D backbone with a devised volumetric neural renderer by comparing the rendered with the real images. Notably, our approach seamlessly integrates the learned 3D encoder into various downstream tasks. These tasks encompass not only high-level challenges such as 3D detection and segmentation but also low-level objectives like 3D reconstruction and image synthesis, spanning both indoor and outdoor scenarios. Besides, we also illustrate the capability of pre-training a 2D backbone using the proposed methodology, surpassing conventional pre-training methods by a large margin. For the first time, PonderV2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 indoor and outdoor benchmarks, implying its effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihang Zhong, Yiming Zhang, Wei Wang, Xiao Sun, Yu Qiao, Gurunandan Krishnan, Sizhuo Ma, Jian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing video frame interpolation (VFI) methods blindly predict where each object is at a specific timestep t ("time indexing"), which struggles to predict precise object movements. Given two images of a baseball, there are infinitely many possible trajectories: accelerating or decelerating, straight or curved. This often results in blurry frames as the method averages out these possibilities. Instead of forcing the network to learn this complicated time-to-location mapping implicitly, we provide the network with an explicit hint on how far the object has traveled between start and end frames, a novel approach termed "distance indexing". This method offers a clearer learning goal for models, reducing the uncertainty tied to object speeds. Moreover, even with this extra guidance, objects can still be blurry especially when they are equally far from both input frames, due to the directional ambiguity in long-range motion. To solve this, we propose an iterative reference-based estimation strategy that breaks down a long-range prediction into several short-range steps. When integrating our plug-and-play strategies into state-of-the-art learning-based models, they exhibit markedly superior perceptual quality in arbitrary time interpolations, using a uniform distance indexing map in the same format as time indexing without requiring extra computation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that if additional latency is acceptable, a continuous map estimator can be employed to compute a pixel-wise dense distance indexing using multiple nearby frames. Combined with efficient multi-frame refinement, this extension can further disambiguate complex motion, thus enhancing performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. Additionally, the ability to manually specify distance indexing allows for independent temporal manipulation of each object, providing a novel tool for video editing tasks such as re-timing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Constructing vivid 3D head avatars for given subjects and realizing a series of animations on them is valuable yet challenging. This paper presents GaussianHead, which models the actional human head with anisotropic 3D Gaussians. In our framework, a motion deformation field and multi-resolution tri-plane are constructed respectively to deal with the head's dynamic geometry and complex texture. Notably, we impose an exclusive derivation scheme on each Gaussian, which generates its multiple doppelgangers through a set of learnable parameters for position transformation. With this design, we can compactly and accurately encode the appearance information of Gaussians, even those fitting the head's particular components with sophisticated structures. In addition, an inherited derivation strategy for newly added Gaussians is adopted to facilitate training acceleration. Extensive experiments show that our method can produce high-fidelity renderings, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction, cross-identity reenactment, and novel view synthesis tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyun Xu, Shujian Yu, Zhuoran Liu, Stjepan Picek</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a fundamental architecture and serve as the backbone of modern vision-language models. Despite their impressive performance, ViTs exhibit notable vulnerability to evasion attacks, necessitating the development of specialized Adversarial Training (AT) strategies tailored to their unique architecture. While a direct solution might involve applying existing AT methods to ViTs, our analysis reveals significant incompatibilities, particularly with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches such as Generalist (CVPR 2023) and DBAT (USENIX Security 2024). This paper presents a systematic investigation of adversarial robustness in ViTs and provides a novel theoretical Mutual Information (MI) analysis in its autoencoder-based self-supervised pre-training. Specifically, we show that MI between the adversarial example and its latent representation in ViT-based autoencoders should be constrained via derived MI bounds. Building on this insight, we propose a self-supervised AT method, MIMIR, that employs an MI penalty to facilitate adversarial pre-training by masked image modeling with autoencoders. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that MIMIR can consistently provide improved natural and robust accuracy, where MIMIR outperforms SOTA AT results on ImageNet-1K. Notably, MIMIR demonstrates superior robustness against unforeseen attacks and common corruption data and can also withstand adaptive attacks where the adversary possesses full knowledge of the defense mechanism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. Eren Akbiyik, Nedko Savov, Danda Pani Paudel, Nikola Popovic, Christian Vater, Otmar Hilliges, Luc Van Gool, Xi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding drivers' decision-making is crucial for road safety. Although predicting the ego-vehicle's path is valuable for driver-assistance systems, existing methods mainly focus on external factors like other vehicles' motions, often neglecting the driver's attention and intent. To address this gap, we infer the ego-trajectory by integrating the driver's gaze and the surrounding scene. We introduce RouteFormer, a novel multimodal ego-trajectory prediction network combining GPS data, environmental context, and the driver's field-of-view, comprising first-person video and gaze fixations. We also present the Path Complexity Index (PCI), a new metric for trajectory complexity that enables a more nuanced evaluation of challenging scenarios. To tackle data scarcity and enhance diversity, we introduce GEM, a comprehensive dataset of urban driving scenarios enriched with synchronized driver field-of-view and gaze data. Extensive evaluations on GEM and DR(eye)VE demonstrate that RouteFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving notable improvements in prediction accuracy across diverse conditions. Ablation studies reveal that incorporating driver field-of-view data yields significantly better average displacement error, especially in challenging scenarios with high PCI scores, underscoring the importance of modeling driver attention.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Senkang Hu, Zhengru Fang, Yiqin Deng, Xianhao Chen, Yuguang Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving has attracted significant attention from both academia and industries, which is expected to offer a safer and more efficient driving system. However, current autonomous driving systems are mostly based on a single vehicle, which has significant limitations which still poses threats to driving safety. Collaborative perception with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) shows a promising solution to overcoming these limitations. In this article, we first identify the challenges of collaborative perception, such as data sharing asynchrony, data volume, and pose errors. Then, we discuss the possible solutions to address these challenges with various technologies, where the research opportunities are also elaborated. Furthermore, we propose a scheme to deal with communication efficiency and latency problems, which is a channel-aware collaborative perception framework to dynamically adjust the communication graph and minimize latency, thereby improving perception performance while increasing communication efficiency. Finally, we conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Will LeVine, Benjamin Pikus, Jacob Phillips, Berk Norman, Fernando Amat Gil, Sean Hendryx</p>
<p>Abstract: As deep neural networks become adopted in high-stakes domains, it is crucial to identify when inference inputs are Out-of-Distribution (OOD) so that users can be alerted of likely drops in performance and calibration despite high confidence -- ultimately to know when networks' decisions (and their uncertainty in those decisions) should be trusted. In this paper we introduce Ablated Learned Temperature Energy (or "AbeT" for short), an OOD detection method which lowers the False Positive Rate at 95\% True Positive Rate (FPR@95) by $43.43\%$ in classification compared to state of the art without training networks in multiple stages or requiring hyperparameters or test-time backward passes. We additionally provide empirical insights as to why our model learns to distinguish between In-Distribution (ID) and OOD samples while only being explicitly trained on ID samples via exposure to misclassified ID examples at training time. Lastly, we show the efficacy of our method in identifying predicted bounding boxes and pixels corresponding to OOD objects in object detection and semantic segmentation, respectively -- with an AUROC increase of $5.15\%$ in object detection and both a decrease in FPR@95 of $41.48\%$ and an increase in AUPRC of $34.20\%$ in semantic segmentation compared to previous state of the art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ibrahim Almakky, Santosh Sanjeev, Anees Ur Rehman Hashmi, Mohammad Areeb Qazi, Hu Wang, Mohammad Yaqub</p>
<p>Abstract: Transfer learning has become a powerful tool to initialize deep learning models to achieve faster convergence and higher performance. This is especially useful in the medical imaging analysis domain, where data scarcity limits possible performance gains for deep learning models. Some advancements have been made in boosting the transfer learning performance gain by merging models starting from the same initialization. However, in the medical imaging analysis domain, there is an opportunity to merge models starting from different initializations, thus combining the features learned from different tasks. In this work, we propose MedMerge, a method whereby the weights of different models can be merged, and their features can be effectively utilized to boost performance on a new task. With MedMerge, we learn kernel-level weights that can later be used to merge the models into a single model, even when starting from different initializations. Testing on various medical imaging analysis tasks, we show that our merged model can achieve significant performance gains, with up to 7% improvement on the F1 score.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanlin Wang, Zhan Tong, Kecheng Zheng, Yujun Shen, Limin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Audio Description (AD) task aims to generate descriptions of visual elements for visually impaired individuals to help them access long-form video content, like movies. With video feature, text, character bank and context information as inputs, the generated ADs are able to correspond to the characters by name and provide reasonable, contextual descriptions to help audience understand the storyline of movie. To achieve this goal, we propose to leverage pre-trained foundation models through a simple and unified framework to generate ADs with interleaved multimodal sequence as input, termed as Uni-AD. To enhance the alignment of features across various modalities with finer granularity, we introduce a simple and lightweight module that maps video features into the textual feature space. Moreover, we also propose a character-refinement module to provide more precise information by identifying the main characters who play more significant roles in the video context. With these unique designs, we further incorporate contextual information and a contrastive loss into our architecture to generate smoother and more contextually appropriate ADs. Experiments on multiple AD datasets show that Uni-AD performs well on AD generation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bahri Batuhan Bilecen, Yigit Yalin, Ning Yu, Aysegul Dundar</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality image generation and real image editing by manipulating their latent spaces. Recent advancements in GANs include 3D-aware models such as EG3D, which feature efficient triplane-based architectures capable of reconstructing 3D geometry from single images. However, limited attention has been given to providing an integrated framework for 3D-aware, high-quality, reference-based image editing. This study addresses this gap by exploring and demonstrating the effectiveness of the triplane space for advanced reference-based edits. Our novel approach integrates encoding, automatic localization, spatial disentanglement of triplane features, and fusion learning to achieve the desired edits. We demonstrate how our approach excels across diverse domains, including human faces, 360-degree heads, animal faces, partially stylized edits like cartoon faces, full-body clothing edits, and edits on class-agnostic samples. Our method shows state-of-the-art performance over relevant latent direction, text, and image-guided 2D and 3D-aware diffusion and GAN methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maoxun Yuan, Bo Cui, Tianyi Zhao, Jiayi Wang, Shan Fu, Xue Yang, Xingxing Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic analysis on visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) images has gained significant attention due to their enhanced accuracy and robustness under challenging conditions including low-illumination and adverse weather. However, due to the lack of pre-trained foundation models on the large-scale infrared image datasets, existing methods prefer to design task-specific frameworks and directly fine-tune them with pre-trained foundation models on their RGB-IR semantic relevance datasets, which results in poor scalability and limited generalization. To address these limitations, we propose UniRGB-IR, a scalable and efficient framework for RGB-IR semantic tasks that introduces a novel adapter mechanism to effectively incorporate rich multi-modal features into pre-trained RGB-based foundation models. Our framework comprises three key components: a vision transformer (ViT) foundation model, a Multi-modal Feature Pool (MFP) module, and a Supplementary Feature Injector (SFI) module. The MFP and SFI modules cooperate with each other as an adpater to effectively complement the ViT features with the contextual multi-scale features. During training process, we freeze the entire foundation model to inherit prior knowledge and only optimize the MFP and SFI modules. Furthermore, to verify the effectiveness of our framework, we utilize the ViT-Base as the pre-trained foundation model to perform extensive experiments. Experimental results on various RGB-IR semantic tasks demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

<p>Abstract: Whether face processing depends on unique, domain-specific neurocognitive mechanisms or domain-general object recognition mechanisms has long been debated. Directly testing these competing hypotheses in humans has proven challenging due to extensive exposure to both faces and objects. Here, we systematically test these hypotheses by capitalizing on recent progress in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can be trained without face exposure (i.e., pre-trained weights). Domain-general mechanism accounts posit that face processing can emerge from a neural network without specialized pre-training on faces. Consequently, we trained CNNs solely on objects and tested their ability to recognize and represent faces as well as objects that look like faces (face pareidolia stimuli)....

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixin Xu, Zhe Wang, Chunyun Chen, Xue Geng, Jie Lin, Mohamed M. Sabry Aly, Xulei Yang, Min Wu, Xiaoli Li, Weisi Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision transformers have emerged as a promising alternative to convolutional neural networks for various image analysis tasks, offering comparable or superior performance. However, one significant drawback of ViTs is their resource-intensive nature, leading to increased memory footprint, computation complexity, and power consumption. To democratize this high-performance technology and make it more environmentally friendly, it is essential to compress ViT models, reducing their resource requirements while maintaining high performance. In this paper, we introduce a new block-structured pruning to address the resource-intensive issue for ViTs, offering a balanced trade-off between accuracy and hardware acceleration. Unlike unstructured pruning or channel-wise structured pruning, block pruning leverages the block-wise structure of linear layers, resulting in more efficient matrix multiplications. To optimize this pruning scheme, our paper proposes a novel hardware-aware learning objective that simultaneously maximizes speedup and minimizes power consumption during inference, tailored to the block sparsity structure. This objective eliminates the need for empirical look-up tables and focuses solely on reducing parametrized layer connections. Moreover, our paper provides a lightweight algorithm to achieve post-training pruning for ViTs, utilizing second-order Taylor approximation and empirical optimization to solve the proposed hardware-aware objective. Extensive experiments on ImageNet are conducted across various ViT architectures, including DeiT-B and DeiT-S, demonstrating competitive performance with other pruning methods and achieving a remarkable balance between accuracy preservation and power savings. Especially, we achieve 3.93x speedup on dedicated hardware and GPUs respectively for DeiT-B, and a power reduction by 1.4x on GPUs. Code released to https://github.com/Akimoto-Cris/LPViT.</p>

<p>Abstract: Childhood myopia constitutes a significant global health concern. It exhibits an escalating prevalence and has the potential to evolve into severe, irreversible conditions that detrimentally impact familial well-being and create substantial economic costs. Contemporary research underscores the importance of precisely predicting myopia progression to enable timely and effective interventions, thereby averting severe visual impairment in children. Such predictions predominantly rely on subjective clinical assessments, which are inherently biased and resource-intensive, thus hindering their widespread application. In this study, we introduce a novel, high-accuracy method for quantitatively predicting the myopic trajectory and myopia risk in children using only fundus images and baseline refraction data. This approach was validated through a six-year longitudinal study of 3,408 children in Henan, utilizing 16,211 fundus images and corresponding refractive data. Our method based on deep learning demonstrated predictive accuracy with an error margin of 0.311D per year and AUC scores of 0.944 and 0.995 for forecasting the risks of developing myopia and high myopia, respectively. These findings confirm the utility of our model in supporting early intervention strategies and in significantly reducing healthcare costs, particularly by obviating the need for additional metadata and repeated consultations. Furthermore, our method was designed to rely only on fundus images and refractive error data, without the need for meta data or multiple inquiries from doctors, strongly reducing the associated medical costs and facilitating large-scale screening. Our model can even provide good predictions based on only a single time measurement. Consequently, the proposed method is an important means to reduce medical inequities caused by economic disparities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Assessing the presence of potentially malignant lymph nodes aids in estimating cancer progression, and identifying surrounding benign lymph nodes can assist in determining potential metastatic pathways for cancer. For quantitative analysis, automatic segmentation of lymph nodes is crucial. However, due to the labor-intensive and time-consuming manual annotation process required for a large number of lymph nodes, it is more practical to annotate only a subset of the lymph node instances to reduce annotation costs. In this study, we propose a pre-trained Dual-Branch network with Dynamically Mixed Pseudo label (DBDMP) to learn from partial instance annotations for lymph nodes segmentation. To obtain reliable pseudo labels for lymph nodes that are not annotated, we employ a dual-decoder network to generate different outputs that are then dynamically mixed. We integrate the original weak partial annotations with the mixed pseudo labels to supervise the network. To further leverage the extensive amount of unannotated voxels, we apply a self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance the model's feature extraction capability. Experiments on the mediastinal Lymph Node Quantification (LNQ) dataset demonstrate that our method, compared to directly learning from partial instance annotations, significantly improves the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) from 11.04% to 54.10% and reduces the Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD) from 20.83 $mm$ to 8.72 $mm$.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Yang, Qianyu Zhou, Haijia Sun, Xiangtai Li, Fengqi Liu, Xuequan Lu, Lizhuang Ma, Shuicheng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to improve the generalizability of point cloud classification (PCC) models toward unseen domains. However, they often suffer from limited receptive fields or quadratic complexity due to using convolution neural networks or vision Transformers. In this paper, we present the first work that studies the generalizability of state space models (SSMs) in DG PCC and find that directly applying SSMs into DG PCC will encounter several challenges: the inherent topology of the point cloud tends to be disrupted and leads to noise accumulation during the serialization stage. Besides, the lack of designs in domain-agnostic feature learning and data scanning will introduce unanticipated domain-specific information into the 3D sequence data. To this end, we propose a novel framework, PointDGMamba, that excels in strong generalizability toward unseen domains and has the advantages of global receptive fields and efficient linear complexity. PointDGMamba consists of three innovative components: Masked Sequence Denoising (MSD), Sequence-wise Cross-domain Feature Aggregation (SCFA), and Dual-level Domain Scanning (DDS). In particular, MSD selectively masks out the noised point tokens of the point cloud sequences, SCFA introduces cross-domain but same-class point cloud features to encourage the model to learn how to extract more generalized features. DDS includes intra-domain scanning and cross-domain scanning to facilitate information exchange between features. In addition, we propose a new and more challenging benchmark PointDG-3to1 for multi-domain generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of PointDGMamba.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Pan, Weibin Wu, Yuhang Cao, Zibin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural network based systems deployed in sensitive environments are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Unrestricted adversarial attacks typically manipulate the semantic content of an image (e.g., color or texture) to create adversarial examples that are both effective and photorealistic. Recent works have utilized the diffusion inversion process to map images into a latent space, where high-level semantics are manipulated by introducing perturbations. However, they often results in substantial semantic distortions in the denoised output and suffers from low efficiency. In this study, we propose a novel framework called Semantic-Consistent Unrestricted Adversarial Attacks (SCA), which employs an inversion method to extract edit-friendly noise maps and utilizes Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to provide semantic guidance throughout the process. Under the condition of rich semantic information provided by MLLM, we perform the DDPM denoising process of each step using a series of edit-friendly noise maps, and leverage DPM Solver++ to accelerate this process, enabling efficient sampling with semantic consistency. Compared to existing methods, our framework enables the efficient generation of adversarial examples that exhibit minimal discernible semantic changes. Consequently, we for the first time introduce Semantic-Consistent Adversarial Examples (SCAE). Extensive experiments and visualizations have demonstrated the high efficiency of SCA, particularly in being on average 12 times faster than the state-of-the-art attacks. Our research can further draw attention to the security of multimedia information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiqi Liang, Ying Liu, Dandan Long, Ruihui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene sketching is to convert a scene into a simplified, abstract representation that captures the essential elements and composition of the original scene. It requires a semantic understanding of the scene and consideration of different regions within the scene. Since scenes often contain diverse visual information across various regions, such as foreground objects, background elements, and spatial divisions, dealing with these different regions poses unique difficulties. In this paper, we define a sketch as some sets of B\'ezier curves because of their smooth and versatile characteristics. We optimize different regions of input scene in multiple rounds. In each optimization round, the strokes sampled from the next region can seamlessly be integrated into the sketch generated in the previous optimization round. We propose an additional stroke initialization method to ensure the integrity of the scene and the convergence of optimization. A novel CLIP-based Semantic Loss and a VGG-based Feature Loss are utilized to guide our multi-round optimization. Extensive experimental results on the quality and quantity of the generated sketches confirm the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linus Franke, Laura Fink, Marc Stamminger</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis have demonstrated impressive results in fast photorealistic scene rendering through differentiable point rendering, either via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [Kerbl and Kopanas et al. 2023] or neural point rendering [Aliev et al. 2020]. Unfortunately, these directions require either a large number of small Gaussians or expensive per-pixel post-processing for reconstructing fine details, which negatively impacts rendering performance. To meet the high performance demands of virtual reality (VR) systems, primitive or pixel counts therefore must be kept low, affecting visual quality.
  In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach based on foveated rendering as a promising solution that combines the strengths of both point rendering directions regarding performance sweet spots. Analyzing the compatibility with the human visual system, we find that using a low-detailed, few primitive smooth Gaussian representation for the periphery is cheap to compute and meets the perceptual demands of peripheral vision. For the fovea only, we use neural points with a convolutional neural network for the small pixel footprint, which provides sharp, detailed output within the rendering budget. This combination also allows for synergistic method accelerations with point occlusion culling and reducing the demands on the neural network.
  Our evaluation confirms that our approach increases sharpness and details compared to a standard VR-ready 3DGS configuration, and participants of a user study overwhelmingly preferred our method. Our system meets the necessary performance requirements for real-time VR interactions, ultimately enhancing the user's immersive experience.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruicheng Wang, Sicheng Xu, Cassie Dai, Jianfeng Xiang, Yu Deng, Xin Tong, Jiaolong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We present MoGe, a powerful model for recovering 3D geometry from monocular open-domain images. Given a single image, our model directly predicts a 3D point map of the captured scene with an affine-invariant representation, which is agnostic to true global scale and shift. This new representation precludes ambiguous supervision in training and facilitate effective geometry learning. Furthermore, we propose a set of novel global and local geometry supervisions that empower the model to learn high-quality geometry. These include a robust, optimal, and efficient point cloud alignment solver for accurate global shape learning, and a multi-scale local geometry loss promoting precise local geometry supervision. We train our model on a large, mixed dataset and demonstrate its strong generalizability and high accuracy. In our comprehensive evaluation on diverse unseen datasets, our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all tasks, including monocular estimation of 3D point map, depth map, and camera field of view.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elena Sierra, Lauren E. Gillespie, Salim Soltani, Moises Exposito-Alonso, Teja Kattenborn</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale, volunteer-collected datasets of community-identified natural world imagery like iNaturalist have enabled marked performance gains for fine-grained visual classification of species using machine learning methods. However, such data -- sometimes referred to as citizen science data -- are opportunistic and lack a structured sampling strategy. This volunteer-collected biodiversity data contains geographic, temporal, taxonomic, observers, and sociopolitical biases that can have significant effects on biodiversity model performance, but whose impacts are unclear for fine-grained species recognition performance. Here we introduce Diversity Shift (DivShift), a framework for quantifying the effects of domain-specific distribution shifts on machine learning model performance. To diagnose the performance effects of biases specific to volunteer-collected biodiversity data, we also introduce DivShift - North American West Coast (DivShift-NAWC), a curated dataset of almost 7.5 million iNaturalist images across the western coast of North America partitioned across five types of expert-verified bias. We compare species recognition performance across these bias partitions using a diverse variety of species- and ecosystem-focused accuracy metrics. We observe that these biases confound model performance less than expected from the underlying label distribution shift, and that more data leads to better model performance but the magnitude of these improvements are bias-specific. These findings imply that while the structure within natural world images provides generalization improvements for biodiversity monitoring tasks, the biases present in volunteer-collected biodiversity data can also affect model performance; thus these models should be used with caution in downstream biodiversity monitoring tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongyi Li, Shujie Hu, Shujie Liu, Long Zhou, Jeongsoo Choi, Lingwei Meng, Xun Guo, Jinyu Li, Hefei Ling, Furu Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-video models have recently undergone rapid and substantial advancements. Nevertheless, due to limitations in data and computational resources, achieving efficient generation of long videos with rich motion dynamics remains a significant challenge. To generate high-quality, dynamic, and temporally consistent long videos, this paper presents ARLON, a novel framework that boosts diffusion Transformers with autoregressive models for long video generation, by integrating the coarse spatial and long-range temporal information provided by the AR model to guide the DiT model. Specifically, ARLON incorporates several key innovations: 1) A latent Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) compresses the input latent space of the DiT model into compact visual tokens, bridging the AR and DiT models and balancing the learning complexity and information density; 2) An adaptive norm-based semantic injection module integrates the coarse discrete visual units from the AR model into the DiT model, ensuring effective guidance during video generation; 3) To enhance the tolerance capability of noise introduced from the AR inference, the DiT model is trained with coarser visual latent tokens incorporated with an uncertainty sampling module. Experimental results demonstrate that ARLON significantly outperforms the baseline OpenSora-V1.2 on eight out of eleven metrics selected from VBench, with notable improvements in dynamic degree and aesthetic quality, while delivering competitive results on the remaining three and simultaneously accelerating the generation process. In addition, ARLON achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation. Detailed analyses of the improvements in inference efficiency are presented, alongside a practical application that demonstrates the generation of long videos using progressive text prompts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Luo, Xin Wang, Bojia Zi, Shihao Zhao, Xingjun Ma, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their deployment in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. One promising approach for robustifying pre-trained VLMs is Adversarial Prompt Tuning (APT), which applies adversarial training during the process of prompt tuning. However, existing APT methods are mostly single-modal methods that design prompt(s) for only the visual or textual modality, limiting their effectiveness in either robustness or clean accuracy. In this work, we propose Adversarial Prompt Distillation (APD), a bimodal knowledge distillation framework that enhances APT by integrating it with multi-modal knowledge transfer. APD optimizes prompts for both visual and textual modalities while distilling knowledge from a clean pre-trained teacher CLIP model. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our APD method over the current state-of-the-art APT methods in terms of both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy. The effectiveness of APD also validates the possibility of using a non-robust teacher to improve the generalization and robustness of fine-tuned VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haijie Li, Yanmin Wu, Jiarui Meng, Qiankun Gao, Zhiyao Zhang, Ronggang Wang, Jian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D scene understanding has become an essential area of research with applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful approach, combining explicit modeling with neural adaptability to provide efficient and detailed scene representations. However, three major challenges remain in leveraging 3DGS for scene understanding: 1) an imbalance between appearance and semantics, where dense Gaussian usage for fine-grained texture modeling does not align with the minimal requirements for semantic attributes; 2) inconsistencies between appearance and semantics, as purely appearance-based Gaussians often misrepresent object boundaries; and 3) reliance on top-down instance segmentation methods, which struggle with uneven category distributions, leading to over- or under-segmentation. In this work, we propose InstanceGaussian, a method that jointly learns appearance and semantic features while adaptively aggregating instances. Our contributions include: i) a novel Semantic-Scaffold-GS representation balancing appearance and semantics to improve feature representations and boundary delineation; ii) a progressive appearance-semantic joint training strategy to enhance stability and segmentation accuracy; and iii) a bottom-up, category-agnostic instance aggregation approach that addresses segmentation challenges through farthest point sampling and connected component analysis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in category-agnostic, open-vocabulary 3D point-level segmentation, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed representation and training strategies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi Su, Xiaoxuan Ma, Jiajun Su, Yizhou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a one-stage framework for real-time multi-person 3D human mesh estimation from a single RGB image. While current one-stage methods, which follow a DETR-style pipeline, achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with high-resolution inputs, we observe that this particularly benefits the estimation of individuals in smaller scales of the image (e.g., those far from the camera), but at the cost of significantly increased computation overhead. To address this, we introduce scale-adaptive tokens that are dynamically adjusted based on the relative scale of each individual in the image within the DETR framework. Specifically, individuals in smaller scales are processed at higher resolutions, larger ones at lower resolutions, and background regions are further distilled. These scale-adaptive tokens more efficiently encode the image features, facilitating subsequent decoding to regress the human mesh, while allowing the model to allocate computational resources more effectively and focus on more challenging cases. Experiments show that our method preserves the accuracy benefits of high-resolution processing while substantially reducing computational cost, achieving real-time inference with performance comparable to SOTA methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fiorenzo Parascandolo, Nicholas Moratelli, Enver Sangineto, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has empirically shown that Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to fully understand the compositional properties of the human language, usually modeling an image caption as a "bag of words". As a result, they perform poorly on compositional tasks, which require a deeper understanding of the different entities of a sentence (subject, verb, etc.) jointly with their mutual relationships in order to be solved. In this paper, we model the dependency relations among textual and visual tokens using a Causal Graphical Model (CGM), built using a dependency parser, and we train a decoder conditioned by the VLM visual encoder. Differently from standard autoregressive or parallel predictions, our decoder's generative process is partially-ordered following the CGM structure. This structure encourages the decoder to learn only the main causal dependencies in a sentence discarding spurious correlations. Using extensive experiments on five compositional benchmarks, we show that our method significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art compositional approaches by a large margin, and it also improves over methods trained using much larger datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Orthognathic surgery consultation is essential to help patients understand the changes to their facial appearance after surgery. However, current visualization methods are often inefficient and inaccurate due to limited pre- and post-treatment data and the complexity of the treatment. To overcome these challenges, this study aims to develop a fully automated pipeline that generates accurate and efficient 3D previews of postsurgical facial appearances for patients with orthognathic treatment without requiring additional medical images. The study introduces novel aesthetic losses, such as mouth-convexity and asymmetry losses, to improve the accuracy of facial surgery prediction. Additionally, it proposes a specialized parametric model for 3D reconstruction of the patient, medical-related losses to guide latent code prediction network optimization, and a data augmentation scheme to address insufficient data. The study additionally employs FLAME, a parametric model, to enhance the quality of facial appearance previews by extracting facial latent codes and establishing dense correspondences between pre- and post-surgery geometries. Quantitative comparisons showed the algorithm's effectiveness, and qualitative results highlighted accurate facial contour and detail predictions. A user study confirmed that doctors and the public could not distinguish between machine learning predictions and actual postoperative results. This study aims to offer a practical, effective solution for orthognathic surgery consultations, benefiting doctors and patients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Li, Dan Guo, Guoliang Chen, Chunxiao Fan, Jingyuan Xu, Zhiliang Wu, Hehe Fan, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Micro-Action Recognition (MAR) has gained increasing attention due to its crucial role as a form of non-verbal communication in social interactions, with promising potential for applications in human communication and emotion analysis. However, current approaches often overlook the inherent ambiguity in micro-actions, which arises from the wide category range and subtle visual differences between categories. This oversight hampers the accuracy of micro-action recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel Prototypical Calibrating Ambiguous Network (PCAN) to unleash and mitigate the ambiguity of MAR. Firstly, we employ a hierarchical action-tree to identify the ambiguous sample, categorizing them into distinct sets of ambiguous samples of false negatives and false positives, considering both body- and action-level categories. Secondly, we implement an ambiguous contrastive refinement module to calibrate these ambiguous samples by regulating the distance between ambiguous samples and their corresponding prototypes. This calibration process aims to pull false negative (FN) samples closer to their respective prototypes and push false positive (FP) samples apart from their affiliated prototypes. In addition, we propose a new prototypical diversity amplification loss to strengthen the model's capacity by amplifying the differences between different prototypes. Finally, we propose a prototype-guided rectification to rectify prediction by incorporating the representability of prototypes. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruibin Li, Tao Yang, Song Guo, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the significant advancements, existing object removal methods struggle with incomplete removal, incorrect content synthesis and blurry synthesized regions, resulting in low success rates. Such issues are mainly caused by the lack of high-quality paired training data, as well as the self-supervised training paradigm adopted in these methods, which forces the model to in-paint the masked regions, leading to ambiguity between synthesizing the masked objects and restoring the background. To address these issues, we propose a semi-supervised learning strategy with human-in-the-loop to create high-quality paired training data, aiming to train a Robust Object Remover (RORem). We first collect 60K training pairs from open-source datasets to train an initial object removal model for generating removal samples, and then utilize human feedback to select a set of high-quality object removal pairs, with which we train a discriminator to automate the following training data generation process. By iterating this process for several rounds, we finally obtain a substantial object removal dataset with over 200K pairs. Fine-tuning the pre-trained stable diffusion model with this dataset, we obtain our RORem, which demonstrates state-of-the-art object removal performance in terms of both reliability and image quality. Particularly, RORem improves the object removal success rate over previous methods by more than 18\%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiwei Yao, Chen Li, Minjun Xiong, Wenbo Dong, Hao Chen, Xiong Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents Contourformer, a real-time contour-based instance segmentation algorithm. The method is fully based on the DETR paradigm and achieves end-to-end inference through iterative and progressive mechanisms to optimize contours. To improve efficiency and accuracy, we develop two novel techniques: sub-contour decoupling mechanisms and contour fine-grained distribution refinement. In the sub-contour decoupling mechanism, we propose a deformable attention-based module that adaptively selects sampling regions based on the current predicted contour, enabling more effective capturing of object boundary information. Additionally, we design a multi-stage optimization process to enhance segmentation precision by progressively refining sub-contours. The contour fine-grained distribution refinement technique aims to further improve the ability to express fine details of contours. These innovations enable Contourformer to achieve stable and precise segmentation for each instance while maintaining real-time performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Contourformer on multiple benchmark datasets, including SBD, COCO, and KINS. We conduct comprehensive evaluations and comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, showing significant improvements in both accuracy and inference speed. This work provides a new solution for contour-based instance segmentation tasks and lays a foundation for future research, with the potential to become a strong baseline method in this field.</p>

<p>Abstract: We tackle open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding by introducing a novel data generation pipeline and training framework. Our method addresses three critical requirements for effective training: precise 3D region segmentation, comprehensive textual descriptions, and sufficient dataset scale. By leveraging state-of-the-art open-vocabulary image segmentation models and region-aware Vision-Language Models, we develop an automatic pipeline that generates high-quality 3D mask-text pairs. Applying this pipeline to multiple 3D scene datasets, we create Mosaic3D-5.6M, a dataset of over 30K annotated scenes with 5.6M mask-text pairs, significantly larger than existing datasets. Building upon this data, we propose Mosaic3D, a foundation model combining a 3D encoder trained with contrastive learning and a lightweight mask decoder for open-vocabulary 3D semantic and instance segmentation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on open-vocabulary 3D semantic and instance segmentation tasks including ScanNet200, Matterport3D, and ScanNet++, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of our large-scale training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reliable failure detection holds paramount importance in safety-critical applications. Yet, neural networks are known to produce overconfident predictions for misclassified samples. As a result, it remains a problematic matter as existing confidence score functions rely on category-level signals, the logits, to detect failures. This research introduces an innovative strategy, leveraging human-level concepts for a dual purpose: to reliably detect when a model fails and to transparently interpret why. By integrating a nuanced array of signals for each category, our method enables a finer-grained assessment of the model's confidence. We present a simple yet highly effective approach based on the ordinal ranking of concept activation to the input image. Without bells and whistles, our method significantly reduce the false positive rate across diverse real-world image classification benchmarks, specifically by 3.7% on ImageNet and 9% on EuroSAT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihang Liu, Chen-Wei Xie, Bin Wen, Feiwu Yu, Jixuan Chen, Boqiang Zhang, Nianzu Yang, Pandeng Li, Yinglu Li, Zuan Gao, Yun Zheng, Hongtao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual captioning benchmarks have become outdated with the emergence of modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as the brief ground-truth sentences and traditional metrics fail to assess detailed captions effectively. While recent benchmarks attempt to address this by focusing on keyword extraction or object-centric evaluation, they remain limited to vague-view or object-view analyses and incomplete visual element coverage. In this paper, we introduce CAPability, a comprehensive multi-view benchmark for evaluating visual captioning across 12 dimensions spanning six critical views. We curate nearly 11K human-annotated images and videos with visual element annotations to evaluate the generated captions. CAPability stably assesses both the correctness and thoroughness of captions using F1-score. By converting annotations to QA pairs, we further introduce a heuristic metric, \textit{know but cannot tell} ($K\bar{T}$), indicating a significant performance gap between QA and caption capabilities. Our work provides the first holistic analysis of MLLMs' captioning abilities, as we identify their strengths and weaknesses across various dimensions, guiding future research to enhance specific aspects of capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqi Guo, Yiyang Du, Shan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Gas leakage poses a significant hazard that requires prevention. Traditionally, human inspection has been used for detection, a slow and labour-intensive process. Recent research has applied machine learning techniques to this problem, yet there remains a shortage of high-quality, publicly available datasets. This paper introduces a synthetic dataset, SimGas, featuring diverse backgrounds, interfering foreground objects, diverse leak locations, and precise segmentation ground truth. We propose a zero-shot method that combines background subtraction, zero-shot object detection, filtering, and segmentation to leverage this dataset. Experimental results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods based solely on background subtraction and zero-shot object detection with segmentation, reaching an IoU of 69%. We also present an analysis of various prompt configurations and threshold settings to provide deeper insights into the performance of our method. Finally, we qualitatively (because of the lack of ground truth) tested our performance on GasVid and reached decent results on the real-world dataset. The dataset, code, and full qualitative results are available at https://github.com/weathon/Lang-Gas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aysegul Ucar, Soumyadeep Ro, Sanapala Satwika, Pamarthi Yasoda Gayathri, Mohmmad Ghaith Balsha</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in artificial intelli-gence, capable of integrating textual and visual data for a unified understanding of complex scenes. While models such as Florence2, built on transformer architectures, have shown promise across general tasks, their performance in object detection within unstructured or cluttered environments remains underexplored. In this study, we fi-ne-tuned the Florence2 model for object detection tasks in non-constructed, complex environments. A comprehensive experimental framework was established involving multiple hardware configurations (NVIDIA T4, L4, and A100 GPUs), optimizers (AdamW, SGD), and varied hyperparameters including learning rates and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) setups. Model training and evaluation were conducted on challenging datasets representative of real-world, disordered settings. The optimized Florence2 models exhibited significant improvements in object detection accuracy, with Mean Average Precision (mAP) metrics approaching or matching those of estab-lished models such as YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10. The integration of LoRA and careful fine-tuning of transformer layers contributed notably to these gains. Our find-ings highlight the adaptability of transformer-based VLMs like Florence2 for do-main-specific tasks, particularly in visually complex environments. The study under-scores the potential of fine-tuned VLMs to rival traditional convolution-based detec-tors, offering a flexible and scalable approach for advanced vision applications in re-al-world, unstructured settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: DeepSeek R1, and o1 have demonstrated powerful reasoning capabilities in the text domain through stable large-scale reinforcement learning. To enable broader applications, some works have attempted to transfer these capabilities to multimodal reasoning. However, these efforts have been limited by the limited difficulty of selected tasks and relatively small training scales, making it challenging to demonstrate strong multimodal reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we introduce the MMK12 dataset and MM-EUREKA with 7B and 32B parameters. The former is a high-quality multimodal mathematics reasoning dataset featuring diverse knowledge domains with human-verified answers and solution processes. The latter is a multimodal model employing rule-based reinforcement learning on MMK12, utilizing online filtering and two-stage training strategy to enhance training stability. MM-EUREKA demonstrates remarkable performance gains in multimodal mathematical reasoning, outperforming previous powerful models like InternVL2.5-78B or InternVL2.5-38B-MPO. In particular, MM-EUREKA achieves competitive or superior performance compared to both open-source and closed-source models, and trails slightly behind o1 in multidisciplinary reasoning tasks. We open-source our complete pipeline to foster further research in this area. We release all our codes, models, data, etc. at https://github.com/ModalMinds/MM-EUREKA</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justus Karlsson, Yonghao Xu, Amanda Berg, Leif Haglund</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple studies have performed next-day fire prediction using satellite imagery. Two main satellites are used to detect wildfires: MODIS and VIIRS. Both satellites provide fire mask products, called MOD14 and VNP14, respectively. Studies have used one or the other, but there has been no comparison between them to determine which might be more suitable for next-day fire prediction. In this paper, we first evaluate how well VIIRS and MODIS data can be used to forecast wildfire spread one day ahead. We find that the model using VIIRS as input and VNP14 as target achieves the best results. Interestingly, the model using MODIS as input and VNP14 as target performs significantly better than using VNP14 as input and MOD14 as target. Next, we discuss why MOD14 might be harder to use for predicting next-day fires. We find that the MOD14 fire mask is highly stochastic and does not correlate with reasonable fire spread patterns. This is detrimental for machine learning tasks, as the model learns irrational patterns. Therefore, we conclude that MOD14 is unsuitable for next-day fire prediction and that VNP14 is a much better option. However, using MODIS input and VNP14 as target, we achieve a significant improvement in predictability. This indicates that an improved fire detection model is possible for MODIS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Utz, Stefan Vocht, Anne Tjorven Buessen, Dennis Possart, Fabian Wagner, Mareike Thies, Mingxuan Gu, Stefan Uderhardt, Katharina Breininger</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, numerous neural network architectures specifically designed for the instance segmentation of nuclei in microscopic images have been released. These models embed nuclei-specific priors to outperform generic architectures like U-Nets; however, they require large annotated datasets, which are often not available. Generative models (GANs, diffusion models) have been used to compensate for this by synthesizing training data. These two-stage approaches are computationally expensive, as first a generative model and then a segmentation model has to be trained. We propose CyclePose, a hybrid framework integrating synthetic data generation and segmentation training. CyclePose builds on a CycleGAN architecture, which allows unpaired translation between microscopy images and segmentation masks. We embed a segmentation model into CycleGAN and leverage a cycle consistency loss for self-supervision. Without annotated data, CyclePose outperforms other weakly or unsupervised methods on two public datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/jonasutz/CyclePose</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaofeng Liang, Runwei Guan, Wangwang Lian, Daizong Liu, Xiaolou Sun, Dongming Wu, Yutao Yue, Weiping Ding, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: As a significant application of multi-source information fusion in intelligent transportation perception systems, Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) involves localizing and tracking specific objects in video sequences based on language references. However, existing RMOT approaches often treat language descriptions as holistic embeddings and struggle to effectively integrate the rich semantic information contained in language expressions with visual features. This limitation is especially apparent in complex scenes requiring comprehensive understanding of both static object attributes and spatial motion information. In this paper, we propose a Cognitive Disentanglement for Referring Multi-Object Tracking (CDRMT) framework that addresses these challenges. It adapts the "what" and "where" pathways from the human visual processing system to RMOT tasks. Specifically, our framework first establishes cross-modal connections while preserving modality-specific characteristics. It then disentangles language descriptions and hierarchically injects them into object queries, refining object understanding from coarse to fine-grained semantic levels. Finally, we reconstruct language representations based on visual features, ensuring that tracked objects faithfully reflect the referring expression. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that CDRMT achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 6.0% in HOTA score on Refer-KITTI and 3.2% on Refer-KITTI-V2. Our approach advances the state-of-the-art in RMOT while simultaneously providing new insights into multi-source information fusion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models trained on vast amounts of data have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and generation capabilities in the domains of text, images, audio and video. Our goal at Roblox is to build such a foundation model for 3D intelligence, a model that can support developers in producing all aspects of a Roblox experience, from generating 3D objects and scenes to rigging characters for animation to producing programmatic scripts describing object behaviors. We discuss three key design requirements for such a 3D foundation model and then present our first step towards building such a model. We expect that 3D geometric shapes will be a core data type and describe our solution for 3D shape tokenizer. We show how our tokenization scheme can be used in applications for text-to-shape generation, shape-to-text generation and text-to-scene generation. We demonstrate how these applications can collaborate with existing large language models (LLMs) to perform scene analysis and reasoning. We conclude with a discussion outlining our path to building a fully unified foundation model for 3D intelligence.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16188">Think or Not Think: A Study of Explicit Thinking in Rule-Based Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Li, Jike Zhong, Shitian Zhao, Yuxiang Lai, Kaipeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the thinking process in rule-based reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RFT) for multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). We first propose CLS-RL for classification, using verifiable rewards to encourage MLLM thinking. Experiments show CLS-RL significantly outperforms SFT and yields a 'free-lunch' generalization effect (improving performance on unseen datasets after training on one dataset). We then question if this explicit thinking is always necessary for RFT. Challenging convention that explicit thinking is crucial for RFT, we introduce No-Thinking-RL, minimizing thinking via a simple equality accuracy reward. Experiments show No-Thinking-RL surpasses CLS-RL in in-domain and generalization abilities, with significantly less fine-tuning time. This suggests reducing thinking can improve MLLM fine-tuning efficiency and effectiveness for certain visual tasks. We hypothesize explicit thinking negatively impacts reward convergence during RFT. To test this, we propose the Think-After-Answerwer method to let models first output the answer and then generate thinking process to alliviate the negative impact of thinking. We further test No-Thinking-RL on diverse tasks (including math, spatial, puzzles) with 2B and 7B models. For 2B models, No-Thinking-RL outperforms thinking-based RFT for all tasks, even on math, with Think-After-Answerwer performing intermediately. For 7B models, performance is comparable on simple visual tasks, but RFT with thinking excels on complex reasoning (math). This implies when dealing with complex math problems, smaller models struggle with generating effective reasoning, hurting performance on complex tasks. Conversely, for simple visual tasks, thinking is not indispensable, and its removal can boost performance and reduce training time. We hope our findings offer insights for better understanding the effect of the thinking process in RFT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Shang, Zhenyu Li, Pengjie Xu, Zhaojun Deng, Ruirui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Environment description-based localization in large-scale point cloud maps constructed through remote sensing is critically significant for the advancement of large-scale autonomous systems, such as delivery robots operating in the last mile. However, current approaches encounter challenges due to the inability of point cloud encoders to effectively capture local details and long-range spatial relationships, as well as a significant modality gap between text and point cloud representations. To address these challenges, we present Des4Pos, a novel two-stage text-driven remote sensing localization framework. In the coarse stage, the point-cloud encoder utilizes the Multi-scale Fusion Attention Mechanism (MFAM) to enhance local geometric features, followed by a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module to strengthen global spatial relationships. Concurrently, the Stepped Text Encoder (STE) integrates cross-modal prior knowledge from CLIP [1] and aligns text and point-cloud features using this prior knowledge, effectively bridging modality discrepancies. In the fine stage, we introduce a Cascaded Residual Attention (CRA) module to fuse cross-modal features and predict relative localization offsets, thereby achieving greater localization precision. Experiments on the KITTI360Pose test set demonstrate that Des4Pos achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-point-cloud place recognition. Specifically, it attains a top-1 accuracy of 40% and a top-10 accuracy of 77% under a 5-meter radius threshold, surpassing the best existing methods by 7% and 7%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juncen Guo, Yang Liu, Xiaoguang Zhu, Lianlong Sun, Liangyu Teng, Jingyi Wu, Di Li, Wei Zhou, Liang Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new class knowledge while retaining previous classes, facilitating adaptation and evolution in dynamic, real-world environments. Traditional CIL methods primarily rely on visual features, which limits their effectiveness in complex, multimodal scenarios. In contrast, VLMs show promising potential for enhancing CIL by leveraging pre-trained knowledge and integrating multi-modal semantic cues such as text and vision. However, existing approaches struggle to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while preserving the generalization strengths of VLMs across diverse modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a Feature Calibration Enhanced Parameter Synthesis (FCPS) framework. Specifically, FCPS introduces a dynamic parameter adjustment mechanism that iteratively calibrates the contribution of original visual features to the final class decision, thus preserving the model's intrinsic generalization capability across modalities. Simultaneously, parameter integration enables effective knowledge transfer, maintaining a balance between acquiring new class representations and preserving old knowledge. Experimental results on popular benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR100 and ImageNet100) validate the superiority of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kibon Ku, Talukder Z Jubery, Elijah Rodriguez, Aditya Balu, Soumik Sarkar, Adarsh Krishnamurthy, Baskar Ganapathysubramanian</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a NeRF-based framework for point cloud (PCD) reconstruction, specifically designed for indoor high-throughput plant phenotyping facilities. Traditional NeRF-based reconstruction methods require cameras to move around stationary objects, but this approach is impractical for high-throughput environments where objects are rapidly imaged while moving on conveyors or rotating pedestals. To address this limitation, we develop a variant of NeRF-based PCD reconstruction that uses a single stationary camera to capture images as the object rotates on a pedestal. Our workflow comprises COLMAP-based pose estimation, a straightforward pose transformation to simulate camera movement, and subsequent standard NeRF training. A defined Region of Interest (ROI) excludes irrelevant scene data, enabling the generation of high-resolution point clouds (10M points). Experimental results demonstrate excellent reconstruction fidelity, with precision-recall analyses yielding an F-score close to 100.00 across all evaluated plant objects. Although pose estimation remains computationally intensive with a stationary camera setup, overall training and reconstruction times are competitive, validating the method's feasibility for practical high-throughput indoor phenotyping applications. Our findings indicate that high-quality NeRF-based 3D reconstructions are achievable using a stationary camera, eliminating the need for complex camera motion or costly imaging equipment. This approach is especially beneficial when employing expensive and delicate instruments, such as hyperspectral cameras, for 3D plant phenotyping. Future work will focus on optimizing pose estimation techniques and further streamlining the methodology to facilitate seamless integration into automated, high-throughput 3D phenotyping pipelines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Increasing attention has been placed on improving the reasoning capacities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). As the cornerstone for AI agents that function in the physical realm, video-based visual-spatial intelligence (VSI) emerges as one of the most pivotal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. This work conducts a first, in-depth study on improving the visual-spatial reasoning of MLLMs via R1-Zero-like training. Technically, we first identify that the visual-spatial reasoning capacities of small- to medium-sized Qwen2-VL models cannot be activated via Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts. We then incorporate GRPO training for improved visual-spatial reasoning, using the carefully curated VSI-100k dataset, following DeepSeek-R1-Zero. During the investigation, we identify the necessity to keep the KL penalty (even with a small value) in GRPO. With just 120 GPU hours, our vsGRPO-2B model, fine-tuned from Qwen2-VL-2B, can outperform the base model by 12.1% and surpass GPT-4o. Moreover, our vsGRPO-7B model, fine-tuned from Qwen2-VL-7B, achieves performance comparable to that of the best open-source model LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B. Additionally, we compare vsGRPO to supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization baselines and observe strong performance superiority. The code and dataset will be available soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhang, Robby T. Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained traction in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) due to their strong generalization capabilities. However, existing DGSS methods often rely exclusively on either VFMs or VLMs, overlooking their complementary strengths. VFMs (e.g., DINOv2) excel at capturing fine-grained features, while VLMs (e.g., CLIP) provide robust text alignment but struggle with coarse granularity. Despite their complementary strengths, effectively integrating VFMs and VLMs with attention mechanisms is challenging, as the increased patch tokens complicate long-sequence modeling. To address this, we propose MFuser, a novel Mamba-based fusion framework that efficiently combines the strengths of VFMs and VLMs while maintaining linear scalability in sequence length. MFuser consists of two key components: MVFuser, which acts as a co-adapter to jointly fine-tune the two models by capturing both sequential and spatial dynamics; and MTEnhancer, a hybrid attention-Mamba module that refines text embeddings by incorporating image priors. Our approach achieves precise feature locality and strong text alignment without incurring significant computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MFuser significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS methods, achieving 68.20 mIoU on synthetic-to-real and 71.87 mIoU on real-to-real benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenfeng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, the field of change detection (CD) in remote sensing imagery has achieved remarkable progress. Existing change detection methods primarily focus on achieving higher accuracy with increased computational costs and parameter sizes, leaving development of lightweight methods for rapid real-world processing an underexplored challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a Lightweight Difference Guiding Network (LDGNet), leveraging absolute difference image to guide optical remote sensing change detection. First, to enhance the feature representation capability of the lightweight backbone network, we propose the Difference Guiding Module (DGM), which leverages multi-scale features extracted from the absolute difference image to progressively influence the original image encoder at each layer, thereby reinforcing feature extraction. Second, we propose the Difference-Aware Dynamic Fusion (DADF) module with Visual State Space Model (VSSM) for lightweight long-range dependency modeling. The module first uses feature absolute differences to guide VSSM's global contextual modeling of change regions, then employs difference attention to dynamically fuse these long-range features with feature differences, enhancing change semantics while suppressing noise and background. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or superior performance to current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods requiring several times more computation, while maintaining only 3.43M parameters and 1.12G FLOPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinpeng Ding, Kui Zhang, Jianhua Han, Lanqing Hong, Hang Xu, Xiaomeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) helps reduce hallucinations in Video Multimodal Large Language Models (VLLMs), but its reliance on offline preference data limits adaptability and fails to capture true video-response misalignment. We propose Video Direct Preference Optimization (VDPO), an online preference learning framework that eliminates the need for preference annotation by leveraging video augmentations to generate rejected samples while keeping responses fixed. However, selecting effective augmentations is non-trivial, as some clips may be semantically identical to the original under specific prompts, leading to false rejections and disrupting alignment. To address this, we introduce Prompt-aware Multi-instance Learning VDPO (PaMi-VDPO), which selects augmentations based on prompt context. Instead of a single rejection, we construct a candidate set of augmented clips and apply a close-to-far selection strategy, initially ensuring all clips are semantically relevant while then prioritizing the most prompt-aware distinct clip. This allows the model to better capture meaningful visual differences, mitigating hallucinations, while avoiding false rejections, and improving alignment. PaMi-VDPOseamlessly integrates into existing VLLMs without additional parameters, GPT-4/human supervision. With only 10k SFT data, it improves the base model by 5.3% on VideoHallucer, surpassing GPT-4o, while maintaining stable performance on general video benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Kimi-VL, an efficient open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model (VLM) that offers advanced multimodal reasoning, long-context understanding, and strong agent capabilities - all while activating only 2.8B parameters in its language decoder (Kimi-VL-A3B). Kimi-VL demonstrates strong performance across challenging domains: as a general-purpose VLM, Kimi-VL excels in multi-turn agent tasks (e.g., OSWorld), matching flagship models. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable capabilities across diverse challenging vision language tasks, including college-level image and video comprehension, OCR, mathematical reasoning, and multi-image understanding. In comparative evaluations, it effectively competes with cutting-edge efficient VLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, and Gemma-3-12B-IT, while surpassing GPT-4o in several key domains. Kimi-VL also advances in processing long contexts and perceiving clearly. With a 128K extended context window, Kimi-VL can process diverse long inputs, achieving impressive scores of 64.5 on LongVideoBench and 35.1 on MMLongBench-Doc. Its native-resolution vision encoder, MoonViT, further allows it to see and understand ultra-high-resolution visual inputs, achieving 83.2 on InfoVQA and 34.5 on ScreenSpot-Pro, while maintaining lower computational cost for common tasks. Building upon Kimi-VL, we introduce an advanced long-thinking variant: Kimi-VL-Thinking. Developed through long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), this model exhibits strong long-horizon reasoning capabilities. It achieves scores of 61.7 on MMMU, 36.8 on MathVision, and 71.3 on MathVista while maintaining the compact 2.8B activated LLM parameters, setting a new standard for efficient multimodal thinking models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyu Liu, Kan Jiang, Murong Ma, Zhe Hou, Yun Lin, Jin Song Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Analyzing Fast, Frequent, and Fine-grained (F$^3$) events presents a significant challenge in video analytics and multi-modal LLMs. Current methods struggle to identify events that satisfy all the F$^3$ criteria with high accuracy due to challenges such as motion blur and subtle visual discrepancies. To advance research in video understanding, we introduce F$^3$Set, a benchmark that consists of video datasets for precise F$^3$ event detection. Datasets in F$^3$Set are characterized by their extensive scale and comprehensive detail, usually encompassing over 1,000 event types with precise timestamps and supporting multi-level granularity. Currently, F$^3$Set contains several sports datasets, and this framework may be extended to other applications as well. We evaluated popular temporal action understanding methods on F$^3$Set, revealing substantial challenges for existing techniques. Additionally, we propose a new method, F$^3$ED, for F$^3$ event detections, achieving superior performance. The dataset, model, and benchmark code are available at https://github.com/F3Set/F3Set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Lan, Ye Tao, Zhibiao Wang, Haoyang Yu, Wenhua Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Fire detection algorithms, particularly those based on computer vision, encounter significant challenges such as high computational costs and delayed response times, which hinder their application in real-time systems. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Light-YOLOv8-Flame, a lightweight flame detection algorithm specifically designed for fast and efficient real-time deployment. The proposed model enhances the YOLOv8 architecture through the substitution of the original C2f module with the FasterNet Block module. This new block combines Partial Convolution (PConv) and Convolution (Conv) layers, reducing both computational complexity and model size. A dataset comprising 7,431 images, representing both flame and non-flame scenarios, was collected and augmented for training purposes. Experimental findings indicate that the modified YOLOv8 model achieves a 0.78% gain in mean average precision (mAP) and a 2.05% boost in recall, while reducing the parameter count by 25.34%, with only a marginal decrease in precision by 0.82%. These findings highlight that Light-YOLOv8-Flame offers enhanced detection performance and speed, making it well-suited for real-time fire detection on resource-constrained devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongchang Wu, Zipeng Qi, Zhenwei Shi, Zhengxia Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable potential in novel view synthesis tasks. The divide-and-conquer paradigm has enabled large-scale scene reconstruction, but significant challenges remain in scene partitioning, optimization, and merging processes. This paper introduces BlockGaussian, a novel framework incorporating a content-aware scene partition strategy and visibility-aware block optimization to achieve efficient and high-quality large-scale scene reconstruction. Specifically, our approach considers the content-complexity variation across different regions and balances computational load during scene partitioning, enabling efficient scene reconstruction. To tackle the supervision mismatch issue during independent block optimization, we introduce auxiliary points during individual block optimization to align the ground-truth supervision, which enhances the reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-view geometry constraint that effectively mitigates rendering degradation caused by airspace floaters during block merging. Extensive experiments on large-scale scenes demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction efficiency and rendering quality, with a 5x speedup in optimization and an average PSNR improvement of 1.21 dB on multiple benchmarks. Notably, BlockGaussian significantly reduces computational requirements, enabling large-scale scene reconstruction on a single 24GB VRAM device.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaewoo Lee, Keyang Xuan, Chanakya Ekbote, Sandeep Polisetty, Yi R. Fung, Paul Pu Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable versatility in understanding diverse multimodal data and tasks. However, these capabilities come with an increased model scale. While post-training pruning reduces model size in unimodal models, its application to MLLMs often yields limited success. Our analysis discovers that conventional methods fail to account for the unique token attributes across layers and modalities inherent to MLLMs. Inspired by this observation, we propose TAMP, a simple yet effective pruning framework tailored for MLLMs, featuring two key components: (1) Diversity-Aware Sparsity, which adjusts sparsity ratio per layer based on diversities among multimodal output tokens, preserving more parameters in high-diversity layers; and (2) Adaptive Multimodal Input Activation, which identifies representative multimodal input tokens using attention scores to guide unstructured weight pruning. We validate our method on two state-of-the-art MLLMs: LLaVA-NeXT, designed for vision-language tasks, and VideoLLaMA2, capable of processing audio, visual, and language modalities. Empirical experiments across various multimodal evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that each component of our approach substantially outperforms existing pruning techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junlin Hao, Peiheng Wang, Haoyang Wang, Xinggong Zhang, Zongming Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-image 3D scene reconstruction presents significant challenges due to its inherently ill-posed nature and limited input constraints. Recent advances have explored two promising directions: multiview generative models that train on 3D consistent datasets but struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, and 3D scene inpainting and completion frameworks that suffer from cross-view inconsistency and suboptimal error handling, as they depend exclusively on depth data or 3D smoothness, which ultimately degrades output quality and computational performance. Building upon these approaches, we present GaussVideoDreamer, which advances generative multimedia approaches by bridging the gap between image, video, and 3D generation, integrating their strengths through two key innovations: (1) A progressive video inpainting strategy that harnesses temporal coherence for improved multiview consistency and faster convergence. (2) A 3D Gaussian Splatting consistency mask to guide the video diffusion with 3D consistent multiview evidence. Our pipeline combines three core components: a geometry-aware initialization protocol, Inconsistency-Aware Gaussian Splatting, and a progressive video inpainting strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves 32% higher LLaVA-IQA scores and at least 2x speedup compared to existing methods while maintaining robust performance across diverse scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nguyen Ngoc Dat, Tom Richardson, Matthew Watson, Kilian Meier, Jenna Kline, Sid Reid, Guy Maalouf, Duncan Hine, Majid Mirmehdi, Tilo Burghardt</p>
<p>Abstract: Live tracking of wildlife via high-resolution video processing directly onboard drones is widely unexplored and most existing solutions rely on streaming video to ground stations to support navigation. Yet, both autonomous animal-reactive flight control beyond visual line of sight and/or mission-specific individual and behaviour recognition tasks rely to some degree on this capability. In response, we introduce WildLive -- a near real-time animal detection and tracking framework for high-resolution imagery running directly onboard uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). The system performs multi-animal detection and tracking at 17fps+ for HD and 7fps+ on 4K video streams suitable for operation during higher altitude flights to minimise animal disturbance. Our system is optimised for Jetson Orin AGX onboard hardware. It integrates the efficiency of sparse optical flow tracking and mission-specific sampling with device-optimised and proven YOLO-driven object detection and segmentation techniques. Essentially, computational resource is focused onto spatio-temporal regions of high uncertainty to significantly improve UAV processing speeds without domain-specific loss of accuracy. Alongside, we introduce our WildLive dataset, which comprises 200k+ annotated animal instances across 19k+ frames from 4K UAV videos collected at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. All frames contain ground truth bounding boxes, segmentation masks, as well as individual tracklets and tracking point trajectories. We compare our system against current object tracking approaches including OC-SORT, ByteTrack, and SORT. Our materials are available at: https://dat-nguyenvn.github.io/WildLive/</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional text-based person ReID assumes that person descriptions from witnesses are complete and provided at once. However, in real-world scenarios, such descriptions are often partial or vague. To address this limitation, we introduce a new task called interactive person re-identification (Inter-ReID). Inter-ReID is a dialogue-based retrieval task that iteratively refines initial descriptions through ongoing interactions with the witnesses. To facilitate the study of this new task, we construct a dialogue dataset that incorporates multiple types of questions by decomposing fine-grained attributes of individuals. We further propose LLaVA-ReID, a question model that generates targeted questions based on visual and textual contexts to elicit additional details about the target person. Leveraging a looking-forward strategy, we prioritize the most informative questions as supervision during training. Experimental results on both Inter-ReID and text-based ReID benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-ReID significantly outperforms baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaushik Bhargav Sivangi, Idris Zakariyya, Paul Henderson, Fani Deligianni</p>
<p>Abstract: Human pose estimation (HPE) has become essential in numerous applications including healthcare, activity recognition, and human-computer interaction. However, the privacy implications of processing sensitive visual data present significant deployment barriers in critical domains. While traditional anonymization techniques offer limited protection and often compromise data utility for broader motion analysis, Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal privacy guarantees but typically degrades model performance when applied naively. In this work, we present the first differentially private 2D human pose estimation (2D-HPE) by applying Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) to this task. To effectively balance privacy with performance, we adopt Projected DP-SGD (PDP-SGD), which projects the noisy gradients to a low-dimensional subspace. Additionally, we adapt TinyViT, a compact and efficient vision transformer for coordinate classification in HPE, providing a lightweight yet powerful backbone that enhances privacy-preserving deployment feasibility on resource-limited devices. Our approach is particularly valuable for multimedia interpretation tasks, enabling privacy-safe analysis and understanding of human motion across diverse visual media while preserving the semantic meaning required for downstream applications. Comprehensive experiments on the MPII Human Pose Dataset demonstrate significant performance enhancement with PDP-SGD achieving 78.48% PCKh@0.5 at a strict privacy budget ($\epsilon=0.2$), compared to 63.85% for standard DP-SGD. This work lays foundation for privacy-preserving human pose estimation in real-world, sensitive applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengdi Wang, Efe Bozkir, Enkelejda Kasneci</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments in hardware, computer graphics, and AI may soon enable AR/VR head-mounted displays (HMDs) to become everyday devices like smartphones and tablets. Eye trackers within HMDs provide a special opportunity for such setups as it is possible to facilitate gaze-based research and interaction. However, estimating users' gaze information often requires raw eye images and videos that contain iris textures, which are considered a gold standard biometric for user authentication, and this raises privacy concerns. Previous research in the eye-tracking community focused on obfuscating iris textures while keeping utility tasks such as gaze estimation accurate. Despite these attempts, there is no comprehensive benchmark that evaluates state-of-the-art approaches. Considering all, in this paper, we benchmark blurring, noising, downsampling, rubber sheet model, and iris style transfer to obfuscate user identity, and compare their impact on image quality, privacy, utility, and risk of imposter attack on two datasets. We use eye segmentation and gaze estimation as utility tasks, and reduction in iris recognition accuracy as a measure of privacy protection, and false acceptance rate to estimate risk of attack. Our experiments show that canonical image processing methods like blurring and noising cause a marginal impact on deep learning-based tasks. While downsampling, rubber sheet model, and iris style transfer are effective in hiding user identifiers, iris style transfer, with higher computation cost, outperforms others in both utility tasks, and is more resilient against spoof attacks. Our analyses indicate that there is no universal optimal approach to balance privacy, utility, and computation burden. Therefore, we recommend practitioners consider the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, and possible combinations of those to reach an optimal privacy-utility trade-off.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Sun, Fenggen Yu, Huiyao Xu, Tao Zhang, Changqing Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) in low-light scenes remains a significant challenge due to degraded inputs characterized by severe noise, low dynamic range (LDR) and unreliable initialization. While recent NeRF-based approaches have shown promising results, most suffer from high computational costs, and some rely on carefully captured or pre-processed data--such as RAW sensor inputs or multi-exposure sequences--which severely limits their practicality. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with competitive visual fidelity; however, existing 3DGS-based methods struggle with low-light sRGB inputs, resulting in unstable Gaussian initialization and ineffective noise suppression. To address these challenges, we propose LL-Gaussian, a novel framework for 3D reconstruction and enhancement from low-light sRGB images, enabling pseudo normal-light novel view synthesis. Our method introduces three key innovations: 1) an end-to-end Low-Light Gaussian Initialization Module (LLGIM) that leverages dense priors from learning-based MVS approach to generate high-quality initial point clouds; 2) a dual-branch Gaussian decomposition model that disentangles intrinsic scene properties (reflectance and illumination) from transient interference, enabling stable and interpretable optimization; 3) an unsupervised optimization strategy guided by both physical constrains and diffusion prior to jointly steer decomposition and enhancement. Additionally, we contribute a challenging dataset collected in extreme low-light environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of LL-Gaussian. Compared to state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods, LL-Gaussian achieves up to 2,000 times faster inference and reduces training time to just 2%, while delivering superior reconstruction and rendering quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingchuan Ma, Yuhao Zhou, Jindi Lv, Yuxin Tian, Dan Si, Shujian Li, Qing Ye, Jiancheng Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: Online class-incremental learning aims to enable models to continuously adapt to new classes with limited access to past data, while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Replay-based methods address this by maintaining a small memory buffer of previous samples, achieving competitive performance. For effective replay under constrained storage, recent approaches leverage distilled data to enhance the informativeness of memory. However, such approaches often involve significant computational overhead due to the use of bi-level optimization. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce Grid-based Patch Sampling (GPS), a lightweight and effective strategy for distilling informative memory samples without relying on a trainable model. GPS generates informative samples by sampling a subset of pixels from the original image, yielding compact low-resolution representations that preserve both semantic content and structural information. During replay, these representations are reassembled to support training and evaluation. Experiments on extensive benchmarks demonstrate that GRS can be seamlessly integrated into existing replay frameworks, leading to 3%-4% improvements in average end accuracy under memory-constrained settings, with limited computational overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing efforts in building Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents largely rely on the training paradigm of supervised fine-tuning on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, this approach not only demands extensive amounts of training data but also struggles to effectively understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. The issue significantly limits its application in real-world scenarios, especially for high-level tasks. Inspired by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), which efficiently enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models in real-world settings, we propose \name, the first reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the GUI capabilities of LVLMs in high-level real-world task scenarios, through unified action space rule modeling. By leveraging a small amount of carefully curated high-quality data across multiple platforms (including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and Web) and employing policy optimization algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update the model, \name achieves superior performance using only 0.02\% of the data (3K vs. 13M) compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like OS-Atlas across eight benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web). These results demonstrate the immense potential of reinforcement learning based on unified action space rule modeling in improving the execution capabilities of LVLMs for real-world GUI agent tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce InternVL3, a significant advancement in the InternVL series featuring a native multimodal pre-training paradigm. Rather than adapting a text-only large language model (LLM) into a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that supports visual inputs, InternVL3 jointly acquires multimodal and linguistic capabilities from both diverse multimodal data and pure-text corpora during a single pre-training stage. This unified training paradigm effectively addresses the complexities and alignment challenges commonly encountered in conventional post-hoc training pipelines for MLLMs. To further improve performance and scalability, InternVL3 incorporates variable visual position encoding (V2PE) to support extended multimodal contexts, employs advanced post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed preference optimization (MPO), and adopts test-time scaling strategies alongside an optimized training infrastructure. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that InternVL3 delivers superior performance across a wide range of multi-modal tasks. In particular, InternVL3-78B achieves a score of 72.2 on the MMMU benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs. Its capabilities remain highly competitive with leading proprietary models, including ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also maintaining strong pure-language proficiency. In pursuit of open-science principles, we will publicly release both the training data and model weights to foster further research and development in next-generation MLLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a practical solution to implement privacy-preserving CNN training based on mere Homomorphic Encryption (HE) technique. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt successfully to crack this nut and no work ever before has achieved this goal. Several techniques combine to accomplish the task:: (1) with transfer learning, privacy-preserving CNN training can be reduced to homomorphic neural network training, or even multiclass logistic regression (MLR) training; (2) via a faster gradient variant called $\texttt{Quadratic Gradient}$, an enhanced gradient method for MLR with a state-of-the-art performance in convergence speed is applied in this work to achieve high performance; (3) we employ the thought of transformation in mathematics to transform approximating Softmax function in the encryption domain to the approximation of the Sigmoid function. A new type of loss function termed $\texttt{Squared Likelihood Error}$ has been developed alongside to align with this change.; and (4) we use a simple but flexible matrix-encoding method named $\texttt{Volley Revolver}$ to manage the data flow in the ciphertexts, which is the key factor to complete the whole homomorphic CNN training. The complete, runnable C++ code to implement our work can be found at: \href{https://github.com/petitioner/HE.CNNtraining}{$\texttt{https://github.com/petitioner/HE.CNNtraining}$}. We select $\texttt{REGNET\_X\_400MF}$ as our pre-trained model for transfer learning. We use the first 128 MNIST training images as training data and the whole MNIST testing dataset as the testing data. The client only needs to upload 6 ciphertexts to the cloud and it takes $\sim 21$ mins to perform 2 iterations on a cloud with 64 vCPUs, resulting in a precision of $21.49\%$.</p>

Recent advancements have made these models applicable across various fields without data constraints, offering new opportunities for general artificial intelligence. However, applying these models can be challenging due to their often task-specific, standalone nature and the technical barriers involved. To address this challenge, we develop AwesomeMeta+, a prototyping and learning system designed to standardize the key components of meta-learning within the context of systems engineering. It standardizes different components of meta-learning and uses a building block metaphor to assist in model construction. By employing a modular, building-block approach, AwesomeMeta+ facilitates the construction of meta-learning models that can be adapted and optimized for specific application needs in real-world systems. The system is developed to support the full lifecycle of meta-learning system engineering, from design to deployment, by enabling users to assemble compatible algorithmic modules. We evaluate AwesomeMeta+ through feedback from 50 researchers and a series of machine-based tests and user studies. The results demonstrate that AwesomeMeta+ enhances users' understanding of meta-learning principles, accelerates system engineering processes, and provides valuable decision-making support for efficient deployment of meta-learning systems in complex application scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Sha, Yao Mu, Yuxuan Jiang, Li Chen, Chenfeng Xu, Ping Luo, Shengbo Eben Li, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Wei Zhan, Mingyu Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing learning-based autonomous driving (AD) systems face challenges in comprehending high-level information, generalizing to rare events, and providing interpretability. To address these problems, this work employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as a decision-making component for complex AD scenarios that require human commonsense understanding. We devise cognitive pathways to enable comprehensive reasoning with LLMs, and develop algorithms for translating LLM decisions into actionable driving commands. Through this approach, LLM decisions are seamlessly integrated with low-level controllers by guided parameter matrix adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method not only consistently surpasses baseline approaches in single-vehicle tasks, but also helps handle complex driving behaviors even multi-vehicle coordination, thanks to the commonsense reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This paper presents an initial step toward leveraging LLMs as effective decision-makers for intricate AD scenarios in terms of safety, efficiency, generalizability, and interoperability. We aspire for it to serve as inspiration for future research in this field. Project page: https://sites.google.com/view/llm-mpc</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Soto, Matthew Reimherr, Aleksandra Slavkovic, Mark Shriver</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of releasing a Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) 3D human face. The human face is a complex structure with many features and inherently tied to one's identity. Protecting this data, in a formally private way, is important yet challenging given the dimensionality of the problem. We extend approximate DP techniques for functional data to the GDP framework. We further propose a novel representation, face radial curves, of a 3D face as a set of functions and then utilize our proposed GDP functional data mechanism. To preserve the shape of the face while injecting noise we rely on tools from shape analysis for our novel representation of the face. We show that our method preserves the shape of the average face and injects less noise than traditional methods for the same privacy budget. Our mechanism consists of two primary components, the first is generally applicable to function value summaries (as are commonly found in nonparametric statistics or functional data analysis) while the second is general to disk-like surfaces and hence more applicable than just to human faces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kehan Chen, Dong An, Yan Huang, Rongtao Xu, Yifei Su, Yonggen Ling, Ian Reid, Liang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the task of Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) under the zero-shot setting. Zero-shot VLN-CE is particularly challenging due to the absence of expert demonstrations for training and minimal environment structural prior to guide navigation. To confront these challenges, we propose a Constraint-Aware Navigator (CA-Nav), which reframes zero-shot VLN-CE as a sequential, constraint-aware sub-instruction completion process. CA-Nav continuously translates sub-instructions into navigation plans using two core modules: the Constraint-Aware Sub-instruction Manager (CSM) and the Constraint-Aware Value Mapper (CVM). CSM defines the completion criteria for decomposed sub-instructions as constraints and tracks navigation progress by switching sub-instructions in a constraint-aware manner. CVM, guided by CSM's constraints, generates a value map on the fly and refines it using superpixel clustering to improve navigation stability. CA-Nav achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two VLN-CE benchmarks, surpassing the previous best method by 12 percent and 13 percent in Success Rate on the validation unseen splits of R2R-CE and RxR-CE, respectively. Moreover, CA-Nav demonstrates its effectiveness in real-world robot deployments across various indoor scenes and instructions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumyendu Sarkar, Ashwin Ramesh Babu, Sajad Mousavi, Vineet Gundecha, Sahand Ghorbanpour, Avisek Naug, Ricardo Luna Gutierrez, Antonio Guillen</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a Reinforcement Learning Platform for Adversarial Black-box untargeted and targeted attacks, RLAB, that allows users to select from various distortion filters to create adversarial examples. The platform uses a Reinforcement Learning agent to add minimum distortion to input images while still causing misclassification by the target model. The agent uses a novel dual-action method to explore the input image at each step to identify sensitive regions for adding distortions while removing noises that have less impact on the target model. This dual action leads to faster and more efficient convergence of the attack. The platform can also be used to measure the robustness of image classification models against specific distortion types. Also, retraining the model with adversarial samples significantly improved robustness when evaluated on benchmark datasets. The proposed platform outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of the average number of queries required to cause misclassification. This advances trustworthiness with a positive social impact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Zhao, Linfeng Feng, Dongxu Ge, Rujin Chen, Fangqiu Yi, Chi Zhang, Xiao-Lei Zhang, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of diffusion models, audio-video generation has been revolutionized. However, most existing methods rely on separate modules for each modality, with limited exploration of unified generative architectures. In addition, many are confined to a single task and small-scale datasets. To address these limitations, we first propose UniForm, a unified multi-task diffusion transformer that jointly generates audio and visual modalities in a shared latent space. A single diffusion process models both audio and video, capturing the inherent correlations between sound and vision. Second, we introduce task-specific noise schemes and task tokens, enabling a single model to support multiple tasks, including text-to-audio-video, audio-to-video, and video-to-audio generation. Furthermore, by leveraging large language models and a large-scale text-audio-video combined dataset, UniForm achieves greater generative diversity than prior approaches. Extensive experiments show that UniForm achieves the state-of-the-art performance across audio-video generation tasks, producing content that is both well-aligned and close to real-world data distributions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steeven Janny, Herv\'e Poirier, Leonid Antsfeld, Guillaume Bono, Gianluca Monaci, Boris Chidlovskii, Francesco Giuliari, Alessio Del Bue, Christian Wolf</p>
<p>Abstract: Progress in Embodied AI has made it possible for end-to-end-trained agents to navigate in photo-realistic environments with high-level reasoning and zero-shot or language-conditioned behavior, but benchmarks are still dominated by simulation. In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miguel Espinosa, Valerio Marsocci, Yuru Jia, Elliot J. Crowley, Mikolaj Czerkawski</p>
<p>Abstract: In remote sensing, multi-modal data from various sensors capturing the same scene offers rich opportunities, but learning a unified representation across these modalities remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods have often been limited to single or dual-modality approaches. In this paper, we introduce COP-GEN-Beta, a generative diffusion model trained on optical, radar, and elevation data from the Major TOM dataset. What sets COP-GEN-Beta apart is its ability to map any subset of modalities to any other, enabling zero-shot modality translation after training. This is achieved through a sequence-based diffusion transformer, where each modality is controlled by its own timestep embedding. We extensively evaluate COP-GEN-Beta on thumbnail images from the Major TOM dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality samples. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations validate the model's performance, highlighting its potential as a powerful pre-trained model for future remote sensing tasks.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08626">Task-conditioned Ensemble of Expert Models for Continuous Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Renu Sharma, Debasmita Pal, Arun Ross</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the major challenges in machine learning is maintaining the accuracy of the deployed model (e.g., a classifier) in a non-stationary environment. The non-stationary environment results in distribution shifts and, consequently, a degradation in accuracy. Continuous learning of the deployed model with new data could be one remedy. However, the question arises as to how we should update the model with new training data so that it retains its accuracy on the old data while adapting to the new data. In this work, we propose a task-conditioned ensemble of models to maintain the performance of the existing model. The method involves an ensemble of expert models based on task membership information. The in-domain models-based on the local outlier concept (different from the expert models) provide task membership information dynamically at run-time to each probe sample. To evaluate the proposed method, we experiment with three setups: the first represents distribution shift between tasks (LivDet-Iris-2017), the second represents distribution shift both between and within tasks (LivDet-Iris-2020), and the third represents disjoint distribution between tasks (Split MNIST). The experiments highlight the benefits of the proposed method. The source code is available at https://github.com/iPRoBe-lab/Continuous_Learning_FE_DM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyue Zhang, Jianfang Li, Jiaxu Zhang, Jianqiang Ren, Liefeng Bo, Zhigang Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked modeling framework has shown promise in co-speech motion generation. However, it struggles to identify semantically significant frames for effective motion masking. In this work, we propose a speech-queried attention-based mask modeling framework for co-speech motion generation. Our key insight is to leverage motion-aligned speech features to guide the masked motion modeling process, selectively masking rhythm-related and semantically expressive motion frames. Specifically, we first propose a motion-audio alignment module (MAM) to construct a latent motion-audio joint space. In this space, both low-level and high-level speech features are projected, enabling motion-aligned speech representation using learnable speech queries. Then, a speech-queried attention mechanism (SQA) is introduced to compute frame-level attention scores through interactions between motion keys and speech queries, guiding selective masking toward motion frames with high attention scores. Finally, the motion-aligned speech features are also injected into the generation network to facilitate co-speech motion generation. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations confirm that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, successfully producing high-quality co-speech motion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Si-Tong Wei, Rui-Huan Wang, Chuan-Zhi Zhou, Baoquan Chen, Peng-Shuai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive models have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet their performance in 3D shape generation lags significantly behind that of diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce OctGPT, a novel multiscale autoregressive model for 3D shape generation that dramatically improves the efficiency and performance of prior 3D autoregressive approaches, while rivaling or surpassing state-of-the-art diffusion models. Our method employs a serialized octree representation to efficiently capture the hierarchical and spatial structures of 3D shapes. Coarse geometry is encoded via octree structures, while fine-grained details are represented by binary tokens generated using a vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE), transforming 3D shapes into compact multiscale binary sequences suitable for autoregressive prediction. To address the computational challenges of handling long sequences, we incorporate octree-based transformers enhanced with 3D rotary positional encodings, scale-specific embeddings, and token-parallel generation schemes. These innovations reduce training time by 13 folds and generation time by 69 folds, enabling the efficient training of high-resolution 3D shapes, e.g.,$1024^3$, on just four NVIDIA 4090 GPUs only within days. OctGPT showcases exceptional versatility across various tasks, including text-, sketch-, and image-conditioned generation, as well as scene-level synthesis involving multiple objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OctGPT accelerates convergence and improves generation quality over prior autoregressive methods, offering a new paradigm for high-quality, scalable 3D content creation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junlei Zhang, Zichen Ding, Chang Ma, Zijie Chen, Qiushi Sun, Zhenzhong Lan, Junxian He</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents offer cross-platform solutions for automating complex digital tasks, with significant potential to transform productivity workflows. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity of high-quality trajectory data. To address this limitation, we propose training Vision Language Models (VLMs) on data-rich, reasoning-intensive tasks during a dedicated mid-training stage, and then examine how incorporating these tasks facilitates generalization to GUI planning scenarios. Specifically, we explore a range of tasks with readily available instruction-tuning data, including GUI perception, multimodal reasoning, and textual reasoning. Through extensive experiments across 11 mid-training tasks, we demonstrate that: (1) Task generalization proves highly effective, yielding substantial improvements across most settings. For instance, multimodal mathematical reasoning enhances performance on AndroidWorld by an absolute 6.3%. Remarkably, text-only mathematical data significantly boosts GUI web agent performance, achieving a 5.6% improvement on WebArena and 5.4% improvement on AndroidWorld, underscoring notable cross-modal generalization from text-based to visual domains; (2) Contrary to prior assumptions, GUI perception data - previously considered closely aligned with GUI agent tasks and widely utilized for training - has a comparatively limited impact on final performance; (3) Building on these insights, we identify the most effective mid-training tasks and curate optimized mixture datasets, resulting in absolute performance gains of 8.0% on WebArena and 12.2% on AndroidWorld. Our work provides valuable insights into cross-domain knowledge transfer for GUI agents and offers a practical approach to addressing data scarcity challenges in this emerging field.
