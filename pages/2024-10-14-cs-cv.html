<p><b>Authors:</b> Nhan T. Luu, Thang C. Truong, Duong T. Luu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, offering advantages such as low energy consumption and small memory footprint. However, their practical adoption is constrained by several challenges, prominently among them being performance optimization. In this study, we present a novel approach to enhance the performance of SNNs through a new encoding method that exploits bit planes derived from various color models of input image data for spike encoding. Our proposed technique is designed to improve the computational accuracy of SNNs compared to conventional methods without increasing model size. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our encoding strategy in achieving performance gain across multiple computer vision tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research endeavor applying color spaces within the context of SNNs. By leveraging the unique characteristics of color spaces, we hope to unlock new potentials in SNNs performance, potentially paving the way for more efficient and effective SNNs models in future researches and applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahriar Ahmad Fahim</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid urbanization in megacities around the world, like Dhaka, has caused numerous transportation challenges that need to be addressed. Emerging technologies of deep learning and artificial intelligence can help us solve these problems to move towards Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in the city. The government of Bangladesh recognizes the integration of ITS to ensure smart mobility as a vital step towards the development plan "Smart Bangladesh Vision 2041", but faces challenges in understanding ITS, its effects, and directions to implement. A vehicle detection system can pave the way to understanding traffic congestion, finding mobility patterns, and ensuring traffic surveillance. So, this paper proposes a fine-tuned object detector, the YOLOv9 model to detect native vehicles trained on a Bangladesh-based dataset. Results show that the fine-tuned YOLOv9 model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.934 at the Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold of 0.5, achieving state-of-the-art performance over past studies on Bangladesh-based datasets, shown through a comparison. Later, by suggesting the model to be deployed on CCTVs (closed circuit television) on the roads, a conceptual technique is proposed to process the vehicle detection model output data in a graph structure creating a vehicle detection system in the city. Finally, applications of such vehicle detection system are discussed showing a framework on how it can solve further ITS research questions, to provide a rationale for policymakers to implement the proposed vehicle detection system in the city.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyi Cao, Shanyan Guan, Yanhao Ge, Wei Li, Xiaokang Yang, Chao Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: While humans effortlessly discern intrinsic dynamics and adapt to new scenarios, modern AI systems often struggle. Current methods for visual grounding of dynamics either use pure neural-network-based simulators (black box), which may violate physical laws, or traditional physical simulators (white box), which rely on expert-defined equations that may not fully capture actual dynamics. We propose the Neural Material Adaptor (NeuMA), which integrates existing physical laws with learned corrections, facilitating accurate learning of actual dynamics while maintaining the generalizability and interpretability of physical priors. Additionally, we propose Particle-GS, a particle-driven 3D Gaussian Splatting variant that bridges simulation and observed images, allowing back-propagate image gradients to optimize the simulator. Comprehensive experiments on various dynamics in terms of grounded particle accuracy, dynamic rendering quality, and generalization ability demonstrate that NeuMA can accurately capture intrinsic dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prasanna Mayilvahanan, Roland S. Zimmermann, Thadd\"aus Wiedemer, Evgenia Rusak, Attila Juhos, Matthias Bethge, Wieland Brendel</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-Domain (OOD) generalization is the ability of a model trained on one or more domains to generalize to unseen domains. In the ImageNet era of computer vision, evaluation sets for measuring a model's OOD performance were designed to be strictly OOD with respect to style. However, the emergence of foundation models and expansive web-scale datasets has obfuscated this evaluation process, as datasets cover a broad range of domains and risk test domain contamination. In search of the forgotten domain generalization, we create large-scale datasets subsampled from LAION -- LAION-Natural and LAION-Rendition -- that are strictly OOD to corresponding ImageNet and DomainNet test sets in terms of style. Training CLIP models on these datasets reveals that a significant portion of their performance is explained by in-domain examples. This indicates that the OOD generalization challenges from the ImageNet era still prevail and that training on web-scale data merely creates the illusion of OOD generalization. Furthermore, through a systematic exploration of combining natural and rendition datasets in varying proportions, we identify optimal mixing ratios for model generalization across these domains. Our datasets and results re-enable meaningful assessment of OOD robustness at scale -- a crucial prerequisite for improving model robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuheng Wang, Yukai Shi, Jiarong Ou, Rui Chen, Ke Lin, Jiahao Wang, Boyuan Jiang, Haotian Yang, Mingwu Zheng, Xin Tao, Fei Yang, Pengfei Wan, Di Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: As visual generation technologies continue to advance, the scale of video datasets has expanded rapidly, and the quality of these datasets is critical to the performance of video generation models. We argue that temporal splitting, detailed captions, and video quality filtering are three key factors that determine dataset quality. However, existing datasets exhibit various limitations in these areas. To address these challenges, we introduce Koala-36M, a large-scale, high-quality video dataset featuring accurate temporal splitting, detailed captions, and superior video quality. The core of our approach lies in improving the consistency between fine-grained conditions and video content. Specifically, we employ a linear classifier on probability distributions to enhance the accuracy of transition detection, ensuring better temporal consistency. We then provide structured captions for the splitted videos, with an average length of 200 words, to improve text-video alignment. Additionally, we develop a Video Training Suitability Score (VTSS) that integrates multiple sub-metrics, allowing us to filter high-quality videos from the original corpus. Finally, we incorporate several metrics into the training process of the generation model, further refining the fine-grained conditions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our data processing pipeline and the quality of the proposed Koala-36M dataset. Our dataset and code will be released at https://koala36m.github.io/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinbin Bai, Tian Ye, Wei Chow, Enxin Song, Qing-Guo Chen, Xiangtai Li, Zhen Dong, Lei Zhu, Shuicheng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have made significant strides in visual generation, yet their paradigm remains fundamentally different from autoregressive language models, complicating the development of unified language-vision models. Recent efforts like LlamaGen have attempted autoregressive image generation using discrete VQVAE tokens, but the large number of tokens involved renders this approach inefficient and slow. In this work, we present Meissonic, which elevates non-autoregressive masked image modeling (MIM) text-to-image to a level comparable with state-of-the-art diffusion models like SDXL. By incorporating a comprehensive suite of architectural innovations, advanced positional encoding strategies, and optimized sampling conditions, Meissonic substantially improves MIM's performance and efficiency. Additionally, we leverage high-quality training data, integrate micro-conditions informed by human preference scores, and employ feature compression layers to further enhance image fidelity and resolution. Our model not only matches but often exceeds the performance of existing models like SDXL in generating high-quality, high-resolution images. Extensive experiments validate Meissonic's capabilities, demonstrating its potential as a new standard in text-to-image synthesis. We release a model checkpoint capable of producing $1024 \times 1024$ resolution images.</p>

<p>Abstract: Low-Latency and Low-Power Edge AI is essential for Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality applications. Recent advances show that hybrid models, combining convolution layers (CNN) and transformers (ViT), often achieve superior accuracy/performance tradeoff on various computer vision and machine learning (ML) tasks. However, hybrid ML models can pose system challenges for latency and energy-efficiency due to their diverse nature in dataflow and memory access patterns. In this work, we leverage the architecture heterogeneity from Neural Processing Units (NPU) and Compute-In-Memory (CIM) and perform diverse execution schemas to efficiently execute these hybrid models. We also introduce H4H-NAS, a Neural Architecture Search framework to design efficient hybrid CNN/ViT models for heterogeneous edge systems with both NPU and CIM. Our H4H-NAS approach is powered by a performance estimator built with NPU performance results measured on real silicon, and CIM performance based on industry IPs. H4H-NAS searches hybrid CNN/ViT models with fine granularity and achieves significant (up to 1.34%) top-1 accuracy improvement on ImageNet dataset. Moreover, results from our Algo/HW co-design reveal up to 56.08% overall latency and 41.72% energy improvements by introducing such heterogeneous computing over baseline solutions. The framework guides the design of hybrid network architectures and system architectures of NPU+CIM heterogeneous systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miguel Carrasco, Cesar Gonzalez-Martin, Sonia Navajas-Torrente, Raul Dastres</p>
<p>Abstract: Images are capable of conveying emotions, but emotional experience is highly subjective. Advances in artificial intelligence have enabled the generation of images based on emotional descriptions. However, the level of agreement between the generative images and human emotional responses has not yet been evaluated. To address this, 20 artistic landscapes were generated using StyleGAN2-ADA. Four variants evoking positive emotions (contentment, amusement) and negative emotions (fear, sadness) were created for each image, resulting in 80 pictures. An online questionnaire was designed using this material, in which 61 observers classified the generated images. Statistical analyses were performed on the collected data to determine the level of agreement among participants, between the observer's responses, and the AI-generated emotions. A generally good level of agreement was found, with better results for negative emotions. However, the study confirms the subjectivity inherent in emotional evaluation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08405">AgroGPT: Efficient Agricultural Vision-Language Model with Expert Tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Awais, Ali Husain Salem Abdulla Alharthi, Amandeep Kumar, Hisham Cholakkal, Rao Muhammad Anwer</p>
<p>Abstract: Significant progress has been made in advancing large multimodal conversational models (LMMs), capitalizing on vast repositories of image-text data available online. Despite this progress, these models often encounter substantial domain gaps, hindering their ability to engage in complex conversations across new domains. Recent efforts have aimed to mitigate this issue, albeit relying on domain-specific image-text data to curate instruction-tuning data. However, many domains, such as agriculture, lack such vision-language data. In this work, we propose an approach to construct instruction-tuning data that harnesses vision-only data for the agriculture domain. We utilize diverse agricultural datasets spanning multiple domains, curate class-specific information, and employ large language models (LLMs) to construct an expert-tuning set, resulting in a 70k expert-tuning dataset called AgroInstruct. Subsequently, we expert-tuned and created AgroGPT, an efficient LMM that can hold complex agriculture-related conversations and provide useful insights. We also develop AgroEvals for evaluation and compare {AgroGPT's} performance with large open and closed-source models. {AgroGPT} excels at identifying fine-grained agricultural concepts, can act as an agriculture expert, and provides helpful information for multimodal agriculture questions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vung Pham, Lan Dong Thi Ngoc, Duy-Linh Bui</p>
<p>Abstract: Maintaining roadway infrastructure is essential for ensuring a safe, efficient, and sustainable transportation system. However, manual data collection for detecting road damage is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and poses safety risks. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, offer a promising solution for automating this process using road images. This paper presents a comprehensive workflow for road damage detection using deep learning models, focusing on optimizations for inference speed while preserving detection accuracy. Specifically, to accommodate hardware limitations, large images are cropped, and lightweight models are utilized. Additionally, an external pothole dataset is incorporated to enhance the detection of this underrepresented damage class. The proposed approach employs multiple model architectures, including a custom YOLOv7 model with Coordinate Attention layers and a Tiny YOLOv7 model, which are trained and combined to maximize detection performance. The models are further reparameterized to optimize inference efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the ensemble of the custom YOLOv7 model with three Coordinate Attention layers and the default Tiny YOLOv7 model achieves an F1 score of 0.7027 with an inference speed of 0.0547 seconds per image. The complete pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, and inference scripts, is publicly available on the project's GitHub repository, enabling reproducibility and facilitating further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Liu, Xuyang Yan, Zekun Zhang, Cheng Ding, Tianhao Zhao, Shaya Jannati, Cynthia Martinez, Dietrich Stout</p>
<p>Abstract: Action recognition has witnessed the development of a growing number of novel algorithms and datasets in the past decade. However, the majority of public benchmarks were constructed around activities of daily living and annotated at a rather coarse-grained level, which lacks diversity in domain-specific datasets, especially for rarely seen domains. In this paper, we introduced Human Stone Toolmaking Action Grammar (HSTAG), a meticulously annotated video dataset showcasing previously undocumented stone toolmaking behaviors, which can be used for investigating the applications of advanced artificial intelligence techniques in understanding a rapid succession of complex interactions between two hand-held objects. HSTAG consists of 18,739 video clips that record 4.5 hours of experts' activities in stone toolmaking. Its unique features include (i) brief action durations and frequent transitions, mirroring the rapid changes inherent in many motor behaviors; (ii) multiple angles of view and switches among multiple tools, increasing intra-class variability; (iii) unbalanced class distributions and high similarity among different action sequences, adding difficulty in capturing distinct patterns for each action. Several mainstream action recognition models are used to conduct experimental analysis, which showcases the challenges and uniqueness of HSTAG https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/1697.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08454">HorGait: Advancing Gait Recognition with Efficient High-Order Spatial Interactions in LiDAR Point Clouds</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxing Hao, Yanxi Wang, Zhigang Chang, Hongmin Gao, Zihao Cheng, Chen Wu, Xin Zhao, Peiye Fang, Rachmat Muwardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Gait recognition is a remote biometric technology that utilizes the dynamic characteristics of human movement to identify individuals even under various extreme lighting conditions. Due to the limitation in spatial perception capability inherent in 2D gait representations, LiDAR can directly capture 3D gait features and represent them as point clouds, reducing environmental and lighting interference in recognition while significantly advancing privacy protection. For complex 3D representations, shallow networks fail to achieve accurate recognition, making vision Transformers the foremost prevalent method. However, the prevalence of dumb patches has limited the widespread use of Transformer architecture in gait recognition. This paper proposes a method named HorGait, which utilizes a hybrid model with a Transformer architecture for gait recognition on the planar projection of 3D point clouds from LiDAR. Specifically, it employs a hybrid model structure called LHM Block to achieve input adaptation, long-range, and high-order spatial interaction of the Transformer architecture. Additionally, it uses large convolutional kernel CNNs to segment the input representation, replacing attention windows to reduce dumb patches. We conducted extensive experiments, and the results show that HorGait achieves state-of-the-art performance among Transformer architecture methods on the SUSTech1K dataset, verifying that the hybrid model can complete the full Transformer process and perform better in point cloud planar projection. The outstanding performance of HorGait offers new insights for the future application of the Transformer architecture in gait recognition.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08456">A Unified Deep Semantic Expansion Framework for Domain-Generalized Person Re-identification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Eugene P. W. Ang, Shan Lin, Alex C. Kot</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised Person Re-identification (Person ReID) methods have achieved excellent performance when training and testing within one camera network. However, they usually suffer from considerable performance degradation when applied to different camera systems. In recent years, many Domain Adaptation Person ReID methods have been proposed, achieving impressive performance without requiring labeled data from the target domain. However, these approaches still need the unlabeled data of the target domain during the training process, making them impractical in many real-world scenarios. Our work focuses on the more practical Domain Generalized Person Re-identification (DG-ReID) problem. Given one or more source domains, it aims to learn a generalized model that can be applied to unseen target domains. One promising research direction in DG-ReID is the use of implicit deep semantic feature expansion, and our previous method, Domain Embedding Expansion (DEX), is one such example that achieves powerful results in DG-ReID. However, in this work we show that DEX and other similar implicit deep semantic feature expansion methods, due to limitations in their proposed loss function, fail to reach their full potential on large evaluation benchmarks as they have a tendency to saturate too early. Leveraging on this analysis, we propose Unified Deep Semantic Expansion, our novel framework that unifies implicit and explicit semantic feature expansion techniques in a single framework to mitigate this early over-fitting and achieve a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in all DG-ReID benchmarks. Further, we apply our method on more general image retrieval tasks, also surpassing the current SOTA in all of these benchmarks by wide margins.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eugene P. W. Ang, Shan Lin, Alex C. Kot</p>
<p>Abstract: Person Re-identification (Person ReID) has progressed to a level where single-domain supervised Person ReID performance has saturated. However, such methods experience a significant drop in performance when trained and tested across different datasets, motivating the development of domain generalization techniques. However, our research reveals that domain generalization methods significantly underperform single-domain supervised methods on single dataset benchmarks. An ideal Person ReID method should be effective regardless of the number of domains involved, and when test domain data is available for training it should perform as well as state-of-the-art (SOTA) fully supervised methods. This is a paradigm that we call Omni-Domain Generalization Person ReID (ODG-ReID). We propose a way to achieve ODG-ReID by creating deep feature diversity with self-ensembles. Our method, Diverse Deep Feature Ensemble Learning (D2FEL), deploys unique instance normalization patterns that generate multiple diverse views and recombines these views into a compact encoding. To the best of our knowledge, our work is one of few to consider omni-domain generalization in Person ReID, and we advance the study of applying feature ensembles in Person ReID. D2FEL significantly improves and matches the SOTA performance for major domain generalization and single-domain supervised benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eugene P. W. Ang, Shan Lin, Alex C. Kot</p>
<p>Abstract: Person Re-identification (Person ReID) has advanced significantly in fully supervised and domain generalized Person R e ID. However, methods developed for one task domain transfer poorly to the other. An ideal Person ReID method should be effective regardless of the number of domains involved in training or testing. Furthermore, given training data from the target domain, it should perform at least as well as state-of-the-art (SOTA) fully supervised Person ReID methods. We call this paradigm Omni-Domain Generalization Person ReID, referred to as ODG-ReID, and propose a way to achieve this by expanding compatible backbone architectures into multiple diverse pathways. Our method, Aligned Divergent Pathways (ADP), first converts a base architecture into a multi-branch structure by copying the tail of the original backbone. We design our module Dynamic Max-Deviance Adaptive Instance Normalization (DyMAIN) that encourages learning of generalized features that are robust to omni-domain directions and apply DyMAIN to the branches of ADP. Our proposed Phased Mixture-of-Cosines (PMoC) coordinates a mix of stable and turbulent learning rate schedules among branches for further diversified learning. Finally, we realign the feature space between branches with our proposed Dimensional Consistency Metric Loss (DCML). ADP outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for multi-source domain generalization and supervised ReID within the same domain. Furthermore, our method demonstrates improvement on a wide range of single-source domain generalization benchmarks, achieving Omni-Domain Generalization over Person ReID tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Xia, Zhengbang Yang, Junbo Zou, Rhys Tracy, Yuqing Wang, Chi Lu, Christopher Lai, Yanjun He, Xun Shao, Zhuoqing Xie, Yuan-fang Wang, Weining Shen, Hanjie Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are advancing the ability to reason about complex sports scenarios by integrating textual and visual information. To comprehensively evaluate their capabilities, we introduce SPORTU, a benchmark designed to assess MLLMs across multi-level sports reasoning tasks. SPORTU comprises two key components: SPORTU-text, featuring 900 multiple-choice questions with human-annotated explanations for rule comprehension and strategy understanding. This component focuses on testing models' ability to reason about sports solely through question-answering (QA), without requiring visual inputs; SPORTU-video, consisting of 1,701 slow-motion video clips across 7 different sports and 12,048 QA pairs, designed to assess multi-level reasoning, from simple sports recognition to complex tasks like foul detection and rule application. We evaluate four prevalent LLMs mainly utilizing few-shot learning paradigms supplemented by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on the SPORTU-text part. We evaluate four LLMs using few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on SPORTU-text. GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy of 71%, but still falls short of human-level performance, highlighting room for improvement in rule comprehension and reasoning. The evaluation for the SPORTU-video part includes 7 proprietary and 6 open-source MLLMs. Experiments show that models fall short on hard tasks that require deep reasoning and rule-based understanding. Claude-3.5-Sonnet performs the best with only 52.6% accuracy on the hard task, showing large room for improvement. We hope that SPORTU will serve as a critical step toward evaluating models' capabilities in sports understanding and reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhou Zheng, Yuichiro Hayashi, Masahiro Oda, Takayuki Kitasaka, Kensaku Mori</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study weakly-supervised laparoscopic image segmentation with sparse annotations. We introduce a novel Bayesian deep learning approach designed to enhance both the accuracy and interpretability of the model's segmentation, founded upon a comprehensive Bayesian framework, ensuring a robust and theoretically validated method. Our approach diverges from conventional methods that directly train using observed images and their corresponding weak annotations. Instead, we estimate the joint distribution of both images and labels given the acquired data. This facilitates the sampling of images and their high-quality pseudo-labels, enabling the training of a generalizable segmentation model. Each component of our model is expressed through probabilistic formulations, providing a coherent and interpretable structure. This probabilistic nature benefits accurate and practical learning from sparse annotations and equips our model with the ability to quantify uncertainty. Extensive evaluations with two public laparoscopic datasets demonstrated the efficacy of our method, which consistently outperformed existing methods. Furthermore, our method was adapted for scribble-supervised cardiac multi-structure segmentation, presenting competitive performance compared to previous methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekun Qian, Ruize Han, Junhui Hou, Linqi Song, Wei Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary multi-object tracking (OVMOT) represents a critical new challenge involving the detection and tracking of diverse object categories in videos, encompassing both seen categories (base classes) and unseen categories (novel classes). This issue amalgamates the complexities of open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) and multi-object tracking (MOT). Existing approaches to OVMOT often merge OVD and MOT methodologies as separate modules, predominantly focusing on the problem through an image-centric lens. In this paper, we propose VOVTrack, a novel method that integrates object states relevant to MOT and video-centric training to address this challenge from a video object tracking standpoint. First, we consider the tracking-related state of the objects during tracking and propose a new prompt-guided attention mechanism for more accurate localization and classification (detection) of the time-varying objects. Subsequently, we leverage raw video data without annotations for training by formulating a self-supervised object similarity learning technique to facilitate temporal object association (tracking). Experimental results underscore that VOVTrack outperforms existing methods, establishing itself as a state-of-the-art solution for open-vocabulary tracking task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengyu Hao, Wenhao Chai, Zhonghan Zhao, Meiqi Sun, Wendi Hu, Jieyang Zhou, Yixian Zhao, Qi Li, Yizhou Wang, Xi Li, Gaoang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing interest in embodied intelligence has brought ego-centric perspectives to contemporary research. One significant challenge within this realm is the accurate localization and tracking of objects in ego-centric videos, primarily due to the substantial variability in viewing angles. Addressing this issue, this paper introduces a novel zero-shot approach for the 3D reconstruction and tracking of all objects from the ego-centric video. We present Ego3DT, a novel framework that initially identifies and extracts detection and segmentation information of objects within the ego environment. Utilizing information from adjacent video frames, Ego3DT dynamically constructs a 3D scene of the ego view using a pre-trained 3D scene reconstruction model. Additionally, we have innovated a dynamic hierarchical association mechanism for creating stable 3D tracking trajectories of objects in ego-centric videos. Moreover, the efficacy of our approach is corroborated by extensive experiments on two newly compiled datasets, with 1.04x - 2.90x in HOTA, showcasing the robustness and accuracy of our method in diverse ego-centric scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Yue, Zidong Wang, Zeyu Lu, Shuyang Sun, Meng Wei, Wanli Ouyang, Lei Bai, Luping Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional class-guided diffusion models generally succeed in generating images with correct semantic content, but often struggle with texture details. This limitation stems from the usage of class priors, which only provide coarse and limited conditional information. To address this issue, we propose Diffusion on Diffusion (DoD), an innovative multi-stage generation framework that first extracts visual priors from previously generated samples, then provides rich guidance for the diffusion model leveraging visual priors from the early stages of diffusion sampling. Specifically, we introduce a latent embedding module that employs a compression-reconstruction approach to discard redundant detail information from the conditional samples in each stage, retaining only the semantic information for guidance. We evaluate DoD on the popular ImageNet-$256 \times 256$ dataset, reducing 7$\times$ training cost compared to SiT and DiT with even better performance in terms of the FID-50K score. Our largest model DoD-XL achieves an FID-50K score of 1.83 with only 1 million training steps, which surpasses other state-of-the-art methods without bells and whistles during inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhijay Ghildyal, Yuanhan Chen, Saman Zadtootaghaj, Nabajeet Barman, Alan C. Bovik</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of AI has influenced many aspects of human life, from self-driving cars and intelligent chatbots to text-based image and video generation models capable of creating realistic images and videos based on user prompts (text-to-image, image-to-image, and image-to-video). AI-based methods for image and video super resolution, video frame interpolation, denoising, and compression have already gathered significant attention and interest in the industry and some solutions are already being implemented in real-world products and services. However, to achieve widespread integration and acceptance, AI-generated and enhanced content must be visually accurate, adhere to intended use, and maintain high visual quality to avoid degrading the end user's quality of experience (QoE).
  One way to monitor and control the visual "quality" of AI-generated and -enhanced content is by deploying Image Quality Assessment (IQA) and Video Quality Assessment (VQA) models. However, most existing IQA and VQA models measure visual fidelity in terms of "reconstruction" quality against a pristine reference content and were not designed to assess the quality of "generative" artifacts. To address this, newer metrics and models have recently been proposed, but their performance evaluation and overall efficacy have been limited by datasets that were too small or otherwise lack representative content and/or distortion capacity; and by performance measures that can accurately report the success of an IQA/VQA model for "GenAI". This paper examines the current shortcomings and possibilities presented by AI-generated and enhanced image and video content, with a particular focus on end-user perceived quality. Finally, we discuss open questions and make recommendations for future work on the "GenAI" quality assessment problems, towards further progressing on this interesting and relevant field of research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pascl Zwick, Kevin Roesch, Marvin Klemp, Oliver Bringmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Anonymization plays a key role in protecting sensible information of individuals in real world datasets. Self-driving cars for example need high resolution facial features to track people and their viewing direction to predict future behaviour and react accordingly. In order to protect people's privacy whilst keeping important features in the dataset, it is important to replace the full body of a person with a highly detailed anonymized one. In contrast to doing face anonymization, full body replacement decreases the ability of recognizing people by their hairstyle or clothes. In this paper, we propose a workflow for full body person anonymization utilizing Stable Diffusion as a generative backend. Text-to-image diffusion models, like Stable Diffusion, OpenAI's DALL-E or Midjourney, have become very popular in recent time, being able to create photorealistic images from a single text prompt. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the art anonymization pipelines with respect to image quality, resolution, Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Additionally, our method is invariant with respect to the image generator and thus able to be used with the latest models available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transparent and reflective objects, which are common in our everyday lives, present a significant challenge to 3D imaging techniques due to their unique visual and optical properties. Faced with these types of objects, RGB-D cameras fail to capture the real depth value with their accurate spatial information. To address this issue, we propose DITR, a diffusion-based Depth Inpainting framework specifically designed for Transparent and Reflective objects. This network consists of two stages, including a Region Proposal stage and a Depth Inpainting stage. DITR dynamically analyzes the optical and geometric depth loss and inpaints them automatically. Furthermore, comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that DITR is highly effective in depth inpainting tasks of transparent and reflective objects with robust adaptability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nguyen Huu Bao Long, Chenyu Zhang, Yuzhi Shi, Tsubasa Hirakawa, Takayoshi Yamashita, Tohgoroh Matsui, Hironobu Fujiyoshi</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers with various attention modules have demonstrated superior performance on vision tasks. While using sparsity-adaptive attention, such as in DAT, has yielded strong results in image classification, the key-value pairs selected by deformable points lack semantic relevance when fine-tuning for semantic segmentation tasks. The query-aware sparsity attention in BiFormer seeks to focus each query on top-k routed regions. However, during attention calculation, the selected key-value pairs are influenced by too many irrelevant queries, reducing attention on the more important ones. To address these issues, we propose the Deformable Bi-level Routing Attention (DBRA) module, which optimizes the selection of key-value pairs using agent queries and enhances the interpretability of queries in attention maps. Based on this, we introduce the Deformable Bi-level Routing Attention Transformer (DeBiFormer), a novel general-purpose vision transformer built with the DBRA module. DeBiFormer has been validated on various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, providing strong evidence of its effectiveness.Code is available at {https://github.com/maclong01/DeBiFormer}</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08584">ZipVL: Efficient Large Vision-Language Models with Dynamic Token Sparsification and KV Cache Compression</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yefei He, Feng Chen, Jing Liu, Wenqi Shao, Hong Zhou, Kaipeng Zhang, Bohan Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: The efficiency of large vision-language models (LVLMs) is constrained by the computational bottleneck of the attention mechanism during the prefill phase and the memory bottleneck of fetching the key-value (KV) cache in the decoding phase, particularly in scenarios involving high-resolution images or videos. Visual content often exhibits substantial redundancy, resulting in highly sparse attention maps within LVLMs. This sparsity can be leveraged to accelerate attention computation or compress the KV cache through various approaches. However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these bottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity concerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an efficient inference framework designed for LVLMs that resolves both computation and memory bottlenecks through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform attention mechanism solely on those important tokens to accelerate the prefill phase. To mitigate the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase, we employ mixed-precision quantization to the KV cache, where high-bit quantization is used for caches of important tokens, while low-bit quantization is applied to those of less importance. Our experiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by 2.6$\times$ and reduce GPU memory usage by 50.0%, with a minimal accuracy reduction of only 0.2% on Video-MME benchmark over LongVA-7B model, effectively enhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work tackles the challenge of efficiently selecting high-performance pre-trained vision backbones for specific target tasks. Although exhaustive search within a finite set of backbones can solve this problem, it becomes impractical for large datasets and backbone pools. To address this, we introduce Vision Backbone Efficient Selection (VIBES), which aims to quickly find well-suited backbones, potentially trading off optimality for efficiency. We propose several simple yet effective heuristics to address VIBES and evaluate them across four diverse computer vision datasets. Our results show that these approaches can identify backbones that outperform those selected from generic benchmarks, even within a limited search budget of one hour on a single GPU. We reckon VIBES marks a paradigm shift from benchmarks to task-specific optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Houlun Chen, Xin Wang, Hong Chen, Zeyang Zhang, Wei Feng, Bin Huang, Jia Jia, Wenwu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Video Corpus Moment Retrieval (VCMR) is limited to coarse-grained understanding, which hinders precise video moment localization when given fine-grained queries. In this paper, we propose a more challenging fine-grained VCMR benchmark requiring methods to localize the best-matched moment from the corpus with other partially matched candidates. To improve the dataset construction efficiency and guarantee high-quality data annotations, we propose VERIFIED, an automatic \underline{V}id\underline{E}o-text annotation pipeline to generate captions with \underline{R}el\underline{I}able \underline{FI}n\underline{E}-grained statics and \underline{D}ynamics. Specifically, we resort to large language models (LLM) and large multimodal models (LMM) with our proposed Statics and Dynamics Enhanced Captioning modules to generate diverse fine-grained captions for each video. To filter out the inaccurate annotations caused by the LLM hallucination, we propose a Fine-Granularity Aware Noise Evaluator where we fine-tune a video foundation model with disturbed hard-negatives augmented contrastive and matching losses. With VERIFIED, we construct a more challenging fine-grained VCMR benchmark containing Charades-FIG, DiDeMo-FIG, and ActivityNet-FIG which demonstrate a high level of annotation quality. We evaluate several state-of-the-art VCMR models on the proposed dataset, revealing that there is still significant scope for fine-grained video understanding in VCMR.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengyuan Chen, Junyu Gao, Changsheng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: A straightforward pipeline for zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection involves selecting potential OOD labels from an extensive semantic pool and then leveraging a pre-trained vision-language model to perform classification on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD labels. In this paper, we theorize that enhancing performance requires expanding the semantic pool, while increasing the expected probability of selected OOD labels being activated by OOD samples, and ensuring low mutual dependence among the activations of these OOD labels. A natural expansion manner is to adopt a larger lexicon; however, the inevitable introduction of numerous synonyms and uncommon words fails to meet the above requirements, indicating that viable expansion manners move beyond merely selecting words from a lexicon. Since OOD detection aims to correctly classify input images into ID/OOD class groups, we can "make up" OOD label candidates which are not standard class names but beneficial for the process. Observing that the original semantic pool is comprised of unmodified specific class names, we correspondingly construct a conjugated semantic pool (CSP) consisting of modified superclass names, each serving as a cluster center for samples sharing similar properties across different categories. Consistent with our established theory, expanding OOD label candidates with the CSP satisfies the requirements and outperforms existing works by 7.89% in FPR95.

<p>Abstract: Sonar image synthesis is crucial for advancing applications in underwater exploration, marine biology, and defence. Traditional methods often rely on extensive and costly data collection using sonar sensors, jeopardizing data quality and diversity. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a new sonar image synthesis framework, Synth-SONAR leveraging diffusion models and GPT prompting. The key novelties of Synth-SONAR are threefold: First, by integrating Generative AI-based style injection techniques along with publicly available real/simulated data, thereby producing one of the largest sonar data corpus for sonar research. Second, a dual text-conditioning sonar diffusion model hierarchy synthesizes coarse and fine-grained sonar images with enhanced quality and diversity. Third, high-level (coarse) and low-level (detailed) text-based sonar generation methods leverage advanced semantic information available in visual language models (VLMs) and GPT-prompting. During inference, the method generates diverse and realistic sonar images from textual prompts, bridging the gap between textual descriptions and sonar image generation. This marks the application of GPT-prompting in sonar imagery for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Synth-SONAR achieves state-of-the-art results in producing high-quality synthetic sonar datasets, significantly enhancing their diversity and realism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Dong, Yuzhe Sun, Yanfeng Gu, Tianzhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a natural language expression and a remote sensing image, the goal of referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) is to generate a pixel-level mask of the target object identified by the referring expression. In contrast to natural scenarios, expressions in RRSIS often involve complex geospatial relationships, with target objects of interest that vary significantly in scale and lack visual saliency, thereby increasing the difficulty of achieving precise segmentation. To address the aforementioned challenges, a novel RRSIS framework is proposed, termed the cross-modal bidirectional interaction model (CroBIM). Specifically, a context-aware prompt modulation (CAPM) module is designed to integrate spatial positional relationships and task-specific knowledge into the linguistic features, thereby enhancing the ability to capture the target object. Additionally, a language-guided feature aggregation (LGFA) module is introduced to integrate linguistic information into multi-scale visual features, incorporating an attention deficit compensation mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Finally, a mutual-interaction decoder (MID) is designed to enhance cross-modal feature alignment through cascaded bidirectional cross-attention, thereby enabling precise segmentation mask prediction. To further forster the research of RRSIS, we also construct RISBench, a new large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 52,472 image-language-label triplets. Extensive benchmarking on RISBench and two other prevalent datasets demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed CroBIM over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruizhe Zeng, Lu Zhang, Xu Yang, Zhiyong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection is the task of accurately detecting objects from a candidate vocabulary list that includes both base and novel categories. Currently, numerous open-vocabulary detectors have achieved success by leveraging the impressive zero-shot capabilities of CLIP. However, we observe that CLIP models struggle to effectively handle background images (i.e. images without corresponding labels) due to their language-image learning methodology. This limitation results in suboptimal performance for open-vocabulary detectors that rely on CLIP when processing background samples. In this paper, we propose Background Information Representation for open-vocabulary Detector (BIRDet), a novel approach to address the limitations of CLIP in handling background samples. Specifically, we design Background Information Modeling (BIM) to replace the single, fixed background embedding in mainstream open-vocabulary detectors with dynamic scene information, and prompt it into image-related background representations. This method effectively enhances the ability to classify oversized regions as background. Besides, we introduce Partial Object Suppression (POS), an algorithm that utilizes the ratio of overlap area to address the issue of misclassifying partial regions as foreground. Experiments on OV-COCO and OV-LVIS benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed model is capable of achieving performance enhancements across various open-vocabulary detectors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Forecasting a typical object's future motion is a critical task for interpreting and interacting with dynamic environments in computer vision. Event-based sensors, which could capture changes in the scene with exceptional temporal granularity, may potentially offer a unique opportunity to predict future motion with a level of detail and precision previously unachievable. Inspired by that, we propose to integrate the strong learning capacity of the video diffusion model with the rich motion information of an event camera as a motion simulation framework. Specifically, we initially employ pre-trained stable video diffusion models to adapt the event sequence dataset. This process facilitates the transfer of extensive knowledge from RGB videos to an event-centric domain. Moreover, we introduce an alignment mechanism that utilizes reinforcement learning techniques to enhance the reverse generation trajectory of the diffusion model, ensuring improved performance and accuracy. Through extensive testing and validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various complex scenarios, showcasing its potential to revolutionize motion flow prediction in computer vision applications such as autonomous vehicle guidance, robotic navigation, and interactive media. Our findings suggest a promising direction for future research in enhancing the interpretative power and predictive accuracy of computer vision systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Zhou, Hao Shao, Letian Wang, Steven L. Waslander, Hongsheng Li, Yu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting the future motion of surrounding agents is essential for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to operate safely in dynamic, human-robot-mixed environments. However, the scarcity of large-scale driving datasets has hindered the development of robust and generalizable motion prediction models, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions and road geometries. Inspired by recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained significant attention in the motion prediction community for learning rich and transferable scene representations. Nonetheless, existing pre-training methods for motion prediction have largely focused on specific model architectures and single dataset, limiting their scalability and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose SmartPretrain, a general and scalable SSL framework for motion prediction that is both model-agnostic and dataset-agnostic. Our approach integrates contrastive and reconstructive SSL, leveraging the strengths of both generative and discriminative paradigms to effectively represent spatiotemporal evolution and interactions without imposing architectural constraints. Additionally, SmartPretrain employs a dataset-agnostic scenario sampling strategy that integrates multiple datasets, enhancing data volume, diversity, and robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that SmartPretrain consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art prediction models across datasets, data splits and main metrics. For instance, SmartPretrain significantly reduces the MissRate of Forecast-MAE by 10.6%. These results highlight SmartPretrain's effectiveness as a unified, scalable solution for motion prediction, breaking free from the limitations of the small-data regime.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maruf Hassan, Steven Davy</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of intelligent mobile applications highlights the crucial demand for deploying powerful deep learning models on resource-constrained mobile devices. An effective solution in this context is the device-edge co-inference framework, which partitions a deep neural network between a mobile device and a nearby edge server. This approach requires balancing on-device computations and communication costs, often achieved through compressed intermediate feature transmission. Conventional deep neural network architectures require continuous data processing, leading to substantial energy consumption by edge devices. This motivates exploring binary, event-driven activations enabled by spiking neural networks (SNNs), known for their extremely energy efficiency. In this research, we propose a novel architecture named SpikeBottleNet, a significant improvement to the existing architecture by integrating SNNs. A key aspect of our investigation is the development of an intermediate feature compression technique specifically designed for SNNs. This technique leverages a split computing approach for SNNs to partition complex architectures, such as Spike ResNet50. By incorporating the power of SNNs within device-edge co-inference systems, experimental results demonstrate that our SpikeBottleNet achieves a significant bit compression ratio of up to 256x in the final convolutional layer while maintaining high classification accuracy with only a 2.5% reduction. Moreover, compared to the baseline BottleNet++ architecture, our framework reduces the transmitted feature size at earlier splitting points by 75%. Furthermore, in terms of the energy efficiency of edge devices, our methodology surpasses the baseline by a factor of up to 98, demonstrating significant enhancements in both efficiency and performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karina Kvanchiani, Petr Surovtsev, Alexander Nagaev, Elizaveta Petrova, Alexander Kapitanov</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the recognition of the Russian fingerspelling alphabet, also known as the Russian Sign Language (RSL) dactyl. Dactyl is a component of sign languages where distinct hand movements represent individual letters of a written language. This method is used to spell words without specific signs, such as proper nouns or technical terms. The alphabet learning simulator is an essential isolated dactyl recognition application. There is a notable issue of data shortage in isolated dactyl recognition: existing Russian dactyl datasets lack subject heterogeneity, contain insufficient samples, or cover only static signs. We provide Bukva, the first full-fledged open-source video dataset for RSL dactyl recognition. It contains 3,757 videos with more than 101 samples for each RSL alphabet sign, including dynamic ones. We utilized crowdsourcing platforms to increase the subject's heterogeneity, resulting in the participation of 155 deaf and hard-of-hearing experts in the dataset creation. We use a TSM (Temporal Shift Module) block to handle static and dynamic signs effectively, achieving 83.6% top-1 accuracy with a real-time inference with CPU only. The dataset, demo code, and pre-trained models are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeongho Ahn, Kazuto Nakashima, Koki Yoshino, Yumi Iwashita, Ryo Kurazume</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D LiDAR has emerged as a promising technique in the field of gait-based person identification, serving as an alternative to traditional RGB cameras, due to its robustness under varying lighting conditions and its ability to capture 3D geometric information. However, long capture distances or the use of low-cost LiDAR sensors often result in sparse human point clouds, leading to a decline in identification performance. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse-to-dense upsampling model for pedestrian point clouds in LiDAR-based gait recognition, named LidarGSU, which is designed to improve the generalization capability of existing identification models. Our method utilizes diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), which have shown high fidelity in generative tasks such as image completion. In this work, we leverage DPMs on sparse sequential pedestrian point clouds as conditional masks in a video-to-video translation approach, applied in an inpainting manner. We conducted extensive experiments on the SUSTeck1K dataset to evaluate the generative quality and recognition performance of the proposed method. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our upsampling model using a real-world dataset, captured with a low-resolution sensor across varying measurement distances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Cao, Deyu Meng, Xiangyong Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite previous works typically targeting isolated degradation types, recent research has increasingly focused on addressing composite degradations which involve a complex interplay of multiple different isolated degradations. Recognizing the challenges posed by the exponential number of possible degradation combinations, we propose Universal Image Restoration (UIR), a new task setting that requires models to be trained on a set of degradation bases and then remove any degradation that these bases can potentially compose in a zero-shot manner. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought which prompts LLMs to address problems step-by-step, we propose the Chain-of-Restoration (CoR), which instructs models to step-by-step remove unknown composite degradations. By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator into pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models remove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image is fully restored from the unknown composite degradation. Extensive experiments show that CoR significantly improves model performance in removing composite degradations, achieving results comparable to or surpassing those of State-of-The-Art (SoTA) methods trained on all degradations. The code will be released at https://github.com/toummHus/Chain-of-Restoration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Yang, Shuibai Zhang, Wenqi Shao, Kaipeng Zhang, Yi Bin, Yu Wang, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across multimodal tasks such as visual perception and reasoning, leading to good performance on various multimodal evaluation benchmarks. However, these benchmarks keep a static nature and overlap with the pre-training data, resulting in fixed complexity constraints and data contamination issues. This raises the concern regarding the validity of the evaluation. To address these two challenges, we introduce a dynamic multimodal evaluation protocol called Vision-Language Bootstrapping (VLB). VLB provides a robust and comprehensive assessment for LVLMs with reduced data contamination and flexible complexity. To this end, VLB dynamically generates new visual question-answering samples through a multimodal bootstrapping module that modifies both images and language, while ensuring that newly generated samples remain consistent with the original ones by a judge module. By composing various bootstrapping strategies, VLB offers dynamic variants of existing benchmarks with diverse complexities, enabling the evaluation to co-evolve with the ever-evolving capabilities of LVLMs. Extensive experimental results across multiple benchmarks, including SEEDBench, MMBench, and MME, show that VLB significantly reduces data contamination and exposes performance limitations of LVLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samed Yal\c{c}{\i}n, Haz{\i}m Kemal Ekenel</p>
<p>Abstract: Maritime obstacle detection aims to detect possible obstacles for autonomous driving of unmanned surface vehicles. In the context of maritime obstacle detection, the water surface can act like a mirror on certain circumstances, causing reflections on imagery. Previous works have indicated surface reflections as a source of false positives for object detectors in maritime obstacle detection tasks. In this work, we show that surface reflections indeed adversely affect detector performance. We measure the effect of reflections by testing on two custom datasets, which we make publicly available. The first one contains imagery with reflections, while in the second reflections are inpainted. We show that the reflections reduce mAP by 1.2 to 9.6 points across various detectors. To remove false positives on reflections, we propose a novel filtering approach named Heatmap Based Sliding Filter. We show that the proposed method reduces the total number of false positives by 34.64% while minimally affecting true positives. We also conduct qualitative analysis and show that the proposed method indeed removes false positives on the reflections. The datasets can be found on https://github.com/SamedYalcin/MRAD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihang Yang, Yang Zhao, Hong Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving necessitates advanced object detection techniques that integrate information from multiple modalities to overcome the limitations associated with single-modal approaches. The challenges of aligning diverse data in early fusion and the complexities, along with overfitting issues introduced by deep fusion, underscore the efficacy of late fusion at the decision level. Late fusion ensures seamless integration without altering the original detector's network structure. This paper introduces a pioneering Multi-modal Multi-class Late Fusion method, designed for late fusion to enable multi-class detection. Fusion experiments conducted on the KITTI validation and official test datasets illustrate substantial performance improvements, presenting our model as a versatile solution for multi-modal object detection in autonomous driving. Moreover, our approach incorporates uncertainty analysis into the classification fusion process, rendering our model more transparent and trustworthy and providing more reliable insights into category predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Turnbull, Emily Fitzgerald, Karen Thompson, Joanne L. Birch</p>
<p>Abstract: Specimen associated biodiversity data are sought after for biological, environmental, climate, and conservation sciences. A rate shift is required for the extraction of data from specimen images to eliminate the bottleneck that the reliance on human-mediated transcription of these data represents. We applied advanced computer vision techniques to develop the `Hespi' (HErbarium Specimen sheet PIpeline), which extracts a pre-catalogue subset of collection data on the institutional labels on herbarium specimens from their digital images. The pipeline integrates two object detection models; the first detects bounding boxes around text-based labels and the second detects bounding boxes around text-based data fields on the primary institutional label. The pipeline classifies text-based institutional labels as printed, typed, handwritten, or a combination and applies Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) for data extraction. The recognized text is then corrected against authoritative databases of taxon names. The extracted text is also corrected with the aide of a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM). Hespi accurately detects and extracts text for test datasets including specimen sheet images from international herbaria. The components of the pipeline are modular and users can train their own models with their own data and use them in place of the models provided.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Schmidt, Jens Piekenbrinck, Bastian Leibe</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as a powerful tool for fast and accurate novel-view synthesis from a set of posed input images. However, like most novel-view synthesis approaches, it relies on accurate camera pose information, limiting its applicability in real-world scenarios where acquiring accurate camera poses can be challenging or even impossible. We propose an extension to the 3D Gaussian Splatting framework by optimizing the extrinsic camera parameters with respect to photometric residuals. We derive the analytical gradients and integrate their computation with the existing high-performance CUDA implementation. This enables downstream tasks such as 6-DoF camera pose estimation as well as joint reconstruction and camera refinement. In particular, we achieve rapid convergence and high accuracy for pose estimation on real-world scenes. Our method enables fast reconstruction of 3D scenes without requiring accurate pose information by jointly optimizing geometry and camera poses, while achieving state-of-the-art results in novel-view synthesis. Our approach is considerably faster to optimize than most competing methods, and several times faster in rendering. We show results on real-world scenes and complex trajectories through simulated environments, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLFF while reducing runtime by two to four times compared to the most efficient competing method.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08769">Efficient Multi-Object Tracking on Edge Devices via Reconstruction-Based Channel Pruning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan M\"uller, Adrian Pigors</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of multi-object tracking (MOT) technologies presents the dual challenge of maintaining high performance while addressing critical security and privacy concerns. In applications such as pedestrian tracking, where sensitive personal data is involved, the potential for privacy violations and data misuse becomes a significant issue if data is transmitted to external servers. To mitigate these risks, processing data directly on an edge device, such as a smart camera, has emerged as a viable solution. Edge computing ensures that sensitive information remains local, thereby aligning with stringent privacy principles and significantly reducing network latency. However, the implementation of MOT on edge devices is not without its challenges. Edge devices typically possess limited computational resources, necessitating the development of highly optimized algorithms capable of delivering real-time performance under these constraints. The disparity between the computational requirements of state-of-the-art MOT algorithms and the capabilities of edge devices emphasizes a significant obstacle. To address these challenges, we propose a neural network pruning method specifically tailored to compress complex networks, such as those used in modern MOT systems. This approach optimizes MOT performance by ensuring high accuracy and efficiency within the constraints of limited edge devices, such as NVIDIA's Jetson Orin Nano. By applying our pruning method, we achieve model size reductions of up to 70% while maintaining a high level of accuracy and further improving performance on the Jetson Orin Nano, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for edge computing applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a novel Hand-pose Embedding Interactive System (HpEIS) as a virtual sensor, which maps users' flexible hand poses to a two-dimensional visual space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on a variety of hand poses. HpEIS enables visually interpretable and guidable support for user explorations in multimedia collections, using only a camera as an external hand pose acquisition device. We identify general usability issues associated with system stability and smoothing requirements through pilot experiments with expert and inexperienced users. We then design stability and smoothing improvements, including hand-pose data augmentation, an anti-jitter regularisation term added to loss function, stabilising post-processing for movement turning points and smoothing post-processing based on One Euro Filters. In target selection experiments (n=12), we evaluate HpEIS by measures of task completion time and the final distance to target points, with and without the gesture guidance window condition. Experimental responses indicate that HpEIS provides users with a learnable, flexible, stable and smooth mid-air hand movement interaction experience.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video segmentation is essential for advancing robotics and autonomous driving, particularly in open-world settings where continuous perception and object association across video frames are critical. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has excelled in static image segmentation, extending its capabilities to video segmentation poses significant challenges. We tackle two major hurdles: a) SAM's embedding limitations in associating objects across frames, and b) granularity inconsistencies in object segmentation. To this end, we introduce VideoSAM, an end-to-end framework designed to address these challenges by improving object tracking and segmentation consistency in dynamic environments. VideoSAM integrates an agglomerated backbone, RADIO, enabling object association through similarity metrics and introduces Cycle-ack-Pairs Propagation with a memory mechanism for stable object tracking. Additionally, we incorporate an autoregressive object-token mechanism within the SAM decoder to maintain consistent granularity across frames. Our method is extensively evaluated on the UVO and BURST benchmarks, and robotic videos from RoboTAP, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chandravardhan Singh Raghaw, Arnav Sharma, Shubhi Bansa, Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman, Nagendra Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Swift and accurate blood smear analysis is an effective diagnostic method for leukemia and other hematological malignancies. However, manual leukocyte count and morphological evaluation using a microscope is time-consuming and prone to errors. Conventional image processing methods also exhibit limitations in differentiating cells due to the visual similarity between malignant and benign cell morphology. This limitation is further compounded by the skewed training data that hinders the extraction of reliable and pertinent features. In response to these challenges, we propose an optimized Coupled Transformer Convolutional Network (CoTCoNet) framework for the classification of leukemia, which employs a well-designed transformer integrated with a deep convolutional network to effectively capture comprehensive global features and scalable spatial patterns, enabling the identification of complex and large-scale hematological features. Further, the framework incorporates a graph-based feature reconstruction module to reveal the hidden or unobserved hard-to-see biological features of leukocyte cells and employs a Population-based Meta-Heuristic Algorithm for feature selection and optimization. To mitigate data imbalance issues, we employ a synthetic leukocyte generator. In the evaluation phase, we initially assess CoTCoNet on a dataset containing 16,982 annotated cells, and it achieves remarkable accuracy and F1-Score rates of 0.9894 and 0.9893, respectively. To broaden the generalizability of our model, we evaluate it across four publicly available diverse datasets, which include the aforementioned dataset. This evaluation demonstrates that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches. We also incorporate an explainability approach in the form of feature visualization closely aligned with cell annotations to provide a deeper understanding of the framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Due to the nature of enhancement--the absence of paired ground-truth information, high-level vision tasks have been recently employed to evaluate the performance of low-light image enhancement. A widely-used manner is to see how accurately an object detector trained on enhanced low-light images by different candidates can perform with respect to annotated semantic labels. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the mentioned approach is generally prone to overfitting, and thus diminishes its measurement reliability. In search of a proper evaluation metric, we propose LIME-Bench, the first online benchmark platform designed to collect human preferences for low-light enhancement, providing a valuable dataset for validating the correlation between human perception and automated evaluation metrics. We then customize LIME-Eval, a novel evaluation framework that utilizes detectors pre-trained on standard-lighting datasets without object annotations, to judge the quality of enhanced images. By adopting an energy-based strategy to assess the accuracy of output confidence maps, our LIME-Eval can simultaneously bypass biases associated with retraining detectors and circumvent the reliance on annotations for dim images. Comprehensive experiments are provided to reveal the effectiveness of our LIME-Eval.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqiang Li, Yi Wu, Chaoyue Wang, Xue Rui, Bin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D-aware image generation necessitates extensive training data to ensure stable training and mitigate the risk of overfitting. This paper first considers a novel task known as One-shot 3D Generative Domain Adaptation (GDA), aimed at transferring a pre-trained 3D generator from one domain to a new one, relying solely on a single reference image. One-shot 3D GDA is characterized by the pursuit of specific attributes, namely, high fidelity, large diversity, cross-domain consistency, and multi-view consistency. Within this paper, we introduce 3D-Adapter, the first one-shot 3D GDA method, for diverse and faithful generation. Our approach begins by judiciously selecting a restricted weight set for fine-tuning, and subsequently leverages four advanced loss functions to facilitate adaptation. An efficient progressive fine-tuning strategy is also implemented to enhance the adaptation process. The synergy of these three technological components empowers 3D-Adapter to achieve remarkable performance, substantiated both quantitatively and qualitatively, across all desired properties of 3D GDA. Furthermore, 3D-Adapter seamlessly extends its capabilities to zero-shot scenarios, and preserves the potential for crucial tasks such as interpolation, reconstruction, and editing within the latent space of the pre-trained generator.

<p>Abstract: In this contribution, we define (and test) a pipeline to perform virtual painting recolouring using raw data of X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis on pictorial artworks. To circumvent the small dataset size, we generate a synthetic dataset, starting from a database of XRF spectra; furthermore, to ensure a better generalisation capacity (and to tackle the issue of in-memory size and inference time), we define a Deep Variational Embedding network to embed the XRF spectra into a lower dimensional, K-Means friendly, metric space.
  We thus train a set of models to assign coloured images to embedded XRF images. We report here the devised pipeline performances in terms of visual quality metrics, and we close on a discussion on the results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Huang, Hanhui Li, Wanquan Liu, Xiaodan Liang, Yiqiang Yan, Yuhao Cheng, Chengqiang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose to create animatable avatars for interacting hands with 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and single-image inputs. Existing GS-based methods designed for single subjects often yield unsatisfactory results due to limited input views, various hand poses, and occlusions. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel two-stage interaction-aware GS framework that exploits cross-subject hand priors and refines 3D Gaussians in interacting areas. Particularly, to handle hand variations, we disentangle the 3D presentation of hands into optimization-based identity maps and learning-based latent geometric features and neural texture maps. Learning-based features are captured by trained networks to provide reliable priors for poses, shapes, and textures, while optimization-based identity maps enable efficient one-shot fitting of out-of-distribution hands. Furthermore, we devise an interaction-aware attention module and a self-adaptive Gaussian refinement module. These modules enhance image rendering quality in areas with intra- and inter-hand interactions, overcoming the limitations of existing GS-based methods. Our proposed method is validated via extensive experiments on the large-scale InterHand2.6M dataset, and it significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance in image quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiao Wang, Yifeng Wang, Qingchuan Ma, Xiao Wang, Ning Yan, Qingquan Yang, Guosheng Xu, Jin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Q-distribution prediction is a crucial research direction in controlled nuclear fusion, with deep learning emerging as a key approach to solving prediction challenges. In this paper, we leverage deep learning techniques to tackle the complexities of Q-distribution prediction. Specifically, we explore multimodal fusion methods in computer vision, integrating 2D line image data with the original 1D data to form a bimodal input. Additionally, we employ the Transformer's attention mechanism for feature extraction and the interactive fusion of bimodal information. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly reducing prediction errors in Q-distribution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daichi Haraguchi, Naoto Inoue, Wataru Shimoda, Hayato Mitani, Seiichi Uchida, Kota Yamaguchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models show promising capability in graphic design generation. Several studies have started employing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to evaluate graphic designs, assuming that LMMs can properly assess their quality, but it is unclear if the evaluation is reliable. One way to evaluate the quality of graphic design is to assess whether the design adheres to fundamental graphic design principles, which are the designer's common practice. In this paper, we compare the behavior of GPT-based evaluation and heuristic evaluation based on design principles using human annotations collected from 60 subjects. Our experiments reveal that, while GPTs cannot distinguish small details, they have a reasonably good correlation with human annotation and exhibit a similar tendency to heuristic metrics based on design principles, suggesting that they are indeed capable of assessing the quality of graphic design.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08895">Calibrated Cache Model for Few-Shot Vision-Language Model Adaptation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Ding, Qiang Yu, Haojian Zhang, Gaofeng Meng, Shiming Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cache-based approaches stand out as both effective and efficient for adapting vision-language models (VLMs). Nonetheless, the existing cache model overlooks three crucial aspects. 1) Pre-trained VLMs are mainly optimized for image-text similarity, neglecting the importance of image-image similarity, leading to a gap between pre-training and adaptation. 2) The current cache model is based on the Nadaraya-Watson (N-W) estimator, which disregards the intricate relationships among training samples while constructing weight function. 3) Under the condition of limited samples, the logits generated by cache model are of high uncertainty, directly using these logits without accounting for the confidence could be problematic. This work presents three calibration modules aimed at addressing the above challenges. Similarity Calibration refines the image-image similarity by using unlabeled images. We add a learnable projection layer with residual connection on top of the pre-trained image encoder of CLIP and optimize the parameters by minimizing self-supervised contrastive loss. Weight Calibration introduces a precision matrix into the weight function to adequately model the relation between training samples, transforming the existing cache model to a Gaussian Process (GP) regressor, which could be more accurate than N-W estimator. Confidence Calibration leverages the predictive variances computed by GP Regression to dynamically re-scale the logits of cache model, ensuring that the cache model's outputs are appropriately adjusted based on their confidence levels. Besides, to reduce the high complexity of GPs, we further propose a group-based learning strategy. Integrating the above designs, we propose both training-free and training-required variants. Extensive experiments on 11 few-shot classification datasets validate that the proposed methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore the transformative potential of SAM 2, a vision foundation model, in advancing gaze estimation and eye tracking technologies. By significantly reducing annotation time, lowering technical barriers through its ease of deployment, and enhancing segmentation accuracy, SAM 2 addresses critical challenges faced by researchers and practitioners. Utilizing its zero-shot segmentation capabilities with minimal user input-a single click per video-we tested SAM 2 on over 14 million eye images from diverse datasets, including virtual reality setups and the world's largest unified dataset recorded using wearable eye trackers. Remarkably, in pupil segmentation tasks, SAM 2 matches the performance of domain-specific models trained solely on eye images, achieving competitive mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) scores of up to 93% without fine-tuning. Additionally, we provide our code and segmentation masks for these widely used datasets to promote further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehoon Choi, Yonghan Lee, Hyungtae Lee, Heesung Kwon, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting has gained attention for its capability to generate high-fidelity rendering results. At the same time, most applications such as games, animation, and AR/VR use mesh-based representations to represent and render 3D scenes. We propose a novel approach that integrates mesh representation with 3D Gaussian splats to perform high-quality rendering of reconstructed real-world scenes. In particular, we introduce a distance-based Gaussian splatting technique to align the Gaussian splats with the mesh surface and remove redundant Gaussian splats that do not contribute to the rendering. We consider the distance between each Gaussian splat and the mesh surface to distinguish between tightly-bound and loosely-bound Gaussian splats. The tightly-bound splats are flattened and aligned well with the mesh geometry. The loosely-bound Gaussian splats are used to account for the artifacts in reconstructed 3D meshes in terms of rendering. We present a training strategy of binding Gaussian splats to the mesh geometry, and take into account both types of splats. In this context, we introduce several regularization techniques aimed at precisely aligning tightly-bound Gaussian splats with the mesh surface during the training process. We validate the effectiveness of our method on large and unbounded scene from mip-NeRF 360 and Deep Blending datasets. Our method surpasses recent mesh-based neural rendering techniques by achieving a 2dB higher PSNR, and outperforms mesh-based Gaussian splatting methods by 1.3 dB PSNR, particularly on the outdoor mip-NeRF 360 dataset, demonstrating better rendering quality. We provide analyses for each type of Gaussian splat and achieve a reduction in the number of Gaussian splats by 30% compared to the original 3D Gaussian splatting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Varduhi Yeghiazaryan, Yeva Gabrielyan, Irina Voiculescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Many image processing applications rely on partitioning an image into disjoint regions whose pixels are 'similar.' The watershed and waterfall transforms are established mathematical morphology pixel clustering techniques. They are both relevant to modern applications where groups of pixels are to be decided upon in one go, or where adjacency information is relevant. We introduce three new parallel partitioning algorithms for GPUs. By repeatedly applying watershed algorithms, we produce waterfall results which form a hierarchy of partition regions over an input image. Our watershed algorithms attain competitive execution times in both 2D and 3D, processing an 800 megavoxel image in less than 1.4 sec. We also show how to use this fully deterministic image partitioning as a pre-processing step to machine learning based semantic segmentation. This replaces the role of superpixel algorithms, and results in comparable accuracy and faster training times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxu Wang, Jingkai Sun, Junhao He, Ziyi Zhang, Qiang Zhang, Mingyuan Sun, Renjing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based simulators show great potential for simulating particle dynamics when 3D groundtruth is available, but per-particle correspondences are not always accessible. The development of neural rendering presents a new solution to this field to learn 3D dynamics from 2D images by inverse rendering. However, existing approaches still suffer from ill-posed natures resulting from the 2D to 3D uncertainty, for example, specific 2D images can correspond with various 3D particle distributions. To mitigate such uncertainty, we consider a conventional, mechanically interpretable framework as the physical priors and extend it to a learning-based version. In brief, we incorporate the learnable graph kernels into the classic Discrete Element Analysis (DEA) framework to implement a novel mechanics-integrated learning system. In this case, the graph network kernels are only used for approximating some specific mechanical operators in the DEA framework rather than the whole dynamics mapping. By integrating the strong physics priors, our methods can effectively learn the dynamics of various materials from the partial 2D observations in a unified manner. Experiments show that our approach outperforms other learned simulators by a large margin in this context and is robust to different renderers, fewer training samples, and fewer camera views.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09004">DA-Ada: Learning Domain-Aware Adapter for Domain Adaptive Object Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haochen Li, Rui Zhang, Hantao Yao, Xin Zhang, Yifan Hao, Xinkai Song, Xiaqing Li, Yongwei Zhao, Ling Li, Yunji Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) aims to generalize detectors trained on an annotated source domain to an unlabelled target domain. As the visual-language models (VLMs) can provide essential general knowledge on unseen images, freezing the visual encoder and inserting a domain-agnostic adapter can learn domain-invariant knowledge for DAOD. However, the domain-agnostic adapter is inevitably biased to the source domain. It discards some beneficial knowledge discriminative on the unlabelled domain, i.e., domain-specific knowledge of the target domain. To solve the issue, we propose a novel Domain-Aware Adapter (DA-Ada) tailored for the DAOD task. The key point is exploiting domain-specific knowledge between the essential general knowledge and domain-invariant knowledge. DA-Ada consists of the Domain-Invariant Adapter (DIA) for learning domain-invariant knowledge and the Domain-Specific Adapter (DSA) for injecting the domain-specific knowledge from the information discarded by the visual encoder. Comprehensive experiments over multiple DAOD tasks show that DA-Ada can efficiently infer a domain-aware visual encoder for boosting domain adaptive object detection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ling Yang, Zixiang Zhang, Junlin Han, Bohan Zeng, Runjia Li, Philip Torr, Wentao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating high-quality 3D assets from textual descriptions remains a pivotal challenge in computer graphics and vision research. Due to the scarcity of 3D data, state-of-the-art approaches utilize pre-trained 2D diffusion priors, optimized through Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). Despite progress, crafting complex 3D scenes featuring multiple objects or intricate interactions is still difficult. To tackle this, recent methods have incorporated box or layout guidance. However, these layout-guided compositional methods often struggle to provide fine-grained control, as they are generally coarse and lack expressiveness. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel SDS approach, Semantic Score Distillation Sampling (SemanticSDS), designed to effectively improve the expressiveness and accuracy of compositional text-to-3D generation. Our approach integrates new semantic embeddings that maintain consistency across different rendering views and clearly differentiate between various objects and parts. These embeddings are transformed into a semantic map, which directs a region-specific SDS process, enabling precise optimization and compositional generation. By leveraging explicit semantic guidance, our method unlocks the compositional capabilities of existing pre-trained diffusion models, thereby achieving superior quality in 3D content generation, particularly for complex objects and scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our SemanticSDS framework is highly effective for generating state-of-the-art complex 3D content. Code: https://github.com/YangLing0818/SemanticSDS-3D</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianyu Zhao, Wei Quan, Bogdan J. Matuszewski</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating rigid objects' poses is one of the fundamental problems in computer vision, with a range of applications across automation and augmented reality. Most existing approaches adopt one network per object class strategy, depend heavily on objects' 3D models, depth data, and employ a time-consuming iterative refinement, which could be impractical for some applications. This paper presents a novel approach, CVAM-Pose, for multi-object monocular pose estimation that addresses these limitations. The CVAM-Pose method employs a label-embedded conditional variational autoencoder network, to implicitly abstract regularised representations of multiple objects in a single low-dimensional latent space. This autoencoding process uses only images captured by a projective camera and is robust to objects' occlusion and scene clutter. The classes of objects are one-hot encoded and embedded throughout the network. The proposed label-embedded pose regression strategy interprets the learnt latent space representations utilising continuous pose representations. Ablation tests and systematic evaluations demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of the CVAM-Pose method for multi-object scenarios. The proposed CVAM-Pose outperforms competing latent space approaches. For example, it is respectively 25% and 20% better than AAE and Multi-Path methods, when evaluated using the $\mathrm{AR_{VSD}}$ metric on the Linemod-Occluded dataset. It also achieves results somewhat comparable to methods reliant on 3D models reported in BOP challenges. Code available: https://github.com/JZhao12/CVAM-Pose</p>

<p>Abstract: Millions of abandoned oil and gas wells are scattered across the world, leaching methane into the atmosphere and toxic compounds into the groundwater. Many of these locations are unknown, preventing the wells from being plugged and their polluting effects averted. Remote sensing is a relatively unexplored tool for pinpointing abandoned wells at scale. We introduce the first large-scale benchmark dataset for this problem, leveraging medium-resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery from Planet Labs. Our curated dataset comprises over 213,000 wells (abandoned, suspended, and active) from Alberta, a region with especially high well density, sourced from the Alberta Energy Regulator and verified by domain experts. We evaluate baseline algorithms for well detection and segmentation, showing the promise of computer vision approaches but also significant room for improvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of inflammatory or misleading "fake" news content has become increasingly common in recent years. Simultaneously, it has become easier than ever to use AI tools to generate photorealistic images depicting any scene imaginable. Combining these two -- AI-generated fake news content -- is particularly potent and dangerous. To combat the spread of AI-generated fake news, we propose the MiRAGeNews Dataset, a dataset of 12,500 high-quality real and AI-generated image-caption pairs from state-of-the-art generators. We find that our dataset poses a significant challenge to humans (60% F-1) and state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs (< 24% F-1). Using our dataset we train a multi-modal detector (MiRAGe) that improves by +5.1% F-1 over state-of-the-art baselines on image-caption pairs from out-of-domain image generators and news publishers. We release our code and data to aid future work on detecting AI-generated content.</p>

<p>Abstract: The creation of complex 3D scenes tailored to user specifications has been a tedious and challenging task with traditional 3D modeling tools. Although some pioneering methods have achieved automatic text-to-3D generation, they are generally limited to small-scale scenes with restricted control over the shape and texture. We introduce SceneCraft, a novel method for generating detailed indoor scenes that adhere to textual descriptions and spatial layout preferences provided by users. Central to our method is a rendering-based technique, which converts 3D semantic layouts into multi-view 2D proxy maps. Furthermore, we design a semantic and depth conditioned diffusion model to generate multi-view images, which are used to learn a neural radiance field (NeRF) as the final scene representation. Without the constraints of panorama image generation, we surpass previous methods in supporting complicated indoor space generation beyond a single room, even as complicated as a whole multi-bedroom apartment with irregular shapes and layouts. Through experimental analysis, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in complex indoor scene generation with diverse textures, consistent geometry, and realistic visual quality.

<p>Abstract: Estimating the location and intensity of tropical cyclones holds crucial significance for predicting catastrophic weather events. In this study, we approach this task as a detection and regression challenge, specifically over the North Indian Ocean (NIO) region where best tracks location and wind speed information serve as the labels. The current process for cyclone detection and intensity estimation involves physics-based simulation studies which are time-consuming, only using image features will automate the process for significantly faster and more accurate predictions. While conventional methods typically necessitate substantial prior knowledge for training, we are exploring alternative approaches to enhance efficiency. This research aims to focus specifically on cyclone detection, intensity estimation and related aspects using only image input and data-driven approaches and will lead to faster inference time and automate the process as opposed to current NWP models being utilized at SAC. In context to algorithm development, a novel two stage detection and intensity estimation module is proposed. In the first level detection we try to localize the cyclone over an entire image as captured by INSAT3D over the NIO (North Indian Ocean). For the intensity estimation task, we propose a CNN-LSTM network, which works on the cyclone centered images, utilizing a ResNet-18 backbone, by which we are able to capture both temporal and spatial characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atma Bharathi Mani, Nagashree TR, Manavalan P, Diwakar PG</p>
<p>Abstract: Clouds in satellite images are a deterrent to qualitative and quantitative study. Time compositing methods compare a series of co-registered images and retrieve only those pixels that have comparatively lesser cloud cover for the resultant image. Two different approaches of time compositing were tested. The first method recoded the clouds to value 0 on all the constituent images and ran a 'max' function. The second method directly ran a 'min' function without recoding on all the images for the resultant image. The 'max' function gave a highly mottled image while the 'min' function gave a superior quality image with smoother texture. Persistent clouds on all constituent images were retained in both methods, but they were readily identifiable and easily extractable in the 'max' function image as they were recoded to 0, while that in the 'min' function appeared with varying DN values. Hence a hybrid technique was created which recodes the clouds to value 255 and runs a 'min' function. This method preserved the quality of the 'min' function and the advantage of retrieving clouds as in the 'max' function image. The models were created using Erdas Imagine Modeler 9.1 and MODIS 250 m resolution images of coastal Karnataka in the months of May, June 2008 were used. A detailed investigation on the different methods is described and scope for automating different techniques is discussed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxing Xu, Mengcheng Lan, Xia Dong, Kai He, Wei Zhang, Qingtian Bian, Yiping Ke</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of neuroscience, identifying distinctive patterns associated with neurological disorders via brain networks is crucial. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) serves as a primary tool for mapping these networks by correlating blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across different brain regions, defined as regions of interest (ROIs). Constructing these brain networks involves using atlases to parcellate the brain into ROIs based on various hypotheses of brain division. However, there is no standard atlas for brain network classification, leading to limitations in detecting abnormalities in disorders. Some recent methods have proposed utilizing multiple atlases, but they neglect consistency across atlases and lack ROI-level information exchange. To tackle these limitations, we propose an Atlas-Integrated Distillation and Fusion network (AIDFusion) to improve brain network classification using fMRI data. AIDFusion addresses the challenge of utilizing multiple atlases by employing a disentangle Transformer to filter out inconsistent atlas-specific information and distill distinguishable connections across atlases. It also incorporates subject- and population-level consistency constraints to enhance cross-atlas consistency. Additionally, AIDFusion employs an inter-atlas message-passing mechanism to fuse complementary information across brain regions. Experimental results on four datasets of different diseases demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of AIDFusion compared to state-of-the-art methods. A case study illustrates AIDFusion extract patterns that are both interpretable and consistent with established neuroscience findings.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent development of deep learning (DL) methods for computer vision has been driven by the creation of open benchmark datasets on which new algorithms can be tested and compared with reproducible results. Although DL methods have many applications in geophysics, few real seismic datasets are available for benchmarking DL models, especially for denoising real data, which is one of the main problems in seismic data processing scenarios in the oil and gas industry. This article presents a benchmark dataset composed of synthetic seismic data corrupted with noise extracted from a filtering process implemented on real data. In this work, a comparison between two well-known DL-based denoising models is conducted on this dataset, which is proposed as a benchmark for accelerating the development of new solutions for seismic data denoising. This work also introduces a new evaluation metric that can capture small variations in model results. The results show that DL models are effective at denoising seismic data, but some issues remain to be solved.</p>

FusionSense addresses three key challenges: (i) How can robots efficiently acquire robust global shape information about the surrounding scene and objects? (ii) How can robots strategically select touch points on the object using geometric and common-sense priors? (iii) How can partial observations such as tactile signals improve the overall representation of the object? Our framework employs 3D Gaussian Splatting as a core representation and incorporates a hierarchical optimization strategy involving global structure construction, object visual hull pruning and local geometric constraints. This advancement results in fast and robust perception in environments with traditionally challenging objects that are transparent, reflective, or dark, enabling more downstream manipulation or navigation tasks. Experiments on real-world data suggest that our framework outperforms previously state-of-the-art sparse-view methods. All code and data are open-sourced on the project website.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed El Amine Meguenani, Alceu de Souza Britto Jr., Alessandro Lameiras Koerich</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper exploits the zero-shot capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for music genre classification. The proposed approach splits audio signals into 20 ms chunks and processes them through convolutional feature encoders, a transformer encoder, and additional layers for coding audio units and generating feature vectors. The extracted feature vectors are used to train a classification head. During inference, predictions on individual chunks are aggregated for a final genre classification. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of LLMs, including WavLM, HuBERT, and wav2vec 2.0, with traditional deep learning architectures like 1D and 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the audio spectrogram transformer (AST). Our findings demonstrate the superior performance of the AST model, achieving an overall accuracy of 85.5%, surpassing all other models evaluated. These results highlight the potential of LLMs and transformer-based architectures for advancing music information retrieval tasks, even in zero-shot scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony Etim, Jakub Szefer</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial example attacks have emerged as a critical threat to machine learning. Adversarial attacks in image classification abuse various, minor modifications to the image that confuse the image classification neural network -- while the image still remains recognizable to humans. One important domain where the attacks have been applied is in the automotive setting with traffic sign classification. Researchers have demonstrated that adding stickers, shining light, or adding shadows are all different means to make machine learning inference algorithms mis-classify the traffic signs. This can cause potentially dangerous situations as a stop sign is recognized as a speed limit sign causing vehicles to ignore it and potentially leading to accidents. To address these attacks, this work focuses on enhancing defenses against such adversarial attacks. This work shifts the advantage to the user by introducing the idea of leveraging historical images and majority voting. While the attacker modifies a traffic sign that is currently being processed by the victim's machine learning inference, the victim can gain advantage by examining past images of the same traffic sign. This work introduces the notion of ''time traveling'' and uses historical Street View images accessible to anybody to perform inference on different, past versions of the same traffic sign. In the evaluation, the proposed defense has 100% effectiveness against latest adversarial example attack on traffic sign classification algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samir Abou Haidar, Alexandre Chariot, Mehdi Darouich, Cyril Joly, Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud</p>
<p>Abstract: Within a perception framework for autonomous mobile and robotic systems, semantic analysis of 3D point clouds typically generated by LiDARs is key to numerous applications, such as object detection and recognition, and scene reconstruction. Scene semantic segmentation can be achieved by directly integrating 3D spatial data with specialized deep neural networks. Although this type of data provides rich geometric information regarding the surrounding environment, it also presents numerous challenges: its unstructured and sparse nature, its unpredictable size, and its demanding computational requirements. These characteristics hinder the real-time semantic analysis, particularly on resource-constrained hardware architectures that constitute the main computational components of numerous robotic applications. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate various 3D semantic segmentation methodologies and analyze their performance and capabilities for resource-constrained inference on embedded NVIDIA Jetson platforms. We evaluate them for a fair comparison through a standardized training protocol and data augmentations, providing benchmark results on the Jetson AGX Orin and AGX Xavier series for two large-scale outdoor datasets: SemanticKITTI and nuScenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Hoopes, Victor Ion Butoi, John V. Guttag, Adrian V. Dalca</p>
<p>Abstract: We present VoxelPrompt, an agent-driven vision-language framework that tackles diverse radiological tasks through joint modeling of natural language, image volumes, and analytical metrics. VoxelPrompt is multi-modal and versatile, leveraging the flexibility of language interaction while providing quantitatively grounded image analysis. Given a variable number of 3D medical volumes, such as MRI and CT scans, VoxelPrompt employs a language agent that iteratively predicts executable instructions to solve a task specified by an input prompt. These instructions communicate with a vision network to encode image features and generate volumetric outputs (e.g., segmentations). VoxelPrompt interprets the results of intermediate instructions and plans further actions to compute discrete measures (e.g., tumor growth across a series of scans) and present relevant outputs to the user. We evaluate this framework in a sandbox of diverse neuroimaging tasks, and we show that the single VoxelPrompt model can delineate hundreds of anatomical and pathological features, measure many complex morphological properties, and perform open-language analysis of lesion characteristics. VoxelPrompt carries out these objectives with accuracy similar to that of fine-tuned, single-task models for segmentation and visual question-answering, while facilitating a much larger range of tasks. Therefore, by supporting accurate image processing with language interaction, VoxelPrompt provides comprehensive utility for numerous imaging tasks that traditionally require specialized models to address.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eunji Kim, Kyuhong Shim, Simyung Chang, Sungroh Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: A text encoder within Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP plays a crucial role in translating textual input into an embedding space shared with images, thereby facilitating the interpretative analysis of vision tasks through natural language. Despite the varying significance of different textual elements within a sentence depending on the context, efforts to account for variation of importance in constructing text embeddings have been lacking. We propose a framework of Semantic Token Reweighting to build Interpretable text embeddings (SToRI), which incorporates controllability as well. SToRI refines the text encoding process in CLIP by differentially weighting semantic elements based on contextual importance, enabling finer control over emphasis responsive to data-driven insights and user preferences. The efficacy of SToRI is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on few-shot image classification and image retrieval tailored to user preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Li, Yangchen Yu, Yin Chen, Yu Zhang, Peng Jia, Yunbo Xu, Ziqiang Li, Meng Wang, Richang Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Engagement estimation plays a crucial role in understanding human social behaviors, attracting increasing research interests in fields such as affective computing and human-computer interaction. In this paper, we propose a Dialogue-Aware Transformer framework (DAT) with Modality-Group Fusion (MGF), which relies solely on audio-visual input and is language-independent, for estimating human engagement in conversations. Specifically, our method employs a modality-group fusion strategy that independently fuses audio and visual features within each modality for each person before inferring the entire audio-visual content. This strategy significantly enhances the model's performance and robustness. Additionally, to better estimate the target participant's engagement levels, the introduced Dialogue-Aware Transformer considers both the participant's behavior and cues from their conversational partners. Our method was rigorously tested in the Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation Challenge held by MultiMediate'24, demonstrating notable improvements in engagement-level regression precision over the baseline model. Notably, our approach achieves a CCC score of 0.76 on the NoXi Base test set and an average CCC of 0.64 across the NoXi Base, NoXi-Add, and MPIIGI test sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bolin Chen, Shanzhi Yin, Zihan Zhang, Jie Chen, Ru-Ling Liao, Lingyu Zhu, Shiqi Wang, Yan Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, deep generative models have greatly advanced the progress of face video coding towards promising rate-distortion performance and diverse application functionalities. Beyond traditional hybrid video coding paradigms, Generative Face Video Compression (GFVC) relying on the strong capabilities of deep generative models and the philosophy of early Model-Based Coding (MBC) can facilitate the compact representation and realistic reconstruction of visual face signal, thus achieving ultra-low bitrate face video communication. However, these GFVC algorithms are sometimes faced with unstable reconstruction quality and limited bitrate ranges. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel Progressive Face Video Compression framework, namely PFVC, that utilizes adaptive visual tokens to realize exceptional trade-offs between reconstruction robustness and bandwidth intelligence. In particular, the encoder of the proposed PFVC projects the high-dimensional face signal into adaptive visual tokens in a progressive manner, whilst the decoder can further reconstruct these adaptive visual tokens for motion estimation and signal synthesis with different granularity levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PFVC framework can achieve better coding flexibility and superior rate-distortion performance in comparison with the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC) codec and the state-of-the-art GFVC algorithms.

<p>Abstract: Iodinated contrast agents are widely utilized in numerous interventional procedures, yet posing substantial health risks to patients. This paper presents CAS-GAN, a novel GAN framework that serves as a ``virtual contrast agent" to synthesize X-ray angiographies via disentanglement representation learning and vessel semantic guidance, thereby reducing the reliance on iodinated agents during interventional procedures. Specifically, our approach disentangles X-ray angiographies into background and vessel components, leveraging medical prior knowledge. A specialized predictor then learns to map the interrelationships between these components. Additionally, a vessel semantic-guided generator and a corresponding loss function are introduced to enhance the visual fidelity of generated images. Experimental results on the XCAD dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our CAS-GAN, achieving a FID of 5.94 and a MMD of 0.017. These promising results highlight CAS-GAN's potential for clinical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic medical report generation (MRG), which aims to produce detailed text reports from medical images, has emerged as a critical task in this domain. MRG systems can enhance radiological workflows by reducing the time and effort required for report writing, thereby improving diagnostic efficiency. In this work, we present a novel approach for automatic MRG utilizing a multimodal large language model.

The experiment shows our model achieved an average Green score of 0.3 on the MRG task validation set and an average accuracy of 0.61 on the visual question answering (VQA) task validation set, outperforming the baseline model. Our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of the ViT3D alignment of LLaMA3 for automatic MRG and VQA tasks by tuning the model on a small dataset.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08620">Natural Language Induced Adversarial Images</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaopei Zhu, Peiyang Xu, Guanning Zeng, Yingpeng Dong, Xiaolin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Research of adversarial attacks is important for AI security because it shows the vulnerability of deep learning models and helps to build more robust models. Adversarial attacks on images are most widely studied, which include noise-based attacks, image editing-based attacks, and latent space-based attacks. However, the adversarial examples crafted by these methods often lack sufficient semantic information, making it challenging for humans to understand the failure modes of deep learning models under natural conditions. To address this limitation, we propose a natural language induced adversarial image attack method. The core idea is to leverage a text-to-image model to generate adversarial images given input prompts, which are maliciously constructed to lead to misclassification for a target model. To adopt commercial text-to-image models for synthesizing more natural adversarial images, we propose an adaptive genetic algorithm (GA) for optimizing discrete adversarial prompts without requiring gradients and an adaptive word space reduction method for improving query efficiency. We further used CLIP to maintain the semantic consistency of the generated images. In our experiments, we found that some high-frequency semantic information such as "foggy", "humid", "stretching", etc. can easily cause classifier errors. This adversarial semantic information exists not only in generated images but also in photos captured in the real world. We also found that some adversarial semantic information can be transferred to unknown classification tasks. Furthermore, our attack method can transfer to different text-to-image models (e.g., Midjourney, DALL-E 3, etc.) and image classifiers.

To address the increasing prevalence of (audio-)visual data on social media, and to capture the evolving and dynamic nature of this communication, researchers have begun to explore the potential of unsupervised approaches for analyzing multimodal online content. Our research contributes to this field by exploring the potential of multimodal topic modeling for analyzing conspiracy theories in German-language Telegram channels.

We analyze a corpus of ~40, 000 Telegram messages posted in October 2023 in 571 German-language Telegram channels known for disseminating conspiracy theories and other deceptive content. We explore the potentials and challenges of this approach for studying a medium-sized corpus of user-generated, text-image online content. We offer insights into the dominant topics across modalities, different text and image genres discovered during the analysis, quantitative inter-modal topic analyses, and a qualitative case study of textual, visual, and multimodal narrative strategies in the communication of conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic MRI image sequences from undersampled accelerated measurements is crucial for faster and higher spatiotemporal resolution real-time imaging of cardiac motion, free breathing motion and many other applications. Classical paradigms, such as gated cine MRI, assume periodicity, disallowing imaging of true motion. Supervised deep learning methods are fundamentally flawed as, in dynamic imaging, ground truth fully-sampled videos are impossible to truly obtain. We propose an unsupervised framework to learn to reconstruct dynamic MRI sequences from undersampled measurements alone by leveraging natural geometric spatiotemporal equivariances of MRI. Dynamic Diffeomorphic Equivariant Imaging (DDEI) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods such as SSDU on highly accelerated dynamic cardiac imaging. Our method is agnostic to the underlying neural network architecture and can be used to adapt the latest models and post-processing approaches.

Consequently, this research investigates through three cases of study fundamental aspects of hybrid quantum machine models for EO tasks aiming to provide a solid groundwork for future research studies towards more adequate simulations and looking at the post-NISQ era. More in detail, we firstly (1) investigate how different quantum libraries behave when training hybrid quantum models, assessing their computational efficiency and effectiveness. Secondly, (2) we analyze the stability/sensitivity to initialization values (i.e., seed values) in both traditional model and quantum-enhanced counterparts. Finally, (3) we explore the benefits of hybrid quantum attention-based models in EO applications, examining how integrating quantum circuits into ViTs can improve model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanieh Shojaei, Qianqian Zou, Max Mehltretter</p>
<p>Abstract: Safe navigation in new environments requires autonomous vehicles and robots to accurately interpret their surroundings, relying on LiDAR scene segmentation, out-of-distribution (OOD) obstacle detection, and uncertainty computation. We propose a method to distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OOD samples and quantify both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties using the feature space of a single deterministic model. After training a semantic segmentation network, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is fitted to its feature space. OOD samples are detected by checking if their squared Mahalanobis distances to each Gaussian component conform to a chi-squared distribution, eliminating the need for an additional OOD training set. Given that the estimated mean and covariance matrix of a multivariate Gaussian distribution follow Gaussian and Inverse-Wishart distributions, multiple GMMs are generated by sampling from these distributions to assess epistemic uncertainty through classification variability. Aleatoric uncertainty is derived from the entropy of responsibility values within Gaussian components. Comparing our method with deep ensembles and logit-sampling for uncertainty computation demonstrates its superior performance in real-world applications for quantifying epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, as well as detecting OOD samples. While deep ensembles miss some highly uncertain samples, our method successfully detects them and assigns high epistemic uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> H. Yi, H. Ren, C. Hu, Y. Li, J. Deng, X. Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become a cornerstone of privacy protection, shifting the paradigm towards localizing sensitive data while only sending model gradients to a central server. This strategy is designed to reinforce privacy protections and minimize the vulnerabilities inherent in centralized data storage systems. Despite its innovative approach, recent empirical studies have highlighted potential weaknesses in FL, notably regarding the exchange of gradients. In response, this study introduces a novel, efficacious method aimed at safeguarding against gradient leakage, namely, ``AdaDefense". Following the idea that model convergence can be achieved by using different types of optimization methods, we suggest using a local stand-in rather than the actual local gradient for global gradient aggregation on the central server. This proposed approach not only effectively prevents gradient leakage, but also ensures that the overall performance of the model remains largely unaffected. Delving into the theoretical dimensions, we explore how gradients may inadvertently leak private information and present a theoretical framework supporting the efficacy of our proposed method. Extensive empirical tests, supported by popular benchmark experiments, validate that our approach maintains model integrity and is robust against gradient leakage, marking an important step in our pursuit of safe and efficient FL.</p>

In this work, we explore using VLM to interpret human demonstration videos and generate robot task planning.

We named it SeeDo because it enables the VLM to ''see'' human demonstrations and explain the corresponding plans to the robot for it to ''do''. To validate our approach, we collected a set of long-horizon human videos demonstrating pick-and-place tasks in three diverse categories and designed a set of metrics to comprehensively benchmark SeeDo against several baselines, including state-of-the-art video-input VLMs. The experiments demonstrate SeeDo's superior performance.

However, the effectiveness of these AI models is often limited by their reliance on large amounts of task-specific labeled data and their inability to generalize across diverse clinical settings. To address these challenges, we introduce CXRBase, a foundational model designed to learn versatile representations from unlabelled CXR images, facilitating efficient adaptation to various clinical tasks. CXRBase is initially trained on a substantial dataset of 1.04 million unlabelled CXR images using self-supervised learning methods. This approach allows the model to discern meaningful patterns without the need for explicit labels. After this initial phase, CXRBase is fine-tuned with labeled data to enhance its performance in disease detection, enabling accurate classification of chest diseases. CXRBase provides a generalizable solution to improve model performance and alleviate the annotation workload of experts to enable broad clinical AI applications from chest imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruinan Wang, Ian Nabney, Mohammad Golbabaee</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperparameter selection is an essential aspect of the machine learning pipeline, profoundly impacting models' robustness, stability, and generalization capabilities. Given the complex hyperparameter spaces associated with Neural Networks and the constraints of computational resources and time, optimizing all hyperparameters becomes impractical. In this context, leveraging hyperparameter importance assessment (HIA) can provide valuable guidance by narrowing down the search space. This enables machine learning practitioners to focus their optimization efforts on the hyperparameters with the most significant impact on model performance while conserving time and resources. This paper aims to quantify the importance weights of some hyperparameters in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with an algorithm called N-RReliefF, laying the groundwork for applying HIA methodologies in the Deep Learning field. We conduct an extensive study by training over ten thousand CNN models across ten popular image classification datasets, thereby acquiring a comprehensive dataset containing hyperparameter configuration instances and their corresponding performance metrics. It is demonstrated that among the investigated hyperparameters, the top five important hyperparameters of the CNN model are the number of convolutional layers, learning rate, dropout rate, optimizer and epoch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Xiling Li, Korbinian Franz Rudolf, Nils Blank, Rudolf Lioutikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Prototype Learning methods provide an interpretable alternative to black-box deep learning models. Approaches such as ProtoPNet learn, which part of a test image "look like" known prototypical parts from training images, combining predictive power with the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning. However, existing approaches have two main drawbacks: A) They rely solely on deterministic similarity scores without statistical confidence. B) The prototypes are learned in a black-box manner without human input. This work introduces HyperPg, a new prototype representation leveraging Gaussian distributions on a hypersphere in latent space, with learnable mean and variance. HyperPg prototypes adapt to the spread of clusters in the latent space and output likelihood scores. The new architecture, HyperPgNet, leverages HyperPg to learn prototypes aligned with human concepts from pixel-level annotations. Consequently, each prototype represents a specific concept such as color, image texture, or part of the image subject. A concept extraction pipeline built on foundation models provides pixel-level annotations, significantly reducing human labeling effort. Experiments on CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets demonstrate that HyperPgNet outperforms other prototype learning architectures while using fewer parameters and training steps. Additionally, the concept-aligned HyperPg prototypes are learned transparently, enhancing model interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brighton Ancelin, Alex Saad-Falcon, Kason Ancelin, Justin Romberg</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose new algorithms to efficiently average a collection of points on a Grassmannian manifold in both the centralized and decentralized settings. Grassmannian points are used ubiquitously in machine learning, computer vision, and signal processing to represent data through (often low-dimensional) subspaces. While averaging these points is crucial to many tasks (especially in the decentralized setting), existing methods unfortunately remain computationally expensive due to the non-Euclidean geometry of the manifold. Our proposed algorithms, Rapid Grassmannian Averaging (RGrAv) and Decentralized Rapid Grassmannian Averaging (DRGrAv), overcome this challenge by leveraging the spectral structure of the problem to rapidly compute an average using only small matrix multiplications and QR factorizations. We provide a theoretical guarantee of optimality and present numerical experiments which demonstrate that our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art methods in providing high accuracy solutions in minimal time. Additional experiments showcase the versatility of our algorithms to tasks such as K-means clustering on video motion data, establishing RGrAv and DRGrAv as powerful tools for generic Grassmannian averaging.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image registration is an essential step in many medical image analysis tasks. Traditional methods for image registration are primarily optimization-driven, finding the optimal deformations that maximize the similarity between two images. Recent learning-based methods, trained to directly predict transformations between two images, run much faster, but suffer from performance deficiencies due to model generalization and the inefficiency in handling individual image specific deformations. Here we present a new neural net based image registration framework, called NIR (Neural Image Registration), which is based on optimization but utilizes deep neural nets to model deformations between image pairs. NIR represents the transformation between two images with a continuous function implemented via neural fields, receiving a 3D coordinate as input and outputting the corresponding deformation vector. NIR provides two ways of generating deformation field: directly output a displacement vector field for general deformable registration, or output a velocity vector field and integrate the velocity field to derive the deformation field for diffeomorphic image registration. The optimal registration is discovered by updating the parameters of the neural field via stochastic gradient descent. We describe several design choices that facilitate model optimization, including coordinate encoding, sinusoidal activation, coordinate sampling, and intensity sampling. Experiments on two 3D MR brain scan datasets demonstrate that NIR yields state-of-the-art performance in terms of both registration accuracy and regularity, while running significantly faster than traditional optimization-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fang Xu, Yilei Shi, Patrick Ebel, Wen Yang, Xiao Xiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Cloud removal is a significant and challenging problem in remote sensing, and in recent years, there have been notable advancements in this area. However, two major issues remain hindering the development of cloud removal: the unavailability of high-resolution imagery for existing datasets and the absence of evaluation regarding the semantic meaningfulness of the generated structures. In this paper, we introduce M3R-CR, a benchmark dataset for high-resolution Cloud Removal with Multi-Modal and Multi-Resolution data fusion. With this dataset, we consider the problem of cloud removal in high-resolution optical remote sensing imagery by integrating multi-modal and multi-resolution information. In this context, we have to take into account the alignment errors caused by the multi-resolution nature, along with the more pronounced misalignment issues in high-resolution images due to inherent imaging mechanism differences and other factors. Existing multi-modal data fusion based methods, which assume the image pairs are aligned accurately at pixel-level, are thus not appropriate for this problem. To this end, we design a new baseline named Align-CR to perform the low-resolution SAR image guided high-resolution optical image cloud removal. It gradually warps and fuses the features of the multi-modal and multi-resolution data during the reconstruction process, effectively mitigating concerns associated with misalignment. In the experiments, we evaluate the performance of cloud removal by analyzing the quality of visually pleasing textures using image reconstruction metrics and further analyze the generation of semantically meaningful structures using a well-established semantic segmentation task. The proposed Align-CR method is superior to other baseline methods in both areas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaochao Zheng, Luping Wang, Bin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This technical report presents our Restormer-Plus approach, which was submitted to the GT-RAIN Challenge (CVPR 2023 UG$^2$+ Track 3). Details regarding the challenge are available at http://cvpr2023.ug2challenge.org/track3.html. Restormer-Plus outperformed all other submitted solutions in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and ranked 4th in terms of structural similarity (SSIM). It was officially evaluated by the competition organizers as a runner-up solution. It consists of four main modules: the single-image de-raining module (Restormer-X), the median filtering module, the weighted averaging module, and the post-processing module. Restormer-X is applied to each rainy image and built on top of Restormer. The median filtering module is used as a median operator for rainy images associated with each scene. The weighted averaging module combines the median filtering results with those of Restormer-X to alleviate overfitting caused by using only Restormer-X. Finally, the post-processing module is utilized to improve the brightness restoration. These modules make Restormer-Plus one of the state-of-the-art solutions for the GT-RAIN Challenge.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chiara Mauri, Stefano Cerri, Oula Puonti, Mark M\"uhlau, Koen Van Leemput</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing interest in methods for predicting an unknown variable of interest, such as a subject's diagnosis, from medical images depicting its anatomical-functional effects. Methods based on discriminative modeling excel at making accurate predictions, but are challenged in their ability to explain their decisions in anatomically meaningful terms. In this paper, we propose a simple technique for single-subject prediction that is inherently interpretable. It augments the generative models used in classical human brain mapping techniques, in which the underlying cause-effect relations can be encoded, with a multivariate noise model that captures dominant spatial correlations. Experiments demonstrate that the resulting model can be efficiently inverted to make accurate subject-level predictions, while at the same time offering intuitive visual explanations of its inner workings. The method is easy to use: training is fast for typical training set sizes, and only a single hyperparameter needs to be set by the user.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Huang, Susan Liang, Yapeng Tian, Anurag Kumar, Chenliang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS leverages a generative diffusion model and a Separation U-Net to synthesize separated sounds directly from Gaussian noise, conditioned on both the audio mixture and the visual information. With its generative objective, DAVIS is better suited to achieving the goal of high-quality sound separation across diverse sound categories. We compare DAVIS to existing state-of-the-art discriminative audio-visual separation methods on the AVE and MUSIC datasets, and results show that DAVIS outperforms other methods in separation quality, demonstrating the advantages of our framework for tackling the audio-visual source separation task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hossein Shakibania, Sina Raoufi, Hassan Khotanlou</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-light images, characterized by inadequate illumination, pose challenges of diminished clarity, muted colors, and reduced details. Low-light image enhancement, an essential task in computer vision, aims to rectify these issues by improving brightness, contrast, and overall perceptual quality, thereby facilitating accurate analysis and interpretation. This paper introduces the Convolutional Dense Attention-guided Network (CDAN), a novel solution for enhancing low-light images. CDAN integrates an autoencoder-based architecture with convolutional and dense blocks, complemented by an attention mechanism and skip connections. This architecture ensures efficient information propagation and feature learning. Furthermore, a dedicated post-processing phase refines color balance and contrast. Our approach demonstrates notable progress compared to state-of-the-art results in low-light image enhancement, showcasing its robustness across a wide range of challenging scenarios. Our model performs remarkably on benchmark datasets, effectively mitigating under-exposure and proficiently restoring textures and colors in diverse low-light scenarios. This achievement underscores CDAN's potential for diverse computer vision tasks, notably enabling robust object detection and recognition in challenging low-light conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Waseem Akram, Muhayyuddin Ahmed, Lakmal Seneviratne, Irfan Hussain</p>
<p>Abstract: Aquaculture is a thriving food-producing sector producing over half of the global fish consumption. However, these aquafarms pose significant challenges such as biofouling, vegetation, and holes within their net pens and have a profound effect on the efficiency and sustainability of fish production. Currently, divers and/or remotely operated vehicles are deployed for inspecting and maintaining aquafarms; this approach is expensive and requires highly skilled human operators. This work aims to develop a robotic-based automatic net defect detection system for aquaculture net pens oriented to on- ROV processing and real-time detection of different aqua-net defects such as biofouling, vegetation, net holes, and plastic. The proposed system integrates both deep learning-based methods for aqua-net defect detection and feedback control law for the vehicle movement around the aqua-net to obtain a clear sequence of net images and inspect the status of the net via performing the inspection tasks. This work contributes to the area of aquaculture inspection, marine robotics, and deep learning aiming to reduce cost, improve quality, and ease of operation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongjin Yang, Jongwoo Ko, Se-Young Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable applicability across a variety of downstream tasks, including zero-shot image classification. Recently, the use of prompts or adapters for efficient transfer learning (ETL) has gained significant attention for effectively adapting to downstream tasks. However, previous studies have overlooked the challenge of varying transfer difficulty of downstream tasks. In this paper, we empirically analyze how each ETL method behaves with respect to transfer difficulty. Our observations indicate that utilizing vision prompts and text adapters is crucial for adaptability and generalizability in domains with high difficulty. Also, by applying an adaptive ensemble approach that integrates task-adapted VLMs with pre-trained VLMs and strategically leverages more general knowledge in low-difficulty and less in high-difficulty domains, we consistently enhance performance across both types of domains. Based on these observations, we propose an adaptive ensemble method that combines visual prompts and text adapters with pre-trained VLMs, tailored by transfer difficulty, to achieve optimal performance for any target domain. Upon experimenting with extensive benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms all baselines, particularly on unseen tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Semantic correspondence methods have advanced to obtaining high-quality correspondences employing complicated networks, aiming to maximize the model capacity. However, despite the performance improvements, they may remain constrained by the scarcity of training keypoint pairs, a consequence of the limited training images and the sparsity of keypoints. This paper builds on the hypothesis that there is an inherent data-hungry matter in learning semantic correspondences and uncovers the models can be more trained by employing densified training pairs. We demonstrate a simple machine annotator reliably enriches paired key points via machine supervision, requiring neither extra labeled key points nor trainable modules from unlabeled images. Consequently, our models surpass current state-of-the-art models on semantic correspondence learning benchmarks like SPair-71k, PF-PASCAL, and PF-WILLOW and enjoy further robustness on corruption benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: Accurate representations of 3D faces are of paramount importance in various computer vision and graphics applications. However, the challenges persist due to the limitations imposed by data discretization and model linearity, which hinder the precise capture of identity and expression clues in current studies. This paper presents a novel 3D morphable face model, named ImFace++, to learn a sophisticated and continuous space with implicit neural representations. ImFace++ first constructs two explicitly disentangled deformation fields to model complex shapes associated with identities and expressions, respectively, which simultaneously facilitate automatic learning of point-to-point correspondences across diverse facial shapes. To capture more sophisticated facial details, a refinement displacement field within the template space is further incorporated, enabling fine-grained learning of individual-specific facial details. Furthermore, a Neural Blend-Field is designed to reinforce the representation capabilities through adaptive blending of an array of local fields. In addition to ImFace++, we devise an improved learning strategy to extend expression embeddings, allowing for a broader range of expression variations. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrates that ImFace++ significantly advances the state-of-the-art in terms of both face reconstruction fidelity and correspondence accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Painchaud, J\'er\'emie Stym-Popper, Pierre-Yves Courand, Nicolas Thome, Pierre-Marc Jodoin, Nicolas Duchateau, Olivier Bernard</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning enables automatic and robust extraction of cardiac function descriptors from echocardiographic sequences, such as ejection fraction or strain. These descriptors provide fine-grained information that physicians consider, in conjunction with more global variables from the clinical record, to assess patients' condition. Drawing on novel transformer models applied to tabular data, we propose a method that considers all descriptors extracted from medical records and echocardiograms to learn the representation of a cardiovascular pathology with a difficult-to-characterize continuum, namely hypertension. Our method first projects each variable into its own representation space using modality-specific approaches. These standardized representations of multimodal data are then fed to a transformer encoder, which learns to merge them into a comprehensive representation of the patient through the task of predicting a clinical rating. This stratification task is formulated as an ordinal classification to enforce a pathological continuum in the representation space. We observe the major trends along this continuum on a cohort of 239 hypertensive patients, providing unprecedented details in the description of hypertension's impact on various cardiac function descriptors. Our analysis shows that i) the XTab foundation model's architecture allows to reach outstanding performance (98% AUROC) even with limited data (less than 200 training samples), ii) stratification across the population is reproducible between trainings (within 3.6% MAE), and iii) patterns emerge in descriptors, some of which align with established physiological knowledge about hypertension, while others could pave the way for a more comprehensive understanding of this pathology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunpeng Gong, Zhun Zhong, Yansong Qu, Zhiming Luo, Rongrong Ji, Min Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant research focusing on addressing security concerns in single-modal person re-identification (ReID) systems that are based on RGB images. However, the safety of cross-modality scenarios, which are more commonly encountered in practical applications involving images captured by infrared cameras, has not received adequate attention. The main challenge in cross-modality ReID lies in effectively dealing with visual differences between different modalities. For instance, infrared images are typically grayscale, unlike visible images that contain color information. Existing attack methods have primarily focused on the characteristics of the visible image modality, overlooking the features of other modalities and the variations in data distribution among different modalities. This oversight can potentially undermine the effectiveness of these methods in image retrieval across diverse modalities. This study represents the first exploration into the security of cross-modality ReID models and proposes a universal perturbation attack specifically designed for cross-modality ReID. This attack optimizes perturbations by leveraging gradients from diverse modality data, thereby disrupting the discriminator and reinforcing the differences between modalities. We conducted experiments on three widely used cross-modality datasets, namely RegDB, SYSU, and LLCM. The results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of our method but also provide insights for future improvements in the robustness of cross-modality ReID systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Li, Ziyang Zhang, Jinglin Zhao, Zheng Wang, Bocheng Ren, Debin Liu, Laurence T. Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked autoencoding and generative pretraining have achieved remarkable success in computer vision and natural language processing, and more recently, they have been extended to the point cloud domain. Nevertheless, existing point cloud models suffer from the issue of information leakage due to the pre-sampling of center points, which leads to trivial proxy tasks for the models. These approaches primarily focus on local feature reconstruction, limiting their ability to capture global patterns within point clouds. In this paper, we argue that the reduced difficulty of pretext tasks hampers the model's capacity to learn expressive representations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel solution called the Differentiable Center Sampling Network (DCS-Net). It tackles the information leakage problem by incorporating both global feature reconstruction and local feature reconstruction as non-trivial proxy tasks, enabling simultaneous learning of both the global and local patterns within point cloud. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the expressive capacity of existing point cloud models and effectively addresses the issue of information leakage.</p>

We propose an Ordinal Diffusion Model (ODM) that controls the ordinal relationships of the estimated noise images among the classes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Zhang, Haobo Yuan, Lu Qi, Jiangning Zhang, Qianyu Zhou, Shunping Ji, Shuicheng Yan, Xiangtai Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, state space models have exhibited strong global modeling capabilities and linear computational complexity in contrast to transformers. This research focuses on applying such architecture to more efficiently and effectively model point cloud data globally with linear computational complexity. In particular, for the first time, we demonstrate that Mamba-based point cloud methods can outperform previous methods based on transformer or multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). To enable Mamba to process 3-D point cloud data more effectively, we propose a novel Consistent Traverse Serialization method to convert point clouds into 1-D point sequences while ensuring that neighboring points in the sequence are also spatially adjacent. Consistent Traverse Serialization yields six variants by permuting the order of \textit{x}, \textit{y}, and \textit{z} coordinates, and the synergistic use of these variants aids Mamba in comprehensively observing point cloud data. Furthermore, to assist Mamba in handling point sequences with different orders more effectively, we introduce point prompts to inform Mamba of the sequence's arrangement rules. Finally, we propose positional encoding based on spatial coordinate mapping to inject positional information into point cloud sequences more effectively. Point Cloud Mamba surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) point-based method PointNeXt and achieves new SOTA performance on the ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, ShapeNetPart, and S3DIS datasets. It is worth mentioning that when using a more powerful local feature extraction module, our PCM achieves 79.6 mIoU on S3DIS, significantly surpassing the previous SOTA models, DeLA and PTv3, by 5.5 mIoU and 4.9 mIoU, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, foundation models trained on massive datasets to adapt to a wide range of tasks have attracted considerable attention and are actively being explored within the computer vision community. Among these, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) stands out for its remarkable progress in generalizability and flexibility for image segmentation tasks, achieved through prompt-based object mask generation. However, despite its strength, SAM faces two key limitations when applied to instance segmentation that segments specific objects or those in unique environments (e.g., task-specific adaptation for out-of-distribution objects) not typically present in the training data: 1) the ambiguity inherent in input prompts and 2) the necessity for extensive additional training to achieve optimal segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a task-specific adaptation (i.e., customization) of the segmentation foundation model via prompt learning tailored to SAM. Our method involves a prompt learning module (PLM), which adjusts input prompts into the embedding space to better align with peculiarities of the target task, thereby enabling more efficient training. Furthermore, we introduce a point matching module (PMM) to enhance the feature representation for finer segmentation by ensuring detailed alignment with ground truth boundaries. Experimental results on various customized segmentation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiwei Chen, Yajie Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a method for large-mask pluralistic image inpainting based on the generative framework of discrete latent codes. Our method learns latent priors, discretized as tokens, by only performing computations at the visible locations of the image. This is realized by a restrictive partial encoder that predicts the token label for each visible block, a bidirectional transformer that infers the missing labels by only looking at these tokens, and a dedicated synthesis network that couples the tokens with the partial image priors to generate coherent and pluralistic complete image even under extreme mask settings. Experiments on public benchmarks validate our design choices as the proposed method outperforms strong baselines in both visual quality and diversity metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Miao, Mohammed Bennamoun, Yongsheng Gao, Mubarak Shah, Ajmal Mian</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (R-VOS) methods face challenges in maintaining consistent object segmentation due to temporal context variability and the presence of other visually similar objects. We propose an end-to-end R-VOS paradigm that explicitly models temporal instance consistency alongside the referring segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a novel hybrid memory that facilitates inter-frame collaboration for robust spatio-temporal matching and propagation. Features of frames with automatically generated high-quality reference masks are propagated to segment the remaining frames based on multi-granularity association to achieve temporally consistent R-VOS. Furthermore, we propose a new Mask Consistency Score (MCS) metric to evaluate the temporal consistency of video segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances temporal consistency by a significant margin, leading to top-ranked performance on popular R-VOS benchmarks, i.e., Ref-YouTube-VOS (67.1%) and Ref-DAVIS17 (65.6%).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gianluca Barone, Aashrit Cunchala, Rudy Nunez</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard classification theory assumes that the distribution of images in the test and training sets are identical. Unfortunately, real-life scenarios typically feature unseen data (``out-of-distribution data") which is different from data in the training distribution (``in-distribution"). This issue is most prevalent in social justice problems where data from under-represented groups may appear in the test data without representing an equal proportion of the training data. This may result in a model returning confidently wrong decisions and predictions. We are interested in the following question: Can the performance of a neural network improve on facial images of out-of-distribution data when it is trained simultaneously on multiple datasets of in-distribution data? We approach this problem by incorporating the Outlier Exposure model and investigate how the model's performance changes when other datasets of facial images were implemented. We observe that the accuracy and other metrics of the model can be increased by applying Outlier Exposure, incorporating a trainable weight parameter to increase the machine's emphasis on outlier images, and by re-weighting the importance of different class labels. We also experimented with whether sorting the images and determining outliers via image features would have more of an effect on the metrics than sorting by average pixel value, and found no conclusive results. Our goal was to make models not only more accurate but also more fair by scanning a more expanded range of images. Utilizing Python and the Pytorch package, we found models utilizing outlier exposure could result in more fair classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Song, Zhan Li, Shi Chen, Xin-Qiang Cai, Kazuyuki Demachi</p>
<p>Abstract: Action recognition, an essential component of computer vision, plays a pivotal role in multiple applications. Despite significant improvements brought by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), these models suffer performance declines when trained with discontinuous video frames, which is a frequent scenario in real-world settings. This decline primarily results from the loss of temporal continuity, which is crucial for understanding the semantics of human actions. To overcome this issue, we introduce the 4A (Action Animation-based Augmentation Approach) pipeline, which employs a series of sophisticated techniques: starting with 2D human pose estimation from RGB videos, followed by Quaternion-based Graph Convolution Network for joint orientation and trajectory prediction, and Dynamic Skeletal Interpolation for creating smoother, diversified actions using game engine technology. This innovative approach generates realistic animations in varied game environments, viewed from multiple viewpoints. In this way, our method effectively bridges the domain gap between virtual and real-world data. In experimental evaluations, the 4A pipeline achieves comparable or even superior performance to traditional training approaches using real-world data, while requiring only 10% of the original data volume. Additionally, our approach demonstrates enhanced performance on In-the-wild videos, marking a significant advancement in the field of action recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gautham Vinod, Jiangpeng He, Zeman Shao, Fengqing Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-based methods to analyze food images have alleviated the user burden and biases associated with traditional methods. However, accurate portion estimation remains a major challenge due to the loss of 3D information in the 2D representation of foods captured by smartphone cameras or wearable devices. In this paper, we propose a new framework to estimate both food volume and energy from 2D images by leveraging the power of 3D food models and physical reference in the eating scene. Our method estimates the pose of the camera and the food object in the input image and recreates the eating occasion by rendering an image of a 3D model of the food with the estimated poses. We also introduce a new dataset, SimpleFood45, which contains 2D images of 45 food items and associated annotations including food volume, weight, and energy. Our method achieves an average error of 31.10 kCal (17.67%) on this dataset, outperforming existing portion estimation methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Song, Zhan Li, Shi Chen, Kazuyuki Demachi</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D human pose estimation is a vital task in computer vision, involving the prediction of human joint positions from images or videos to reconstruct a skeleton of a human in three-dimensional space. This technology is pivotal in various fields, including animation, security, human-computer interaction, and automotive safety, where it promotes both technological progress and enhanced human well-being. The advent of deep learning significantly advances the performance of 3D pose estimation by incorporating temporal information for predicting the spatial positions of human joints. However, traditional methods often fall short as they primarily focus on the spatial coordinates of joints and overlook the orientation and rotation of the connecting bones, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of human pose in 3D space. To address these limitations, we introduce Quater-GCN (Q-GCN), a directed graph convolutional network tailored to enhance pose estimation by orientation. Q-GCN excels by not only capturing the spatial dependencies among node joints through their coordinates but also integrating the dynamic context of bone rotations in 2D space. This approach enables a more sophisticated representation of human poses by also regressing the orientation of each bone in 3D space, moving beyond mere coordinate prediction. Furthermore, we complement our model with a semi-supervised training strategy that leverages unlabeled data, addressing the challenge of limited orientation ground truth data. Through comprehensive evaluations, Q-GCN has demonstrated outstanding performance against current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongwei Sun, Yajie Bao, Junmin Liu, Xiangyong Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing image change captioning (RSICC) aims to automatically generate sentences that describe content differences in remote sensing bitemporal images. Recently, attention-based transformers have become a prevalent idea for capturing the features of global change. However, existing transformer-based RSICC methods face challenges, e.g., high parameters and high computational complexity caused by the self-attention operation in the transformer encoder component. To alleviate these issues, this paper proposes a Sparse Focus Transformer (SFT) for the RSICC task. Specifically, the SFT network consists of three main components, i.e. a high-level features extractor based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), a sparse focus attention mechanism-based transformer encoder network designed to locate and capture changing regions in dual-temporal images, and a description decoder that embeds images and words to generate sentences for captioning differences. The proposed SFT network can reduce the parameter number and computational complexity by incorporating a sparse attention mechanism within the transformer encoder network. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that even with a reduction of over 90\% in parameters and computational complexity for the transformer encoder, our proposed network can still obtain competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art RSICC methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zebin You, Xinyu Zhang, Hanzhong Guo, Jingdong Wang, Chongxuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The ultimate goal of generative models is to perfectly capture the data distribution. For image generation, common metrics of visual quality (e.g., FID) and the perceived truthfulness of generated images seem to suggest that we are nearing this goal. However, through distribution classification tasks, we reveal that, from the perspective of neural network-based classifiers, even advanced diffusion models are still far from this goal. Specifically, classifiers are able to consistently and effortlessly distinguish real images from generated ones across various settings. Moreover, we uncover an intriguing discrepancy: classifiers can easily differentiate between diffusion models with comparable performance (e.g., U-ViT-H vs. DiT-XL), but struggle to distinguish between models within the same family but of different scales (e.g., EDM2-XS vs. EDM2-XXL). Our methodology carries several important implications. First, it naturally serves as a diagnostic tool for diffusion models by analyzing specific features of generated data. Second, it sheds light on the model autophagy disorder and offers insights into the use of generated data: augmenting real data with generated data is more effective than replacing it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen Li, Weixi Feng, Tsu-Jui Fu, Xinyi Wang, Sugato Basu, Wenhu Chen, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) models have achieved significant success but continue to be hampered by the slow sampling speed of their iterative sampling processes. To address the challenge, consistency models have been proposed to facilitate fast inference, albeit at the cost of sample quality. In this work, we aim to break the quality bottleneck of a video consistency model (VCM) to achieve $\textbf{both fast and high-quality video generation}$. We introduce T2V-Turbo, which integrates feedback from a mixture of differentiable reward models into the consistency distillation (CD) process of a pre-trained T2V model. Notably, we directly optimize rewards associated with single-step generations that arise naturally from computing the CD loss, effectively bypassing the memory constraints imposed by backpropagating gradients through an iterative sampling process. Remarkably, the 4-step generations from our T2V-Turbo achieve the highest total score on VBench, even surpassing Gen-2 and Pika. We further conduct human evaluations to corroborate the results, validating that the 4-step generations from our T2V-Turbo are preferred over the 50-step DDIM samples from their teacher models, representing more than a tenfold acceleration while improving video generation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weichao Zhao, Hao Feng, Qi Liu, Jingqun Tang, Shu Wei, Binghong Wu, Lei Liao, Yongjie Ye, Hao Liu, Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li, Can Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Tables contain factual and quantitative data accompanied by various structures and contents that pose challenges for machine comprehension. Previous methods generally design task-specific architectures and objectives for individual tasks, resulting in modal isolation and intricate workflows. In this paper, we present a novel large vision-language model, TabPedia, equipped with a concept synergy mechanism. In this mechanism, all the involved diverse visual table understanding (VTU) tasks and multi-source visual embeddings are abstracted as concepts. This unified framework allows TabPedia to seamlessly integrate VTU tasks, such as table detection, table structure recognition, table querying, and table question answering, by leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Moreover, the concept synergy mechanism enables table perception-related and comprehension-related tasks to work in harmony, as they can effectively leverage the needed clues from the corresponding source perception embeddings. Furthermore, to better evaluate the VTU task in real-world scenarios, we establish a new and comprehensive table VQA benchmark, ComTQA, featuring approximately 9,000 QA pairs. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on both table perception and comprehension tasks, conducted across various public benchmarks, validate the effectiveness of our TabPedia. The superior performance further confirms the feasibility of using LLMs for understanding visual tables when all concepts work in synergy. The benchmark ComTQA has been open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ByteDance/ComTQA. The source code and model also have been released athttps://github.com/zhaowc-ustc/TabPedia.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation has been an efficient approach to transferring the semantic segmentation model across data distributions. Meanwhile, the recent Open-vocabulary Semantic Scene understanding based on large-scale vision language models is effective in open-set settings because it can learn diverse concepts and categories. However, these prior methods fail to generalize across different camera views due to the lack of cross-view geometric modeling. At present, there are limited studies analyzing cross-view learning. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Unsupervised Cross-view Adaptation Learning approach to modeling the geometric structural change across views in Semantic Scene Understanding. First, we introduce a novel Cross-view Geometric Constraint on Unpaired Data to model structural changes in images and segmentation masks across cameras. Second, we present a new Geodesic Flow-based Correlation Metric to efficiently measure the geometric structural changes across camera views. Third, we introduce a novel view-condition prompting mechanism to enhance the view-information modeling of the open-vocabulary segmentation network in cross-view adaptation learning. The experiments on different cross-view adaptation benchmarks have shown the effectiveness of our approach in cross-view modeling, demonstrating that we achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance compared to prior unsupervised domain adaptation and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chun Gu, Zeyu Yang, Zijie Pan, Xiatian Zhu, Li Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D representation is essential to the significant advance of 3D generation with 2D diffusion priors. As a flexible representation, NeRF has been first adopted for 3D representation. With density-based volumetric rendering, it however suffers both intensive computational overhead and inaccurate mesh extraction. Using a signed distance field and Marching Tetrahedra, DMTet allows for precise mesh extraction and real-time rendering but is limited in handling large topological changes in meshes, leading to optimization challenges. Alternatively, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is favored in both training and rendering efficiency while falling short in mesh extraction. In this work, we introduce a novel 3D representation, Tetrahedron Splatting (TeT-Splatting), that supports easy convergence during optimization, precise mesh extraction, and real-time rendering simultaneously. This is achieved by integrating surface-based volumetric rendering within a structured tetrahedral grid while preserving the desired ability of precise mesh extraction, and a tile-based differentiable tetrahedron rasterizer. Furthermore, we incorporate eikonal and normal consistency regularization terms for the signed distance field to improve generation quality and stability. Critically, our representation can be trained without mesh extraction, making the optimization process easier to converge. Our TeT-Splatting can be readily integrated in existing 3D generation pipelines, along with polygonal mesh for texture optimization. Extensive experiments show that our TeT-Splatting strikes a superior tradeoff among convergence speed, render efficiency, and mesh quality as compared to previous alternatives under varying 3D generation settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent text-to-video (T2V) technology advancements, as demonstrated by models such as Gen2, Pika, and Sora, have significantly broadened its applicability and popularity. Despite these strides, evaluating these models poses substantial challenges. Primarily, due to the limitations inherent in automatic metrics, manual evaluation is often considered a superior method for assessing T2V generation. However, existing manual evaluation protocols face reproducibility, reliability, and practicality issues. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Text-to-Video Human Evaluation (T2VHE) protocol, a comprehensive and standardized protocol for T2V models. The T2VHE protocol includes well-defined metrics, thorough annotator training, and an effective dynamic evaluation module. Experimental results demonstrate that this protocol not only ensures high-quality annotations but can also reduce evaluation costs by nearly 50\%. We will open-source the entire setup of the T2VHE protocol, including the complete protocol workflow, the dynamic evaluation component details, and the annotation interface code. This will help communities establish more sophisticated human assessment protocols.</p>

<p>Abstract: Social networks are creating a digital world in which the cognitive, emotional, and pragmatic value of the imagery of human faces and bodies is arguably changing. However, researchers in the digital humanities are often ill-equipped to study these phenomena at scale. This work presents FRESCO (Face Representation in E-Societies through Computational Observation), a framework designed to explore the socio-cultural implications of images on social media platforms at scale. FRESCO deconstructs images into numerical and categorical variables using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, aligning with the principles of visual semiotics. The framework analyzes images across three levels: the plastic level, encompassing fundamental visual features like lines and colors; the figurative level, representing specific entities or concepts; and the enunciation level, which focuses particularly on constructing the point of view of the spectator and observer. These levels are analyzed to discern deeper narrative layers within the imagery. Experimental validation confirms the reliability and utility of FRESCO, and we assess its consistency and precision across two public datasets. Subsequently, we introduce the FRESCO score, a metric derived from the framework's output that serves as a reliable measure of similarity in image content.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the remarkable advancements in image generation and open-form text generation, the creation of interleaved image-text content has become an increasingly intriguing field. Multimodal story generation, characterized by producing narrative texts and vivid images in an interleaved manner, has emerged as a valuable and practical task with broad applications. However, this task poses significant challenges, as it necessitates the comprehension of the complex interplay between texts and images, and the ability to generate long sequences of coherent, contextually relevant texts and visuals. In this work, we propose SEED-Story, a novel method that leverages a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate extended multimodal stories. Our model, built upon the powerful comprehension capability of MLLM, predicts text tokens as well as visual tokens, which are subsequently processed with an adapted visual de-tokenizer to produce images with consistent characters and styles. We further propose multimodal attention sink mechanism to enable the generation of stories with up to 25 sequences (only 10 for training) in a highly efficient autoregressive manner. Additionally, we present a large-scale and high-resolution dataset named StoryStream for training our model and quantitatively evaluating the task of multimodal story generation in various aspects.</p>

<p>Abstract: Public urban spaces like streetscapes and plazas serve residents and accommodate social life in all its vibrant variations. Recent advances in Robotics and Embodied AI make public urban spaces no longer exclusive to humans. Food delivery bots and electric wheelchairs have started sharing sidewalks with pedestrians, while robot dogs and humanoids have recently emerged in the street. Micromobility enabled by AI for short-distance travel in public urban spaces plays a crucial component in the future transportation system. Ensuring the generalizability and safety of AI models maneuvering mobile machines is essential. In this work, we present MetaUrban, a compositional simulation platform for the AI-driven urban micromobility research. MetaUrban can construct an infinite number of interactive urban scenes from compositional elements, covering a vast array of ground plans, object placements, pedestrians, vulnerable road users, and other mobile agents' appearances and dynamics. We design point navigation and social navigation tasks as the pilot study using MetaUrban for urban micromobility research and establish various baselines of Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning. We conduct extensive evaluation across mobile machines, demonstrating that heterogeneous mechanical structures significantly influence the learning and execution of AI policies. We perform a thorough ablation study, showing that the compositional nature of the simulated environments can substantially improve the generalizability and safety of the trained mobile agents. MetaUrban will be made publicly available to provide research opportunities and foster safe and trustworthy embodied AI and micromobility in cities. The code and dataset will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tsung-Han Wu, Giscard Biamby, Jerome Quenum, Ritwik Gupta, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Trevor Darrell, David M. Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made significant strides in visual question-answering for single images. Recent advancements like long-context LMMs have allowed them to ingest larger, or even multiple, images. However, the ability to process a large number of visual tokens does not guarantee effective retrieval and reasoning for multi-image question answering (MIQA), especially in real-world applications like photo album searches or satellite imagery analysis. In this work, we first assess the limitations of current benchmarks for long-context LMMs. We address these limitations by introducing a new vision-centric, long-context benchmark, "Visual Haystacks (VHs)". We comprehensively evaluate both open-source and proprietary models on VHs, and demonstrate that these models struggle when reasoning across potentially unrelated images, perform poorly on cross-image reasoning, as well as exhibit biases based on the placement of key information within the context window. Towards a solution, we introduce MIRAGE (Multi-Image Retrieval Augmented Generation), an open-source, lightweight visual-RAG framework that processes up to 10k images on a single 40G A100 GPU -- far surpassing the 1k-image limit of contemporary models. MIRAGE demonstrates up to 13% performance improvement over existing open-source LMMs on VHs, sets a new state-of-the-art on the RetVQA multi-image QA benchmark, and achieves competitive performance on single-image QA with state-of-the-art LMMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanggong Yang, Yifei Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating high-fidelity landscape paintings remains a challenging task that requires precise control over both structure and style. In this paper, we present LPGen, a novel diffusion-based model specifically designed for landscape painting generation. LPGen introduces a decoupled cross-attention mechanism that independently processes structural and stylistic features, effectively mimicking the layered approach of traditional painting techniques. Additionally, LPGen proposes a structural controller, a multi-scale encoder designed to control the layout of landscape paintings, striking a balance between aesthetics and composition. Besides, the model is pre-trained on a curated dataset of high-resolution landscape images, categorized by distinct artistic styles, and then fine-tuned to ensure detailed and consistent output. Through extensive evaluations, LPGen demonstrates superior performance in producing paintings that are not only structurally accurate but also stylistically coherent, surpassing current state-of-the-art models. This work advances AI-generated art and offers new avenues for exploring the intersection of technology and traditional artistic practices. Our code, dataset, and model weights will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Zhao, Yongying Liu, Jiaqi Wang, Yijia Chen, Dianhan Xi, Xinlei Shao, Shigeru Tabeta, Katsunori Mizuno</p>
<p>Abstract: Underwater litter is widely spread across aquatic environments such as lakes, rivers, and oceans, significantly impacting natural ecosystems. Current monitoring technologies for detecting underwater litter face limitations in survey efficiency, cost, and environmental conditions, highlighting the need for efficient, consumer-grade technologies for automatic detection. This research introduces the Aerial-Aquatic Speedy Scanner (AASS) combined with Super-Resolution Reconstruction (SRR) and an improved YOLOv8 detection network. AASS enhances data acquisition efficiency over traditional methods, capturing high-quality images that accurately identify underwater waste. SRR improves image-resolution by mitigating motion blur and insufficient resolution, thereby enhancing detection tasks. Specifically, the RCAN model achieved the highest mean average precision (mAP) of 78.6% for detection accuracy on reconstructed images among the tested SRR models. With a magnification factor of 4, the SRR test set shows an improved mAP compared to the conventional bicubic set. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting underwater litter.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danush Kumar Venkatesh, Dominik Rivoir, Micha Pfeiffer, Stefanie Speidel</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer-assisted surgery (CAS) systems are designed to assist surgeons during procedures, thereby reducing complications and enhancing patient care. Training machine learning models for these systems requires a large corpus of annotated datasets, which is challenging to obtain in the surgical domain due to patient privacy concerns and the significant labeling effort required from doctors. Previous methods have explored unpaired image translation using generative models to create realistic surgical images from simulations. However, these approaches have struggled to produce high-quality, diverse surgical images. In this work, we introduce \emph{SurgicaL-CD}, a consistency-distilled diffusion method to generate realistic surgical images with only a few sampling steps without paired data. We evaluate our approach on three datasets, assessing the generated images in terms of quality and utility as downstream training datasets. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms GANs and diffusion-based approaches. Our code is available at https://gitlab.com/nct_tso_public/gan2diffusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Han, Chen Zhu, Xiangyu Zhao, Hengshu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual geo-localization demands in-depth knowledge and advanced reasoning skills to associate images with real-world geographic locations precisely. In general, traditional methods based on data-matching are hindered by the impracticality of storing adequate visual records of global landmarks. Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated the capability of geo-localization through Visual Question Answering (VQA), enabling a solution that does not require external geo-tagged image records. However, the performance of a single LVLM is still limited by its intrinsic knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce smileGeo, a novel visual geo-localization framework that leverages multiple Internet-enabled LVLM agents operating within an agent-based architecture. By facilitating inter-agent communication, smileGeo integrates the inherent knowledge of these agents with additional retrieved information, enhancing the ability to effectively localize images. Additionally, our framework employs a dynamic learning strategy that optimizes communication among agents, minimizing redundant interactions and improving overall system efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conducted experiments on three different datasets, and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngjoon Yu, Sangyun Chung, Byung-Kwan Lee, Yong Man Ro</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced with text-aligned vision inputs. They have made remarkable progress in computer vision tasks by aligning text modality with vision inputs. There are also endeavors to incorporate multi-vision sensors beyond RGB, including thermal, depth, and medical X-ray images. However, we observe that current LVLMs view images taken from multi-vision sensors as if they were in the same RGB domain without considering the physical characteristics of multi-vision sensors. They fail to convey the fundamental multi-vision sensor information from the dataset and the corresponding contextual knowledge properly. Consequently, alignment between the information from the actual physical environment and the text is not achieved correctly, making it difficult to answer complex sensor-related questions that consider the physical environment. In this paper, we aim to establish a multi-vision Sensor Perception And Reasoning benchmarK called SPARK that can reduce the fundamental multi-vision sensor information gap between images and multi-vision sensors. We generated 6,248 vision-language test samples to investigate multi-vision sensory perception and multi-vision sensory reasoning on physical sensor knowledge proficiency across different formats, covering different types of sensor-related questions. We utilized these samples to assess ten leading LVLMs. The results showed that most models displayed deficiencies in multi-vision sensory reasoning to varying extents.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Yao, Yukang Huo, Qingbin Tian, Jiayin Zhao, Xiao Liu, Ruifeng Wang, Lin Xue, Haihua Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Early detection of abnormal fish behavior caused by disease or hunger can be achieved through fish tracking using deep learning techniques, which holds significant value for industrial aquaculture. However, underwater reflections and some reasons with fish, such as the high similarity, rapid swimming caused by stimuli and mutual occlusion bring challenges to multi-target tracking of fish. To address these challenges, this paper establishes a complex multi-scenario sturgeon tracking dataset and introduces the FMRFT model, a real-time end-to-end fish tracking solution. The model incorporates the low video memory consumption Mamba In Mamba (MIM) architecture, which facilitates multi-frame temporal memory and feature extraction, thereby addressing the challenges to track multiple fish across frames. Additionally, the FMRFT model with the Query Time Sequence Intersection (QTSI) module effectively manages occluded objects and reduces redundant tracking frames using the superior feature interaction and prior frame processing capabilities of RT-DETR. This combination significantly enhances the accuracy and stability of fish tracking. Trained and tested on the dataset, the model achieves an IDF1 score of 90.3% and a MOTA accuracy of 94.3%. Experimental results show that the proposed FMRFT model effectively addresses the challenges of high similarity and mutual occlusion in fish populations, enabling accurate tracking in factory farming environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heethanjan Kanagalingam, Thenukan Pathmanathan, Navaneethan Ketheeswaran, Mokeeshan Vathanakumar, Mohamed Afham, Ranga Rodrigo</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to enable models to recognize novel objects or classes with limited labelled data. Feature generators, which synthesize new data points to augment limited datasets, have emerged as a promising solution to this challenge. This paper investigates the effectiveness of feature generators in enhancing the embedding process for FSL tasks. To address the issue of inaccurate embeddings due to the scarcity of images per class, we introduce a feature generator that creates visual features from class-level textual descriptions. By training the generator with a combination of classifier loss, discriminator loss, and distance loss between the generated features and true class embeddings, we ensure the generation of accurate same-class features and enhance the overall feature representation. Our results show a significant improvement in accuracy over baseline methods, with our approach outperforming the baseline model by 10% in 1-shot and around 5% in 5-shot approaches. Additionally, both visual-only and visual + textual generators have also been tested in this paper. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/heethanjan/Feature-Generator-for-FSL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Periorbital distances and features around the eyes and lids hold valuable information for disease quantification and monitoring of surgical and medical intervention. These distances are commonly measured manually, a process that is both subjective and highly time-consuming. Here, we set out to developed three deep-learning methods for segmentation and periorbital distance prediction, and also evaluate the utility of periorbital distances for disease classification. The MAE of our deep learning predicted distances was less than or very close to the error observed between trained human annotators. We compared our models to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method for periorbital distance prediction and found that our methods outperformed SOTA on all of our datasets on all but one periorbital measurement. We also show that robust segmentation can be achieved on diseased eyes using models trained on open-source, healthy eyes, and that periorbital distances have can be used as high-quality features in downstream classification models. Leveraging segmentation networks as intermediary steps in classification has broad implications for increasing the generalizability of classification models in ophthalmic plastic and craniofacial surgery by avoiding the out-of-distribution problem observed in traditional convolutional neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taha Koleilat, Hojat Asgariandehkordi, Hassan Rivaz, Yiming Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Segmentation of anatomical structures and pathological regions in medical images is essential for modern clinical diagnosis, disease research, and treatment planning. While significant advancements have been made in deep learning-based segmentation techniques, many of these methods still suffer from limitations in data efficiency, generalizability, and interactivity. As a result, developing precise segmentation methods that require fewer labeled datasets remains a critical challenge in medical image analysis. Recently, the introduction of foundation models like CLIP and Segment-Anything-Model (SAM), with robust cross-domain representations, has paved the way for interactive and universal image segmentation. However, further exploration of these models for data-efficient segmentation in medical imaging is still needed and highly relevant. In this paper, we introduce MedCLIP-SAMv2, a novel framework that integrates the CLIP and SAM models to perform segmentation on clinical scans using text prompts, in both zero-shot and weakly supervised settings. Our approach includes fine-tuning the BiomedCLIP model with a new Decoupled Hard Negative Noise Contrastive Estimation (DHN-NCE) loss, and leveraging the Multi-modal Information Bottleneck (M2IB) to create visual prompts for generating segmentation masks from SAM in the zero-shot setting. We also investigate using zero-shot segmentation labels within a weakly supervised paradigm to enhance segmentation quality further. Extensive testing across four diverse segmentation tasks and medical imaging modalities (breast tumor ultrasound, brain tumor MRI, lung X-ray, and lung CT) demonstrates the high accuracy of our proposed framework.

<p>Abstract: Periorbital segmentation and distance prediction using deep learning allows for the objective quantification of disease state, treatment monitoring, and remote medicine. However, there are currently no reports of segmentation datasets for the purposes of training deep learning models with sub mm accuracy on the regions around the eyes. All images (n=2842) had the iris, sclera, lid, caruncle, and brow segmented by five trained annotators. Here, we validate this dataset through intra and intergrader reliability tests and show the utility of the data in training periorbital segmentation networks. All the annotations are publicly available for free download. Having access to segmentation datasets designed specifically for oculoplastic surgery will permit more rapid development of clinically useful segmentation networks which can be leveraged for periorbital distance prediction and disease classification. In addition to the annotations, we also provide an open-source toolkit for periorbital distance prediction from segmentation masks. The weights of all models have also been open-sourced and are publicly available for use by the community.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper analyzes the impact of causal manner in the text encoder of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, which can lead to information bias and loss. Previous works have focused on addressing the issues through the denoising process. However, there is no research discussing how text embedding contributes to T2I models, especially when generating more than one object. In this paper, we share a comprehensive analysis of text embedding: i) how text embedding contributes to the generated images and ii) why information gets lost and biases towards the first-mentioned object. Accordingly, we propose a simple but effective text embedding balance optimization method, which is training-free, with an improvement of 90.05% on information balance in stable diffusion. Furthermore, we propose a new automatic evaluation metric that quantifies information loss more accurately than existing methods, achieving 81% concordance with human assessments. This metric effectively measures the presence and accuracy of objects, addressing the limitations of current distribution scores like CLIP's text-image similarities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pouyan Navard, Amin Karimi Monsefi, Mengxi Zhou, Wei-Lun Chao, Alper Yilmaz, Rajiv Ramnath</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved text-to-image (T2I) generation, but they often struggle to balance fine-grained precision with high-level control. Methods like ControlNet and T2I-Adapter excel at following sketches by seasoned artists but tend to be overly rigid, replicating unintentional flaws in sketches from novice users. Meanwhile, coarse-grained methods, such as sketch-based abstraction frameworks, offer more accessible input handling but lack the precise control needed for detailed, professional use. To address these limitations, we propose KnobGen, a dual-pathway framework that democratizes sketch-based image generation by seamlessly adapting to varying levels of sketch complexity and user skill. KnobGen uses a Coarse-Grained Controller (CGC) module for high-level semantics and a Fine-Grained Controller (FGC) module for detailed refinement. The relative strength of these two modules can be adjusted through our knob inference mechanism to align with the user's specific needs. These mechanisms ensure that KnobGen can flexibly generate images from both novice sketches and those drawn by seasoned artists. This maintains control over the final output while preserving the natural appearance of the image, as evidenced on the MultiGen-20M dataset and a newly collected sketch dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco M. Castro-Mac\'ias, Pablo Morales-\'Alvarez, Yunan Wu, Rafael Molina, Aggelos K. Katsaggelos</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is widely used in medical imaging classification to reduce the labeling effort. While only bag labels are available for training, one typically seeks predictions at both bag and instance levels (classification and localization tasks, respectively). Early MIL methods treated the instances in a bag independently. Recent methods account for global and local dependencies among instances. Although they have yielded excellent results in classification, their performance in terms of localization is comparatively limited. We argue that these models have been designed to target the classification task, while implications at the instance level have not been deeply investigated. Motivated by a simple observation -- that neighboring instances are likely to have the same label -- we propose a novel, principled, and flexible mechanism to model local dependencies. It can be used alone or combined with any mechanism to model global dependencies (e.g., transformers). A thorough empirical validation shows that our module leads to state-of-the-art performance in localization while being competitive or superior in classification.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tinghui Zhu, Qin Liu, Fei Wang, Zhengzhong Tu, Muhao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for capturing and reasoning over multimodal inputs. However, these models are prone to parametric knowledge conflicts, which arise from inconsistencies of represented knowledge between their vision and language components. In this paper, we formally define the problem of $\textbf{cross-modality parametric knowledge conflict}$ and present a systematic approach to detect, interpret, and mitigate them. We introduce a pipeline that identifies conflicts between visual and textual answers, showing a persistently high conflict rate across modalities in recent LVLMs regardless of the model size. We further investigate how these conflicts interfere with the inference process and propose a contrastive metric to discern the conflicting samples from the others. Building on these insights, we develop a novel dynamic contrastive decoding method that removes undesirable logits inferred from the less confident modality components based on answer confidence. For models that do not provide logits, we also introduce two prompt-based strategies to mitigate the conflicts. Our methods achieve promising improvements in accuracy on both the ViQuAE and InfoSeek datasets. Specifically, using LLaVA-34B, our proposed dynamic contrastive decoding improves an average accuracy of 2.24%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengting Chen, Lei Cheng, Lianghui Ding, Quanshi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a method to explain the internal representation structure of a neural network for image generation. Specifically, our method disentangles primitive feature components from the intermediate-layer feature of the neural network, which ensures that each feature component is exclusively used to generate a specific set of image regions. In this way, the generation of the entire image can be considered as the superposition of different pre-encoded primitive regional patterns, each being generated by a feature component. We find that the feature component can be represented as an OR relationship between the demands for generating different image regions, which is encoded by the neural network. Therefore, we extend the Harsanyi interaction to represent such an OR interaction to disentangle the feature component. Experiments show a clear correspondence between each feature component and the generation of specific image regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyan Jiang, Rui Meng, Xinyi Yang, Semih Yavuz, Yingbo Zhou, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in developing universal text embedding models that can generalize across tasks (e.g., MTEB). However, progress in learning universal multimodal embedding models has been relatively slow despite their importance. In this work, we aim to explore the potential for building universal embeddings capable of handling a wide range of downstream tasks. Our contributions are twofold: (1) MMEB (Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark), which covers 4 meta-tasks (i.e. classification, visual question answering, multimodal retrieval, and visual grounding) and 36 datasets, including 20 training and 16 evaluation datasets, and (2) VLM2Vec (Vision-Language Model -> Vector), a contrastive training framework that converts any state-of-the-art vision-language model into an embedding model via training on MMEB. Unlike previous models such as CLIP and BLIP, VLM2Vec can process any combination of images and text to generate a fixed-dimensional vector based on task instructions. We build a series of VLM2Vec models on Phi-3.5-V and evaluate them on MMEB's evaluation split. Our results show that VLM2Vec achieves an absolute average improvement of 10% to 20% over existing multimodal embedding models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets in MMEB.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Wu, Kecheng Zheng, Shuailei Ma, Fan Lu, Yuxin Guo, Yifei Zhang, Wei Chen, Qingpei Guo, Yujun Shen, Zheng-Jun Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding long text is of great demands in practice but beyond the reach of most language-image pre-training (LIP) models. In this work, we empirically confirm that the key reason causing such an issue is that the training images are usually paired with short captions, leaving certain tokens easily overshadowed by salient tokens. Towards this problem, our initial attempt is to relabel the data with long captions, however, directly learning with which may lead to performance degradation in understanding short text (e.g., in the image classification task). Then, after incorporating corner tokens to aggregate diverse textual information, we manage to help the model catch up to its original level of short text understanding yet greatly enhance its capability of long text understanding. We further look into whether the model can continuously benefit from longer captions and notice a clear trade-off between the performance and the efficiency. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach using a self-constructed large-scale dataset, which consists of 100M long caption oriented text-image pairs. It is noteworthy that, on the task of long-text image retrieval, we beat the competitor using long captions with 11.1% improvement (i.e., from 72.62% to 83.72%).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen Li, Qian Long, Jian Zheng, Xiaofeng Gao, Robinson Piramuthu, Wenhu Chen, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we focus on enhancing a diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) model during the post-training phase by distilling a highly capable consistency model from a pretrained T2V model. Our proposed method, T2V-Turbo-v2, introduces a significant advancement by integrating various supervision signals, including high-quality training data, reward model feedback, and conditional guidance, into the consistency distillation process. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we highlight the crucial importance of tailoring datasets to specific learning objectives and the effectiveness of learning from diverse reward models for enhancing both the visual quality and text-video alignment. Additionally, we highlight the vast design space of conditional guidance strategies, which centers on designing an effective energy function to augment the teacher ODE solver. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by extracting motion guidance from the training datasets and incorporating it into the ODE solver, showcasing its effectiveness in improving the motion quality of the generated videos with the improved motion-related metrics from VBench and T2V-CompBench. Empirically, our T2V-Turbo-v2 establishes a new state-of-the-art result on VBench, with a Total score of 85.13, surpassing proprietary systems such as Gen-3 and Kling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadreza Salehi, Jae Sung Park, Tanush Yadav, Aditya Kusupati, Ranjay Krishna, Yejin Choi, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Ali Farhadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Our world is full of varied actions and moves across specialized domains that we, as humans, strive to identify and understand. Within any single domain, actions can often appear quite similar, making it challenging for deep models to distinguish them accurately. To evaluate the effectiveness of multimodal foundation models in helping us recognize such actions, we present ActionAtlas v1.0, a multiple-choice video question answering benchmark featuring short videos across various sports. Each video in the dataset is paired with a question and four or five choices. The question pinpoints specific individuals, asking which choice "best" describes their action within a certain temporal context. Overall, the dataset includes 934 videos showcasing 580 unique actions across 56 sports, with a total of 1896 actions within choices. Unlike most existing video question answering benchmarks that only cover simplistic actions, often identifiable from a single frame, ActionAtlas focuses on intricate movements and rigorously tests the model's capability to discern subtle differences between moves that look similar within each domain. We evaluate open and proprietary foundation models on this benchmark, finding that the best model, GPT-4o, achieves a maximum accuracy of 45.52%. Meanwhile, Non-expert crowd workers, provided with action description for each choice, achieve 61.64% accuracy, where random chance is approximately 21%. Our findings with state-of-the-art models indicate that having a high frame sampling rate is important for accurately recognizing actions in ActionAtlas, a feature that some leading proprietary video models, such as Gemini, do not include in their default configuration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyi Guo, Yuyang Liu, Zongying Lin, Peixi Peng, Yonghong Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Incremental object detection (IOD) is challenged by background shift, where background categories in sequential data may include previously learned or future classes. Inspired by the vision-language foundation models such as CLIP, these models capture shared attributes from extensive image-text paired data during pre-training. We propose a novel method utilizing attributes in vision-language foundation models for incremental object detection. Our method constructs a Class-Agnostic Shared Attribute base (CASA) to capture common semantic information among incremental classes. Specifically, we utilize large language models to generate candidate textual attributes and select the most relevant ones based on current training data, recording their significance in an attribute assignment matrix. For subsequent tasks, we freeze the retained attributes and continue selecting from the remaining candidates while updating the attribute assignment matrix accordingly. Furthermore, we employ OWL-ViT as our baseline, preserving the original parameters of the pre-trained foundation model. Our method adds only 0.7% to parameter storage through parameter-efficient fine-tuning to significantly enhance the scalability and adaptability of IOD. Extensive two-phase and multi-phase experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Information comes in diverse modalities. Multimodal native AI models are essential to integrate real-world information and deliver comprehensive understanding. While proprietary multimodal native models exist, their lack of openness imposes obstacles for adoptions, let alone adaptations. To fill this gap, we introduce Aria, an open multimodal native model with best-in-class performance across a wide range of multimodal, language, and coding tasks. Aria is a mixture-of-expert model with 3.9B and 3.5B activated parameters per visual token and text token, respectively. It outperforms Pixtral-12B and Llama3.2-11B, and is competitive against the best proprietary models on various multimodal tasks. We pre-train Aria from scratch following a 4-stage pipeline, which progressively equips the model with strong capabilities in language understanding, multimodal understanding, long context window, and instruction following. We open-source the model weights along with a codebase that facilitates easy adoptions and adaptations of Aria in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haadia Amjad, Kilian Goeller, Steffen Seitz, Carsten Knoll, Naseer Bajwa, Ronald Tetzlaff, Muhammad Imran Malik</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning is actively being used in biometrics to develop efficient identification and verification systems. Handwritten signatures are a common subset of biometric data for authentication purposes. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) learn from original and forged signatures to generate forged signatures. While most GAN techniques create a strong signature verifier, which is the discriminator, there is a need to focus more on the quality of forgeries generated by the generator model. This work focuses on creating a generator that produces forged samples that achieve a benchmark in spoofing signature verification systems. We use CycleGANs infused with Inception model-like blocks with attention heads as the generator and a variation of the SigCNN model as the base Discriminator. We train our model with a new technique that results in 80% to 100% success in signature spoofing. Additionally, we create a custom evaluation technique to act as a goodness measure of the generated forgeries. Our work advocates generator-focused GAN architectures for spoofing data quality that aid in a better understanding of biometric data generation and evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changli Tang, Yixuan Li, Yudong Yang, Jimin Zhuang, Guangzhi Sun, Wei Li, Zujun Ma, Chao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimization (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimized using DPO. To further improve training, we introduce a novel multi-round DPO (mrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initializing the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilize the process. To address potential catastrophic forgetting of non-captioning abilities due to mrDPO, we propose rebirth tuning, which finetunes the pre-DPO LLM by using the captions generated by the mrDPO-trained model as supervised labels. Experiments show that mrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing global and local error rates by 40\% and 20\%, respectively, while decreasing the repetition rate by 35\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmark among models of similar size.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anqi Zhang, Guangyu Gao, Jianbo Jiao, Chi Harold Liu, Yunchao Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent advancements in large-scale pre-training techniques have significantly enhanced the capabilities of vision foundation models, notably the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which can generate precise masks based on point and box prompts. Recent studies extend SAM to Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS), focusing on prompt generation for SAM-based automatic semantic segmentation. However, these methods struggle with selecting suitable prompts, require specific hyperparameter settings for different scenarios, and experience prolonged one-shot inference times due to the overuse of SAM, resulting in low efficiency and limited automation ability. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective approach based on graph analysis. In particular, a Positive-Negative Alignment module dynamically selects the point prompts for generating masks, especially uncovering the potential of the background context as the negative reference. Another subsequent Point-Mask Clustering module aligns the granularity of masks and selected points as a directed graph, based on mask coverage over points. These points are then aggregated by decomposing the weakly connected components of the directed graph in an efficient manner, constructing distinct natural clusters. Finally, the positive and overshooting gating, benefiting from graph-based granularity alignment, aggregate high-confident masks and filter out the false-positive masks for final prediction, reducing the usage of additional hyperparameters and redundant mask generation. Extensive experimental analysis across standard FSS, One-shot Part Segmentation, and Cross Domain FSS datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach, surpassing state-of-the-art generalist models with a mIoU of 58.7% on COCO-20i and 35.2% on LVIS-92i.

<p>Abstract: We introduce Pixtral-12B, a 12--billion-parameter multimodal language model. Pixtral-12B is trained to understand both natural images and documents, achieving leading performance on various multimodal benchmarks, surpassing a number of larger models. Unlike many open-source models, Pixtral is also a cutting-edge text model for its size, and does not compromise on natural language performance to excel in multimodal tasks. Pixtral uses a new vision encoder trained from scratch, which allows it to ingest images at their natural resolution and aspect ratio. This gives users flexibility on the number of tokens used to process an image. Pixtral is also able to process any number of images in its long context window of 128K tokens. Pixtral 12B substanially outperforms other open models of similar sizes (Llama-3.2 11B \& Qwen-2-VL 7B). It also outperforms much larger open models like Llama-3.2 90B while being 7x smaller. We further contribute an open-source benchmark, MM-MT-Bench, for evaluating vision-language models in practical scenarios, and provide detailed analysis and code for standardized evaluation protocols for multimodal LLMs. Pixtral-12B is released under Apache 2.0 license.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fu-Yun Wang, Ling Yang, Zhaoyang Huang, Mengdi Wang, Hongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have greatly improved visual generation but are hindered by slow generation speed due to the computationally intensive nature of solving generative ODEs. Rectified flow, a widely recognized solution, improves generation speed by straightening the ODE path. Its key components include: 1) using the diffusion form of flow-matching, 2) employing $\boldsymbol v$-prediction, and 3) performing rectification (a.k.a. reflow). In this paper, we argue that the success of rectification primarily lies in using a pretrained diffusion model to obtain matched pairs of noise and samples, followed by retraining with these matched noise-sample pairs. Based on this, components 1) and 2) are unnecessary. Furthermore, we highlight that straightness is not an essential training target for rectification; rather, it is a specific case of flow-matching models. The more critical training target is to achieve a first-order approximate ODE path, which is inherently curved for models like DDPM and Sub-VP. Building on this insight, we propose Rectified Diffusion, which generalizes the design space and application scope of rectification to encompass the broader category of diffusion models, rather than being restricted to flow-matching models. We validate our method on Stable Diffusion v1-5 and Stable Diffusion XL. Our method not only greatly simplifies the training procedure of rectified flow-based previous works (e.g., InstaFlow) but also achieves superior performance with even lower training cost.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Korycki, Cory Yeaton, Gregory S. Gilbert, Colleen Josephson, Steve McGuire</p>
<p>Abstract: Forest mapping provides critical observational data needed to understand the dynamics of forest environments. Notably, tree diameter at breast height (DBH) is a metric used to estimate forest biomass and carbon dioxide sequestration. Manual methods of forest mapping are labor intensive and time consuming, a bottleneck for large-scale mapping efforts. Automated mapping relies on acquiring dense forest reconstructions, typically in the form of point clouds. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and mobile laser scanning (MLS) generate point clouds using expensive LiDAR sensing, and have been used successfully to estimate tree diameter. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are an emergent technology enabling photorealistic, vision-based reconstruction by training a neural network on a sparse set of input views. In this paper, we present a comparison of MLS and NeRF forest reconstructions for the purpose of trunk diameter estimation in a mixed-evergreen Redwood forest. In addition, we propose an improved DBH-estimation method using convex-hull modeling. Using this approach, we achieved 1.68 cm RMSE, which consistently outperformed standard cylinder modeling approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alina Ciocarlan, Sidonie Lefebvre, Sylvie Le H\'egarat-Mascle, Arnaud Woiselle</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising approach in computer vision, enabling networks to learn meaningful representations from large unlabeled datasets. SSL methods fall into two main categories: instance discrimination and Masked Image Modeling (MIM). While instance discrimination is fundamental to SSL, it was originally designed for classification and may be less effective for object detection, particularly for small objects. In this survey, we focus on SSL methods specifically tailored for real-world object detection, with an emphasis on detecting small objects in complex environments. Unlike previous surveys, we offer a detailed comparison of SSL strategies, including object-level instance discrimination and MIM methods, and assess their effectiveness for small object detection using both CNN and ViT-based architectures. Specifically, our benchmark is performed on the widely-used COCO dataset, as well as on a specialized real-world dataset focused on vehicle detection in infrared remote sensing imagery. We also assess the impact of pre-training on custom domain-specific datasets, highlighting how certain SSL strategies are better suited for handling uncurated data.
  Our findings highlight that instance discrimination methods perform well with CNN-based encoders, while MIM methods are better suited for ViT-based architectures and custom dataset pre-training. This survey provides a practical guide for selecting optimal SSL strategies, taking into account factors such as backbone architecture, object size, and custom pre-training requirements. Ultimately, we show that choosing an appropriate SSL pre-training strategy, along with a suitable encoder, significantly enhances performance in real-world object detection, particularly for small object detection in frugal settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leyi Zhu, Weihuang Liu, Xinyi Chen, Zimeng Li, Xuhang Chen, Zhen Wang, Chi-Man Pun</p>
<p>Abstract: Shadow detection is crucial for accurate scene understanding in computer vision, yet it is challenged by the diverse appearances of shadows caused by variations in illumination, object geometry, and scene context. Deep learning models often struggle to generalize to real-world images due to the limited size and diversity of training datasets. To address this, we introduce TICA, a novel framework that leverages light-intensity information during test-time adaptation to enhance shadow detection accuracy. TICA exploits the inherent inconsistencies in light intensity across shadow regions to guide the model toward a more consistent prediction. A basic encoder-decoder model is initially trained on a labeled dataset for shadow detection. Then, during the testing phase, the network is adjusted for each test sample by enforcing consistent intensity predictions between two augmented input image versions. This consistency training specifically targets both foreground and background intersection regions to identify shadow regions within images accurately for robust adaptation. Extensive evaluations on the ISTD and SBU shadow detection datasets reveal that TICA significantly demonstrates that TICA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior results in balanced error rate (BER).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronghui Zhang, Runzong Zou, Yue Zhao, Zirui Zhang, Junzhou Chen, Yue Cao, Chuan Hu, Houbing Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention mechanisms, particularly channel attention, have become highly influential in numerous computer vision tasks. Despite their effectiveness, many existing methods primarily focus on optimizing performance through complex attention modules applied at individual convolutional layers, often overlooking the synergistic interactions that can occur across multiple layers. In response to this gap, we introduce bridge attention, a novel approach designed to facilitate more effective integration and information flow between different convolutional layers. Our work extends the original bridge attention model (BAv1) by introducing an adaptive selection operator, which reduces information redundancy and optimizes the overall information exchange. This enhancement results in the development of BAv2, which achieves substantial performance improvements in the ImageNet classification task, obtaining Top-1 accuracies of 80.49% and 81.75% when using ResNet50 and ResNet101 as backbone networks, respectively. These results surpass the retrained baselines by 1.61% and 0.77%, respectively. Furthermore, BAv2 outperforms other existing channel attention techniques, such as the classical SENet101, exceeding its retrained performance by 0.52% Additionally, integrating BAv2 into advanced convolutional networks and vision transformers has led to significant gains in performance across a wide range of computer vision tasks, underscoring its broad applicability.</p>

<p>Abstract: With 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) advancing real-time and high-fidelity rendering for novel view synthesis, storage requirements pose challenges for their widespread adoption. Although various compression techniques have been proposed, previous art suffers from a common limitation: for any existing 3DGS, per-scene optimization is needed to achieve compression, making the compression sluggish and slow. To address this issue, we introduce Fast Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting (FCGS), an optimization-free model that can compress 3DGS representations rapidly in a single feed-forward pass, which significantly reduces compression time from minutes to seconds. To enhance compression efficiency, we propose a multi-path entropy module that assigns Gaussian attributes to different entropy constraint paths for balance between size and fidelity. We also carefully design both inter- and intra-Gaussian context models to remove redundancies among the unstructured Gaussian blobs. Overall, FCGS achieves a compression ratio of over 20X while maintaining fidelity, surpassing most per-scene SOTA optimization-based methods.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SPA, a novel representation learning framework that emphasizes the importance of 3D spatial awareness in embodied AI. Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

<p>Abstract: The usage of linear transformations has great relevance for data decorrelation applications, like image and video compression. In that sense, the discrete Tchebichef transform (DTT) possesses useful coding and decorrelation properties. The DTT transform kernel does not depend on the input data and fast algorithms can be developed to real time applications. However, the DTT fast algorithm presented in literature possess high computational complexity. In this work, we introduce a new low-complexity approximation for the DTT. The fast algorithm of the proposed transform is multiplication-free and requires a reduced number of additions and bit-shifting operations. Image and video compression simulations in popular standards shows good performance of the proposed transform. Regarding hardware resource consumption for FPGA shows 43.1% reduction of configurable logic blocks and ASIC place and route realization shows 57.7% reduction in the area-time figure when compared with the 2-D version of the exact DTT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jongseong Jang, Daeun Kyung, Seung Hwan Kim, Honglak Lee, Kyunghoon Bae, Edward Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly used in medical imaging for tasks such as pathological classification, but they face challenges due to the scarcity of high-quality, expert-labeled training data. Recent efforts have utilized pre-trained contrastive image-text models like CLIP, adapting them for medical use by fine-tuning the model with chest X-ray images and corresponding reports for zero-shot pathology classification, thus eliminating the need for pathology-specific annotations. However, most studies continue to use the same contrastive learning objectives as in the general domain, overlooking the multi-labeled nature of medical image-report pairs. In this paper, we propose a new fine-tuning strategy that includes positive-pair loss relaxation and random sentence sampling. We aim to improve the performance of zero-shot pathology classification without relying on external knowledge. Our method can be applied to any pre-trained contrastive image-text encoder and easily transferred to out-of-domain datasets without further training, as it does not use external data. Our approach consistently improves overall zero-shot pathology classification across four chest X-ray datasets and three pre-trained models, with an average macro AUROC increase of 4.3%. Additionally, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art and marginally surpasses board-certified radiologists in zero-shot classification for the five competition pathologies in the CheXpert dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juyoung Yun, Sol Choi, Francois Rameau, Byungkon Kang, Zhoulai Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing complexity of machine learning models, managing computational resources like memory and processing power has become a critical concern. Mixed precision techniques, which leverage different numerical precisions during model training and inference to optimize resource usage, have been widely adopted. However, access to hardware that supports lower precision formats (e.g., FP8 or FP4) remains limited, especially for practitioners with hardware constraints. For many with limited resources, the available options are restricted to using 32-bit, 16-bit, or a combination of the two. While it is commonly believed that 16-bit precision can achieve results comparable to full (32-bit) precision, this study is the first to systematically validate this assumption through both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluation. Our theoretical formalization of floating-point errors and classification tolerance provides new insights into the conditions under which 16-bit precision can approximate 32-bit results. This study fills a critical gap, proving for the first time that standalone 16-bit precision neural networks match 32-bit and mixed-precision in accuracy while boosting computational speed. Given the widespread availability of 16-bit across GPUs, these findings are especially valuable for machine learning practitioners with limited hardware resources to make informed decisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujin Tang, Jiaming Zhou, Xiang Pan, Zeying Gong, Junwei Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is a vital challenge of societal importance. Though data-driven approaches have emerged as a widely used solution, solely relying on data-driven approaches has limitations in modeling the underlying physics, making accurate predictions difficult. We focus on the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) post-processing based precipitation forecasting task to couple Machine Learning techniques with traditional NWP. This task remains challenging due to the imbalanced precipitation data and complex relationships between multiple meteorological variables. To address these limitations, we introduce the \textbf{PostRainBench}, a comprehensive multi-variable NWP post-processing benchmark, and \textbf{CAMT}, a simple yet effective Channel Attention Enhanced Multi-task Learning framework with a specially designed weighted loss function. Extensive experimental results on the proposed benchmark show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 6.3\%, 4.7\%, and 26.8\% in rain CSI and improvements of 15.6\%, 17.4\%, and 31.8\% over NWP predictions in heavy rain CSI on respective datasets. Most notably, our model is the first deep learning-based method to outperform NWP approaches in heavy rain conditions. These results highlight the potential impact of our model in reducing the severe consequences of extreme rainfall events.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Dehghani, Mobin Mohammadi, Diyana Tehrany Dehkordy</p>
<p>Abstract: It is crucial for emergency physicians to identify patients at higher risk of mortality to effectively prioritize hospital resources, particularly in regions with limited medical services. This became even more critical during global pandemics, which have disrupted lives in unprecedented ways and caused widespread morbidity and mortality. The collected data from patients is beneficial to predict the outcome, although there is a question about which data makes the most accurate predictions. Therefore, this study aimed to achieve two main objectives during the pandemic, using data and experiments from the most recent global health crisis, COVID-19. First, we want to examine whether deep learning algorithms can predict a patient's morality. Second, we investigated the impact of Clinical and RT-PCR on prediction to determine which one is more reliable. We defined four stages with different feature sets and used 9 machine learning and deep learning methods to build appropriate model. Based on results, the deep neural decision forest, as an interpretable deep learning methods, performed the best across all stages and proved its capability to predict the recovery and death of patients. Additionally, results indicate that Clinical alone (without the use of RT-PCR) is the most effective method of diagnosis, with an accuracy of 80%. This study can provide guidance for medical professionals in the event of a crisis or outbreak similar to COVID-19. Moreover, the proposed deep learning method demonstrates exceptional suitability for mortality prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoxuan Xia, Olivier Laurent, Gianni Franchi, Christos-Savvas Bouganis</p>
<p>Abstract: Label smoothing (LS) is a popular regularisation method for training neural networks as it is effective in improving test accuracy and is simple to implement. Hard one-hot labels are smoothed by uniformly distributing probability mass to other classes, reducing overfitting. Prior work has suggested that in some cases LS can degrade selective classification (SC) -- where the aim is to reject misclassifications using a model's uncertainty. In this work, we first demonstrate empirically across an extended range of large-scale tasks and architectures that LS consistently degrades SC. We then address a gap in existing knowledge, providing an explanation for this behaviour by analysing logit-level gradients: LS degrades the uncertainty rank ordering of correct vs incorrect predictions by regularising the max logit more when a prediction is likely to be correct, and less when it is likely to be wrong. This elucidates previously reported experimental results where strong classifiers underperform in SC. We then demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of post-hoc logit normalisation for recovering lost SC performance caused by LS. Furthermore, linking back to our gradient analysis, we again provide an explanation for why such normalisation is effective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cameron Gordon, Lachlan Ewen MacDonald, Hemanth Saratchandran, Simon Lucey</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep implicit functions have been found to be an effective tool for efficiently encoding all manner of natural signals. Their attractiveness stems from their ability to compactly represent signals with little to no offline training data. Instead, they leverage the implicit bias of deep networks to decouple hidden redundancies within the signal. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that additional compression can be achieved by leveraging redundancies that exist between layers. We propose to use a novel runtime decoder-only hypernetwork - that uses no offline training data - to better exploit cross-layer parameter redundancy. Previous applications of hypernetworks with deep implicit functions have employed feed-forward encoder/decoder frameworks that rely on large offline datasets that do not generalize beyond the signals they were trained on. We instead present a strategy for the optimization of runtime deep implicit functions for single-instance signals through a Decoder-Only randomly projected Hypernetwork (D'OH). By directly changing the latent code dimension, we provide a natural way to vary the memory footprint of neural representations without the costly need for neural architecture search on a space of alternative low-rate structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianhao Peng, Chen Feng, Duolikun Danier, Fan Zhang, Benoit Vallade, Alex Mackin, David Bull</p>
<p>Abstract: With recent advances in deep learning, numerous algorithms have been developed to enhance video quality, reduce visual artifacts, and improve perceptual quality. However, little research has been reported on the quality assessment of enhanced content - the evaluation of enhancement methods is often based on quality metrics that were designed for compression applications. In this paper, we propose a novel blind deep video quality assessment (VQA) method specifically for enhanced video content. It employs a new Recurrent Memory Transformer (RMT) based network architecture to obtain video quality representations, which is optimized through a novel content-quality-aware contrastive learning strategy based on a new database containing 13K training patches with enhanced content. The extracted quality representations are then combined through linear regression to generate video-level quality indices. The proposed method, RMT-BVQA, has been evaluated on the VDPVE (VQA Dataset for Perceptual Video Enhancement) database through a five-fold cross validation. The results show its superior correlation performance when compared to ten existing no-reference quality metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Massimo Bini, Karsten Roth, Zeynep Akata, Anna Khoreva</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) has become ubiquitous to adapt foundation models to downstream task requirements while retaining their generalization ability. However, the amount of additionally introduced parameters and compute for successful adaptation and hyperparameter searches can explode quickly, especially when deployed at scale to serve numerous individual requests. To ensure effective, parameter-efficient, and hyperparameter-robust adaptation, we propose the ETHER transformation family, which performs Efficient fineTuning via HypErplane Reflections. By design, ETHER transformations require a minimal number of parameters, are less likely to deteriorate model performance, and exhibit robustness to hyperparameter and learning rate choices. In particular, we introduce ETHER and its relaxation ETHER+, which match or outperform existing PEFT methods with significantly fewer parameters ($\sim$$10$-$100$ times lower than LoRA or OFT) across multiple image synthesis and natural language tasks without exhaustive hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we investigate the recent emphasis on Hyperspherical Energy retention for adaptation and raise questions on its practical utility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher D. Hsu, Pratik Chaudhari</p>
<p>Abstract: We study pursuit-evasion games in highly occluded urban environments, e.g. tall buildings in a city, where a scout (quadrotor) tracks multiple dynamic targets on the ground. We show that we can build a neural radiance field (NeRF) representation of the city -- online -- using RGB and depth images from different vantage points. This representation is used to calculate the information gain to both explore unknown parts of the city and track the targets -- thereby giving a completely first-principles approach to actively tracking dynamic targets. We demonstrate, using a custom-built simulator using Open Street Maps data of Philadelphia and New York City, that we can explore and locate 20 stationary targets within 300 steps. This is slower than a greedy baseline, which does not use active perception. But for dynamic targets that actively hide behind occlusions, we show that our approach maintains, at worst, a tracking error of 200m; the greedy baseline can have a tracking error as large as 600m. We observe a number of interesting properties in the scout's policies, e.g., it switches its attention to track a different target periodically, as the quality of the NeRF representation improves over time, the scout also becomes better in terms of target tracking.</p>

<p>Abstract: The incidence and mortality rates of malignant tumors, such as acute leukemia, have risen significantly. Clinically, hospitals rely on cytological examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow smears to diagnose malignant tumors, with accurate blood cell counting being crucial. Existing automated methods face challenges such as low feature expression capability, poor interpretability, and redundant feature extraction when processing high-dimensional microimage data. We propose a novel fine-grained classification model, SCKansformer, for bone marrow blood cells, which addresses these challenges and enhances classification accuracy and efficiency. The model integrates the Kansformer Encoder, SCConv Encoder, and Global-Local Attention Encoder. The Kansformer Encoder replaces the traditional MLP layer with the KAN, improving nonlinear feature representation and interpretability. The SCConv Encoder, with its Spatial and Channel Reconstruction Units, enhances feature representation and reduces redundancy. The Global-Local Attention Encoder combines Multi-head Self-Attention with a Local Part module to capture both global and local features. We validated our model using the Bone Marrow Blood Cell Fine-Grained Classification Dataset (BMCD-FGCD), comprising over 10,000 samples and nearly 40 classifications, developed with a partner hospital. Comparative experiments on our private dataset, as well as the publicly available PBC and ALL-IDB datasets, demonstrate that SCKansformer outperforms both typical and advanced microcell classification methods across all datasets.

<p>Abstract: The ability to understand and reason about spatial relationships between objects in images is an important component of visual reasoning. This skill rests on the ability to recognize and localize objects of interest and determine their spatial relation. Early vision and language models (VLMs) have been shown to struggle to recognize spatial relations. We extend the previously released What'sUp dataset and propose a novel comprehensive evaluation for spatial relationship understanding that highlights the strengths and weaknesses of 27 different models. In addition to the VLMs evaluated in What'sUp, our extensive evaluation encompasses 3 classes of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that vary in their parameter sizes (ranging from 7B to 110B), training/instruction-tuning methods, and visual resolution to benchmark their performances and scrutinize the scaling laws in this task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyang Geng, Ashwini Pokle, William Luo, Justin Lin, J. Zico Kolter</p>
<p>Abstract: Consistency models (CMs) offer faster sampling than traditional diffusion models, but their training is resource-intensive. For example, as of 2024, training a state-of-the-art CM on CIFAR-10 takes one week on 8 GPUs. In this work, we propose an effective scheme for training CMs that largely improves the efficiency of building such models. Specifically, by expressing CM trajectories via a particular differential equation, we argue that diffusion models can be viewed as a special case of CMs. We can thus fine-tune a consistency model starting from a pretrained diffusion model and progressively approximate the full consistency condition to stronger degrees over the training process. Our resulting method, which we term Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT), achieves vastly reduced training times while improving upon the quality of previous methods: for example, ECT achieves a 2-step FID of 2.73 on CIFAR10 within 1 hour on a single A100 GPU, matching Consistency Distillation trained for hundreds of GPU hours. Owing to this computational efficiency, we investigate the scaling laws of CMs under ECT, showing that they obey the classic power law scaling, hinting at their ability to improve efficiency and performance at larger scales. Our code (https://github.com/locuslab/ect) is publicly available, making CMs more accessible to the broader community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Royina Karegoudra Jayanth, Yinshuang Xu, Ziyun Wang, Evangelos Chatzipantazis, Daniel Gehrig, Kostas Daniilidis</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks are seeing rapid adoption in purely inertial odometry, where accelerometer and gyroscope measurements from commodity inertial measurement units (IMU) are used to regress displacements and associated uncertainties. They can learn informative displacement priors, which can be directly fused with the raw data with off-the-shelf non-linear filters. Nevertheless, these networks do not consider the physical roto-reflective symmetries inherent in IMU data, leading to the need to memorize the same priors for every possible motion direction, which hinders generalization. In this work, we characterize these symmetries and show that the IMU data and the resulting displacement and covariance transform equivariantly, when rotated around the gravity vector and reflected with respect to arbitrary planes parallel to gravity. We design a neural network that respects these symmetries by design through equivariant processing in three steps: First, it estimates an equivariant gravity-aligned frame from equivariant vectors and invariant scalars derived from IMU data, leveraging expressive linear and non-linear layers tailored to commute with the underlying symmetry transformation. We then map the IMU data into this frame, thereby achieving an invariant canonicalization that can be directly used with off-the-shelf inertial odometry networks. Finally, we map these network outputs back into the original frame, thereby obtaining equivariant covariances and displacements. We demonstrate the generality of our framework by applying it to the filter-based approach based on TLIO, and the end-to-end RONIN architecture, and show better performance on the TLIO, Aria, RIDI and OxIOD datasets than existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyao Liang, Ziming Liu, Mitchell Ostrow, Ila Fiete</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are capable of generating photo-realistic images that combine elements which likely do not appear together in the training set, demonstrating the ability to \textit{compositionally generalize}. Nonetheless, the precise mechanism of compositionality and how it is acquired through training remains elusive. Inspired by cognitive neuroscientific approaches, we consider a highly reduced setting to examine whether and when diffusion models learn semantically meaningful and factorized representations of composable features. We performed extensive controlled experiments on conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) trained to generate various forms of 2D Gaussian bump images. We found that the models learn factorized but not fully continuous manifold representations for encoding continuous features of variation underlying the data. With such representations, models demonstrate superior feature compositionality but limited ability to interpolate over unseen values of a given feature. Our experimental results further demonstrate that diffusion models can attain compositionality with few compositional examples, suggesting a more efficient way to train DDPMs. Finally, we connect manifold formation in diffusion models to percolation theory in physics, offering insight into the sudden onset of factorized representation learning. Our thorough toy experiments thus contribute a deeper understanding of how diffusion models capture compositional structure in data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rabia Asghar, Arslan Shaukat, Usman Akram, Rimsha Tariq</p>
<p>Abstract: Human immune system contains white blood cells (WBC) that are good indicator of many diseases like bacterial infections, AIDS, cancer, spleen, etc. White blood cells have been sub classified into four types: monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils on the basis of their nucleus, shape and cytoplasm. Traditionally in laboratories, pathologists and hematologists analyze these blood cells through microscope and then classify them manually. This manual process takes more time and increases the chance of human error. Hence, there is a need to automate this process. In this paper, first we have used different CNN pre-train models such as ResNet-50, InceptionV3, VGG16 and MobileNetV2 to automatically classify the white blood cells. These pre-train models are applied on Kaggle dataset of microscopic images. Although we achieved reasonable accuracy ranging between 92 to 95%, still there is need to enhance the performance. Hence, inspired by these architectures, a framework has been proposed to automatically categorize the four kinds of white blood cells with increased accuracy. The aim is to develop a convolution neural network (CNN) based classification system with decent generalization ability. The proposed CNN model has been tested on white blood cells images from Kaggle and LISC datasets. Accuracy achieved is 99.57% and 98.67% for both datasets respectively. Our proposed convolutional neural network-based model provides competitive performance as compared to previous results reported in literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng Xu, Bowen Hai, Yushun Tang, Zhihai He</p>
<p>Abstract: Learned Image Compression (LIC) models have achieved superior rate-distortion performance than traditional codecs. Existing LIC models use CNN, Transformer, or Mixed CNN-Transformer as basic blocks. However, limited by the shifted window attention, Swin-Transformer-based LIC exhibits a restricted growth of receptive fields, affecting the ability to model large objects for image compression. To address this issue and improve the performance, we incorporate window partition into channel attention for the first time to obtain large receptive fields and capture more global information. Since channel attention hinders local information learning, it is important to extend existing attention mechanisms in Transformer codecs to the space-channel attention to establish multiple receptive fields, being able to capture global correlations with large receptive fields while maintaining detailed characterization of local correlations with small receptive fields. We also incorporate the discrete wavelet transform into our Spatial-Channel Hybrid (SCH) framework for efficient frequency-dependent down-sampling and further enlarging receptive fields. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performances, reducing BD-rate by 18.54%, 23.98%, 22.33%, and 24.71% on four standard datasets compared to VTM-23.1.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sabine Muzellec, Drew Linsley, Alekh K. Ashok, Ennio Mingolla, Girik Malik, Rufin VanRullen, Thomas Serre</p>
<p>Abstract: Objects we encounter often change appearance as we interact with them. Changes in illumination (shadows), object pose, or movement of nonrigid objects can drastically alter available image features. How do biological visual systems track objects as they change? It may involve specific attentional mechanisms for reasoning about the locations of objects independently of their appearances -- a capability that prominent neuroscientific theories have associated with computing through neural synchrony. We computationally test the hypothesis that the implementation of visual attention through neural synchrony underlies the ability of biological visual systems to track objects that change in appearance over time. We first introduce a novel deep learning circuit that can learn to precisely control attention to features separately from their location in the world through neural synchrony: the complex-valued recurrent neural network (CV-RNN). Next, we compare object tracking in humans, the CV-RNN, and other deep neural networks (DNNs), using FeatureTracker: a large-scale challenge that asks observers to track objects as their locations and appearances change in precisely controlled ways. While humans effortlessly solved FeatureTracker, state-of-the-art DNNs did not. In contrast, our CV-RNN behaved similarly to humans on the challenge, providing a computational proof-of-concept for the role of phase synchronization as a neural substrate for tracking appearance-morphing objects as they move about.</p>

Recent studies indicate that training CNNs with regularizers that promote brain-like representations, using neural recordings, can improve model robustness. However, the requirement to use neural data severely restricts the utility of these methods. Is it possible to develop regularizers that mimic the computational function of neural regularizers without the need for neural recordings, thereby expanding the usability and effectiveness of these techniques? In this work, we inspect a neural regularizer introduced in Li et al. (2019) to extract its underlying strength. The regularizer uses neural representational similarities, which we find also correlate with pixel similarities. Motivated by this finding, we introduce a new regularizer that retains the essence of the original but is computed using image pixel similarities, eliminating the need for neural recordings. We show that our regularization method 1) significantly increases model robustness to a range of black box attacks on various datasets and 2) is computationally inexpensive and relies only on original datasets. Our work explores how biologically motivated loss functions can be used to drive the performance of artificial neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksey Valouev</p>
<p>Abstract: Point spread function (PSF) engineering is vital for precisely controlling the focus of light in computational imaging, with applications in neural imaging, fluorescence microscopy, and biophotonics. The PSF is derived from the magnitude of the Fourier transform of a phase function, making the construction of the phase function given the PSF (PSF engineering) an ill-posed inverse problem. Traditional PSF engineering methods rely on physical basis functions, limiting their ability to generalize across the range of PSFs required for imaging tasks. We introduce a novel approach leveraging implicit neural representations that significantly outperforms existing pixel-wise optimization methods in phase function quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deok-Kyeong Jang, Dongseok Yang, Deok-Yun Jang, Byeoli Choi, Donghoon Shin, Sung-hee Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces ELMO, a real-time upsampling motion capture framework designed for a single LiDAR sensor. Modeled as a conditional autoregressive transformer-based upsampling motion generator, ELMO achieves 60 fps motion capture from a 20 fps LiDAR point cloud sequence. The key feature of ELMO is the coupling of the self-attention mechanism with thoughtfully designed embedding modules for motion and point clouds, significantly elevating the motion quality. To facilitate accurate motion capture, we develop a one-time skeleton calibration model capable of predicting user skeleton offsets from a single-frame point cloud. Additionally, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique utilizing a LiDAR simulator, which enhances global root tracking to improve environmental understanding. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we compare ELMO with state-of-the-art methods in both image-based and point cloud-based motion capture. We further conduct an ablation study to validate our design principles. ELMO's fast inference time makes it well-suited for real-time applications, exemplified in our demo video featuring live streaming and interactive gaming scenarios. Furthermore, we contribute a high-quality LiDAR-mocap synchronized dataset comprising 20 different subjects performing a range of motions, which can serve as a valuable resource for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> L\'eo Machado, H\'el\`ene Philippe, \'Elodie Ferreres, Julien Khlaut, Julie Dupuis, Korentin Le Floch, Denis Habip Gatenyo, Pascal Roux, Jules Gr\'egory, Maxime Ronot, Corentin Dancette, Daniel Tordjman, Pierre Manceron, Paul H\'erent</p>
<p>Abstract: Carcinogenesis is a proteiform phenomenon, with tumors emerging in various locations and displaying complex, diverse shapes. At the crucial intersection of research and clinical practice, it demands precise and flexible assessment. However, current biomarkers, such as RECIST 1.1's long and short axis measurements, fall short of capturing this complexity, offering an approximate estimate of tumor burden and a simplistic representation of a more intricate process. Additionally, existing supervised AI models face challenges in addressing the variability in tumor presentations, limiting their clinical utility. These limitations arise from the scarcity of annotations and the models' focus on narrowly defined tasks.
  To address these challenges, we developed ONCOPILOT, an interactive radiological foundation model trained on approximately 7,500 CT scans covering the whole body, from both normal anatomy and a wide range of oncological cases. ONCOPILOT performs 3D tumor segmentation using visual prompts like point-click and bounding boxes, outperforming state-of-the-art models (e.g., nnUnet) and achieving radiologist-level accuracy in RECIST 1.1 measurements. The key advantage of this foundation model is its ability to surpass state-of-the-art performance while keeping the radiologist in the loop, a capability that previous models could not achieve. When radiologists interactively refine the segmentations, accuracy improves further. ONCOPILOT also accelerates measurement processes and reduces inter-reader variability, facilitating volumetric analysis and unlocking new biomarkers for deeper insights.
  This AI assistant is expected to enhance the precision of RECIST 1.1 measurements, unlock the potential of volumetric biomarkers, and improve patient stratification and clinical care, while seamlessly integrating into the radiological workflow.</p>
