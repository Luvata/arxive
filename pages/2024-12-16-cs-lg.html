<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikhail Mironov, Liudmila Prokhorenkova</p>
<p>Abstract: Homophily is a graph property describing the tendency of edges to connect similar nodes. There are several measures used for assessing homophily but all are known to have certain drawbacks: in particular, they cannot be reliably used for comparing datasets with varying numbers of classes and class size balance. To show this, previous works on graph homophily suggested several properties desirable for a good homophily measure, also noting that no existing homophily measure has all these properties. Our paper addresses this issue by introducing a new homophily measure - unbiased homophily - that has all the desirable properties and thus can be reliably used across datasets with different label distributions. The proposed measure is suitable for undirected (and possibly weighted) graphs. We show both theoretically and via empirical examples that the existing homophily measures have serious drawbacks while unbiased homophily has a desirable behavior for the considered scenarios. Finally, when it comes to directed graphs, we prove that some desirable properties contradict each other and thus a measure satisfying all of them cannot exist.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09686">The Cost of Replicability in Active Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rupkatha Hira, Dominik Kau, Jessica Sorrell</p>
<p>Abstract: Active learning aims to reduce the required number of labeled data for machine learning algorithms by selectively querying the labels of initially unlabeled data points. Ensuring the replicability of results, where an algorithm consistently produces the same outcome across different runs, is essential for the reliability of machine learning models but often increases sample complexity. This report investigates the cost of replicability in active learning using the CAL algorithm, a classical disagreement-based active learning method. By integrating replicable statistical query subroutines and random thresholding techniques, we propose two versions of a replicable CAL algorithm. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that while replicability does increase label complexity, the CAL algorithm can still achieve significant savings in label complexity even with the replicability constraint. These findings offer valuable insights into balancing efficiency and robustness in machine learning models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09687">DQA: An Efficient Method for Deep Quantization of Deep Neural Network Activations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Hu, Paul Henderson, Jos\'e Cano</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization of Deep Neural Network (DNN) activations is a commonly used technique to reduce compute and memory demands during DNN inference, which can be particularly beneficial on resource-constrained devices. To achieve high accuracy, existing methods for quantizing activations rely on complex mathematical computations or perform extensive searches for the best hyper-parameters. However, these expensive operations are impractical on devices with limited computation capabilities, memory capacities, and energy budgets. Furthermore, many existing methods do not focus on sub-6-bit (or deep) quantization.
  To fill these gaps, in this paper we propose DQA (Deep Quantization of DNN Activations), a new method that focuses on sub-6-bit quantization of activations and leverages simple shifting-based operations and Huffman coding to be efficient and achieve high accuracy. We evaluate DQA with 3, 4, and 5-bit quantization levels and three different DNN models for two different tasks, image classification and image segmentation, on two different datasets. DQA shows significantly better accuracy (up to 29.28%) compared to the direct quantization method and the state-of-the-art NoisyQuant for sub-6-bit quantization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amanda Rios, Ibrahima Ndiour, Parual Datta, Jerry Sydir, Omesh Tickoo, Nilesh Ahuja</p>
<p>Abstract: AI deployed in many real-world use cases should be capable of adapting to novelties encountered after deployment. Here, we consider a challenging, under-explored and realistic continual adaptation problem: a deployed AI agent is continuously provided with unlabeled data that may contain not only unseen samples of known classes but also samples from novel (unknown) classes. In such a challenging setting, it has only a tiny labeling budget to query the most informative samples to help it continuously learn. We present a comprehensive solution to this complex problem with our model "CUAL" (Continual Uncertainty-aware Active Learner). CUAL leverages an uncertainty estimation algorithm to prioritize active labeling of ambiguous (uncertain) predicted novel class samples while also simultaneously pseudo-labeling the most certain predictions of each class. Evaluations across multiple datasets, ablations, settings and backbones (e.g. ViT foundation model) demonstrate our method's effectiveness. We will release our code upon acceptance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09726">The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Gaussian Score Approximation for Diffusion Models and its Applications</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Binxu Wang, John J. Vastola</p>
<p>Abstract: By learning the gradient of smoothed data distributions, diffusion models can iteratively generate samples from complex distributions. The learned score function enables their generalization capabilities, but how the learned score relates to the score of the underlying data manifold remains largely unclear. Here, we aim to elucidate this relationship by comparing learned neural scores to the scores of two kinds of analytically tractable distributions: Gaussians and Gaussian mixtures. The simplicity of the Gaussian model makes it theoretically attractive, and we show that it admits a closed-form solution and predicts many qualitative aspects of sample generation dynamics. We claim that the learned neural score is dominated by its linear (Gaussian) approximation for moderate to high noise scales, and supply both theoretical and empirical arguments to support this claim. Moreover, the Gaussian approximation empirically works for a larger range of noise scales than naive theory suggests it should, and is preferentially learned early in training. At smaller noise scales, we observe that learned scores are better described by a coarse-grained (Gaussian mixture) approximation of training data than by the score of the training distribution, a finding consistent with generalization. Our findings enable us to precisely predict the initial phase of trained models' sampling trajectories through their Gaussian approximations. We show that this allows the skipping of the first 15-30% of sampling steps while maintaining high sample quality (with a near state-of-the-art FID score of 1.93 on CIFAR-10 unconditional generation). This forms the foundation of a novel hybrid sampling method, termed analytical teleportation, which can seamlessly integrate with and accelerate existing samplers, including DPM-Solver-v3 and UniPC. Our findings suggest ways to improve the design and training of diffusion models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09748">New Approach to Clustering Random Attributes</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zenon Gniazdowski</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for similarity analysis and, consequently, a new algorithm for clustering different types of random attributes, both numerical and nominal. However, in order for nominal attributes to be clustered, their values must be properly encoded. In the encoding process, nominal attributes obtain a new representation in numerical form. Only the numeric attributes can be subjected to factor analysis, which allows them to be clustered in terms of their similarity to factors. The proposed method was tested for several sample datasets. It was found that the proposed method is universal. On the one hand, the method allows clustering of numerical attributes. On the other hand, it provides the ability to cluster nominal attributes. It also allows simultaneous clustering of numerical attributes and numerically encoded nominal attributes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyle R. Chickering</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of neural networks for solving differential equations is practically difficult due to the exponentially increasing runtime of autodifferentiation when computing high-order derivatives. We propose $n$-TangentProp, the natural extension of the TangentProp formalism \cite{simard1991tangent} to arbitrarily many derivatives. $n$-TangentProp computes the exact derivative $d^n/dx^n f(x)$ in quasilinear, instead of exponential time, for a densely connected, feed-forward neural network $f$ with a smooth, parameter-free activation function. We validate our algorithm empirically across a range of depths, widths, and number of derivatives. We demonstrate that our method is particularly beneficial in the context of physics-informed neural networks where \ntp allows for significantly faster training times than previous methods and has favorable scaling with respect to both model size and loss-function complexity as measured by the number of required derivatives.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shashank N. Sridhara, Eduardo Pavez, Antonio Ortega</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the problem of sampling graph signals in scenarios where the graph structure is not predefined and must be inferred from data. In this scenario, existing approaches rely on a two-step process, where a graph is learned first, followed by sampling. More generally, graph learning and graph signal sampling have been studied as two independent problems in the literature. This work provides a foundational step towards jointly optimizing the graph structure and sampling set. Our main contribution, Vertex Importance Sampling (VIS), is to show that the sampling set can be effectively determined from the vertex importance (node weights) obtained from graph learning. We further propose Vertex Importance Sampling with Repulsion (VISR), a greedy algorithm where spatially -separated "important" nodes are selected to ensure better reconstruction. Empirical results on simulated data show that sampling using VIS and VISR leads to competitive reconstruction performance and lower complexity than the conventional two-step approach of graph learning followed by graph sampling.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09758">Toward Foundation Model for Multivariate Wearable Sensing of Physiological Signals</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunfei Luo, Yuliang Chen, Asif Salekin, Tauhidur Rahman</p>
<p>Abstract: Time-series foundation models have the ability to run inference, mainly forecasting, on any type of time series data, thanks to the informative representations comprising waveform features. Wearable sensing data, on the other hand, contain more variability in both patterns and frequency bands of interest and generally emphasize more on the ability to infer healthcare-related outcomes. The main challenge of crafting a foundation model for wearable sensing physiological signals is to learn generalizable representations that support efficient adaptation across heterogeneous sensing configurations and applications. In this work, we propose NormWear, a step toward such a foundation model, aiming to extract generalized and informative wearable sensing representations. NormWear has been pretrained on a large set of physiological signals, including PPG, ECG, EEG, GSR, and IMU, from various public resources. For a holistic assessment, we perform downstream evaluation on 11 public wearable sensing datasets, spanning 18 applications in the areas of mental health, body state inference, biomarker estimations, and disease risk evaluations. We demonstrate that NormWear achieves a better performance improvement over competitive baselines in general time series foundation modeling. In addition, leveraging a novel representation-alignment-match-based method, we align physiological signals embeddings with text embeddings. This alignment enables our proposed foundation model to perform zero-shot inference, allowing it to generalize to previously unseen wearable signal-based health applications. Finally, we perform nonlinear dynamic analysis on the waveform features extracted by the model at each intermediate layer. This analysis quantifies the model's internal processes, offering clear insights into its behavior and fostering greater trust in its inferences among end users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijin Lyu, Yutong Jin, Sneha Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Determining the robustness of deep learning models is an established and ongoing challenge within automated decision-making systems. With the advent and success of techniques that enable advanced deep learning (DL), these models are being used in widespread applications, including high-stake ones like healthcare, education, border-control. Therefore, it is critical to understand the limitations of these models and predict their regions of failures, in order to create the necessary guardrails for their successful and safe deployment. In this work, we revisit robustness, specifically investigating the sufficiency of robust accuracy (RA), within the context of deepfake detection. We present robust ratio (RR) as a complementary metric, that can quantify the changes to the normalized or probability outcomes under input perturbation. We present a comparison of RA and RR and demonstrate that despite similar RA between models, the models show varying RR under different tolerance (perturbation) levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lyudmila Grigoryeva, Hannah Lim Jing Ting, Juan-Pablo Ortega</p>
<p>Abstract: Next-generation reservoir computing (NG-RC) has attracted much attention due to its excellent performance in spatio-temporal forecasting of complex systems and its ease of implementation. This paper shows that NG-RC can be encoded as a kernel ridge regression that makes training efficient and feasible even when the space of chosen polynomial features is very large. Additionally, an extension to an infinite number of covariates is possible, which makes the methodology agnostic with respect to the lags into the past that are considered as explanatory factors, as well as with respect to the number of polynomial covariates, an important hyperparameter in traditional NG-RC. We show that this approach has solid theoretical backing and good behavior based on kernel universality properties previously established in the literature. Various numerical illustrations show that these generalizations of NG-RC outperform the traditional approach in several forecasting applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09803">deepNoC: A deep learning system to assign the number of contributors to a short tandem repeat DNA profile</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Duncan Taylor, Melissa A. Humphries</p>
<p>Abstract: A common task in forensic biology is to interpret and evaluate short tandem repeat DNA profiles. The first step in these interpretations is to assign a number of contributors to the profiles, a task that is most often performed manually by a scientist using their knowledge of DNA profile behaviour. Studies using constructed DNA profiles have shown that as DNA profiles become more complex, and the number of DNA-donating individuals increases, the ability for scientists to assign the target number. There have been a number of machine learning algorithms developed that seek to assign the number of contributors to a DNA profile, however due to practical limitations in being able to generate DNA profiles in a laboratory, the algorithms have been based on summaries of the available information. In this work we develop an analysis pipeline that simulates the electrophoretic signal of an STR profile, allowing virtually unlimited, pre-labelled training material to be generated. We show that by simulating 100 000 profiles and training a number of contributors estimation tool using a deep neural network architecture (in an algorithm named deepNoC) that a high level of performance is achieved (89% for 1 to 10 contributors). The trained network can then have fine-tuning training performed with only a few hundred profiles in order to achieve the same accuracy within a specific laboratory. We also build into deepNoC secondary outputs that provide a level of explainability to a user of algorithm, and show how they can be displayed in an intuitive manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Gu, Zhuonan Zheng, Sheng Zhou, Meihan Liu, Jiawei Chen, Tanyu Qiao, Liangcheng Li, Jiajun Bu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various domains, such as transaction and social net-works. However, their application is often hindered by the varyinghomophily levels across different orders of neighboring nodes, ne-cessitating separate model designs for homophilic and heterophilicgraphs. In this paper, we aim to develop a unified framework ca-pable of handling neighborhoods of various orders and homophilylevels. Through theoretical exploration, we identify a previouslyoverlooked architectural aspect in multi-hop learning: the cascadedependency, which leads to asmoothness-generalization dilemma.This dilemma significantly affects the learning process, especiallyin the context of high-order neighborhoods and heterophilic graphs.To resolve this issue, we propose an Inceptive Graph Neural Net-work (IGNN), a universal message-passing framework that replacesthe cascade dependency with an inceptive architecture. IGNN pro-vides independent representations for each hop, allowing personal-ized generalization capabilities, and captures neighborhood-wiserelationships to select appropriate receptive fields. Extensive ex-periments show that our IGNN outperforms 23 baseline methods,demonstrating superior performance on both homophilic and het-erophilic graphs, while also scaling efficiently to large graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Branton DeMoss, Silvia Sapora, Jakob Foerster, Nick Hawes, Ingmar Posner</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of generalization through the lens of compression. In particular, we study the complexity dynamics of neural networks to explain grokking, where networks suddenly transition from memorizing to generalizing solutions long after over-fitting the training data. To this end we introduce a new measure of intrinsic complexity for neural networks based on the theory of Kolmogorov complexity. Tracking this metric throughout network training, we find a consistent pattern in training dynamics, consisting of a rise and fall in complexity. We demonstrate that this corresponds to memorization followed by generalization. Based on insights from rate--distortion theory and the minimum description length principle, we lay out a principled approach to lossy compression of neural networks, and connect our complexity measure to explicit generalization bounds. Based on a careful analysis of information capacity in neural networks, we propose a new regularization method which encourages networks towards low-rank representations by penalizing their spectral entropy, and find that our regularizer outperforms baselines in total compression of the dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditionally, learning the structure of a Dynamic Bayesian Network has been centralized, with all data pooled in one location. However, in real-world scenarios, data are often dispersed among multiple parties (e.g., companies, devices) that aim to collaboratively learn a Dynamic Bayesian Network while preserving their data privacy and security. In this study, we introduce a federated learning approach for estimating the structure of a Dynamic Bayesian Network from data distributed horizontally across different parties. We propose a distributed structure learning method that leverages continuous optimization so that only model parameters are exchanged during optimization. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets reveal that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques, particularly when there are many clients with limited individual sample sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmadreza Eslaminia, Adrian Jackson, Beitong Tian, Avi Stern, Hallie Gordon, Rajiv Malhotra, Klara Nahrstedt, Chenhui Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a widely used additive manufacturing (AM) technique valued for its flexibility and cost-efficiency, with applications in a variety of industries including healthcare and aerospace. Recent developments have made affordable FDM machines accessible and encouraged adoption among diverse users. However, the design, planning, and production process in FDM require specialized interdisciplinary knowledge. Managing the complex parameters and resolving print defects in FDM remain challenging. These technical complexities form the most critical barrier preventing individuals without technical backgrounds and even professional engineers without training in other domains from participating in AM design and manufacturing. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their advanced capabilities in text and code processing, offer the potential for addressing these challenges in FDM. However, existing research on LLM applications in this field is limited, typically focusing on specific use cases without providing comprehensive evaluations across multiple models and tasks. To this end, we introduce FDM-Bench, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate LLMs on FDM-specific tasks. FDM-Bench enables a thorough assessment by including user queries across various experience levels and G-code samples that represent a range of anomalies. We evaluate two closed-source models (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and two open-source models (Llama-3.1-70B and Llama-3.1-405B) on FDM-Bench. A panel of FDM experts assess the models' responses to user queries in detail. Results indicate that closed-source models generally outperform open-source models in G-code anomaly detection, whereas Llama-3.1-405B demonstrates a slight advantage over other models in responding to user queries. These findings underscore FDM-Bench's potential as a foundational tool for advancing research on LLM capabilities in FDM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rutuja Gurav, Isaac Kelly, Pooyan Goodarzi, Anamaria Effler, Barry Barish, Evangelos Papalexakis, Jonathan Richardson</p>
<p>Abstract: Gravitational-wave observatories like LIGO are large-scale, terrestrial instruments housed in infrastructure that spans a multi-kilometer geographic area and which must be actively controlled to maintain operational stability for long observation periods. Despite exquisite seismic isolation, they remain susceptible to seismic noise and other terrestrial disturbances that can couple undesirable vibrations into the instrumental infrastructure, potentially leading to control instabilities or noise artifacts in the detector output. It is, therefore, critical to characterize the seismic state of these observatories to identify a set of temporal patterns that can inform the detector operators in day-to-day monitoring and diagnostics. On a day-to-day basis, the operators monitor several seismically relevant data streams to diagnose operational instabilities and sources of noise using some simple empirically-determined thresholds. It can be untenable for a human operator to monitor multiple data streams in this manual fashion and thus a distillation of these data-streams into a more human-friendly format is sought. In this paper, we present an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for features-based multivariate time series clustering to achieve this goal and to provide actionable insights to the detector operators by correlating found clusters with events of interest in the detector.</p>

<p>Abstract: Programmatically generated synthetic data has been used in differential private training for classification to enhance performance without privacy leakage. However, as the synthetic data is generated from a random process, the distribution of real data and the synthetic data are distinguishable and difficult to transfer. Therefore, the model trained with the synthetic data generates unrealistic random images, raising challenges to adapt the synthetic data for generative models. In this work, we propose DP-SynGen, which leverages programmatically generated synthetic data in diffusion models to address this challenge. By exploiting the three stages of diffusion models(coarse, context, and cleaning) we identify stages where synthetic data can be effectively utilized. We theoretically and empirically verified that cleaning and coarse stages can be trained without private data, replacing them with synthetic data to reduce the privacy budget. The experimental results show that DP-SynGen improves the quality of generative data by mitigating the negative impact of privacy-induced noise on the generation process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Khoa Le, Kien Do, Truyen Tran</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we address causal inference when only observational data and a valid causal ordering from the causal graph are available. We introduce a set of flow models that can recover component-wise, invertible transformation of exogenous variables. Our flow-based methods offer flexible model design while maintaining causal consistency regardless of the number of discretization steps. We propose design improvements that enable simultaneous learning of all causal mechanisms and reduce abduction and prediction complexity to linear O(n) relative to the number of layers, independent of the number of causal variables. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches and delivers consistent performance across a wide range of structural causal models in answering observational, interventional, and counterfactual questions. Additionally, our method achieves a significant reduction in computational time compared to existing diffusion-based techniques, making it practical for large structural causal models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youran Sun, Yihua Liu, Yi-Shuai Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: Difference-of-Convex Algorithm (DCA) is a well-known nonconvex optimization algorithm for minimizing a nonconvex function that can be expressed as the difference of two convex ones. Many famous existing optimization algorithms, such as SGD and proximal point methods, can be viewed as special DCAs with specific DC decompositions, making it a powerful framework for optimization. On the other hand, shortcuts are a key architectural feature in modern deep neural networks, facilitating both training and optimization. We showed that the shortcut neural network gradient can be obtained by applying DCA to vanilla neural networks, networks without shortcut connections. Therefore, from the perspective of DCA, we can better understand the effectiveness of networks with shortcuts. Moreover, we proposed a new architecture called NegNet that does not fit the previous interpretation but performs on par with ResNet and can be included in the DCA framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abraham Atsiwo</p>
<p>Abstract: The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) highlights the essence of financial news in stock price movement. Financial news comes in the form of corporate announcements, news titles, and other forms of digital text. The generation of insights from financial news can be done with sentiment analysis. General-purpose language models are too general for sentiment analysis in finance. Curated labeled data for fine-tuning general-purpose language models are scare, and existing fine-tuned models for sentiment analysis in finance do not capture the maximum context width. We hypothesize that using actual and synthetic data can improve performance. We introduce BertNSP-finance to concatenate shorter financial sentences into longer financial sentences, and finbert-lc to determine sentiment from digital text. The results show improved performance on the accuracy and the f1 score for the financial phrasebank data with $50\%$ and $100\%$ agreement levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Tao, Kazuyuki Aihara, Luonan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) with unsupervised learning can solve large-scale combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with efficient time complexity, making them versatile for various applications. However, since this method maps the combinatorial optimization problem to the training process of a graph neural network, and the current mainstream backpropagation-based training algorithms are prone to fall into local minima, the optimization performance is still inferior to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) COP methods. To address this issue, inspired by possibly chaotic dynamics of real brain learning, we introduce a chaotic training algorithm, i.e. chaotic graph backpropagation (CGBP), which introduces a local loss function in GNN that makes the training process not only chaotic but also highly efficient. Different from existing methods, we show that the global ergodicity and pseudo-randomness of such chaotic dynamics enable CGBP to learn each optimal GNN effectively and globally, thus solving the COP efficiently. We have applied CGBP to solve various COPs, such as the maximum independent set, maximum cut, and graph coloring. Results on several large-scale benchmark datasets showcase that CGBP can outperform not only existing GNN algorithms but also SOTA methods. In addition to solving large-scale COPs, CGBP as a universal learning algorithm for GNNs, i.e. as a plug-in unit, can be easily integrated into any existing method for improving the performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaobo Ma, Hyunsoo Noh, Ryan Hatch, James Tokishi, Zepu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban transportation networks are vital for the efficient movement of people and goods, necessitating effective traffic management and planning. An integral part of traffic management is understanding the turning movement counts (TMCs) at intersections, Accurate TMCs at intersections are crucial for traffic signal control, congestion mitigation, and road safety. In general, TMCs are obtained using physical sensors installed at intersections, but this approach can be cost-prohibitive and technically challenging, especially for cities with extensive road networks. Recent advancements in machine learning and data-driven approaches have offered promising alternatives for estimating TMCs. Traffic patterns can vary significantly across different intersections due to factors such as road geometry, traffic signal settings, and local driver behaviors. This domain discrepancy limits the generalizability and accuracy of machine learning models when applied to new or unseen intersections. In response to these limitations, this research proposes a novel framework leveraging transfer learning (TL) to estimate TMCs at intersections by using traffic controller event-based data, road infrastructure data, and point-of-interest (POI) data. Evaluated on 30 intersections in Tucson, Arizona, the performance of the proposed TL model was compared with eight state-of-the-art regression models and achieved the lowest values in terms of Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms have become integral to decision making in various domains, including healthcare, finance, education, and law enforcement. However, concerns about fairness and bias in these systems pose significant ethical and social challenges. This study investigates the fairness of ML models applied to structured datasets in classification tasks, highlighting the potential for biased predictions to perpetuate systemic inequalities. A publicly available dataset from Kaggle was selected for analysis, offering a realistic scenario for evaluating fairness in machine learning workflows.
  To assess and mitigate biases, three prominent fairness libraries; Fairlearn by Microsoft, AIF360 by IBM, and the What If Tool by Google were employed. These libraries provide robust frameworks for analyzing fairness, offering tools to evaluate metrics, visualize results, and implement bias mitigation strategies. The research aims to assess the extent of bias in the ML models, compare the effectiveness of these libraries, and derive actionable insights for practitioners.
  The findings reveal that each library has unique strengths and limitations in fairness evaluation and mitigation. By systematically comparing their capabilities, this study contributes to the growing field of ML fairness by providing practical guidance for integrating fairness tools into real world applications. These insights are intended to support the development of more equitable machine learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junrui Xiao, Zhikai Li, Lianwei Yang, Yiduo Mei, Qingyi Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces excessive hardware cost by quantizing full-precision models into lower bit representations on a tiny calibration set, without retraining. Despite the remarkable progress made through recent efforts, traditional PTQ methods typically encounter failure in dynamic and ever-changing real-world scenarios, involving unpredictable data streams and continual domain shifts, which poses greater challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel and stable quantization process for test-time adaptation (TTA), dubbed TTAQ, to address the performance degradation of traditional PTQ in dynamically evolving test domains. To tackle domain shifts in quantizer, TTAQ proposes the Perturbation Error Mitigation (PEM) and Perturbation Consistency Reconstruction (PCR). Specifically, PEM analyzes the error propagation and devises a weight regularization scheme to mitigate the impact of input perturbations. On the other hand, PCR introduces consistency learning to ensure that quantized models provide stable predictions for same sample. Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive Balanced Loss (ABL) to adjust the logits by taking advantage of the frequency and complexity of the class, which can effectively address the class imbalance caused by unpredictable data streams during optimization. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple datasets with generic TTA methods, proving that TTAQ can outperform existing baselines and encouragingly improve the accuracy of low bit PTQ models in continually changing test domains. For instance, TTAQ decreases the mean error of 2-bit models on ImageNet-C dataset by an impressive 10.1\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanting Xie, Bingheng Li, Erlin Pan, Zhaochen Guo, Zhao Kang, Wenyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing graph clustering methods primarily focus on exploiting topological structure, often neglecting the ``missing-half" node feature information, especially how these features can enhance clustering performance. This issue is further compounded by the challenges associated with high-dimensional features. Feature selection in graph clustering is particularly difficult because it requires simultaneously discovering clusters and identifying the relevant features for these clusters. To address this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm called ``one node one model", which builds an exclusive model for each node and defines the node label as a combination of predictions for node groups. Specifically, the proposed ``Feature Personalized Graph Clustering (FPGC)" method identifies cluster-relevant features for each node using a squeeze-and-excitation block, integrating these features into each model to form the final representations. Additionally, the concept of feature cross is developed as a data augmentation technique to learn low-order feature interactions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FPGC outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods. Moreover, the plug-and-play nature of our method provides a versatile solution to enhance GNN-based models from a feature perspective.</p>

First, we examine several variants of linear temporal logic, whose formulas have been previously been shown to be computable using hard attention transformers. We demonstrate how soft attention transformers can compute formulas of these logics using unbounded positional embeddings or temperature scaling. Second, we demonstrate how temperature scaling allows softmax transformers to simulate a large subclass of average-hard attention transformers, those that have what we call the uniform-tieless property.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuemin Wang, Tianlong Gu, Xuguang Bao, Liang Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-structured data is ubiquitous in today's connected world, driving extensive research in graph analysis. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great success in this field, leading to growing interest in developing fair GNNs for critical applications. However, most existing fair GNNs focus on statistical fairness notions, which may be insufficient when dealing with statistical anomalies. Hence, motivated by causal theory, there has been growing attention to mitigating root causes of unfairness utilizing graph counterfactuals. Unfortunately, existing methods for generating graph counterfactuals invariably require the sensitive attribute. Nevertheless, in many real-world applications, it is usually infeasible to obtain sensitive attributes due to privacy or legal issues, which challenge existing methods. In this paper, we propose a framework named Fairwos (improving Fairness without sensitive attributes). In particular, we first propose a mechanism to generate pseudo-sensitive attributes to remedy the problem of missing sensitive attributes, and then design a strategy for finding graph counterfactuals from the real dataset. To train fair GNNs, we propose a method to ensure that the embeddings from the original data are consistent with those from the graph counterfactuals, and dynamically adjust the weight of each pseudo-sensitive attribute to balance its contribution to fairness and utility. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that minimizing the relation between these pseudo-sensitive attributes and the prediction can enable the fairness of GNNs. Experimental results on six real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in balancing utility and fairness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scaling large language models (LLMs) significantly improves performance but comes with prohibitive computational costs. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models offer an efficient alternative, increasing capacity without a proportional rise in compute requirements. However, training MoE models from scratch poses challenges like overfitting and routing instability. We present an efficient training recipe leveraging pre-trained dense checkpoints, training an 8-Expert Top-2 MoE model from Llama 3-8B with less than $1\%$ of typical pre-training compute. Our approach enhances downstream performance on academic benchmarks, achieving a $\textbf{2%}$ improvement in 0-shot accuracy on MMLU, while reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) of $\textbf{46.8%}$ during training using our framework. We also integrate online upcycling in NeMo for seamless use of pre-trained weights, enabling cost-effective development of high-capacity MoE models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09961">What constitutes a Deep Fake? The blurry line between legitimate processing and manipulation under the EU AI Act</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kristof Meding, Christoph Sorge</p>
<p>Abstract: When does a digital image resemble reality? The relevance of this question increases as the generation of synthetic images -- so called deep fakes -- becomes increasingly popular. Deep fakes have gained much attention for a number of reasons -- among others, due to their potential to disrupt the political climate. In order to mitigate these threats, the EU AI Act implements specific transparency regulations for generating synthetic content or manipulating existing content. However, the distinction between real and synthetic images is -- even from a computer vision perspective -- far from trivial. We argue that the current definition of deep fakes in the AI act and the corresponding obligations are not sufficiently specified to tackle the challenges posed by deep fakes. By analyzing the life cycle of a digital photo from the camera sensor to the digital editing features, we find that: (1.) Deep fakes are ill-defined in the EU AI Act. The definition leaves too much scope for what a deep fake is. (2.) It is unclear how editing functions like Google's ``best take'' feature can be considered as an exception to transparency obligations. (3.) The exception for substantially edited images raises questions about what constitutes substantial editing of content and whether or not this editing must be perceptible by a natural person. Our results demonstrate that complying with the current AI Act transparency obligations is difficult for providers and deployers. As a consequence of the unclear provisions, there is a risk that exceptions may be either too broad or too limited. We intend our analysis to foster the discussion on what constitutes a deep fake and to raise awareness about the pitfalls in the current AI Act transparency obligations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Zheng, Jieming Shi, Renchi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph similarity computation (GSC) is to calculate the similarity between one pair of graphs, which is a fundamental problem with fruitful applications in the graph community. In GSC, graph edit distance (GED) and maximum common subgraph (MCS) are two important similarity metrics, both of which are NP-hard to compute. Instead of calculating the exact values, recent solutions resort to leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn data-driven models for the estimation of GED and MCS. Most of them are built on components involving node-level interactions crossing graphs, which engender vast computation overhead but are of little avail in effectiveness. In the paper, we present GraSP, a simple yet effective GSC approach for GED and MCS prediction. GraSP achieves high result efficacy through several key instruments: enhanced node features via positional encoding and a GNN model augmented by a gating mechanism, residual connections, as well as multi-scale pooling. Theoretically, GraSP can surpass the 1-WL test, indicating its high expressiveness. Empirically, extensive experiments comparing GraSP against 10 competitors on multiple widely adopted benchmark datasets showcase the superiority of GraSP over prior arts in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Fang, Yuxuan Liang, Bo Hui, Zezhi Shao, Liwei Deng, Xu Liu, Xinke Jiang, Kai Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Road traffic forecasting is crucial in real-world intelligent transportation scenarios like traffic dispatching and path planning in city management and personal traveling. Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) stand out as the mainstream solution in this task. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity of remarkable dynamic spatial modeling-based STGNNs has become the bottleneck over large-scale traffic data. From the spatial data management perspective, we present a novel Transformer framework called PatchSTG to efficiently and dynamically model spatial dependencies for large-scale traffic forecasting with interpretability and fidelity. Specifically, we design a novel irregular spatial patching to reduce the number of points involved in the dynamic calculation of Transformer. The irregular spatial patching first utilizes the leaf K-dimensional tree (KDTree) to recursively partition irregularly distributed traffic points into leaf nodes with a small capacity, and then merges leaf nodes belonging to the same subtree into occupancy-equaled and non-overlapped patches through padding and backtracking. Based on the patched data, depth and breadth attention are used interchangeably in the encoder to dynamically learn local and global spatial knowledge from points in a patch and points with the same index of patches. Experimental results on four real world large-scale traffic datasets show that our PatchSTG achieves train speed and memory utilization improvements up to $10\times$ and $4\times$ with the state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, as the population ages, falls have increasingly posed a significant threat to the health of the elderly. We propose a real-time fall detection system that integrates the inertial measurement unit (IMU) of a smartphone with optimized Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI) for secondary validation. Initially, the IMU distinguishes falls from routine daily activities with minimal computational demand. Subsequently, the CSI is employed for further assessment, which includes evaluating the individual's post-fall mobility. This methodology not only achieves high accuracy but also reduces energy consumption in the smartphone platform. An Android application developed specifically for the purpose issues an emergency alert if the user experiences a fall and is unable to move. Experimental results indicate that the CSI model, based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), achieves a detection accuracy of 99%, \revised{surpassing comparable IMU-only models, and demonstrating significant resilience in distinguishing between falls and non-fall activities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Uplift modeling and Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) estimation aim at predicting the causal effect of an action, such as a medical treatment or a marketing campaign on a specific individual. In this paper, we focus on data from Randomized Controlled Experiments which guarantee causal interpretation of the outcomes. Class and treatment imbalance are important problems in uplift modeling/HTE, but classical undersampling or oversampling based approaches are hard to apply in this case since they distort the predicted effect. Calibration methods have been proposed in the past, however, they do not guarantee correct predictions. In this work, we propose an approach alternative to undersampling, based on flipping the class value of selected records. We show that the proposed approach does not distort the predicted effect and does not require calibration. The method is especially useful for models based on class variable transformation (modified outcome models). We address those models separately, designing a transformation scheme which guarantees correct predictions and addresses also the problem of treatment imbalance which is especially important for those models. Experiments fully confirm our theoretical results. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method is a viable alternative also for standard classification problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Makbule Gulcin Ozsoy, Leila Messallem, Jon Besga, Gianandrea Minneci</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graphs use nodes, relationships, and properties to represent arbitrarily complex data. When stored in a graph database, the Cypher query language enables efficient modeling and querying of knowledge graphs. However, using Cypher requires specialized knowledge, which can present a challenge for non-expert users. Our work Text2Cypher aims to bridge this gap by translating natural language queries into Cypher query language and extending the utility of knowledge graphs to non-technical expert users.
  While large language models (LLMs) can be used for this purpose, they often struggle to capture complex nuances, resulting in incomplete or incorrect outputs. Fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific datasets has proven to be a more promising approach, but the limited availability of high-quality, publicly available Text2Cypher datasets makes this challenging. In this work, we show how we combined, cleaned and organized several publicly available datasets into a total of 44,387 instances, enabling effective fine-tuning and evaluation. Models fine-tuned on this dataset showed significant performance gains, with improvements in Google-BLEU and Exact Match scores over baseline models, highlighting the importance of high-quality datasets and fine-tuning in improving Text2Cypher performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and their machine learning counterpart, Knowledge Graph Embedding Models (KGEMs), have seen ever-increasing use in a wide variety of academic and applied settings. In particular, KGEMs are typically applied to KGs to solve the link prediction task; i.e. to predict new facts in the domain of a KG based on existing, observed facts. While this approach has been shown substantial power in many end-use cases, it remains incompletely characterised in terms of how KGEMs react differently to KG structure. This is of particular concern in light of recent studies showing that KG structure can be a significant source of bias as well as partially determinant of overall KGEM performance. This paper seeks to address this gap in the state-of-the-art. This paper provides, to the authors' knowledge, the first comprehensive survey exploring established relationships of Knowledge Graph Embedding Models and Graph structure in the literature. It is the hope of the authors that this work will inspire further studies in this area, and contribute to a more holistic understanding of KGs, KGEMs, and the link prediction task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Louis Chislett, Catalina A. Vallejos, Timothy I. Cannings, James Liley</p>
<p>Abstract: Prediction models frequently face the challenge of concept drift, in which the underlying data distribution changes over time, weakening performance. Examples can include models which predict loan default, or those used in healthcare contexts. Typical management strategies involve regular model updates or updates triggered by concept drift detection. However, these simple policies do not necessarily balance the cost of model updating with improved classifier performance. We present AMUSE (Adaptive Model Updating using a Simulated Environment), a novel method leveraging reinforcement learning trained within a simulated data generating environment, to determine update timings for classifiers. The optimal updating policy depends on the current data generating process and ongoing drift process. Our key idea is that we can train an arbitrarily complex model updating policy by creating a training environment in which possible episodes of drift are simulated by a parametric model, which represents expectations of possible drift patterns. As a result, AMUSE proactively recommends updates based on estimated performance improvements, learning a policy that balances maintaining model performance with minimizing update costs. Empirical results confirm the effectiveness of AMUSE in simulated data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rittwika Kansabanik, Adrian Barbu</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature selection is crucial for pinpointing relevant features in high-dimensional datasets, mitigating the 'curse of dimensionality,' and enhancing machine learning performance. Traditional feature selection methods for classification use data from all classes to select features for each class. This paper explores feature selection methods that select features for each class separately, using class models based on low-rank generative methods and introducing a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) feature selection criterion. This novel approach has theoretical true feature recovery guarantees under certain assumptions and is shown to outperform some existing feature selection methods on standard classification datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikita Gabdullin</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies generalization capabilities of neural networks (NNs) using new and improved PyTorch library Loss Landscape Analysis (LLA). LLA facilitates visualization and analysis of loss landscapes along with the properties of NN Hessian. Different approaches to NN loss landscape plotting are discussed with particular focus on normalization techniques showing that conventional methods cannot always ensure correct visualization when batch normalization layers are present in NN architecture. The use of Hessian axes is shown to be able to mitigate this effect, and methods for choosing Hessian axes are proposed. In addition, spectra of Hessian eigendecomposition are studied and it is shown that typical spectra exist for a wide range of NNs. This allows to propose quantitative criteria for Hessian analysis that can be applied to evaluate NN performance and assess its generalization capabilities. Generalization experiments are conducted using ImageNet-1K pre-trained models along with several models trained as part of this study. The experiment include training models on one dataset and testing on another one to maximize experiment similarity to model performance in the Wild. It is shown that when datasets change, the changes in criteria correlate with the changes in accuracy, making the proposed criteria a computationally efficient estimate of generalization ability, which is especially useful for extremely large datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanne van Kempen, Jaron Sanders, Fiona Sloothaak, Maarten G. Wolf</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by applications in service systems, we consider queueing systems where each customer must be handled by a server with the right skill set. We focus on optimizing the routing of customers to servers in order to maximize the total payoff of customer--server matches. In addition, customer--server dependent payoff parameters are assumed to be unknown a priori. We construct a machine learning algorithm that adaptively learns the payoff parameters while maximizing the total payoff and prove that it achieves polylogarithmic regret. Moreover, we show that the algorithm is asymptotically optimal up to logarithmic terms by deriving a regret lower bound. The algorithm leverages the basic feasible solutions of a static linear program as the action space. The regret analysis overcomes the complex interplay between queueing and learning by analyzing the convergence of the queue length process to its stationary behavior. We also demonstrate the performance of the algorithm numerically, and have included an experiment with time-varying parameters highlighting the potential of the algorithm in non-static environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Lorenz, Marta Kwiatkowska, Mario Fritz</p>
<p>Abstract: Data poisoning attacks pose one of the biggest threats to modern AI systems, necessitating robust defenses. While extensive efforts have been made to develop empirical defenses, attackers continue to evolve, creating sophisticated methods to circumvent these measures. To address this, we must move beyond empirical defenses and establish provable certification methods that guarantee robustness. This paper introduces a novel certification approach, BiCert, using Bilinear Mixed Integer Programming (BMIP) to compute sound deterministic bounds that provide such provable robustness. Using BMIP, we compute the reachable set of parameters that could result from training with potentially manipulated data. A key element to make this computation feasible is to relax the reachable parameter set to a convex set between training iterations. At test time, this parameter set allows us to predict all possible outcomes, guaranteeing robustness. BiCert is more precise than previous methods, which rely solely on interval and polyhedral bounds. Crucially, our approach overcomes the fundamental limitation of prior approaches where parameter bounds could only grow, often uncontrollably. We show that BiCert's tighter bounds eliminate a key source of divergence issues, resulting in more stable training and higher certified accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models for continuous data gained widespread adoption owing to their high quality generation and control mechanisms. However, controllable diffusion on discrete data faces challenges given that continuous guidance methods do not directly apply to discrete diffusion. Here, we provide a straightforward derivation of classifier-free and classifier-based guidance for discrete diffusion, as well as a new class of diffusion models that leverage uniform noise and that are more guidable because they can continuously edit their outputs. We improve the quality of these models with a novel continuous-time variational lower bound that yields state-of-the-art performance, especially in settings involving guidance or fast generation. Empirically, we demonstrate that our guidance mechanisms combined with uniform noise diffusion improve controllable generation relative to autoregressive and diffusion baselines on several discrete data domains, including genomic sequences, small molecule design, and discretized image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehyeon Kim, Taehong Moon, Keon Lee, Jaewoong Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the use of Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) for high-fidelity generation in vector-quantized generative models. This quantization technique maintains higher data fidelity by employing more in-depth tokens. However, increasing the token number in generative models leads to slower inference speeds. To this end, we introduce ResGen, an efficient RVQ-based discrete diffusion model that generates high-fidelity samples without compromising sampling speed. Our key idea is a direct prediction of vector embedding of collective tokens rather than individual ones. Moreover, we demonstrate that our proposed token masking and multi-token prediction method can be formulated within a principled probabilistic framework using a discrete diffusion process and variational inference. We validate the efficacy and generalizability of the proposed method on two challenging tasks across different modalities: conditional image generation} on ImageNet 256x256 and zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that ResGen outperforms autoregressive counterparts in both tasks, delivering superior performance without compromising sampling speed. Furthermore, as we scale the depth of RVQ, our generative models exhibit enhanced generation fidelity or faster sampling speeds compared to similarly sized baseline models.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate confident yet inaccurate responses, introducing significant risks for deployment in safety-critical domains. We present a novel approach to detecting model hallucination through systematic analysis of information flow across model layers when processing inputs with insufficient or ambiguous context. Our investigation reveals that hallucination manifests as usable information deficiencies in inter-layer transmissions. While existing approaches primarily focus on final-layer output analysis, we demonstrate that tracking cross-layer information dynamics ($\mathcal{L}$I) provides robust indicators of model reliability, accounting for both information gain and loss during computation. $\mathcal{L}$I improves model reliability by immediately integrating with universal LLMs without additional training or architectural modifications.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the adversarial robustness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) using Information Bottleneck (IB) objectives for task-oriented communication systems. We empirically demonstrate that while IB-based approaches provide baseline resilience against attacks targeting downstream tasks, the reliance on generative models for task-oriented communication introduces new vulnerabilities. Through extensive experiments on several datasets, we analyze how bottleneck depth and task complexity influence adversarial robustness. Our key findings show that Shallow Variational Bottleneck Injection (SVBI) provides less adversarial robustness compared to Deep Variational Information Bottleneck (DVIB) approaches, with the gap widening for more complex tasks. Additionally, we reveal that IB-based objectives exhibit stronger robustness against attacks focusing on salient pixels with high intensity compared to those perturbing many pixels with lower intensity. Lastly, we demonstrate that task-oriented communication systems that rely on generative models to extract and recover salient information have an increased attack surface. The results highlight important security considerations for next-generation communication systems that leverage neural networks for goal-oriented compression.</p>

<p>Abstract: A myriad of measures to illustrate performance of predictive artificial intelligence (AI) models have been proposed in the literature. Selecting appropriate performance measures is essential for predictive AI models that are developed to be used in medical practice, because poorly performing models may harm patients and lead to increased costs. We aim to assess the merits of classic and contemporary performance measures when validating predictive AI models for use in medical practice. We focus on models with a binary outcome. We discuss 32 performance measures covering five performance domains (discrimination, calibration, overall, classification, and clinical utility) along with accompanying graphical assessments. The first four domains cover statistical performance, the fifth domain covers decision-analytic performance. We explain why two key characteristics are important when selecting which performance measures to assess: (1) whether the measure's expected value is optimized when it is calculated using the correct probabilities (i.e., a "proper" measure), and (2) whether they reflect either purely statistical performance or decision-analytic performance by properly considering misclassification costs. Seventeen measures exhibit both characteristics, fourteen measures exhibited one characteristic, and one measure possessed neither characteristic (the F1 measure). All classification measures (such as classification accuracy and F1) are improper for clinically relevant decision thresholds other than 0.5 or the prevalence. We recommend the following measures and plots as essential to report: AUROC, calibration plot, a clinical utility measure such as net benefit with decision curve analysis, and a plot with probability distributions per outcome category.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting sports viewership is crucial for optimizing ad sales and revenue forecasting. Social media platforms, such as Reddit, provide a wealth of user-generated content that reflects audience engagement and interest. In this study, we propose a regression-based approach to predict sports viewership using social media metrics, including post counts, comments, scores, and sentiment analysis from TextBlob and VADER. Through iterative improvements, such as focusing on major sports subreddits, incorporating categorical features, and handling outliers by sport, the model achieved an $R^2$ of 0.99, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.27 million viewers, and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 2.33 million viewers on the full dataset. These results demonstrate the model's ability to accurately capture patterns in audience behavior, offering significant potential for pre-event revenue forecasting and targeted advertising strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Ruggeri, Gaetano Signorelli</p>
<p>Abstract: A popular end-to-end architecture for selective rationalization is the select-then-predict pipeline, comprising a generator to extract highlights fed to a predictor. Such a cooperative system suffers from suboptimal equilibrium minima due to the dominance of one of the two modules, a phenomenon known as interlocking. While several contributions aimed at addressing interlocking, they only mitigate its effect, often by introducing feature-based heuristics, sampling, and ad-hoc regularizations. We present GenSPP, the first interlocking-free architecture for selective rationalization that does not require any learning overhead, as the above-mentioned. GenSPP avoids interlocking by performing disjoint training of the generator and predictor via genetic global search. Experiments on a synthetic and a real-world benchmark show that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art competitors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicheng Zhu, Brandon Amos, Yuandong Tian, Chuan Guo, Ivan Evtimov</p>
<p>Abstract: Many jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs) rely on a common objective: making the model respond with the prefix "Sure, here is (harmful request)". While straightforward, this objective has two limitations: limited control over model behaviors, often resulting in incomplete or unrealistic responses, and a rigid format that hinders optimization. To address these limitations, we introduce AdvPrefix, a new prefix-forcing objective that enables more nuanced control over model behavior while being easy to optimize. Our objective leverages model-dependent prefixes, automatically selected based on two criteria: high prefilling attack success rates and low negative log-likelihood. It can further simplify optimization by using multiple prefixes for a single user request. AdvPrefix can integrate seamlessly into existing jailbreak attacks to improve their performance for free. For example, simply replacing GCG attack's target prefixes with ours on Llama-3 improves nuanced attack success rates from 14% to 80%, suggesting that current alignment struggles to generalize to unseen prefixes. Our work demonstrates the importance of jailbreak objectives in achieving nuanced jailbreaks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piotr Teterwak, Kate Saenko, Bryan A. Plummer, Ser-Nam Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank adapters enable fine-tuning of large models with only a small number of parameters, thus reducing storage costs and minimizing the risk of catastrophic forgetting. However, they often pose optimization challenges, with poor convergence. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an over-parameterized approach that accelerates training without increasing inference costs. This method reparameterizes low-rank adaptation by employing a separate MLP and learned embedding for each layer. The learned embedding is input to the MLP, which generates the adapter parameters. Such overparamaterization has been shown to implicitly function as an adaptive learning rate and momentum, accelerating optimization. At inference time, the MLP can be discarded, leaving behind a standard low-rank adapter. To study the effect of MLP overparameterization on a small yet difficult proxy task, we implement it for matrix factorization, and find it achieves faster convergence and lower final loss. Extending this approach to larger-scale tasks, we observe consistent performance gains across domains. We achieve improvements in vision-language tasks and especially notable increases in image generation, with CMMD scores improving by up to 15 points.</p>

<p>Abstract: Integrating multiple functionalities into a system poses a fascinating challenge to the field of deep learning. While the precise mechanisms by which the brain encodes and decodes information, and learns diverse skills, remain elusive, memorization undoubtedly plays a pivotal role in this process. In this article, we delve into the implementation and application of an autoencoder-inspired hippocampus network in a multi-functional system. We propose an autoencoder-based memorization method for policy function's parameters. Specifically, the encoder of the autoencoder maps policy function's parameters to a skill vector, while the decoder retrieves the parameters via this skill vector. The policy function is dynamically adjusted tailored to corresponding tasks. Henceforth, a skill vectors graph neural network is employed to represent the homeomorphic topological structure of subtasks and manage subtasks execution.</p>

<p>Abstract: We demonstrate a machine learning (ML) approach that accurately predicts the current-voltage behavior of 3D/2D-structured (FAMA)Pb(IBr)3/OABr hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskite (HOIP) solar cells under AM1.5 illumination. Our neural network algorithm is trained on measured responses from several hundred HOIP solar cells, using three simple optical measurements of constituent HOIP films as input: optical transmission spectrum, spectrally-resolved photoluminescence, and time-resolved photoluminescence, from which we predict the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factors (FF) values of solar cells that contain the HOIP active layers. Determined average prediction accuracies for 95 % of the predicted Voc, Jsc, and FF values are 91%, 94% and 89%, respectively, with R2 coefficients of determination of 0.47, 0.77, and 0.58, respectively. Quantifying the connection between ML predictions and physical parameters extracted from the measured HOIP films optical properties, allows us to identify the most significant parameters influencing the prediction results. With separate ML-classifying algorithms, we identify degraded solar cells using the same optical input data, achieving over 90% classification accuracy through support vector machine, cross entropy loss, and artificial neural network algorithms. To our knowledge, the demonstrated regression and classification work is the first to use ML to predict device photovoltaic properties solely from the optical properties of constituent materials.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing reliance on smartphones for communication, financial transactions, and personal data management has made them prime targets for cyberattacks, particularly smishing, a sophisticated variant of phishing conducted via SMS. Despite the growing threat, traditional detection methods often struggle with the informal and evolving nature of SMS language, which includes abbreviations, slang, and short forms. This paper presents an enhanced content-based smishing detection framework that leverages advanced text normalization techniques to improve detection accuracy. By converting nonstandard text into its standardized form, the proposed model enhances the efficacy of machine learning classifiers, particularly the Naive Bayesian classifier, in distinguishing smishing messages from legitimate ones. Our experimental results, validated on a publicly available dataset, demonstrate a detection accuracy of 96.2%, with a low False Positive Rate of 3.87% and False Negative Rate of 2.85%. This approach significantly outperforms existing methodologies, providing a robust solution to the increasingly sophisticated threat of smishing in the mobile environment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Omnidirectional image super-resolution (ODISR) aims to upscale low-resolution (LR) omnidirectional images (ODIs) to high-resolution (HR), addressing the growing demand for detailed visual content across a $180^{\circ}\times360^{\circ}$ viewport. Existing methods are limited by simple degradation assumptions (e.g., bicubic downsampling), which fail to capture the complex, unknown real-world degradation processes. Recent diffusion-based approaches suffer from slow inference due to their hundreds of sampling steps and frequent pixel-latent space conversions. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose RealOSR, a novel diffusion-based approach for real-world ODISR (Real-ODISR) with single-step diffusion denoising. To sufficiently exploit the input information, RealOSR introduces a lightweight domain alignment module, which facilitates the efficient injection of LR ODI into the single-step latent denoising. Additionally, to better utilize the rich semantic and multi-scale feature modeling ability of denoising UNet, we develop a latent unfolding module that simulates the gradient descent process directly in latent space. Experimental results demonstrate that RealOSR outperforms previous methods in both ODI recovery quality and efficiency. Compared to the recent state-of-the-art diffusion-based ODISR method, OmniSSR, RealOSR achieves significant improvements in visual quality and over \textbf{200$\times$} inference acceleration. Our code and models will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junqi You, Xiaosong Jia, Zhiyuan Zhang, Yutao Zhu, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: For end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD), the evaluation system remains an open problem. Existing closed-loop evaluation protocols usually rely on simulators like CARLA being less realistic; while NAVSIM using real-world vision data, yet is limited to fixed planning trajectories in short horizon and assumes other agents are not reactive.
  We introduce Bench2Drive-R, a generative framework that enables reactive closed-loop evaluation. Unlike existing video generative models for AD, the proposed designs are tailored for interactive simulation, where sensor rendering and behavior rollout are decoupled by applying a separate behavioral controller to simulate the reactions of surrounding agents. As a result, the renderer could focus on image fidelity, control adherence, and spatial-temporal coherence. For temporal consistency, due to the step-wise interaction nature of simulation, we design a noise modulating temporal encoder with Gaussian blurring to encourage long-horizon autoregressive rollout of image sequences without deteriorating distribution shifts. For spatial consistency, a retrieval mechanism, which takes the spatially nearest images as references, is introduced to to ensure scene-level rendering fidelity during the generation process. The spatial relations between target and reference are explicitly modeled with 3D relative position encodings and the potential over-reliance of reference images is mitigated with hierarchical sampling and classifier-free guidance.
  We compare the generation quality of Bench2Drive-R with existing generative models and achieve state-of-the-art performance. We further integrate Bench2Drive-R into nuPlan and evaluate the generative qualities with closed-loop simulation results. We will open source our code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Miao, Harsh Agrawal, Qihang Zhang, Federico Semeraro, Marco Cavallo, Jiatao Gu, Alexander Toshev</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating high-quality 3D content requires models capable of learning robust distributions of complex scenes and the real-world objects within them. Recent Gaussian-based 3D reconstruction techniques have achieved impressive results in recovering high-fidelity 3D assets from sparse input images by predicting 3D Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. However, these techniques often lack the extensive priors and expressiveness offered by Diffusion Models. On the other hand, 2D Diffusion Models, which have been successfully applied to denoise multiview images, show potential for generating a wide range of photorealistic 3D outputs but still fall short on explicit 3D priors and consistency. In this work, we aim to bridge these two approaches by introducing DSplats, a novel method that directly denoises multiview images using Gaussian Splat-based Reconstructors to produce a diverse array of realistic 3D assets. To harness the extensive priors of 2D Diffusion Models, we incorporate a pretrained Latent Diffusion Model into the reconstructor backbone to predict a set of 3D Gaussians. Additionally, the explicit 3D representation embedded in the denoising network provides a strong inductive bias, ensuring geometrically consistent novel view generation. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DSplats not only produces high-quality, spatially consistent outputs, but also sets a new standard in single-image to 3D reconstruction. When evaluated on the Google Scanned Objects dataset, DSplats achieves a PSNR of 20.38, an SSIM of 0.842, and an LPIPS of 0.109.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxime Noizet (Heudiasyc), Philippe Xu (Heudiasyc), Philippe Bonnifait (Heudiasyc)</p>
<p>Abstract: For autonomous navigation, accurate localization with respect to a map is needed. In urban environments, infrastructure such as buildings or bridges cause major difficulties to Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and, despite advances in inertial navigation, it is necessary to support them with other sources of exteroceptive information. In road environments, many common furniture such as traffic signs, traffic lights and street lights take the form of poles. By georeferencing these features in vector maps, they can be used within a localization filter that includes a detection pipeline and a data association method. Poles, having discriminative vertical structures, can be extracted from 3D geometric information using LiDAR sensors. Alternatively, deep neural networks can be employed to detect them from monocular cameras. The lack of depth information induces challenges in associating camera detections with map features. Yet, multi-camera integration provides a cost-efficient solution. This paper quantitatively evaluates the efficacy of these approaches in terms of localization. It introduces a real-time method for camera-based pole detection using a lightweight neural network trained on automatically annotated images. The proposed methods' efficiency is assessed on a challenging sequence with a vector map. The results highlight the high accuracy of the vision-based approach in open road conditions.</p>

Moreover, we extend LMC's applicability to super-quadratic potentials and offer improved convergence rates over existing algorithms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mustafa Cavus, Przemyslaw Biecek</p>
<p>Abstract: The Rashomon effect presents a significant challenge in model selection. It occurs when multiple models achieve similar performance on a dataset but produce different predictions, resulting in predictive multiplicity. This is especially problematic in high-stakes environments, where arbitrary model outcomes can have serious consequences. Traditional model selection methods prioritize accuracy and fail to address this issue. Factors such as class imbalance and irrelevant variables further complicate the situation, making it harder for models to provide trustworthy predictions. Data-centric AI approaches can mitigate these problems by prioritizing data optimization, particularly through preprocessing techniques. However, recent studies suggest preprocessing methods may inadvertently inflate predictive multiplicity. This paper investigates how data preprocessing techniques like balancing and filtering methods impact predictive multiplicity and model stability, considering the complexity of the data. We conduct the experiments on 21 real-world datasets, applying various balancing and filtering techniques, and assess the level of predictive multiplicity introduced by these methods by leveraging the Rashomon effect. Additionally, we examine how filtering techniques reduce redundancy and enhance model generalization. The findings provide insights into the relationship between balancing methods, data complexity, and predictive multiplicity, demonstrating how data-centric AI strategies can improve model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pablo Morales-\'Alvarez, Stergios Christodoulidis, Maria Vakalopoulou, Pablo Piantanida, Jose Dolz</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) represents a paradigm shift in machine learning, with unprecedented results in a broad span of visual recognition tasks. CLIP, one of the most popular VLMs, has exhibited remarkable zero-shot and transfer learning capabilities in classification. To transfer CLIP to downstream tasks, adapters constitute a parameter-efficient approach that avoids backpropagation through the large model (unlike related prompt learning methods). However, CLIP adapters have been developed to target discriminative performance, and the quality of their uncertainty estimates has been overlooked. In this work we show that the discriminative performance of state-of-the-art CLIP adapters does not always correlate with their uncertainty estimation capabilities, which are essential for a safe deployment in real-world scenarios. We also demonstrate that one of such adapters is obtained through MAP inference from a more general probabilistic framework. Based on this observation we introduce BayesAdapter, which leverages Bayesian inference to estimate a full probability distribution instead of a single point, better capturing the variability inherent in the parameter space. In a comprehensive empirical evaluation we show that our approach obtains high quality uncertainty estimates in the predictions, standing out in calibration and selective classification.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johann Schmidt, Frank Dreyer, Sayed Abid Hashimi, Sebastian Stober</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic signal control plays a crucial role in urban mobility. However, existing methods often struggle to generalize beyond their training environments to unseen scenarios with varying traffic dynamics. We present TransferLight, a novel framework designed for robust generalization across road-networks, diverse traffic conditions and intersection geometries. At its core, we propose a log-distance reward function, offering spatially-aware signal prioritization while remaining adaptable to varied lane configurations - overcoming the limitations of traditional pressure-based rewards. Our hierarchical, heterogeneous, and directed graph neural network architecture effectively captures granular traffic dynamics, enabling transferability to arbitrary intersection layouts. Using a decentralized multi-agent approach, global rewards, and novel state transition priors, we develop a single, weight-tied policy that scales zero-shot to any road network without re-training. Through domain randomization during training, we additionally enhance generalization capabilities. Experimental results validate TransferLight's superior performance in unseen scenarios, advancing practical, generalizable intelligent transportation systems to meet evolving urban traffic demands.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Luo, Abhimanyu Kumbara, Mansur Shomali, Rui Han, Anand Iyer, Ritu Agarwal, Gordon Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: While previous studies of AI in diabetes management focus on long-term risk, research on near-future glucose prediction remains limited but important as it enables timely diabetes self-management. Integrating AI with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) holds promise for near-future glucose prediction. However, existing models have limitations in capturing patterns of blood glucose fluctuations and demonstrate poor generalizability. A robust approach is needed to leverage massive CGM data for near-future glucose prediction. We propose large sensor models (LSMs) to capture knowledge in CGM data by modeling patients as sequences of glucose. CGM-LSM is pretrained on 15.96 million glucose records from 592 diabetes patients for near-future glucose prediction. We evaluated CGM-LSM against state-of-the-art methods using the OhioT1DM dataset across various metrics, prediction horizons, and unseen patients. Additionally, we assessed its generalizability across factors like diabetes type, age, gender, and hour of day. CGM-LSM achieved exceptional performance, with an rMSE of 29.81 mg/dL for type 1 diabetes patients and 23.49 mg/dL for type 2 diabetes patients in a two-hour prediction horizon. For the OhioT1DM dataset, CGM-LSM achieved a one-hour rMSE of 15.64 mg/dL, halving the previous best of 31.97 mg/dL. Robustness analyses revealed consistent performance not only for unseen patients and future periods, but also across diabetes type, age, and gender. The model demonstrated adaptability to different hours of day, maintaining accuracy across periods of various activity intensity levels. CGM-LSM represents a transformative step in diabetes management by leveraging pretraining to uncover latent glucose generation patterns in sensor data. Our findings also underscore the broader potential of LSMs to drive innovation across domains involving complex sensor data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiyao Hu, Zhenyu Zhou, Xiaowei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Two types of radio frequency (RF) impairments frequently occur in a cable broadband network: impairments that occur inside a cable network and impairments occur at the edge of the broadband network, i.e., in a subscriber's premise. Differentiating these two types of faults is important, as different faults require different types of technical personnel to repair them. Presently, the cable industry lacks publicly available tools to automatically diagnose the type of fault. In this work, we present TelApart, a fault diagnosis system for cable broadband networks. TelApart uses telemetry data collected by the Proactive Network Maintenance (PNM) infrastructure in cable networks to effectively differentiate the type of fault. Integral to TelApart's design is an unsupervised machine learning model that groups cable devices sharing similar anomalous patterns together. We use metrics derived from an ISP's customer trouble tickets to programmatically tune the model's hyper-parameters so that an ISP can deploy TelApart in various conditions without hand-tuning its hyper-parameters. We also address the data challenge that the telemetry data collected by the PNM system contain numerous missing, duplicated, and unaligned data points. Using real-world data contributed by a cable ISP, we show that TelApart can effectively identify different types of faults.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saptarshi Chakraborty, Peter L. Bartlett</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances have revealed that the rate of convergence of the expected test error in deep supervised learning decays as a function of the intrinsic dimension and not the dimension $d$ of the input space. Existing literature defines this intrinsic dimension as the Minkowski dimension or the manifold dimension of the support of the underlying probability measures, which often results in sub-optimal rates and unrealistic assumptions. In this paper, we consider supervised deep learning when the response given the explanatory variable is distributed according to an exponential family with a $\beta$-H\"older smooth mean function. We consider an entropic notion of the intrinsic data-dimension and demonstrate that with $n$ independent and identically distributed samples, the test error scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(n^{-\frac{2\beta}{2\beta + \bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda)}}\right)$, where $\bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda)$ is the $2\beta$-entropic dimension of $\lambda$, the distribution of the explanatory variables. This improves on the best-known rates. Furthermore, under the assumption of an upper-bounded density of the explanatory variables, we characterize the rate of convergence as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( d^{\frac{2\lfloor\beta\rfloor(\beta + d)}{2\beta + d}}n^{-\frac{2\beta}{2\beta + d}}\right)$, establishing that the dependence on $d$ is not exponential but at most polynomial. We also demonstrate that when the explanatory variable has a lower bounded density, this rate in terms of the number of data samples, is nearly optimal for learning the dependence structure for exponential families.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-video generation enhances content creation but is highly computationally intensive: The computational cost of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) scales quadratically in the number of pixels. This makes minute-length video generation extremely expensive, limiting most existing models to generating videos of only 10-20 seconds length. We propose a Linear-complexity text-to-video Generation (LinGen) framework whose cost scales linearly in the number of pixels. For the first time, LinGen enables high-resolution minute-length video generation on a single GPU without compromising quality. It replaces the computationally-dominant and quadratic-complexity block, self-attention, with a linear-complexity block called MATE, which consists of an MA-branch and a TE-branch. The MA-branch targets short-to-long-range correlations, combining a bidirectional Mamba2 block with our token rearrangement method, Rotary Major Scan, and our review tokens developed for long video generation. The TE-branch is a novel TEmporal Swin Attention block that focuses on temporal correlations between adjacent tokens and medium-range tokens. The MATE block addresses the adjacency preservation issue of Mamba and improves the consistency of generated videos significantly. Experimental results show that LinGen outperforms DiT (with a 75.6% win rate) in video quality with up to 15$\times$ (11.5$\times$) FLOPs (latency) reduction. Furthermore, both automatic metrics and human evaluation demonstrate our LinGen-4B yields comparable video quality to state-of-the-art models (with a 50.5%, 52.1%, 49.1% win rate with respect to Gen-3, LumaLabs, and Kling, respectively). This paves the way to hour-length movie generation and real-time interactive video generation.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in robotic foundation models have enabled the development of generalist policies that can adapt to diverse tasks. While these models show impressive flexibility, their performance heavily depends on the quality of their training data. In this work, we propose Reinforcement Learning Distilled Generalists (RLDG), a method that leverages reinforcement learning to generate high-quality training data for finetuning generalist policies. Through extensive real-world experiments on precise manipulation tasks like connector insertion and assembly, we demonstrate that generalist policies trained with RL-generated data consistently outperform those trained with human demonstrations, achieving up to 40% higher success rates while generalizing better to new tasks. We also provide a detailed analysis that reveals this performance gain stems from both optimized action distributions and improved state coverage. Our results suggest that combining task-specific RL with generalist policy distillation offers a promising approach for developing more capable and efficient robotic manipulation systems that maintain the flexibility of foundation models while achieving the performance of specialized controllers.

<p>Abstract: Large models have shown unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing, image generation, and most recently, time series forecasting. This leads us to ask the question: treating market prices as a time series, can large models be used to predict the market? In this paper, we answer this by evaluating the performance of the latest time series foundation model TimesFM on price prediction. We find that due to the irregular nature of price data, directly applying TimesFM gives unsatisfactory results and propose to fine-tune TimeFM on financial data for the task of price prediction. This is done by continual pre-training of the latest time series foundation model TimesFM on price data containing 100 million time points, spanning a range of financial instruments spanning hourly and daily granularities. The fine-tuned model demonstrates higher price prediction accuracy than the baseline model. We conduct mock trading for our model in various financial markets and show that it outperforms various benchmarks in terms of returns, sharpe ratio, max drawdown and trading cost.</p>

By projecting complex graphs into a lower-dimensional space, these techniques simplify the analysis and processing of large-scale graphs. By transforming graphs into vectors, it simplifies the analysis and processing of large-scale datasets. Several approaches, such as GraphSAGE, Node2Vec, and FastRP, offer efficient methods for generating graph embeddings. By storing embeddings as node properties, it is possible to compare different embedding techniques and evaluate their effectiveness for specific tasks. This flexibilityallows for dynamic updates to embeddings and facilitates experimentation with different approaches. By analyzing these embeddings, one can extract valuable insights into the relationships between nodes and their similarities within the embedding space</p>

Traditional feedback control design that relies on full-order models, such as high-dimensional state-space representations or partial differential equations, fails to meet these requirements due to the delay in the control computation, which requires multiple expensive simulations of the physical system. The computational bottleneck is even more severe when considering parametrized systems, as new strategies have to be determined for every new scenario. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time closed-loop control strategy enhanced by nonlinear non-intrusive Deep Learning-based Reduced Order Models (DL-ROMs). Specifically, in the offline phase, (i) full-order state-control pairs are generated for different scenarios through the adjoint method, (ii) the essential features relevant for control design are extracted from the snapshots through a combination of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and deep autoencoders, and (iii) the low-dimensional policy bridging latent control and state spaces is approximated with a feedforward neural network. After data generation and neural networks training, the optimal control actions are retrieved in real-time for any observed state and scenario. In addition, the dynamics may be approximated through a cheap surrogate model in order to close the loop at the latent level, thus continuously controlling the system in real-time even when full-order state measurements are missing. The effectiveness of the proposed method, in terms of computational speed, accuracy, and robustness against noisy data, is finally assessed on two different high-dimensional optimal transport problems, one of which also involving an underlying fluid flow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Zhang, Fujun Luan, Sai Bi, Jianming Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is widely used in diffusion models but often introduces over-contrast and over-saturation artifacts at higher guidance strengths. We present EP-CFG (Energy-Preserving Classifier-Free Guidance), which addresses these issues by preserving the energy distribution of the conditional prediction during the guidance process. Our method simply rescales the energy of the guided output to match that of the conditional prediction at each denoising step, with an optional robust variant for improved artifact suppression. Through experiments, we show that EP-CFG maintains natural image quality and preserves details across guidance strengths while retaining CFG's semantic alignment benefits, all with minimal computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Albert Lin, Shuang Peng, Somil Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: As learning-based methods for legged robots rapidly grow in popularity, it is important that we can provide safety assurances efficiently across different controllers and environments. Existing works either rely on a priori knowledge of the environment and safety constraints to ensure system safety or provide assurances for a specific locomotion policy. To address these limitations, we propose an observation-conditioned reachability-based (OCR) safety-filter framework. Our key idea is to use an OCR value network (OCR-VN) that predicts the optimal control-theoretic safety value function for new failure regions and dynamic uncertainty during deployment time. Specifically, the OCR-VN facilitates rapid safety adaptation through two key components: a LiDAR-based input that allows the dynamic construction of safe regions in light of new obstacles and a disturbance estimation module that accounts for dynamics uncertainty in the wild. The predicted safety value function is used to construct an adaptive safety filter that overrides the nominal quadruped controller when necessary to maintain safety. Through simulation studies and hardware experiments on a Unitree Go1 quadruped, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can automatically safeguard a wide range of hierarchical quadruped controllers, adapts to novel environments, and is robust to unmodeled dynamics without a priori access to the controllers or environments - hence, "One Filter to Deploy Them All". The experiment videos can be found on the project website.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyuan Chen, Fang Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Noisy matrix completion has attracted significant attention due to its applications in recommendation systems, signal processing and image restoration. Most existing works rely on (weighted) least squares methods under various low-rank constraints. However, minimizing the sum of squared residuals is not always efficient, as it may ignore the potential structural information in the residuals.In this study, we propose a novel residual spectral matching criterion that incorporates not only the numerical but also locational information of residuals. This criterion is the first in noisy matrix completion to adopt the perspective of low-rank perturbation of random matrices and exploit the spectral properties of sparse random matrices. We derive optimal statistical properties by analyzing the spectral properties of sparse random matrices and bounding the effects of low-rank perturbations and partial observations. Additionally, we propose algorithms that efficiently approximate solutions by constructing easily computable pseudo-gradients. The iterative process of the proposed algorithms ensures convergence at a rate consistent with the optimal statistical error bound. Our method and algorithms demonstrate improved numerical performance in both simulated and real data examples, particularly in environments with high noise levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niloy Kumar Kundu, Sarah Kobir, Md. Rayhan Ahmed, Tahmina Aktar, Niloya Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) is crucial for enhancing affective computing and enriching the domain of human-computer interaction. However, the main challenge in SER lies in selecting relevant feature representations from speech signals with lower computational costs. In this paper, we propose a lightweight SER architecture that integrates attention-based local feature blocks (ALFBs) to capture high-level relevant feature vectors from speech signals. We also incorporate a global feature block (GFB) technique to capture sequential, global information and long-term dependencies in speech signals. By aggregating attention-based local and global contextual feature vectors, our model effectively captures the internal correlation between salient features that reflect complex human emotional cues. To evaluate our approach, we extracted four types of spectral features from speech audio samples: mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, mel-spectrogram, root mean square value, and zero-crossing rate. Through a 5-fold cross-validation strategy, we tested the proposed method on five multi-lingual standard benchmark datasets: TESS, RAVDESS, BanglaSER, SUBESCO, and Emo-DB, and obtained a mean accuracy of 99.65%, 94.88%, 98.12%, 97.94%, and 97.19% respectively. The results indicate that our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to most existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper we present our submission for the NorSID Shared Task as part of the 2025 VarDial Workshop (Scherrer et al., 2025), consisting of three tasks: Intent Detection, Slot Filling and Dialect Identification, evaluated using data in different dialects of the Norwegian language. For Intent Detection and Slot Filling, we have fine-tuned a multitask model in a cross-lingual setting, to leverage the xSID dataset available in 17 languages. In the case of Dialect Identification, our final submission consists of a model fine-tuned on the provided development set, which has obtained the highest scores within our experiments. Our final results on the test set show that our models do not drop in performance compared to the development set, likely due to the domain-specificity of the dataset and the similar distribution of both subsets. Finally, we also report an in-depth analysis of the provided datasets and their artifacts, as well as other sets of experiments that have been carried out but did not yield the best results. Additionally, we present an analysis on the reasons why some methods have been more successful than others; mainly the impact of the combination of languages and domain-specificity of the training data on the results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) have enabled robot agents to accomplish complex tasks. Reward Machines (RMs) enhance RL's capability to train policies over extended time horizons by structuring high-level task information. In this work, we introduce a novel LfD approach for learning RMs directly from visual demonstrations of robotic manipulation tasks. Unlike previous methods, our approach requires no predefined propositions or prior knowledge of the underlying sparse reward signals. Instead, it jointly learns the RM structure and identifies key high-level events that drive transitions between RM states. We validate our method on vision-based manipulation tasks, showing that the inferred RM accurately captures task structure and enables an RL agent to effectively learn an optimal policy.</p>

<p>Abstract: The transition to 6G networks promises unprecedented advancements in wireless communication, with increased data rates, ultra-low latency, and enhanced capacity. However, the complexity of managing and optimizing these next-generation networks presents significant challenges. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized various domains by leveraging their sophisticated natural language understanding capabilities. However, the practical application of LLMs in wireless network orchestration and management remains largely unexplored. Existing literature predominantly offers visionary perspectives without concrete implementations, leaving a significant gap in the field. To address this gap, this paper presents NETORCHLLM, a wireless NETwork ORCHestrator LLM framework that uses LLMs to seamlessly orchestrate diverse wireless-specific models from wireless communication communities using their language understanding and generation capabilities. A comprehensive framework is introduced, demonstrating the practical viability of our approach and showcasing how LLMs can be effectively harnessed to optimize dense network operations, manage dynamic environments, and improve overall network performance. NETORCHLLM bridges the theoretical aspirations of prior research with practical, actionable solutions, paving the way for future advancements in integrating generative AI technologies within the wireless communications sector.</p>

<p>Abstract: In our previous work, we introduced CosyVoice, a multilingual speech synthesis model based on supervised discrete speech tokens. By employing progressive semantic decoding with two popular generative models, language models (LMs) and Flow Matching, CosyVoice demonstrated high prosody naturalness, content consistency, and speaker similarity in speech in-context learning. Recently, significant progress has been made in multi-modal large language models (LLMs), where the response latency and real-time factor of speech synthesis play a crucial role in the interactive experience. Therefore, in this report, we present an improved streaming speech synthesis model, CosyVoice 2, which incorporates comprehensive and systematic optimizations. Specifically, we introduce finite-scalar quantization to improve the codebook utilization of speech tokens. For the text-speech LM, we streamline the model architecture to allow direct use of a pre-trained LLM as the backbone. In addition, we develop a chunk-aware causal flow matching model to support various synthesis scenarios, enabling both streaming and non-streaming synthesis within a single model. By training on a large-scale multilingual dataset, CosyVoice 2 achieves human-parity naturalness, minimal response latency, and virtually lossless synthesis quality in the streaming mode.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rasmus Pagh, Lukas Retschmeier, Hao Wu, Hanwen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of privately releasing an approximate minimum spanning tree (MST). Given a graph $G = (V, E, \vec{W})$ where $V$ is a set of $n$ vertices, $E$ is a set of $m$ undirected edges, and $ \vec{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{|E|} $ is an edge-weight vector, our goal is to publish an approximate MST under edge-weight differential privacy, as introduced by Sealfon in PODS 2016, where $V$ and $E$ are considered public and the weight vector is private. Our neighboring relation is $\ell_\infty$-distance on weights: for a sensitivity parameter $\Delta_\infty$, graphs $ G = (V, E, \vec{W}) $ and $ G' = (V, E, \vec{W}') $ are neighboring if $\|\vec{W}-\vec{W}'\|_\infty \leq \Delta_\infty$.
  Existing private MST algorithms face a trade-off, sacrificing either computational efficiency or accuracy. We show that it is possible to get the best of both worlds: With a suitable random perturbation of the input that does not suffice to make the weight vector private, the result of any non-private MST algorithm will be private and achieves a state-of-the-art error guarantee.
  Furthermore, by establishing a connection to Private Top-k Selection [Steinke and Ullman, FOCS '17], we give the first privacy-utility trade-off lower bound for MST under approximate differential privacy, demonstrating that the error magnitude, $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$, is optimal up to logarithmic factors. That is, our approach matches the time complexity of any non-private MST algorithm and at the same time achieves optimal error. We complement our theoretical treatment with experiments that confirm the practicality of our approach.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10136">Can LLMs Convert Graphs to Text-Attributed Graphs?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehong Wang, Sidney Liu, Zheyuan Zhang, Tianyi Ma, Chuxu Zhang, Yanfang Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous data structures found in numerous real-world applications, such as drug discovery, recommender systems, and social network analysis. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool to learn node embeddings through message passing on these structures. However, a significant challenge arises when applying GNNs to multiple graphs with different feature spaces, as existing GNN architectures are not designed for cross-graph feature alignment. To address this, recent approaches introduce text-attributed graphs, where each node is associated with a textual description, enabling the use of a shared textual encoder to project nodes from different graphs into a unified feature space. While promising, this method relies heavily on the availability of text-attributed data, which can be difficult to obtain in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method named Topology-Aware Node description Synthesis (TANS), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically convert existing graphs into text-attributed graphs. The key idea is to integrate topological information with each node's properties, enhancing the LLMs' ability to explain how graph topology influences node semantics. We evaluate our TANS on text-rich, text-limited, and text-free graphs, demonstrating that it enables a single GNN to operate across diverse graphs. Notably, on text-free graphs, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches that manually design node features, showcasing the potential of LLMs for preprocessing graph-structured data, even in the absence of textual information.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Wein, Marco Riebel, Lisa-Marie Brunner, Caroline Nothdurfter, Rainer Rupprecht, Jens V. Schwarzbach</p>
<p>Abstract: Spontaneous neural activity observed in resting-state fMRI is characterized by complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Different measures related to local and global brain connectivity and fluctuations in low-frequency amplitudes can quantify individual aspects of these neural dynamics. Even though such measures are derived from the same functional signals, they are often evaluated separately, neglecting their interrelations and potentially reducing the analysis sensitivity. In our study, we present a fusion searchlight (FuSL) framework to combine the complementary information contained in different resting-state fMRI metrics and demonstrate how this can improve the decoding of brain states. Moreover, we show how explainable AI allows us to reconstruct the differential impact of each metric on the decoding, which additionally increases spatial specificity of searchlight analysis. In general, this framework can be adapted to combine information derived from different imaging modalities or experimental conditions, offering a versatile and interpretable tool for data fusion in neuroimaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daojun Liang, Haixia Zhang, Dongfeng Yuan, Minggao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The number of categories of instances in the real world is normally huge, and each instance may contain multiple labels. To distinguish these massive labels utilizing machine learning, eXtreme Label Classification (XLC) has been established. However, as the number of categories increases, the number of parameters and nonlinear operations in the classifier also rises. This results in a Classifier Computational Overload Problem (CCOP). To address this, we propose a Multi-Head Encoding (MHE) mechanism, which replaces the vanilla classifier with a multi-head classifier. During the training process, MHE decomposes extreme labels into the product of multiple short local labels, with each head trained on these local labels. During testing, the predicted labels can be directly calculated from the local predictions of each head. This reduces the computational load geometrically. Then, according to the characteristics of different XLC tasks, e.g., single-label, multi-label, and model pretraining tasks, three MHE-based implementations, i.e., Multi-Head Product, Multi-Head Cascade, and Multi-Head Sampling, are proposed to more effectively cope with CCOP. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that MHE can achieve performance approximately equivalent to that of the vanilla classifier by generalizing the low-rank approximation problem from Frobenius-norm to Cross-Entropy. Experimental results show that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance while significantly streamlining the training and inference processes of XLC tasks.

Sims is designed to complement existing modeling tools by focusing on feature exploration rather than model creation. We demonstrate the utility of Sims through a case study analyzing simulated maize yield data in Rwanda, where we evaluate how different combinations of soil, weather, and agronomic features affect the clustering of yield response zones.

<p>Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDP) are a well-established model for sequential decision-making in the presence of probabilities. In robust MDP (RMDP), every action is associated with an uncertainty set of probability distributions, modelling that transition probabilities are not known precisely. Based on the known theoretical connection to stochastic games, we provide a framework for solving RMDPs that is generic, reliable, and efficient. It is *generic* both with respect to the model, allowing for a wide range of uncertainty sets, including but not limited to intervals, $L^1$- or $L^2$-balls, and polytopes; and with respect to the objective, including long-run average reward, undiscounted total reward, and stochastic shortest path. It is *reliable*, as our approach not only converges in the limit, but provides precision guarantees at any time during the computation. It is *efficient* because -- in contrast to state-of-the-art approaches -- it avoids explicitly constructing the underlying stochastic game. Consequently, our prototype implementation outperforms existing tools by several orders of magnitude and can solve RMDPs with a million states in under a minute.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arijit Nag, Soumen Chakrabarti, Animesh Mukherjee, Niloy Ganguly</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-source Large Language models (OsLLMs) propel the democratization of natural language research by giving the flexibility to augment or update model parameters for performance improvement. Nevertheless, like proprietary LLMs, Os-LLMs offer poorer performance on low-resource languages (LRLs) than high-resource languages (HRLs), owing to smaller amounts of training data and underrepresented vocabulary. On the other hand, continual pre-training (CPT) with large amounts of language-specific data is a costly proposition in terms of data acquisition and computational resources. Our goal is to drastically reduce CPT cost. To that end, we first develop a new algorithm to select a subset of texts from a larger corpus. We show the effectiveness of our technique using very little CPT data. In search of further improvement, we design a new algorithm to select tokens to include in the LLM vocabulary. We experiment with the recent Llama-3 model and nine Indian languages with diverse scripts and extent of resource availability. For evaluation, we use IndicGenBench, a generation task benchmark dataset for Indic languages. We experiment with various CPT corpora and augmented vocabulary size and offer insights across language families.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a novel, model-free, and data-driven methodology for controlling complex dynamical systems into previously unseen target states, including those with significantly different and complex dynamics. Leveraging a parameter-aware realization of next-generation reservoir computing, our approach accurately predicts system behavior in unobserved parameter regimes, enabling control over transitions to arbitrary target states. Crucially, this includes states with dynamics that differ fundamentally from known regimes, such as shifts from periodic to intermittent or chaotic behavior. The method's parameter-awareness facilitates non-stationary control, ensuring smooth transitions between states. By extending the applicability of machine learning-based control mechanisms to previously inaccessible target dynamics, this methodology opens the door to transformative new applications while maintaining exceptional efficiency. Our results highlight reservoir computing as a powerful alternative to traditional methods for dynamic system control.</p>

We use a pointmap-based geometric representation in a multiview image format to coordinate the generation of multiple target views simultaneously. We facilitate correspondence between views by assuming fixed target camera poses relative to the source camera, and constructing a predictable distribution of geometric features per target. Our modular, geometry-driven approach to novel-view synthesis (called "unPIC") beats SoTA baselines such as CAT3D and One-2-3-45 on held-out objects from ObjaverseXL, as well as real-world objects ranging from Google Scanned Objects, Amazon Berkeley Objects, to the Digital Twin Catalog.</p>

<p>Abstract: Regulatory documents are rich in nuanced terminology and specialized semantics. FRAG systems: Frozen retrieval-augmented generators utilizing pre-trained (or, frozen) components face consequent challenges with both retriever and answering performance. We present a system that adapts the retriever performance to the target domain using a multi-stage tuning (MST) strategy. Our retrieval approach, called MST-R (a) first fine-tunes encoders used in vector stores using hard negative mining, (b) then uses a hybrid retriever, combining sparse and dense retrievers using reciprocal rank fusion, and then (c) adapts the cross-attention encoder by fine-tuning only the top-k retrieved results. We benchmark the system performance on the dataset released for the RIRAG challenge (as part of the RegNLP workshop at COLING 2025). We achieve significant performance gains obtaining a top rank on the RegNLP challenge leaderboard. We also show that a trivial answering approach games the RePASs metric outscoring all baselines and a pre-trained Llama model. Analyzing this anomaly, we present important takeaways for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-context LLMs have enabled numerous downstream applications but also introduced significant challenges related to computational and memory efficiency. To address these challenges, optimizations for long-context inference have been developed, centered around the KV cache. However, existing benchmarks often evaluate in single-request, neglecting the full lifecycle of the KV cache in real-world use. This oversight is particularly critical, as KV cache reuse has become widely adopted in LLMs inference frameworks, such as vLLM and SGLang, as well as by LLM providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic. To address this gap, we introduce SCBench(SharedContextBench), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context methods from a KV cachecentric perspective: 1) KV cache generation, 2) KV cache compression, 3) KV cache retrieval, 4) KV cache loading. Specifically, SCBench uses test examples with shared context, ranging 12 tasks with two shared context modes, covering four categories of long-context capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global information, and multi-task. With it, we provide an extensive KV cache-centric analysis of eight categories long-context solutions, including Gated Linear RNNs, Mamba-Attention hybrids, and efficient methods such as sparse attention, KV cache dropping, quantization, retrieval, loading, and prompt compression. The evaluation is conducted on 8 long-context LLMs. Our findings show that sub-O(n) memory methods suffer in multi-turn scenarios, while sparse encoding with O(n) memory and sub-O(n^2) pre-filling computation perform robustly. Dynamic sparsity yields more expressive KV caches than static patterns, and layer-level sparsity in hybrid architectures reduces memory usage with strong performance. Additionally, we identify attention distribution shift issues in long-generation scenarios. https://aka.ms/SCBench.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents an innovative method for predicting shape errors in 5-axis machining using graph neural networks. The graph structure is defined with nodes representing workpiece surface points and edges denoting the neighboring relationships. The dataset encompasses data from a material removal simulation, process data, and post-machining quality information. Experimental results show that the presented approach can generalize the shape error prediction for the investigated workpiece geometry. Moreover, by modelling spatial and temporal connections within the workpiece, the approach handles a low number of labels compared to non-graphical methods such as Support Vector Machines.</p>

<p>Abstract: As key elements within the central dogma, DNA, RNA, and proteins play crucial roles in maintaining life by guaranteeing accurate genetic expression and implementation. Although research on these molecules has profoundly impacted fields like medicine, agriculture, and industry, the diversity of machine learning approaches-from traditional statistical methods to deep learning models and large language models-poses challenges for researchers in choosing the most suitable models for specific tasks, especially for cross-omics and multi-omics tasks due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To address this, we introduce the first comprehensive multi-omics benchmark COMET (Benchmark for Biological COmprehensive Multi-omics Evaluation Tasks and Language Models), designed to evaluate models across single-omics, cross-omics, and multi-omics tasks. First, we curate and develop a diverse collection of downstream tasks and datasets covering key structural and functional aspects in DNA, RNA, and proteins, including tasks that span multiple omics levels. Then, we evaluate existing foundational language models for DNA, RNA, and proteins, as well as the newly proposed multi-omics method, offering valuable insights into their performance in integrating and analyzing data from different biological modalities. This benchmark aims to define critical issues in multi-omics research and guide future directions, ultimately promoting advancements in understanding biological processes through integrated and different omics data analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Villani, Igor Maljkovic, Dario Lazzaro, Angelo Sotgiu, Antonio Emanuele Cin\`a, Fabio Roli</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., carefully crafted input samples that can cause models to make incorrect predictions with high confidence. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, adversarial training and detection-based defenses have been proposed to strengthen models in advance. However, most of these approaches focus on a single data modality, overlooking the relationships between visual patterns and textual descriptions of the input. In this paper, we propose a novel defense, Multi-Shield, designed to combine and complement these defenses with multi-modal information to further enhance their robustness. Multi-Shield leverages multi-modal large language models to detect adversarial examples and abstain from uncertain classifications when there is no alignment between textual and visual representations of the input. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, using robust and non-robust image classification models, demonstrate that Multi-Shield can be easily integrated to detect and reject adversarial examples, outperforming the original defenses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Janos Lebeda, Lukas Retschmeier</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of releasing a sparse histogram under $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. The stability histogram independently adds noise from a Laplace or Gaussian distribution to the non-zero entries and removes those noisy counts below a threshold.
  Thereby, the introduction of new non-zero values between neighboring histograms is only revealed with probability at most $\delta$, and typically, the value of the threshold dominates the error of the mechanism. We consider the variant of the stability histogram with Gaussian noise.
  Recent works ([Joseph and Yu, COLT '24] and [Lebeda, SOSA '25]) reduced the error for private histograms using correlated Gaussian noise. However, these techniques can not be directly applied in the very sparse setting. Instead, we adopt Lebeda's technique and show that adding correlated noise to the non-zero counts only allows us to reduce the magnitude of noise when we have a sparsity bound. This, in turn, allows us to use a lower threshold by up to a factor of $1/2$ compared to the non-correlated noise mechanism. We then extend our mechanism to a setting without a known bound on sparsity. Additionally, we show that correlated noise can give a similar improvement for the more practical discrete Gaussian mechanism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenzhao Zheng, Junjie Wu, Yao Zheng, Sicheng Zuo, Zixun Xie, Longchao Yang, Yong Pan, Zhihui Hao, Peng Jia, Xianpeng Lang, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-based autonomous driving shows great potential due to its satisfactory performance and low costs. Most existing methods adopt dense representations (e.g., bird's eye view) or sparse representations (e.g., instance boxes) for decision-making, which suffer from the trade-off between comprehensiveness and efficiency. This paper explores a Gaussian-centric end-to-end autonomous driving (GaussianAD) framework and exploits 3D semantic Gaussians to extensively yet sparsely describe the scene. We initialize the scene with uniform 3D Gaussians and use surrounding-view images to progressively refine them to obtain the 3D Gaussian scene representation. We then use sparse convolutions to efficiently perform 3D perception (e.g., 3D detection, semantic map construction). We predict 3D flows for the Gaussians with dynamic semantics and plan the ego trajectory accordingly with an objective of future scene forecasting. Our GaussianAD can be trained in an end-to-end manner with optional perception labels when available. Extensive experiments on the widely used nuScenes dataset verify the effectiveness of our end-to-end GaussianAD on various tasks including motion planning, 3D occupancy prediction, and 4D occupancy forecasting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicheng Zuo, Wenzhao Zheng, Yuanhui Huang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is important for autonomous driving due to its comprehensive perception of the surroundings. To incorporate sequential inputs, most existing methods fuse representations from previous frames to infer the current 3D occupancy. However, they fail to consider the continuity of driving scenarios and ignore the strong prior provided by the evolution of 3D scenes (e.g., only dynamic objects move). In this paper, we propose a world-model-based framework to exploit the scene evolution for perception. We reformulate 3D occupancy prediction as a 4D occupancy forecasting problem conditioned on the current sensor input. We decompose the scene evolution into three factors: 1) ego motion alignment of static scenes; 2) local movements of dynamic objects; and 3) completion of newly-observed scenes. We then employ a Gaussian world model (GaussianWorld) to explicitly exploit these priors and infer the scene evolution in the 3D Gaussian space considering the current RGB observation. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework on the widely used nuScenes dataset. Our GaussianWorld improves the performance of the single-frame counterpart by over 2% in mIoU without introducing additional computations. Code: https://github.com/zuosc19/GaussianWorld.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider a general and realistic scenario involving non-stationary time series, consisting of several offline intervals with different distributions within a fixed offline time horizon, and an online interval that continuously receives new samples. For non-stationary time series, the data distribution in the current online interval may have appeared in previous offline intervals. We theoretically explore the feasibility of applying knowledge from offline intervals to the current online interval. To this end, we propose the Mixture of Online and Offline Experts (MOOE). MOOE learns static offline experts from offline intervals and maintains a dynamic online expert for the current online interval. It then adaptively combines the offline and online experts using a meta expert to make predictions for the samples received in the online interval. Specifically, we focus on theoretical analysis, deriving parameter convergence, regret bounds, and generalization error bounds to prove the effectiveness of the algorithm.</p>

While recent efforts have proved their compression capabilities, to date, their interpretability properties have not been fully assessed. Here, we conduct a systematic and principled study towards assessing the interpretability of these types of networks. Moreover, we pay special attention towards analyzing the level to which part-whole relationships are indeed encoded within the learned representation. Our analysis in the MNIST, SVHN, PASCAL-part and CelebA datasets suggest that the representations encoded in CapsNets might not be as disentangled nor strictly related to parts-whole relationships as is commonly stated in the literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shitong Shao, Xu Dai, Lujun Li, Huanran Chen, Yang Hu, Shouyi Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Probability Models (DPMs) have made impressive advancements in various machine learning domains. However, achieving high-quality synthetic samples typically involves performing a large number of sampling steps, which impedes the possibility of real-time sample synthesis. Traditional accelerated sampling algorithms via knowledge distillation rely on pre-trained model weights and discrete time step scenarios, necessitating additional training sessions to achieve their goals. To address these issues, we propose the Catch-Up Distillation (CUD), which encourages the current moment output of the velocity estimation model ``catch up'' with its previous moment output. Specifically, CUD adjusts the original Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) training objective to align the current moment output with both the ground truth label and the previous moment output, utilizing Runge-Kutta-based multi-step alignment distillation for precise ODE estimation while preventing asynchronous updates. Furthermore, we investigate the design space for CUDs under continuous time-step scenarios and analyze how to determine the suitable strategies. To demonstrate CUD's effectiveness, we conduct thorough ablation and comparison experiments on CIFAR-10, MNIST, and ImageNet-64. On CIFAR-10, we obtain a FID of 2.80 by sampling in 15 steps under one-session training and the new state-of-the-art FID of 3.37 by sampling in one step with additional training. This latter result necessitated only 620k iterations with a batch size of 128, in contrast to Consistency Distillation, which demanded 2100k iterations with a larger batch size of 256.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dun Zeng, Zenglin Xu, Shiyu Liu, Yu Pan, Qifan Wang, Xiaoying Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated averaging (FedAvg) is the most fundamental algorithm in Federated learning (FL). Previous theoretical results assert that FedAvg convergence and generalization degenerate under heterogeneous clients. However, recent empirical results show that FedAvg can perform well in many real-world heterogeneous tasks. These results reveal an inconsistency between FL theory and practice that is not fully explained. In this paper, we show that common heterogeneity measures contribute to this inconsistency based on rigorous convergence analysis. Furthermore, we introduce a new measure \textit{client consensus dynamics} and prove that \textit{FedAvg can effectively handle client heterogeneity when an appropriate aggregation strategy is used}. Building on this theoretical insight, we present a simple and effective FedAvg variant termed FedAWARE. Extensive experiments on three datasets and two modern neural network architectures demonstrate that FedAWARE ensures faster convergence and better generalization in heterogeneous client settings. Moreover, our results show that FedAWARE can significantly enhance the generalization performance of advanced FL algorithms when used as a plug-in module.</p>

<p>Abstract: A key strategy in societal adaptation to climate change is using alert systems to prompt preventative action and reduce the adverse health impacts of extreme heat events. This paper implements and evaluates reinforcement learning (RL) as a tool to optimize the effectiveness of such systems. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce a new publicly available RL environment enabling the evaluation of the effectiveness of heat alert policies to reduce heat-related hospitalizations. The rewards model is trained from a comprehensive dataset of historical weather, Medicare health records, and socioeconomic/geographic features. We use scalable Bayesian techniques tailored to the low-signal effects and spatial heterogeneity present in the data. The transition model uses real historical weather patterns enriched by a data augmentation mechanism based on climate region similarity. Second, we use this environment to evaluate standard RL algorithms in the context of heat alert issuance. Our analysis shows that policy constraints are needed to improve RL's initially poor performance. Third, a post-hoc contrastive analysis provides insight into scenarios where our modified heat alert-RL policies yield significant gains/losses over the current National Weather Service alert policy in the United States.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Puja Trivedi, Mark Heimann, Rushil Anirudh, Danai Koutra, Jayaraman J. Thiagarajan</p>
<p>Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for node and graph representation learning tasks, the reliability of GNN uncertainty estimates under distribution shifts remains relatively under-explored. Indeed, while post-hoc calibration strategies can be used to improve in-distribution calibration, they need not also improve calibration under distribution shift. However, techniques which produce GNNs with better intrinsic uncertainty estimates are particularly valuable, as they can always be combined with post-hoc strategies later. Therefore, in this work, we propose G-$\Delta$UQ, a novel training framework designed to improve intrinsic GNN uncertainty estimates. Our framework adapts the principle of stochastic data centering to graph data through novel graph anchoring strategies, and is able to support partially stochastic GNNs. While, the prevalent wisdom is that fully stochastic networks are necessary to obtain reliable estimates, we find that the functional diversity induced by our anchoring strategies when sampling hypotheses renders this unnecessary and allows us to support G-$\Delta$UQ on pretrained models. Indeed, through extensive evaluation under covariate, concept and graph size shifts, we show that G-$\Delta$UQ leads to better calibrated GNNs for node and graph classification. Further, it also improves performance on the uncertainty-based tasks of out-of-distribution detection and generalization gap estimation. Overall, our work provides insights into uncertainty estimation for GNNs, and demonstrates the utility of G-$\Delta$UQ in obtaining reliable estimates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ghadeer O. Ghosheh, Jin Li, Tingting Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic Health Records present a valuable modality for driving personalized medicine, where treatment is tailored to fit individual-level differences. For this purpose, many data-driven machine learning and statistical models rely on the wealth of longitudinal EHRs to study patients' physiological and treatment effects. However, longitudinal EHRs tend to be sparse and highly missing, where missingness could also be informative and reflect the underlying patient's health status. Therefore, the success of data-driven models for personalized medicine highly depends on how the EHR data is represented from physiological data, treatments, and the missing values in the data. To this end, we propose a novel deep-learning model that learns the underlying patient dynamics over time across multivariate data to generate personalized realistic values conditioning on an individual's demographic characteristics and treatments. Our proposed model, IGNITE (Individualized GeNeration of Imputations in Time-series Electronic health records), utilises a conditional dual-variational autoencoder augmented with dual-stage attention to generate missing values for an individual. In IGNITE, we further propose a novel individualized missingness mask (IMM), which helps our model generate values based on the individual's observed data and missingness patterns. We further extend the use of IGNITE from imputing missingness to a personalized data synthesizer, where it generates missing EHRs that were never observed prior or even generates new patients for various applications. We validate our model on three large publicly available datasets and show that IGNITE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in missing data reconstruction and task prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: In Imitation Learning (IL), utilizing suboptimal and heterogeneous demonstrations presents a substantial challenge due to the varied nature of real-world data. However, standard IL algorithms consider these datasets as homogeneous, thereby inheriting the deficiencies of suboptimal demonstrators. Previous approaches to this issue rely on impractical assumptions like high-quality data subsets, confidence rankings, or explicit environmental knowledge. This paper introduces IRLEED, Inverse Reinforcement Learning by Estimating Expertise of Demonstrators, a novel framework that overcomes these hurdles without prior knowledge of demonstrator expertise. IRLEED enhances existing Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) algorithms by combining a general model for demonstrator suboptimality to address reward bias and action variance, with a Maximum Entropy IRL framework to efficiently derive the optimal policy from diverse, suboptimal demonstrations. Experiments in both online and offline IL settings, with simulated and human-generated data, demonstrate IRLEED's adaptability and effectiveness, making it a versatile solution for learning from suboptimal demonstrations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel formalism for describing Structural Causal Models (SCMs) as fixed-point problems on causally ordered variables, eliminating the need for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and establish the weakest known conditions for their unique recovery given the topological ordering (TO). Based on this, we design a two-stage causal generative model that first infers in a zero-shot manner a valid TO from observations, and then learns the generative SCM on the ordered variables. To infer TOs, we propose to amortize the learning of TOs on synthetically generated datasets by sequentially predicting the leaves of graphs seen during training. To learn SCMs, we design a transformer-based architecture that exploits a new attention mechanism enabling the modeling of causal structures, and show that this parameterization is consistent with our formalism. Finally, we conduct an extensive evaluation of each method individually, and show that when combined, our model outperforms various baselines on generated out-of-distribution problems.

<p>Abstract: In this article, we present a resource-efficient approach for electrocardiogram (ECG) based heartbeat classification using multi-feature fusion and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). The dataset comprises five original classes from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database: Normal (N), Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB), Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC), and Paced Beat (PB). Preprocessing methods including the discrete wavelet transform and dual moving average windows are used to reduce noise and artifacts in the raw ECG signal, and extract the main points (PQRST) of the ECG waveform. Multi-feature fusion is achieved by utilizing time intervals and the proposed under-the-curve areas, which are inherently robust against noise, as input features. Simulations demonstrated that incorporating under-the-curve area features improved the classification accuracy for the challenging RBBB and LBBB classes from 31.4\% to 84.3\% for RBBB, and from 69.6\% to 87.0\% for LBBB. Using a Bi-LSTM network, rather than a conventional LSTM network, resulted in higher accuracy (33.8\% vs 21.8\%) with a 28\% reduction in required network parameters for the RBBB class. Multiple neural network models with varying parameter sizes, including tiny (84k), small (150k), medium (478k), and large (1.25M) models, are developed to achieve high accuracy \textit{across all classes}, a more crucial and challenging goal than overall classification accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Heterogeneous data from multiple populations, sub-groups, or sources is often represented as a ``mixture model'' with a single latent class influencing all of the observed covariates. Heterogeneity can be resolved at multiple levels by grouping populations according to different notions of similarity. This paper proposes grouping with respect to the causal response of an intervention or perturbation on the system. This definition is distinct from previous notions, such as similar covariate values (e.g. clustering) or similar correlations between covariates (e.g. Gaussian mixture models). To solve the problem, we ``synthetically sample'' from a counterfactual distribution using higher-order multi-linear moments of the observable data. To understand how these ``causal mixtures'' fit in with more classical notions, we develop a hierarchy of mixture identifiability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Jiang, Sifan Yang, Wenhao Yang, Lijun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Sign stochastic gradient descent (signSGD) is a communication-efficient method that transmits only the sign of stochastic gradients for parameter updating. Existing literature has demonstrated that signSGD can achieve a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}T^{-1/4})$, where $d$ represents the dimension and $T$ is the iteration number. In this paper, we improve this convergence rate to $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}T^{-1/3})$ by introducing the Sign-based Stochastic Variance Reduction (SSVR) method, which employs variance reduction estimators to track gradients and leverages their signs to update. For finite-sum problems, our method can be further enhanced to achieve a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(m^{1/4}d^{1/2}T^{-1/2})$, where $m$ denotes the number of component functions. Furthermore, we investigate the heterogeneous majority vote in distributed settings and introduce two novel algorithms that attain improved convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}T^{-1/2} + dn^{-1/2})$ and $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/4}T^{-1/4})$ respectively, outperforming the previous results of $\mathcal{O}(dT^{-1/4} + dn^{-1/2})$ and $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/8}T^{-1/8})$, where $n$ represents the number of nodes. Numerical experiments across different tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wyatt Mackey, Ioannis Schizas, Jared Deighton, David L. Boothe, Jr., Vasileios Maroulas</p>
<p>Abstract: A common technique for ameliorating the computational costs of running large neural models is sparsification, or the pruning of neural connections during training. Sparse models are capable of maintaining the high accuracy of state of the art models, while functioning at the cost of more parsimonious models. The structures which underlie sparse architectures are, however, poorly understood and not consistent between differently trained models and sparsification schemes. In this paper, we propose a new technique for sparsification of recurrent neural nets (RNNs), called moduli regularization, in combination with magnitude pruning. Moduli regularization leverages the dynamical system induced by the recurrent structure to induce a geometric relationship between neurons in the hidden state of the RNN. By making our regularizing term explicitly geometric, we provide the first, to our knowledge, a priori description of the desired sparse architecture of our neural net, as well as explicit end-to-end learning of RNN geometry. We verify the effectiveness of our scheme under diverse conditions, testing in navigation, natural language processing, and addition RNNs. Navigation is a structurally geometric task, for which there are known moduli spaces, and we show that regularization can be used to reach 90% sparsity while maintaining model performance only when coefficients are chosen in accordance with a suitable moduli space. Natural language processing and addition, however, have no known moduli space in which computations are performed. Nevertheless, we show that moduli regularization induces more stable recurrent neural nets, and achieves high fidelity models above 90% sparsity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roman Bresson, Giannis Nikolentzos, George Panagopoulos, Michail Chatzianastasis, Jun Pang, Michalis Vazirgiannis</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto tool for learning node and graph representations. Most GNNs typically consist of a sequence of neighborhood aggregation (a.k.a., message-passing) layers, within which the representation of each node is updated based on those of its neighbors. The most expressive message-passing GNNs can be obtained through the use of the sum aggregator and of MLPs for feature transformation, thanks to their universal approximation capabilities. However, the limitations of MLPs recently motivated the introduction of another family of universal approximators, called Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) which rely on a different representation theorem. In this work, we compare the performance of KANs against that of MLPs on graph learning tasks. We evaluate two different implementations of KANs using two distinct base families of functions, namely B-splines and radial basis functions. We perform extensive experiments on node classification, graph classification and graph regression datasets. Our results indicate that KANs are on-par with or better than MLPs on all studied tasks, making them viable alternatives, at the cost of some computational complexity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felipe Machado Schwanck, Marcos Tomazzoli Leipnitz, Joel Lu\'is Carbonera, Juliano Araujo Wickboldt</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm in which many clients cooperatively train a single centralized model while keeping their data private and decentralized. FL is commonly used in edge computing, which involves placing computer workloads (both hardware and software) as close as possible to the edge, where the data is being created and where actions are occurring, enabling faster response times, greater data privacy, and reduced data transfer costs. However, due to the heterogeneous data distributions/contents of clients, it is non-trivial to accurately evaluate the contributions of local models in global centralized model aggregation. This is an example of a major challenge in FL, commonly known as data imbalance or class imbalance. In general, testing and assessing FL algorithms can be a very difficult and complex task due to the distributed nature of the systems. In this work, a framework is proposed and implemented to assess FL algorithms in a more easy and scalable way. This framework is evaluated over a distributed edge-like environment managed by a container orchestration platform (i.e. Kubernetes).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haohao Qu, Liangbo Ning, Rui An, Wenqi Fan, Tyler Derr, Hui Liu, Xin Xu, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: As one of the most representative DL techniques, Transformer architecture has empowered numerous advanced models, especially the large language models (LLMs) that comprise billions of parameters, becoming a cornerstone in deep learning. Despite the impressive achievements, Transformers still face inherent limitations, particularly the time-consuming inference resulting from the quadratic computation complexity of attention calculation. Recently, a novel architecture named Mamba, drawing inspiration from classical state space models (SSMs), has emerged as a promising alternative for building foundation models, delivering comparable modeling abilities to Transformers while preserving near-linear scalability concerning sequence length. This has sparked an increasing number of studies actively exploring Mamba's potential to achieve impressive performance across diverse domains. Given such rapid evolution, there is a critical need for a systematic review that consolidates existing Mamba-empowered models, offering a comprehensive understanding of this emerging model architecture. In this survey, we therefore conduct an in-depth investigation of recent Mamba-associated studies, covering three main aspects: the advancements of Mamba-based models, the techniques of adapting Mamba to diverse data, and the applications where Mamba can excel. Specifically, we first review the foundational knowledge of various representative deep learning models and the details of Mamba-1&2 as preliminaries. Then, to showcase the significance of Mamba for AI, we comprehensively review the related studies focusing on Mamba models' architecture design, data adaptability, and applications. Finally, we present a discussion of current limitations and explore various promising research directions to provide deeper insights for future investigations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony GX-Chen, Kenneth Marino, Rob Fergus</p>
<p>Abstract: In the face of difficult exploration problems in reinforcement learning, we study whether giving an agent an object-centric mapping (describing a set of items and their attributes) allow for more efficient learning. We found this problem is best solved hierarchically by modelling items at a higher level of state abstraction to pixels, and attribute change at a higher level of temporal abstraction to primitive actions. This abstraction simplifies the transition dynamic by making specific future states easier to predict. We make use of this to propose a fully model-based algorithm that learns a discriminative world model, plans to explore efficiently with only a count-based intrinsic reward, and can subsequently plan to reach any discovered (abstract) states.
  We demonstrate the model's ability to (i) efficiently solve single tasks, (ii) transfer zero-shot and few-shot across item types and environments, and (iii) plan across long horizons. Across a suite of 2D crafting and MiniHack environments, we empirically show our model significantly out-performs state-of-the-art low-level methods (without abstraction), as well as performant model-free and model-based methods using the same abstraction. Finally, we show how to learn low level object-perturbing policies via reinforcement learning, and the object mapping itself by supervised learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dorian Gailhard, Enzo Tartaglione, Lirida Naviner, Jhony H. Giraldo</p>
<p>Abstract: Hypergraphs are powerful mathematical structures that can model complex, high-order relationships in various domains, including social networks, bioinformatics, and recommender systems. However, generating realistic and diverse hypergraphs remains challenging due to their inherent complexity and lack of effective generative models. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion-based Hypergraph Generation (HYGENE) method that addresses these challenges through a progressive local expansion approach. HYGENE works on the bipartite representation of hypergraphs, starting with a single pair of connected nodes and iteratively expanding it to form the target hypergraph. At each step, nodes and hyperedges are added in a localized manner using a denoising diffusion process, which allows for the construction of the global structure before refining local details. Our experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of HYGENE, proving its ability to closely mimic a variety of properties in hypergraphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to employ deep learning models for hypergraph generation, and our work aims to lay the groundwork for future research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengfei Shi, Wei Zhong, Xinyu Zhang, Ningtao Wang, Xing Fu, Weiqiang Wang, Yin Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating the conditional average treatment effects (CATE) is very important in causal inference and has a wide range of applications across many fields. In the estimation process of CATE, the unconfoundedness assumption is typically required to ensure the identifiability of the regression problems. When estimating CATE using high-dimensional data, there have been many variable selection methods and neural network approaches based on representation learning, while these methods do not provide a way to verify whether the subset of variables after dimensionality reduction or the learned representations still satisfy the unconfoundedness assumption during the estimation process, which can lead to ineffective estimates of the treatment effects. Additionally, these methods typically use data from only the treatment or control group when estimating the regression functions for each group. This paper proposes a novel neural network approach named \textbf{CrossNet} to learn a sufficient representation for the features, based on which we then estimate the CATE, where cross indicates that in estimating the regression functions, we used data from their own group as well as cross-utilized data from another group. Numerical simulations and empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms the competitive approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manshan Guo, Bhavin Choksi, Sari Sadiya, Alessandro T. Gifford, Martina G. Vilas, Radoslaw M. Cichy, Gemma Roig</p>
<p>Abstract: In contrast to human vision, artificial neural networks (ANNs) remain relatively susceptible to adversarial attacks. To address this vulnerability, efforts have been made to transfer inductive bias from human brains to ANNs, often by training the ANN representations to match their biological counterparts. Previous works relied on brain data acquired in rodents or primates using invasive techniques, from specific regions of the brain, under non-natural conditions (anesthetized animals), and with stimulus datasets lacking diversity and naturalness. In this work, we explored whether aligning model representations to human EEG responses to a rich set of real-world images increases robustness to ANNs. Specifically, we trained ResNet50-backbone models on a dual task of classification and EEG prediction; and evaluated their EEG prediction accuracy and robustness to adversarial attacks. We observed significant correlation between the networks' EEG prediction accuracy, often highest around 100 ms post stimulus onset, and their gains in adversarial robustness. Although effect size was limited, effects were consistent across different random initializations and robust for architectural variants. We further teased apart the data from individual EEG channels and observed strongest contribution from electrodes in the parieto-occipital regions. The demonstrated utility of human EEG for such tasks opens up avenues for future efforts that scale to larger datasets under diverse stimuli conditions with the promise of stronger effects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chufan Gao, Mandis Beigi, Afrah Shafquat, Jacob Aptekar, Jimeng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Analyzing data from past clinical trials is part of the ongoing effort to optimize the design, implementation, and execution of new clinical trials and more efficiently bring life-saving interventions to market. While there have been recent advances in the generation of static context synthetic clinical trial data, due to both limited patient availability and constraints imposed by patient privacy needs, the generation of fine-grained synthetic time-sequential clinical trial data has been challenging. Given that patient trajectories over an entire clinical trial are of high importance for optimizing trial design and efforts to prevent harmful adverse events, there is a significant need for the generation of high-fidelity time-sequence clinical trial data. Here we introduce TrialSynth, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) designed to address the specific challenges of generating synthetic time-sequence clinical trial data. Distinct from related clinical data VAE methods, the core of our method leverages Hawkes Processes (HP), which are particularly well-suited for modeling event-type and time gap prediction needed to capture the structure of sequential clinical trial data. Our experiments demonstrate that TrialSynth surpasses the performance of other comparable methods that can generate sequential clinical trial data at varying levels of fidelity / privacy tradeoff, enabling the generation of highly accurate event sequences across multiple real-world sequential event datasets with small patient source populations. Notably, our empirical findings highlight that TrialSynth not only outperforms existing clinical sequence-generating methods but also produces data with superior utility while empirically preserving patient privacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sedjro Salomon Hotegni, Sebastian Peitz</p>
<p>Abstract: Extensive research has shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to slight adversarial perturbations$-$small changes to the input data that appear insignificant but cause the model to produce drastically different outputs. In addition to augmenting training data with adversarial examples generated from a specific attack method, most of the current defense strategies necessitate modifying the original model architecture components to improve robustness or performing test-time data purification to handle adversarial attacks. In this work, we demonstrate that strong feature representation learning during training can significantly enhance the original model's robustness. We propose MOREL, a multi-objective feature representation learning approach, encouraging classification models to produce similar features for inputs within the same class, despite perturbations. Our training method involves an embedding space where cosine similarity loss and multi-positive contrastive loss are used to align natural and adversarial features from the model encoder and ensure tight clustering. Concurrently, the classifier is motivated to achieve accurate predictions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of DNNs against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks, outperforming other methods that similarly require no architectural changes or test-time data purification.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Spencer Frei, Gal Vardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have the capacity to act as supervised learning algorithms: by properly encoding a set of labeled training ("in-context") examples and an unlabeled test example into an input sequence of vectors of the same dimension, the forward pass of the transformer can produce predictions for that unlabeled test example. A line of recent work has shown that when linear transformers are pre-trained on random instances for linear regression tasks, these trained transformers make predictions using an algorithm similar to that of ordinary least squares. In this work, we investigate the behavior of linear transformers trained on random linear classification tasks. Via an analysis of the implicit regularization of gradient descent, we characterize how many pre-training tasks and in-context examples are needed for the trained transformer to generalize well at test-time. We further show that in some settings, these trained transformers can exhibit "benign overfitting in-context": when in-context examples are corrupted by label flipping noise, the transformer memorizes all of its in-context examples (including those with noisy labels) yet still generalizes near-optimally for clean test examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sayan Biswas, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Rishi Sharma, Thibaud Trinca, Martijn de Vos</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized learning (DL) is an emerging approach that enables nodes to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing raw data. In many application domains, such as healthcare, this approach faces challenges due to the high level of heterogeneity in the training data's feature space. Such feature heterogeneity lowers model utility and negatively impacts fairness, particularly for nodes with under-represented training data. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{Facade}, a clustering-based DL algorithm specifically designed for fair model training when the training data exhibits several distinct features. The challenge of \textsc{Facade} is to assign nodes to clusters, one for each feature, based on the similarity in the features of their local data, without requiring individual nodes to know apriori which cluster they belong to. \textsc{Facade} (1) dynamically assigns nodes to their appropriate clusters over time, and (2) enables nodes to collaboratively train a specialized model for each cluster in a fully decentralized manner. We theoretically prove the convergence of \textsc{Facade}, implement our algorithm, and compare it against three state-of-the-art baselines. Our experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of model accuracy and fairness compared to all three competitors. Compared to the best-performing baseline, \textsc{Facade} on the CIFAR-10 dataset also reduces communication costs by 32.3\% to reach a target accuracy when cluster sizes are imbalanced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruinan Jin, Xiao Li, Yaoliang Yu, Baoxiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) is a cornerstone optimization algorithm in deep learning, widely recognized for its flexibility with adaptive learning rates and efficiency in handling large-scale data. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical understanding of Adam's convergence has been constrained by stringent assumptions, such as almost surely bounded stochastic gradients or uniformly bounded gradients, which are more restrictive than those typically required for analyzing stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
  In this paper, we introduce a novel and comprehensive framework for analyzing the convergence properties of Adam. This framework offers a versatile approach to establishing Adam's convergence. Specifically, we prove that Adam achieves asymptotic (last iterate sense) convergence in both the almost sure sense and the \(L_1\) sense under the relaxed assumptions typically used for SGD, namely \(L\)-smoothness and the ABC inequality. Meanwhile, under the same assumptions, we show that Adam attains non-asymptotic sample complexity bounds similar to those of SGD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunpeng Xu, Lifei Chen, Shengrui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic concepts in time series are crucial for understanding complex systems such as financial markets, healthcare, and online activity logs. These concepts help reveal structures and behaviors in sequential data for better decision-making and forecasting. However, existing models often struggle to detect and track concept drift due to limitations in interpretability and adaptability. To address this challenge, inspired by the flexibility of the recent Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), we propose WormKAN, a concept-aware KAN-based model to address concept drift in co-evolving time series. WormKAN consists of three key components: Patch Normalization, Temporal Representation Module, and Concept Dynamics. Patch normalization processes co-evolving time series into patches, treating them as fundamental modeling units to capture local dependencies while ensuring consistent scaling. The temporal representation module learns robust latent representations by leveraging a KAN-based autoencoder, complemented by a smoothness constraint, to uncover inter-patch correlations. Concept dynamics identifies and tracks dynamic transitions, revealing structural shifts in the time series through concept identification and drift detection. These transitions, akin to passing through a \textit{wormhole}, are identified by abrupt changes in the latent space. Experiments show that KAN and KAN-based models (WormKAN) effectively segment time series into meaningful concepts, enhancing the identification and tracking of concept drift.</p>

Furthermore, we extend this initialization to low-rank adapters (LoRA) commonly used for finetuning foundation models. Our approach, NoRA, i.e., LoRA with Nystrom initialization, demonstrates superior performance across various downstream tasks and model scales, from 1B to 7B parameters, in large language and diffusion models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time-to-event analysis provides insights into clinical prognosis and treatment recommendations. However, this task is more challenging than standard regression problems due to the presence of censored observations. Additionally, the lack of confidence assessment, model robustness, and prediction calibration raises concerns about the reliability of predictions. To address these challenges, we propose an evidential regression model specifically designed for time-to-event prediction. The proposed model quantifies both epistemic and aleatory uncertainties using Gaussian Random Fuzzy Numbers and belief functions, providing clinicians with uncertainty-aware survival time predictions. The model is trained by minimizing a generalized negative log-likelihood function accounting for data censoring. Experimental evaluations using simulated datasets with different data distributions and censoring conditions, as well as real-world datasets across diverse clinical applications, demonstrate that our model delivers both accurate and reliable performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the potential of our approach for enhancing clinical decision-making in survival analysis.</p>

However, solving such reasoning problems often involves hypothesizing and reflecting over complex multi-body interactions under the effect of a multitude of physical forces and thus learning all such interactions poses a significant hurdle for state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks, including large language models (LLMs). To study this problem, we propose a new physical reasoning task and a dataset, dubbed TraySim. Our task involves predicting the dynamics of several objects on a tray that is given an external impact -- the domino effect of the ensued object interactions and their dynamics thus offering a challenging yet controlled setup, with the goal of reasoning being to infer the stability of the objects after the impact. To solve this complex physical reasoning task, we present LLMPhy, a zero-shot black-box optimization framework that leverages the physics knowledge and program synthesis abilities of LLMs, and synergizes these abilities with the world models built into modern physics engines. Specifically, LLMPhy uses an LLM to generate code to iteratively estimate the physical hyperparameters of the system (friction, damping, layout, etc.) via an implicit analysis-by-synthesis approach using a (non-differentiable) simulator in the loop and uses the inferred parameters to imagine the dynamics of the scene towards solving the reasoning task. To show the effectiveness of LLMPhy, we present experiments on our TraySim dataset to predict the steady-state poses of the objects. Our results show that the combination of the LLM and the physics engine leads to state-of-the-art zero-shot physical reasoning performance, while demonstrating superior convergence against standard black-box optimization methods and better estimation of the physical parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Wang, Rui Sun, Elizabeth Lui, Vatsal Shah, Xihan Xiong, Jiahao Sun, Davide Crapis, William Knottenbelt</p>
<p>Abstract: The centralization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses significant challenges, including single points of failure, inherent biases, data privacy concerns, and scalability issues. These problems are especially prevalent in closed-source large language models (LLMs), where user data is collected and used without transparency. To mitigate these issues, blockchain-based decentralized AI (DeAI) has emerged as a promising solution. DeAI combines the strengths of both blockchain and AI technologies to enhance the transparency, security, decentralization, and trustworthiness of AI systems. However, a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art DeAI development, particularly for active industry solutions, is still lacking. In this work, we present a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) for blockchain-based DeAI solutions. We propose a taxonomy to classify existing DeAI protocols based on the model lifecycle. Based on this taxonomy, we provide a structured way to clarify the landscape of DeAI protocols and identify their similarities and differences. We analyze the functionalities of blockchain in DeAI, investigating how blockchain features contribute to enhancing the security, transparency, and trustworthiness of AI processes, while also ensuring fair incentives for AI data and model contributors. In addition, we identify key insights and research gaps in developing DeAI protocols, highlighting several critical avenues for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Wang, Haozhu Wang, Yanjun Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision transformers recast reinforcement learning as a conditional sequence generation problem, offering a simple but effective alternative to traditional value or policy-based methods. A recent key development in this area is the integration of prompting in decision transformers to facilitate few-shot policy generalization. However, current methods mainly use static prompt segments to guide rollouts, limiting their ability to provide context-specific guidance. Addressing this, we introduce a hierarchical prompting approach enabled by retrieval augmentation. Our method learns two layers of soft tokens as guiding prompts: (1) global tokens encapsulating task-level information about trajectories, and (2) adaptive tokens that deliver focused, timestep-specific instructions. The adaptive tokens are dynamically retrieved from a curated set of demonstration segments, ensuring context-aware guidance. Experiments across seven benchmark tasks in the MuJoCo and MetaWorld environments demonstrate the proposed approach consistently outperforms all baseline methods, suggesting that hierarchical prompting for decision transformers is an effective strategy to enable few-shot policy generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hayden McTavish, Jon Donnelly, Margo Seltzer, Cynthia Rudin</p>
<p>Abstract: Many important datasets contain samples that are missing one or more feature values. Maintaining the interpretability of machine learning models in the presence of such missing data is challenging. Singly or multiply imputing missing values complicates the model's mapping from features to labels. On the other hand, reasoning on indicator variables that represent missingness introduces a potentially large number of additional terms, sacrificing sparsity. We solve these problems with M-GAM, a sparse, generalized, additive modeling approach that incorporates missingness indicators and their interaction terms while maintaining sparsity through l0 regularization. We show that M-GAM provides similar or superior accuracy to prior methods while significantly improving sparsity relative to either imputation or naive inclusion of indicator variables.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Gao, Chenhao Zhang, Fengge Wu, Junsuo Zhao, Changwen Zheng, Huaping Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph representation learning methods are highly effective in handling complex non-Euclidean data by capturing intricate relationships and features within graph structures. However, traditional methods face challenges when dealing with heterogeneous graphs that contain various types of nodes and edges due to the diverse sources and complex nature of the data. Existing Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown promising results but require prior knowledge of node and edge types and unified node feature formats, which limits their applicability. Recent advancements in graph representation learning using Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new solutions by integrating LLMs' data processing capabilities, enabling the alignment of various graph representations. Nevertheless, these methods often overlook heterogeneous graph data and require extensive preprocessing. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that leverages the strengths of both LLM and GNN, allowing for the processing of graph data with any format and type of nodes and edges without the need for type information or special preprocessing. Our method employs LLM to automatically summarize and classify different data formats and types, aligns node features, and uses a specialized GNN for targeted learning, thus obtaining effective graph representations for downstream tasks. Theoretical analysis and experimental validation have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanchen Xu, Siqi Huang, Hongyuan Zhang, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been widely used as an effective self-supervised learning method for graph representation learning. However, how to apply adequate and stable graph augmentation to generating proper views for contrastive learning remains an essential problem. Dropping edges is a primary augmentation in GCL while adding edges is not a common method due to its unstable performance. To our best knowledge, there is no theoretical analysis to study why dropping edges usually outperforms adding edges. To answer this question, we introduce a new metric, namely Error Passing Rate (EPR), to quantify how a graph fits the network. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions, we propose a novel GCL algorithm, Error-PAssing-based Graph Contrastive Learning (EPAGCL), which uses both edge adding and edge dropping as its augmentation. To be specific, we generate views by adding and dropping edges according to the weights derived from EPR. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets are conducted to validate the correctness of our theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haonan Yuan, Qingyun Sun, Zhaonan Wang, Xingcheng Fu, Cheng Ji, Yongjian Wang, Bo Jin, Jianxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic graphs exhibit intertwined spatio-temporal evolutionary patterns, widely existing in the real world. Nevertheless, the structure incompleteness, noise, and redundancy result in poor robustness for Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs). Dynamic Graph Structure Learning (DGSL) offers a promising way to optimize graph structures. However, aside from encountering unacceptable quadratic complexity, it overly relies on heuristic priors, making it hard to discover underlying predictive patterns. How to efficiently refine the dynamic structures, capture intrinsic dependencies, and learn robust representations, remains under-explored. In this work, we propose the novel DG-Mamba, a robust and efficient Dynamic Graph structure learning framework with the Selective State Space Models (Mamba). To accelerate the spatio-temporal structure learning, we propose a kernelized dynamic message-passing operator that reduces the quadratic time complexity to linear. To capture global intrinsic dynamics, we establish the dynamic graph as a self-contained system with State Space Model. By discretizing the system states with the cross-snapshot graph adjacency, we enable the long-distance dependencies capturing with the selective snapshot scan. To endow learned dynamic structures more expressive with informativeness, we propose the self-supervised Principle of Relevant Information for DGSL to regularize the most relevant yet least redundant information, enhancing global robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the robustness and efficiency of our DG-Mamba compared with the state-of-the-art baselines against adversarial attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kwangryeol Park, Seulki Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose SMMF (Square-Matricized Momentum Factorization), a memory-efficient optimizer that reduces the memory requirement of the widely used adaptive learning rate optimizers, such as Adam, by up to 96%. SMMF enables flexible and efficient factorization of an arbitrary rank (shape) of the first and second momentum tensors during optimization, based on the proposed square-matricization and one-time single matrix factorization. From this, it becomes effectively applicable to any rank (shape) of momentum tensors, i.e., bias, matrix, and any rank-d tensors, prevalent in various deep model architectures, such as CNNs (high rank) and Transformers (low rank), in contrast to existing memory-efficient optimizers that applies only to a particular (rank-2) momentum tensor, e.g., linear layers. We conduct a regret bound analysis of SMMF, which shows that it converges similarly to non-memory-efficient adaptive learning rate optimizers, such as AdamNC, providing a theoretical basis for its competitive optimization capability. In our experiment, SMMF takes up to 96% less memory compared to state-of-the-art memory efficient optimizers, e.g., Adafactor, CAME, and SM3, while achieving comparable model performance on various CNN and Transformer tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting Xiao, Lei Shi, Peng Liu, Zhe Wang, Chenjia Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is an important topic for alleviating the substantial workload of radiologists. Existing RRG approaches rely on supervised regression based on different architectures or additional knowledge injection,while the generated report may not align optimally with radiologists' preferences. Especially, since the preferences of radiologists are inherently heterogeneous and multidimensional, e.g., some may prioritize report fluency, while others emphasize clinical accuracy. To address this problem,we propose a new RRG method via Multi-objective Preference Optimization (MPO) to align the pre-trained RRG model with multiple human preferences, which can be formulated by multi-dimensional reward functions and optimized by multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we use a preference vector to represent the weight of preferences and use it as a condition for the RRG model. Then, a linearly weighed reward is obtained via a dot product between the preference vector and multi-dimensional reward. Next,the RRG model is optimized to align with the preference vector by optimizing such a reward via RL. In the training stage,we randomly sample diverse preference vectors from the preference space and align the model by optimizing the weighted multi-objective rewards, which leads to an optimal policy on the entire preference space. When inference,our model can generate reports aligned with specific preferences without further fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the proposed method can generate reports that cater to different preferences in a single model and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09399">A Geometry-Aware Message Passing Neural Network for Modeling Aerodynamics over Airfoils</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Helwig, Xuan Zhang, Haiyang Yu, Shuiwang Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational modeling of aerodynamics is a key problem in aerospace engineering, often involving flows interacting with solid objects such as airfoils. Deep surrogate models have emerged as purely data-driven approaches that learn direct mappings from simulation conditions to solutions based on either simulation or experimental data. Here, we consider modeling of incompressible flows over solid objects, wherein geometric structures are a key factor in determining aerodynamics. To effectively incorporate geometries, we propose a message passing scheme that efficiently and expressively integrates the airfoil shape with the mesh representation. Under this framework, we first obtain a representation of the geometry in the form of a latent graph on the airfoil surface. We subsequently propagate this representation to all collocation points through message passing on a directed, bipartite graph. We demonstrate that this framework supports efficient training by downsampling the solution mesh while avoiding distribution shifts at test time when evaluated on the full mesh. To enable our model to be able to distinguish between distinct spatial regimes of dynamics relative to the airfoil, we represent mesh points in both a leading edge and trailing edge coordinate system. We further enhance the expressiveness of our coordinate system representations by embedding our hybrid Polar-Cartesian coordinates using sinusoidal and spherical harmonics bases. We additionally find that a change of basis to canonicalize input representations with respect to inlet velocity substantially improves generalization. Altogether, these design choices lead to a purely data-driven machine learning framework known as GeoMPNN, which won the Best Student Submission award at the NeurIPS 2024 ML4CFD Competition, placing 4th overall.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Wang, Xilei Wu, Tingting Zhang, Xin Wang, Pengcheng Wang, Han Ding, Jingang Shi, Jinsong Han, Dong Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Hand hygiene is among the most effective daily practices for preventing infectious diseases such as influenza, malaria, and skin infections. While professional guidelines emphasize proper handwashing to reduce the risk of viral infections, surveys reveal that adherence to these recommendations remains low. To address this gap, we propose UWash, a wearable solution leveraging smartwatches to evaluate handwashing procedures, aiming to raise awareness and cultivate high-quality handwashing habits. We frame the task of handwashing assessment as an action segmentation problem, similar to those in computer vision, and introduce a simple yet efficient two-stream UNet-like network to achieve this goal. Experiments involving 51 subjects demonstrate that UWash achieves 92.27% accuracy in handwashing gesture recognition, an error of <0.5 seconds in onset/offset detection, and an error of <5 points in gesture scoring under user-dependent settings. The system also performs robustly in user-independent and user-independent-location-independent evaluations. Remarkably, UWash maintains high performance in real-world tests, including evaluations with 10 random passersby at a hospital 9 months later and 10 passersby in an in-the-wild test conducted 2 years later. UWash is the first system to score handwashing quality based on gesture sequences, offering actionable guidance for improving daily hand hygiene.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Zhang, Chen Huang, Yueke Zhang, Kevin Cao, Scott Thomas Andersen, Huajie Shao, Kevin Leach, Yu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Binary code analysis and comprehension is critical to applications in reverse engineering and computer security tasks where source code is not available. Unfortunately, unlike source code, binary code lacks semantics and is more difficult for human engineers to understand and analyze. In this paper, we present ContraBin, a contrastive learning technique that integrates source code and comment information along with binaries to create an embedding capable of aiding binary analysis and comprehension tasks. Specifically, we present three components in ContraBin: (1) a primary contrastive learning method for initial pre-training, (2) a simplex interpolation method to integrate source code, comments, and binary code, and (3) an intermediate representation learning algorithm to train a binary code embedding. We further analyze the impact of human-written and synthetic comments on binary code comprehension tasks, revealing a significant performance disparity. While synthetic comments provide substantial benefits, human-written comments are found to introduce noise, even resulting in performance drops compared to using no comments. These findings reshape the narrative around the role of comment types in binary code analysis. We evaluate the effectiveness of ContraBin through four indicative downstream tasks related to binary code: algorithmic functionality classification, function name recovery, code summarization, and reverse engineering. The results show that ContraBin considerably improves performance on all four tasks, measured by accuracy, mean of average precision, and BLEU scores as appropriate. ContraBin is the first language representation model to incorporate source code, binary code, and comments into contrastive code representation learning and is intended to contribute to the field of binary code analysis. The dataset used in this study is available for further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fran\c{c}ois Le Gall</p>
<p>Abstract: Several quantum algorithms for linear algebra problems, and in particular quantum machine learning problems, have been "dequantized" in the past few years. These dequantization results typically hold when classical algorithms can access the data via length-squared sampling. In this work we investigate how robust these dequantization results are. We introduce the notion of approximate length-squared sampling, where classical algorithms are only able to sample from a distribution close to the ideal distribution in total variation distance. While quantum algorithms are natively robust against small perturbations, current techniques in dequantization are not. Our main technical contribution is showing how many techniques from randomized linear algebra can be adapted to work under this weaker assumption as well. We then use these techniques to show that the recent low-rank dequantization framework by Chia, Gily\'en, Li, Lin, Tang and Wang (JACM 2022) and the dequantization framework for sparse matrices by Gharibian and Le Gall (STOC 2022), which are both based on the Quantum Singular Value Transformation, can be generalized to the case of approximate length-squared sampling access to the input. We also apply these results to obtain a robust dequantization of many quantum machine learning algorithms, including quantum algorithms for recommendation systems, supervised clustering and low-rank matrix inversion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinmeng Huang, Kan Xu, Donghwan Lee, Hamed Hassani, Hamsa Bastani, Edgar Dobriban</p>
<p>Abstract: Large and complex datasets are often collected from several, possibly heterogeneous sources. Multitask learning methods improve efficiency by leveraging commonalities across datasets while accounting for possible differences among them. Here, we study multitask linear regression and contextual bandits under sparse heterogeneity, where the source/task-associated parameters are equal to a global parameter plus a sparse task-specific term. We propose a novel two-stage estimator called MOLAR that leverages this structure by first constructing a covariate-wise weighted median of the task-wise linear regression estimates and then shrinking the task-wise estimates towards the weighted median. Compared to task-wise least squares estimates, MOLAR improves the dependence of the estimation error on the data dimension. Extensions of MOLAR to generalized linear models and constructing confidence intervals are discussed in the paper. We then apply MOLAR to develop methods for sparsely heterogeneous multitask contextual bandits, obtaining improved regret guarantees over single-task bandit methods. We further show that our methods are minimax optimal by providing a number of lower bounds. Finally, we support the efficiency of our methods by performing experiments on both synthetic data and the PISA dataset on student educational outcomes from heterogeneous countries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piero Fraternali, Luca Morandini, Sergio Luis Herrera Gonz\'alez</p>
<p>Abstract: The detection and characterization of illegal solid waste disposal sites are essential for environmental protection, particularly for mitigating pollution and health hazards. Improperly managed landfills contaminate soil and groundwater via rainwater infiltration, posing threats to both animals and humans. Traditional landfill identification approaches, such as on-site inspections, are time-consuming and expensive. Remote sensing is a cost-effective solution for the identification and monitoring of solid waste disposal sites that enables broad coverage and repeated acquisitions over time. Earth Observation (EO) satellites, equipped with an array of sensors and imaging capabilities, have been providing high-resolution data for several decades. Researchers proposed specialized techniques that leverage remote sensing imagery to perform a range of tasks such as waste site detection, dumping site monitoring, and assessment of suitable locations for new landfills. This review aims to provide a detailed illustration of the most relevant proposals for the detection and monitoring of solid waste sites by describing and comparing the approaches, the implemented techniques, and the employed data. Furthermore, since the data sources are of the utmost importance for developing an effective solid waste detection model, a comprehensive overview of the satellites and publicly available data sets is presented. Finally, this paper identifies the open issues in the state-of-the-art and discusses the relevant research directions for reducing the costs and improving the effectiveness of novel solid waste detection methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faith Johnson, Bryan Bo Cao, Ashwin Ashok, Shubham Jain, Kristin Dana</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual navigation follows the intuition that humans can navigate without detailed maps. A common approach is interactive exploration while building a topological graph with images at nodes that can be used for planning. Recent variations learn from passive videos and can navigate using complex social and semantic cues. However, a significant number of training videos are needed, large graphs are utilized, and scenes are not unseen since odometry is utilized. We introduce a new approach to visual navigation using feudal learning, which employs a hierarchical structure consisting of a worker agent, a mid-level manager, and a high-level manager. Key to the feudal learning paradigm, agents at each level see a different aspect of the task and operate at different spatial and temporal scales. Two unique modules are developed in this framework. For the high-level manager, we learn a memory proxy map in a self supervised manner to record prior observations in a learned latent space and avoid the use of graphs and odometry. For the mid-level manager, we develop a waypoint network that outputs intermediate subgoals imitating human waypoint selection during local navigation. This waypoint network is pre-trained using a new, small set of teleoperation videos that we make publicly available, with training environments different from testing environments. The resulting feudal navigation network achieves near SOTA performance, while providing a novel no-RL, no-graph, no-odometry, no-metric map approach to the image goal navigation task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Selig, Thomas M\"arz, Martin Storath, Andreas Weinmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Computed tomography from a low radiation dose (LDCT) is challenging due to high noise in the projection data. Popular approaches for LDCT image reconstruction are two-stage methods, typically consisting of the filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm followed by a neural network for LDCT image enhancement. Two-stage methods are attractive for their simplicity and potential for computational efficiency, typically requiring only a single FBP and a neural network forward pass for inference. However, the best reconstruction quality is currently achieved by unrolled iterative methods (Learned Primal-Dual and ItNet), which are more complex and thus have a higher computational cost for training and inference. We propose a method combining the simplicity and efficiency of two-stage methods with state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. Our strategy utilizes a neural network pretrained for Gaussian noise removal from natural grayscale images, fine-tuned for LDCT image enhancement. We call this method FBP-DTSGD (Domain and Task Shifted Gaussian Denoisers) as the fine-tuning is a task shift from Gaussian denoising to enhancing LDCT images and a domain shift from natural grayscale to LDCT images. An ablation study with three different pretrained Gaussian denoisers indicates that the performance of FBP-DTSGD does not depend on a specific denoising architecture, suggesting future advancements in Gaussian denoising could benefit the method. The study also shows that pretraining on natural images enhances LDCT reconstruction quality, especially with limited training data. Notably, pretraining involves no additional cost, as existing pretrained models are used. The proposed method currently holds the top mean position in the LoDoPaB-CT challenge.</p>

Our framework interpolates freely between Integral Probability Metric (IPM) and $f$-divergence, which naturally recovers some known results (including Wasserstein- and KL-bounds), as well as yields new generalization bounds. Additionally, we show that our framework admits an optimal transport interpretation. When evaluated in two concrete examples, the proposed bounds either strictly improve upon existing bounds in some cases or match the best existing OOD generalization bounds. Moreover, by focusing on $f$-divergence and combining it with the Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) methods, we derive a family of CMI-based generalization bounds, which include the state-of-the-art ICIMI bound as a special instance. Finally, leveraging these findings, we analyze the generalization of the Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) algorithm, showing that our derived generalization bounds outperform existing information-theoretic generalization bounds in certain scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Lester, Jaehoon Lee, Alex Alemi, Jeffrey Pennington, Adam Roberts, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Noah Constant</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\"ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen Liu, Jae-Won Chung, Zhiyu Wu, Fan Lai, Myungjin Lee, Mosharaf Chowdhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now at the core of conversational AI services such as real-time translation and chatbots, which provide live user interaction by incrementally streaming text to the user. However, existing LLM serving systems fail to provide good user experience because their optimization metrics are not always aligned with user experience.
  In this paper, we first introduce and define the notion of Quality-of-Experience (QoE) for text streaming services by considering each user's end-to-end interaction timeline. Based on this, we propose Andes, a QoE-aware LLM serving system that enhances user experience by ensuring that users receive the first token promptly and subsequent tokens at a smooth, digestible pace, even during surge periods. This is enabled by Andes's preemptive request scheduler that dynamically prioritizes requests at the token granularity based on each request's expected QoE gain and GPU resource usage. Our evaluations demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving systems, Andes improves the average QoE by up to $4.7\times$ given the same GPU resource, or saves up to 61% GPU resources while maintaining the same high QoE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge F. Urb\'an, Petros Stefanou, Jos\'e A. Pons</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the potential accuracy boundaries of physics-informed neural networks, contrasting their approach with previous similar works and traditional numerical methods. We find that selecting improved optimization algorithms significantly enhances the accuracy of the results. Simple modifications to the loss function may also improve precision, offering an additional avenue for enhancement. Despite optimization algorithms having a greater impact on convergence than adjustments to the loss function, practical considerations often favor tweaking the latter due to ease of implementation. On a global scale, the integration of an enhanced optimizer and a marginally adjusted loss function enables a reduction in the loss function by several orders of magnitude across diverse physical problems. Consequently, our results obtained using compact networks (typically comprising 2 or 3 layers of 20-30 neurons) achieve accuracies comparable to finite difference schemes employing thousands of grid points. This study encourages the continued advancement of PINNs and associated optimization techniques for broader applications across various fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Ravuri, Neil D. Lawrence</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper shows that dimensionality reduction methods such as UMAP and t-SNE, can be approximately recast as MAP inference methods corresponding to a model introduced in ProbDR, that describes the graph Laplacian (an estimate for the precision/inverse covariance) matrix using a Wishart distribution, with a mean given by a non-linear covariance function evaluated on the latents. This interpretation offers deeper theoretical and semantic insights into such algorithms, by showing that variances corresponding to these covariances are low (and misspecified), and forging a connection to Gaussian process latent variable models by showing that well-known kernels can be used to describe covariances implied by graph Laplacians. We also introduce tools with which similar dimensionality reduction methods can be studied, and pose two areas of research arising from these interpretations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized many fields, including materials science. However, predicting properties of crystalline materials using machine learning faces challenges in input encoding, output versatility, and interpretability. We introduce CrystalBERT, an adaptable transformer-based framework integrating space group, elemental, and unit cell information. This novel structure can seamlessly combine diverse features and accurately predict various physical properties, including topological properties, superconducting transition temperatures, dielectric constants, and more. CrystalBERT provides insightful interpretations of features influencing target properties. Our results indicate that space group and elemental information are crucial for predicting topological and superconducting properties, underscoring their intricate nature. By incorporating these features, we achieve 91\% accuracy in topological classification, surpassing prior studies and identifying previously misclassified materials. This research demonstrates that integrating diverse material information enhances the prediction of complex material properties, paving the way for more accurate and interpretable machine learning models in materials science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Li, Guodong Long, Chunxu Zhang, Honglei Zhang, Jing Jiang, Chengqi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the integration of federated learning (FL) and recommendation systems (RS), known as Federated Recommendation Systems (FRS), has attracted attention for preserving user privacy by keeping private data on client devices. However, FRS faces inherent limitations such as data heterogeneity and scarcity, due to the privacy requirements of FL and the typical data sparsity issues of RSs. Models like ChatGPT are empowered by the concept of transfer learning and self-supervised learning, so they can be easily applied to the downstream tasks after fine-tuning or prompting. These models, so-called Foundation Models (FM), fouce on understanding the human's intent and perform following their designed roles in the specific tasks, which are widely recognized for producing high-quality content in the image and language domains. Thus, the achievements of FMs inspire the design of FRS and suggest a promising research direction: integrating foundation models to address the above limitations. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review of FRSs with FMs. Specifically, we: 1) summarise the common approaches of current FRSs and FMs; 2) review the challenges posed by FRSs and FMs; 3) discuss potential future research directions; and 4) introduce some common benchmarks and evaluation metrics in the FRS field. We hope that this position paper provides the necessary background and guidance to explore this interesting and emerging topic.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the propagation of harmful information in multilingual large language models (LLMs) and evaluates the efficacy of various unlearning methods. We demonstrate that fake information, regardless of the language it is in, once introduced into these models through training data, can spread across different languages, compromising the integrity and reliability of the generated content. Our findings reveal that standard unlearning techniques, which typically focus on English data, are insufficient in mitigating the spread of harmful content in multilingual contexts and could inadvertently reinforce harmful content across languages. We show that only by addressing harmful responses in both English and the original language of the harmful data can we effectively eliminate generations for all languages. This underscores the critical need for comprehensive unlearning strategies that consider the multilingual nature of modern LLMs to enhance their safety and reliability across diverse linguistic landscapes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Methods of computational quantum chemistry provide accurate approximations of molecular properties crucial for computer-aided drug discovery and other areas of chemical science. However, high computational complexity limits the scalability of their applications. Neural network potentials (NNPs) are a promising alternative to quantum chemistry methods, but they require large and diverse datasets for training. This work presents a new dataset and benchmark called $\nabla^2$DFT that is based on the nablaDFT. It contains twice as much molecular structures, three times more conformations, new data types and tasks, and state-of-the-art models. The dataset includes energies, forces, 17 molecular properties, Hamiltonian and overlap matrices, and a wavefunction object. All calculations were performed at the DFT level ($\omega$B97X-D/def2-SVP) for each conformation. Moreover, $\nabla^2$DFT is the first dataset that contains relaxation trajectories for a substantial number of drug-like molecules. We also introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating NNPs in molecular property prediction, Hamiltonian prediction, and conformational optimization tasks. Finally, we propose an extendable framework for training NNPs and implement 10 models within it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Saiful Islam, Tariq Adnan, Jan Freyberg, Sangwu Lee, Abdelrahman Abdelkader, Meghan Pawlik, Cathe Schwartz, Karen Jaffe, Ruth B. Schneider, E Ray Dorsey, Ehsan Hoque</p>
<p>Abstract: Limited accessibility to neurological care leads to underdiagnosed Parkinson's Disease (PD), preventing early intervention. Existing AI-based PD detection methods primarily focus on unimodal analysis of motor or speech tasks, overlooking the multifaceted nature of the disease. To address this, we introduce a large-scale, multi-task video dataset consisting of 1102 sessions (each containing videos of finger tapping, facial expression, and speech tasks captured via webcam) from 845 participants (272 with PD). We propose a novel Uncertainty-calibrated Fusion Network (UFNet) that leverages this multimodal data to enhance diagnostic accuracy. UFNet employs independent task-specific networks, trained with Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty quantification, followed by self-attended fusion of features, with attention weights dynamically adjusted based on task-specific uncertainties. To ensure patient-centered evaluation, the participants were randomly split into three sets: 60% for training, 20% for model selection, and 20% for final performance evaluation. UFNet significantly outperformed single-task models in terms of accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUROC), and sensitivity while maintaining non-inferior specificity. Withholding uncertain predictions further boosted the performance, achieving 88.0+-0.3%$ accuracy, 93.0+-0.2% AUROC, 79.3+-0.9% sensitivity, and 92.6+-0.3% specificity, at the expense of not being able to predict for 2.3+-0.3% data (+- denotes 95% confidence interval). Further analysis suggests that the trained model does not exhibit any detectable bias across sex and ethnic subgroups and is most effective for individuals aged between 50 and 80. Requiring only a webcam and microphone, our approach facilitates accessible home-based PD screening, especially in regions with limited healthcare resources.</p>

The proposed approach is built on the deterministic variant of the Information Bottleneck algorithm, designed to optimally compress data while preserving its relevant structural information. We evaluate the performance of our method against four well-established clustering techniques for mixed-type data -- KAMILA, K-Prototypes, Factor Analysis for Mixed Data with K-Means, and Partitioning Around Medoids using Gower's dissimilarity -- using both simulated and real-world datasets. The results highlight that the proposed approach offers a competitive alternative to traditional clustering techniques, particularly under specific conditions where heterogeneity in data poses significant challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhimin Zhao, Abdul Ali Bangash, Filipe Roseiro C\^ogo, Bram Adams, Ahmed E. Hassan</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models (FM), such as large language models (LLMs), which are large-scale machine learning (ML) models, have demonstrated remarkable adaptability in various downstream software engineering (SE) tasks, such as code completion, code understanding, and software development. As a result, FM leaderboards have become essential tools for SE teams to compare and select the best third-party FMs for their specific products and purposes. However, the lack of standardized guidelines for FM evaluation and comparison threatens the transparency of FM leaderboards and limits stakeholders' ability to perform effective FM selection. As a first step towards addressing this challenge, our research focuses on understanding how these FM leaderboards operate in real-world scenarios ("leaderboard operations") and identifying potential pitfalls and areas for improvement ("leaderboard smells"). In this regard, we collect up to 1,045 FM leaderboards from five different sources: GitHub, Hugging Face Spaces, Papers With Code, spreadsheet and independent platform, to examine their documentation and engage in direct communication with leaderboard operators to understand their workflows. Through card sorting and negotiated agreement, we identify five distinct workflow patterns and develop a domain model that captures the key components and their interactions within these workflows. We then identify eight unique types of leaderboard smells in LBOps. By mitigating these smells, SE teams can improve transparency, accountability, and collaboration in current LBOps practices, fostering a more robust and responsible ecosystem for FM comparison and selection.</p>

We explore two methods based on such low-discrepancy points to reduce large data sets in order to train neural networks. The first one is the method of Dick and Feischl [4], which relies on digital nets and an averaging procedure. Motivated by our experimental findings, we construct a second method, which again uses digital nets, but Voronoi clustering instead of averaging. Both methods are compared to the supercompress approach of [14], which is a variant of the K-means clustering algorithm. The comparison is done in terms of the compression error for different objective functions and the accuracy of the training of a neural network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiliang Li, Yifan Zhang, Yu Huang, Kevin Leach</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent growth and proliferation of malware has tested practitioners' ability to promptly classify new samples according to malware families. In contrast to labor-intensive reverse engineering efforts, machine learning approaches have demonstrated increased speed and accuracy. However, most existing deep-learning malware family classifiers must be calibrated using a large number of samples that are painstakingly manually analyzed before training. Furthermore, as novel malware samples arise that are beyond the scope of the training set, additional reverse engineering effort must be employed to update the training set. The sheer volume of new samples found in the wild creates substantial pressure on practitioners' ability to reverse engineer enough malware to adequately train modern classifiers. In this paper, we present MalMixer, a malware family classifier using semi-supervised learning that achieves high accuracy with sparse training data. We present a novel domain-knowledge-aware technique for augmenting malware feature representations, enhancing few-shot performance of semi-supervised malware family classification. We show that MalMixer achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot malware family classification settings. Our research confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of lightweight, domain-knowledge-aware feature augmentation methods and highlights the capabilities of similar semi-supervised classifiers in addressing malware classification issues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangqi Duan, Nigel Fernandez, Alexander Hicks, Andrew Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-ended coding tasks, which ask students to construct programs according to certain specifications, are common in computer science education. Student modeling can be challenging since their open-ended nature means that student code can be diverse. Traditional knowledge tracing (KT) models that only analyze response correctness may not fully capture nuances in student knowledge from student code. In this paper, we introduce Test case-Informed Knowledge Tracing for Open-ended Coding (TIKTOC), a framework to simultaneously analyze and predict both open-ended student code and whether the code passes each test case. We augment the existing CodeWorkout dataset with the test cases used for a subset of the open-ended coding questions, and propose a multi-task learning KT method to simultaneously analyze and predict 1) whether a student's code submission passes each test case and 2) the student's open-ended code, using a large language model as the backbone. We quantitatively show that these methods outperform existing KT methods for coding that only use the overall score a code submission receives. We also qualitatively demonstrate how test case information, combined with open-ended code, helps us gain fine-grained insights into student knowledge.</p>

Recently, both Differentiable and Dynamic Ray Tracing frameworks have emerged to address these challenges. However, there is often confusion about how these approaches differ and which one should be used in specific contexts. In this paper, we provide an overview of these two techniques and a comparative analysis against two state-of-the-art tools: 3DSCAT from UniBo and Sionna from NVIDIA. To provide a more precise characterization of the scope of these methods, we introduce a novel simulation-based metric, the Multipath Lifetime Map, which enables the evaluation of spatial and temporal coherence in radio channels only based on the geometrical description of the environment. Finally, our metrics are evaluated on a classic urban street canyon scenario, yielding similar results to those obtained from measurement campaigns.</p>

  Our approach balances computational efficiency and task fidelity, significantly reducing inference latency and throughput bottlenecks. Experiments on diverse datasets and model pairs demonstrate that DroidSpeak achieves up to 3x higher throughputs and 2.6x faster prefill times with negligible accuracy loss compared to full recomputation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The construction of loss functions presents a major challenge in data-driven modeling involving weak-form operators in PDEs and gradient flows, particularly due to the need to select test functions appropriately. We address this challenge by introducing self-test loss functions, which employ test functions that depend on the unknown parameters, specifically for cases where the operator depends linearly on the unknowns. The proposed self-test loss function conserves energy for gradient flows and coincides with the expected log-likelihood ratio for stochastic differential equations. Importantly, it is quadratic, facilitating theoretical analysis of identifiability and well-posedness of the inverse problem, while also leading to efficient parametric or nonparametric regression algorithms. It is computationally simple, requiring only low-order derivatives or even being entirely derivative-free, and numerical experiments demonstrate its robustness against noisy and discrete data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Structural health monitoring (SHM) is essential for the early detection of infrastructure defects, such as cracks in concrete bridge pier. but often faces challenges in efficiency and accuracy in complex environments. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) achieves excellent segmentation performance, its computational demands limit its suitability for real-time applications on edge devices. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Crack-EdgeSAM, a self-prompting crack segmentation system that integrates YOLOv8 for generating prompt boxes and a fine-tuned EdgeSAM model for crack segmentation. To ensure computational efficiency, the method employs ConvLoRA, a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) technique, along with DiceFocalLoss to fine-tune the EdgeSAM model. Our experimental results on public datasets and the climbing robot automatic inspections demonstrate that the system achieves high segmentation accuracy and significantly enhanced inference speed compared to the most recent methods. Notably, the system processes 1024 x 1024 pixels images at 46 FPS on our PC and 8 FPS on Jetson Orin Nano.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huafeng Li, Dayong Su, Qing Cai, Yafei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: If unaligned multimodal medical images can be simultaneously aligned and fused using a single-stage approach within a unified processing framework, it will not only achieve mutual promotion of dual tasks but also help reduce the complexity of the model. However, the design of this model faces the challenge of incompatible requirements for feature fusion and alignment; specifically, feature alignment requires consistency among corresponding features, whereas feature fusion requires the features to be complementary to each other. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an unaligned medical image fusion method called Bidirectional Stepwise Feature Alignment and Fusion (BSFA-F) strategy. To reduce the negative impact of modality differences on cross-modal feature matching, we incorporate the Modal Discrepancy-Free Feature Representation (MDF-FR) method into BSFA-F. MDF-FR utilizes a Modality Feature Representation Head (MFRH) to integrate the global information of the input image. By injecting the information contained in MFRH of the current image into other modality images, it effectively reduces the impact of modality differences on feature alignment while preserving the complementary information carried by different images. In terms of feature alignment, BSFA-F employs a bidirectional stepwise alignment deformation field prediction strategy based on the path independence of vector displacement between two points. This strategy solves the problem of large spans and inaccurate deformation field prediction in single-step alignment. Finally, Multi-Modal Feature Fusion block achieves the fusion of aligned features. The experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bofang Jia, Pengxiang Ding, Can Cui, Mingyang Sun, Pengfang Qian, Siteng Huang, Zhaoxin Fan, Donglin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual-motor policy learning has advanced with architectures like diffusion-based policies, known for modeling complex robotic trajectories. However, their prolonged inference times hinder high-frequency control tasks requiring real-time feedback. While consistency distillation (CD) accelerates inference, it introduces errors that compromise action quality. To address these limitations, we propose the Score and Distribution Matching Policy (SDM Policy), which transforms diffusion-based policies into single-step generators through a two-stage optimization process: score matching ensures alignment with true action distributions, and distribution matching minimizes KL divergence for consistency. A dual-teacher mechanism integrates a frozen teacher for stability and an unfrozen teacher for adversarial training, enhancing robustness and alignment with target distributions. Evaluated on a 57-task simulation benchmark, SDM Policy achieves a 6x inference speedup while having state-of-the-art action quality, providing an efficient and reliable framework for high-frequency robotic tasks.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09602">Hidden Biases of End-to-End Driving Datasets</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Zimmerlin, Jens Bei{\ss}wenger, Bernhard Jaeger, Andreas Geiger, Kashyap Chitta</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end driving systems have made rapid progress, but have so far not been applied to the challenging new CARLA Leaderboard 2.0. Further, while there is a large body of literature on end-to-end architectures and training strategies, the impact of the training dataset is often overlooked. In this work, we make a first attempt at end-to-end driving for Leaderboard 2.0. Instead of investigating architectures, we systematically analyze the training dataset, leading to new insights: (1) Expert style significantly affects downstream policy performance. (2) In complex data sets, the frames should not be weighted on the basis of simplistic criteria such as class frequencies. (3) Instead, estimating whether a frame changes the target labels compared to previous frames can reduce the size of the dataset without removing important information. By incorporating these findings, our model ranks first and second respectively on the map and sensors tracks of the 2024 CARLA Challenge, and sets a new state-of-the-art on the Bench2Drive test routes. Finally, we uncover a design flaw in the current evaluation metrics and propose a modification for future challenges.
