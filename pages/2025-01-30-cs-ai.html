<p><b>Authors:</b> Arya Rahgozar, Pouria Mortezaagha, Jodi Edwards, Douglas Manuel, Jessie McGowen, Merrick Zwarenstein, Dean Fergusson, Andrea Tricco, Kelly Cobey, Margaret Sampson, Malcolm King, Dawn Richards, Alexandra Bodnaruc, David Moher</p>
<p>Abstract: The Brain-Heart Interconnectome (BHI) combines neurology and cardiology but is hindered by inefficiencies in evidence synthesis, poor adherence to quality standards, and research waste. To address these challenges, we developed an AI-driven system to enhance systematic reviews in the BHI domain. The system integrates automated detection of Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, and Study design (PICOS), semantic search using vector embeddings, graph-based querying, and topic modeling to identify redundancies and underexplored areas. Core components include a Bi-LSTM model achieving 87% accuracy for PICOS compliance, a study design classifier with 95.7% accuracy, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with GPT-3.5, which outperformed GPT-4 for graph-based and topic-driven queries. The system provides real-time updates, reducing research waste through a living database and offering an interactive interface with dashboards and conversational AI. While initially developed for BHI, the system's adaptable architecture enables its application across various biomedical fields, supporting rigorous evidence synthesis, efficient resource allocation, and informed clinical decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinqi Zhang, Xintian Han, Haolong Li, Kedi Chen, Shaohui Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have shown remarkable abilities in text generation, question answering, language translation, reasoning and many other tasks. It continues to advance rapidly and is becoming increasingly influential in various fields, from technology and business to education and entertainment. Despite LLM's success in multiple areas, its ability to play abstract games, such as chess, is underexplored. Chess-playing requires the language models to output legal and reasonable moves from textual inputs. Here, we propose the Large language model ChessLLM to play full chess games. We transform the game into a textual format with the best move represented in the Forsyth-Edwards Notation. We show that by simply supervised fine-tuning, our model has achieved a professional-level Elo rating of 1788 in matches against the standard Elo-rated Stockfish when permitted to sample 10 times. We further show that data quality is important. Long-round data supervision enjoys a 350 Elo rating improvement over short-round data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ricardo Salazar, Shahrzad Jamshidi</p>
<p>Abstract: Define a building blocks set to be a collection of n cubes (each with six sides) where each side is assigned one letter and one color from a palette of m colors. We propose a novel problem of assigning letters and colors to each face so as to maximize the number of words one can spell from a chosen dataset that are either mono words, all letters have the same color, or rainbow words, all letters have unique colors. We explore this problem considering a chosen set of English words, up to six letters long, from a typical vocabulary of a US American 14 year old and explore the problem when n=6 and m=6, with the added restriction that each color appears exactly once on the cube. The problem is intractable, as the size of the solution space makes a brute force approach computationally infeasible. Therefore we aim to solve this problem using random search, simulated annealing, two distinct tree search approaches (greedy and best-first), and a genetic algorithm. To address this, we explore a range of optimization techniques: random search, simulated annealing, two distinct tree search methods (greedy and best-first), and a genetic algorithm. Additionally, we attempted to implement a reinforcement learning approach; however, the model failed to converge to viable solutions within the problem's constraints. Among these methods, the genetic algorithm delivered the best performance, achieving a total of 2846 mono and rainbow words.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Markus Kirchweger, Hai Xia, Tom\'a\v{s} Peitl, Stefan Szeider</p>
<p>Abstract: Parallel solving via cube-and-conquer is a key method for scaling SAT solvers to hard instances. While cube-and-conquer has proven successful for pure SAT problems, notably the Pythagorean triples conjecture, its application to SAT solvers extended with propagators presents unique challenges, as these propagators learn constraints dynamically during the search.
  We study this problem using SAT Modulo Symmetries (SMS) as our primary test case, where a symmetry-breaking propagator reduces the search space by learning constraints that eliminate isomorphic graphs. Through extensive experimentation comprising over 10,000 CPU hours, we systematically evaluate different cube-and-conquer variants on three well-studied combinatorial problems. Our methodology combines prerun phases to collect learned constraints, various cubing strategies, and parameter tuning via algorithm configuration and LLM-generated design suggestions.
  The comprehensive empirical evaluation provides new insights into effective cubing strategies for propagator-based SAT solving, with our best method achieving speedups of 2-3x from improved cubing and parameter tuning, providing an additional 1.5-2x improvement on harder instances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengpei Yuan, Nehal Hasnaeen, Ran Zhang, Bryce Bible, Joseph Riley Taylor, Hairong Qi, Fenghui Yao, Xiaopeng Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores a novel approach to advancing dementia care by integrating socially assistive robotics, reinforcement learning (RL), large language models (LLMs), and clinical domain expertise within a simulated environment. This integration addresses the critical challenge of limited experimental data in socially assistive robotics for dementia care, providing a dynamic simulation environment that realistically models interactions between persons living with dementia (PLWDs) and robotic caregivers. The proposed framework introduces a probabilistic model to represent the cognitive and emotional states of PLWDs, combined with an LLM-based behavior simulation to emulate their responses. We further develop and train an adaptive RL system enabling humanoid robots, such as Pepper, to deliver context-aware and personalized interactions and assistance based on PLWDs' cognitive and emotional states. The framework also generalizes to computer-based agents, highlighting its versatility. Results demonstrate that the RL system, enhanced by LLMs, effectively interprets and responds to the complex needs of PLWDs, providing tailored caregiving strategies. This research contributes to human-computer and human-robot interaction by offering a customizable AI-driven caregiving platform, advancing understanding of dementia-related challenges, and fostering collaborative innovation in assistive technologies. The proposed approach has the potential to enhance the independence and quality of life for PLWDs while alleviating caregiver burden, underscoring the transformative role of interaction-focused AI systems in dementia care.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17282">From Natural Language to Extensive-Form Game Representations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shilong Deng, Yongzhao Wang, Rahul Savani</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a framework for translating game descriptions in natural language into extensive-form representations in game theory, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and in-context learning. Given the varying levels of strategic complexity in games, such as perfect versus imperfect information, directly applying in-context learning would be insufficient. To address this, we introduce a two-stage framework with specialized modules to enhance in-context learning, enabling it to divide and conquer the problem effectively. In the first stage, we tackle the challenge of imperfect information by developing a module that identifies information sets along and the corresponding partial tree structure. With this information, the second stage leverages in-context learning alongside a self-debugging module to produce a complete extensive-form game tree represented using pygambit, the Python API of a recognized game-theoretic analysis tool called Gambit. Using this python representation enables the automation of tasks such as computing Nash equilibria directly from natural language descriptions. We evaluate the performance of the full framework, as well as its individual components, using various LLMs on games with different levels of strategic complexity. Our experimental results show that the framework significantly outperforms baseline models in generating accurate extensive-form games, with each module playing a critical role in its success.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun-Shiuan Chuang, Nikunj Harlalka, Sameer Narendran, Alexander Cheung, Sizhe Gao, Siddharth Suresh, Junjie Hu, Timothy T. Rogers</p>
<p>Abstract: Guesstimation, the task of making approximate quantity estimates, is a common real-world challenge. However, it has been largely overlooked in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) research. We introduce a novel guesstimation dataset, MARBLES. This dataset requires one to estimate how many items (e.g., marbles) can fit into containers (e.g., a one-cup measuring cup), both with and without accompanying images. Inspired by the social science concept of the ``{Wisdom of Crowds'' (WOC) - taking the median from estimates from a crowd), which has proven effective in guesstimation, we propose ``WOC decoding'' strategy for LLM guesstimation. We show that LLMs/VLMs perform well on guesstimation, suggesting that they possess some level of a "world model" necessary for guesstimation. Moreover, similar to human performance, the WOC decoding method improves LLM/VLM guesstimation accuracy. Furthermore, the inclusion of images in the multimodal condition enhances model performance. These results highlight the value of WOC decoding strategy for LLMs/VLMs and position guesstimation as a probe for evaluating LLMs/VLMs' world model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomek Korbak, Joshua Clymer, Benjamin Hilton, Buck Shlegeris, Geoffrey Irving</p>
<p>Abstract: As LLM agents gain a greater capacity to cause harm, AI developers might increasingly rely on control measures such as monitoring to justify that they are safe. We sketch how developers could construct a "control safety case", which is a structured argument that models are incapable of subverting control measures in order to cause unacceptable outcomes. As a case study, we sketch an argument that a hypothetical LLM agent deployed internally at an AI company won't exfiltrate sensitive information. The sketch relies on evidence from a "control evaluation,"' where a red team deliberately designs models to exfiltrate data in a proxy for the deployment environment. The safety case then hinges on several claims: (1) the red team adequately elicits model capabilities to exfiltrate data, (2) control measures remain at least as effective in deployment, and (3) developers conservatively extrapolate model performance to predict the probability of data exfiltration in deployment. This safety case sketch is a step toward more concrete arguments that can be used to show that a dangerously capable LLM agent is safe to deploy.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17393">Intensional Inheritance Between Concepts: An Information-Theoretic Interpretation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Goertzel</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of formalizing and quantifying the concept of "intensional inheritance" between two concepts. We begin by conceiving the intensional inheritance of $W$ from $F$ as the amount of information the proposition "x is $F$ " provides about the proposition "x is $W$. To flesh this out, we consider concepts $F$ and $W$ defined by sets of properties $\left\{F_{1}, F_{2}, \ldots, F_{n}\right\}$ and $\left\{W_{1}, W_{2}, \ldots, W_{m}\right\}$ with associated degrees $\left\{d_{1}, d_{2}, \ldots, d_{n}\right\}$ and $\left\{e_{1}, e_{2}, \ldots, e_{m}\right\}$, respectively, where the properties may overlap. We then derive formulas for the intensional inheritance using both Shannon information theory and algorithmic information theory, incorporating interaction information among properties. We examine a special case where all properties are mutually exclusive and calculate the intensional inheritance in this case in both frameworks. We also derive expressions for $P(W \mid F)$ based on the mutual information formula. Finally we consider the relationship between intensional inheritance and conventional set-theoretic "extensional" inheritance, concluding that in our information-theoretic framework, extensional inheritance emerges as a special case of intensional inheritance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17459">Large Language Models for Single-Step and Multi-Step Flight Trajectory Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwei Luo, Jiliu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction is a critical time series task in aviation. While deep learning methods have shown significant promise, the application of large language models (LLMs) to this domain remains underexplored. This study pioneers the use of LLMs for flight trajectory prediction by reframing it as a language modeling problem. Specifically, We extract features representing the aircraft's position and status from ADS-B flight data to construct a prompt-based dataset, where trajectory waypoints are converted into language tokens. The dataset is then employed to fine-tune LLMs, enabling them to learn complex spatiotemporal patterns for accurate predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs achieve notable performance improvements in both single-step and multi-step predictions compared to traditional methods, with LLaMA-3.1 model achieving the highest overall accuracy. However, the high inference latency of LLMs poses a challenge for real-time applications, underscoring the need for further research in this promising direction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christoph Jabs, Jeremias Berg, Bart Bogaerts, Matti J\"arvisalo</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the wide employment of automated reasoning in the analysis and construction of correct systems, the results reported by automated reasoning engines must be trustworthy. For Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers - and more recently SAT-based maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) solvers - trustworthiness is obtained by integrating proof logging into solvers, making solvers capable of emitting machine-verifiable proofs to certify correctness of the reasoning steps performed. In this work, we enable for the first time proof logging based on the VeriPB proof format for multi-objective MaxSAT (MO-MaxSAT) optimization techniques. Although VeriPB does not offer direct support for multi-objective problems, we detail how preorders in VeriPB can be used to provide certificates for MO-MaxSAT algorithms computing a representative solution for each element in the non-dominated set of the search space under Pareto-optimality, without extending the VeriPB format or the proof checker. By implementing VeriPB proof logging into a state-of-the-art multi-objective MaxSAT solver, we show empirically that proof logging can be made scalable for MO-MaxSAT with reasonable overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Kretinsky, Tobias Meggendorfer, Maximilian Prokop, Ashkan Zarkhah</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthesizing a reactive system from specifications given in linear temporal logic (LTL) is a classical problem, finding its applications in safety-critical systems design. We present our tool SemML, which won this year's LTL realizability tracks of SYNTCOMP, after years of domination by Strix. While both tools are based on the automata-theoretic approach, ours relies heavily on (i) Semantic labelling, additional information of logical nature, coming from recent LTL-to-automata translations and decorating the resulting parity game, and (ii) Machine Learning approaches turning this information into a guidance oracle for on-the-fly exploration of the parity game (whence the name SemML). Our tool fills the missing gaps of previous suggestions to use such an oracle and provides an efficeint implementation with additional algorithmic improvements. We evaluate SemML both on the entire set of SYNTCOMP as well as a synthetic data set, compare it to Strix, and analyze the advantages and limitations. As SemML solves more instances on SYNTCOMP and does so significantly faster on larger instances, this demonstrates for the first time that machine-learning-aided approaches can out-perform state-of-the-art tools in real LTL synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuxin Zhuang, Shuxin Li, Tianji Yang, Muheng Li, Xianjie Shi, Bo An, Youzhi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: After the great achievement of solving two-player zero-sum games, more and more AI researchers focus on solving multiplayer games. To facilitate the development of designing efficient learning algorithms for solving multiplayer games, we propose a multiplayer game platform for solving Urban Network Security Games (\textbf{UNSG}) that model real-world scenarios. That is, preventing criminal activity is a highly significant responsibility assigned to police officers in cities, and police officers have to allocate their limited security resources to interdict the escaping criminal when a crime takes place in a city. This interaction between multiple police officers and the escaping criminal can be modeled as a UNSG. The variants of UNSGs can model different real-world settings, e.g., whether real-time information is available or not, and whether police officers can communicate or not. The main challenges of solving this game include the large size of the game and the co-existence of cooperation and competition. While previous efforts have been made to tackle UNSGs, they have been hampered by performance and scalability issues. Therefore, we propose an open-source UNSG platform (\textbf{GraphChase}) for designing efficient learning algorithms for solving UNSGs. Specifically, GraphChase offers a unified and flexible game environment for modeling various variants of UNSGs, supporting the development, testing, and benchmarking of algorithms. We believe that GraphChase not only facilitates the development of efficient algorithms for solving real-world problems but also paves the way for significant advancements in algorithmic development for solving general multiplayer games.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Silvia Tulli, Stylianos Loukas Vasileiou, Mohamed Chetouani, Sarath Sreedharan</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the significant challenges to generating value-aligned behavior is to not only account for the specified user objectives but also any implicit or unspecified user requirements. The existence of such implicit requirements could be particularly common in settings where the user's understanding of the task model may differ from the agent's estimate of the model. Under this scenario, the user may incorrectly expect some agent behavior to be inevitable or guaranteed. This paper addresses such expectation mismatch in the presence of differing models by capturing the possibility of unspecified user subgoal in the context of a task captured as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and querying for it as required. Our method identifies bottleneck states and uses them as candidates for potential implicit subgoals. We then introduce a querying strategy that will generate the minimal number of queries required to identify a policy guaranteed to achieve the underlying goal. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in inferring and achieving unstated goals across various tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher D. Rosin</p>
<p>Abstract: The Handbook of Combinatorial Designs catalogs many types of combinatorial designs, together with lists of open instances for which existence has not yet been determined. We develop a constructive protocol CPro1, which uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code that constructs combinatorial designs and resolves some of these open instances. The protocol starts from a definition of a particular type of design, and a verifier that reliably confirms whether a proposed design is valid. The LLM selects strategies and implements them in code, and scaffolding provides automated hyperparameter tuning and execution feedback using the verifier. Most generated code fails, but by generating many candidates, the protocol automates exploration of a variety of standard methods (e.g. simulated annealing, genetic algorithms) and experimentation with variations (e.g. cost functions) to find successful approaches. Testing on 16 different types of designs, CPro1 constructs solutions to open instances for 6 of them: Symmetric and Skew Weighing Matrices, Equidistant Permutation Arrays, Packing Arrays, Balanced Ternary Designs, and Florentine Rectangles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zuguang Li, Wen Wu, Shaohua Wu, Qiaohua Lin, Yaping Sun, Hui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large models (LMs) have immense potential in Internet of Things (IoT) systems, enabling applications such as intelligent voice assistants, predictive maintenance, and healthcare monitoring. However, training LMs on edge servers raises data privacy concerns, while deploying them directly on IoT devices is constrained by limited computational and memory resources. We analyze the key challenges of training LMs in IoT systems, including energy constraints, latency requirements, and device heterogeneity, and propose potential solutions such as dynamic resource management, adaptive model partitioning, and clustered collaborative training. Furthermore, we propose a split knowledge distillation framework to efficiently distill LMs into smaller, deployable versions for IoT devices while ensuring raw data remains local. This framework integrates knowledge distillation and split learning to minimize energy consumption and meet low model training delay requirements. A case study is presented to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaojie Hu, Qiang Zhou, Qihong Chen, Xiaopeng Li, Linbo Liu, Dejiao Zhang, Amit Kachroo, Talha Oz, Omer Tripp</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce QualityFlow, a dynamic agentic workflow for program synthesis. Given the English description of a programming problem and a set of unit tests, the model's goal is to synthesize the correct program that solves the problem and passes the tests. QualityFlow consists of multiple large language model (LLM) agents that resemble a software development team, including code generation, testing, and self-debugging. Existing program synthesis methods face three major limitations: assumption of visible unit test conformity, bottleneck of synthesized test quality, and deviation of self-debugging trajectory. To address them, we propose the LLM Quality Checker, which explicitly "imagines" whether the synthesized programs' execution would conform to the unit tests. The Quality Checks dynamically control the workflow, including actions to submit the final answer, clarify the problem statement, and revert previous workflow steps. As a result, our Quality Checker can precisely accept any correct program, mitigate faulty synthesized tests, and prevent potential workflow deviation. The success of the Quality Checker further enables Diversified Prompting, which encourages variations in LLM responses to maximize the possibility that a correct program appears and passes the quality check. In experiments, QualityFlow establishes the state-of-the-art results on four program synthesis benchmarks: MBPP, HumanEval, and the stricter evaluations of both MBPP and HumanEval from EvalPlus. Our systematic analysis shows that the dynamic workflow controlled by LLM quality checks can outperform static workflows and single-attempt zero-shot synthesis. The Quality Checker is the center of our investigation, and we dissect its individual performance and integrated impact on the workflow accuracy, as well as other ablations experiments to justify our workflow design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lishuang Wang, Zhihong Wu, Kebin Sun, Zhuozhao Li, Ran Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Tree-based Genetic Programming (TGP) is a key evolutionary algorithm widely used in symbolic regression, feature engineering, and scientific modeling. Its high computational demands make GPU acceleration essential for scalable and high-performance evolutionary computation. However, GPU acceleration of TGP faces three key challenges: inefficient tree encoding, highly heterogeneous genetic operations, and limited parallelism in fitness evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce EvoGP, a comprehensive GPU-accelerated TGP framework. First, we design a tensorized encoding scheme to represent tree with different structures as tensors with the same shape, optimizing memory access and enabling efficient parallel execution. Second, we propose a unified parallel framework for genetic operations by leveraging shared computational primitives and implementing dedicated CUDA kernels for scalable performance. Third, we present a fully parallel fitness evaluation strategy for symbolic regression, exploiting both population-level and data-level parallelism to maximize GPU utilization. Moreover, we implement a comprehensive library to provide rich algorithm operators and benchmark problems. EvoGP is extensively tested on various tasks, including symbolic regression, classification, and robotics control, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across diverse application scenarios. Experimental results show that EvoGP achieves up to a 140.89x speedup over the state-of-the-art GPU-based TGP implementation, while maintaining or exceeding the accuracy of baseline methods. EvoGP is open-source and accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/evogp.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jethro Odeyemi, Wenjun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the performance of four randomized optimization algorithms: Randomized Hill Climbing (RHC), Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and MIMIC (Mutual Information Maximizing Input Clustering), across three distinct types of problems: binary, permutation, and combinatorial. We systematically compare these algorithms using a set of benchmark fitness functions that highlight the specific challenges and requirements of each problem category. Our study analyzes each algorithm's effectiveness based on key performance metrics, including solution quality, convergence speed, computational cost, and robustness. Results show that while MIMIC and GA excel in producing high-quality solutions for binary and combinatorial problems, their computational demands vary significantly. RHC and SA, while computationally less expensive, demonstrate limited performance in complex problem landscapes. The findings offer valuable insights into the trade-offs between different optimization strategies and provide practical guidance for selecting the appropriate algorithm based on the type of problems, accuracy requirements, and computational constraints.</p>

<p>Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize subtle differences in meaning or the combination of states and objects through the use of known and unknown concepts during training. Existing methods either focused on prompt configuration or on using prompts to tune the pre-trained Vision-Language model. However, these methods faced challenges in accurately identifying subtle differences in meaning or combining states with objects. To jointly eradicate the above issues and construct an efficient and effective CZSL technique, we suggest a method to improve attribute recognition performance by utilizing diverse Prompt Learning with an Inter/Intra-Modality Fusion Synthesizer in scene understanding involving subtle semantic differences and multiple objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Glass, Mustafa Eyceoz, Dharmashankar Subramanian, Gaetano Rossiello, Long Vu, Alfio Gliozzo</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-SQL is emerging as a practical interface for real world databases. The dominant paradigm for Text-to-SQL is cross-database or schema-independent, supporting application schemas unseen during training. The schema of a database defines the tables, columns, column types and foreign key connections between tables. Real world schemas can be large, containing hundreds of columns, but for any particular query only a small fraction will be relevant. Placing the entire schema in the prompt for an LLM can be impossible for models with smaller token windows and expensive even when the context window is large enough to allow it. Even apart from computational considerations, the accuracy of the model can be improved by focusing the SQL generation on only the relevant portion of the database. Schema linking identifies the portion of the database schema useful for the question. Previous work on schema linking has used graph neural networks, generative LLMs, and cross encoder classifiers. We introduce a new approach to adapt decoder-only LLMs to schema linking that is both computationally more efficient and more accurate than the generative approach. Additionally our extractive approach permits fine-grained control over the precision-recall trade-off for schema linking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ammarah Irum, M. Ali Tahir</p>
<p>Abstract: Document level Urdu Sentiment Analysis (SA) is a challenging Natural Language Processing (NLP) task as it deals with large documents in a resource-poor language. In large documents, there are ample amounts of words that exhibit different viewpoints. Deep learning (DL) models comprise of complex neural network architectures that have the ability to learn diverse features of the data to classify various sentiments. Besides audio, image and video classification; DL algorithms are now extensively used in text-based classification problems. To explore the powerful DL techniques for Urdu SA, we have applied five different DL architectures namely, Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Convolutional Neural Network with Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (CNN-BiLSTM), Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer (BERT). In this paper, we have proposed a DL hybrid model that integrates BiLSTM with Single Layer Multi Filter Convolutional Neural Network (BiLSTM-SLMFCNN). The proposed and baseline techniques are applied on Urdu Customer Support data set and IMDB Urdu movie review data set by using pretrained Urdu word embeddings that are suitable for (SA) at the document level. Results of these techniques are evaluated and our proposed model outperforms all other DL techniques for Urdu SA. BiLSTM-SLMFCNN outperformed the baseline DL models and achieved 83{\%}, 79{\%}, 83{\%} and 94{\%} accuracy on small, medium and large sized IMDB Urdu movie review data set and Urdu Customer Support data set respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marc Ballestero-Rib\'o, Daniel Ortiz-Mart\'inez</p>
<p>Abstract: The dream of achieving a student-teacher ratio of 1:1 is closer than ever thanks to the emergence of large language models (LLMs). One potential application of these models in the educational field would be to provide feedback to students in university introductory programming courses, so that a student struggling to solve a basic implementation problem could seek help from an LLM available 24/7. This article focuses on studying three aspects related to such an application. First, the performance of two well-known models, GPT-3.5T and GPT-4T, in providing feedback to students is evaluated. The empirical results showed that GPT-4T performs much better than GPT-3.5T, however, it is not yet ready for use in a real-world scenario. This is due to the possibility of generating incorrect information that potential users may not always be able to detect. Second, the article proposes a carefully designed prompt using in-context learning techniques that allows automating important parts of the evaluation process, as well as providing a lower bound for the fraction of feedbacks containing incorrect information, saving time and effort. This was possible because the resulting feedback has a programmatically analyzable structure that incorporates diagnostic information about the LLM's performance in solving the requested task. Third, the article also suggests a possible strategy for implementing a practical learning tool based on LLMs, which is rooted on the proposed prompting techniques. This strategy opens up a whole range of interesting possibilities from a pedagogical perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Salinas, Omar Swelam, Frank Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often requires costly human annotations. To address this, LLM-based judges have been proposed, which compare the outputs of two LLMs enabling the ranking of models without human intervention. While several approaches have been proposed, many confounding factors are present between different papers. For instance the model, the prompt and other hyperparameters are typically changed at the same time making apple-to-apple comparisons challenging. In this paper, we propose to systematically analyze and tune hyperparameter of LLM judges. To alleviate the high cost of evaluating a judge, we propose to leverage multi-objective multi-fidelity which allows to find judges that trades accuracy for cost and also reduce significantly the cost of the search. Our method identifies judges that not only outperform existing benchmarks in accuracy and cost-efficiency but also utilize open-weight models, ensuring greater accessibility and reproducibility.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emotional support dialogue systems aim to reduce help-seekers' distress and help them overcome challenges. While human values$\unicode{x2013}$core beliefs that shape an individual's priorities$\unicode{x2013}$are increasingly emphasized in contemporary psychological therapy for their role in fostering internal transformation and long-term emotional well-being, their integration into emotional support systems remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present a value-driven method for training emotional support dialogue systems designed to reinforce positive values in seekers. Our model learns to identify which values to reinforce at each turn and how to do so, by leveraging online support conversations from Reddit. The model demonstrated superior performance in emotional support capabilities, outperforming various baselines. Notably, it more effectively explored and elicited values from seekers. Expert assessments by therapists highlighted two key strengths of our model: its ability to validate users' challenges and its effectiveness in emphasizing positive aspects of their situations$\unicode{x2013}$both crucial elements of value reinforcement. Our work validates the effectiveness of value reinforcement for emotional support systems and establishes a foundation for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beiming Liu, Zhizhuo Cui, Siteng Hu, Xiaohua Li, Haifeng Lin, Zhengxin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Aerospace manufacturing demands exceptionally high precision in technical parameters. The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and QWen, in Natural Language Processing has sparked industry interest in their application to tasks including process design, material selection, and tool information retrieval. However, LLMs are prone to generating "hallucinations" in specialized domains, producing inaccurate or false information that poses significant risks to the quality of aerospace products and flight safety. This paper introduces a set of evaluation metrics tailored for LLMs in aerospace manufacturing, aiming to assess their accuracy by analyzing their performance in answering questions grounded in professional knowledge. Firstly, key information is extracted through in-depth textual analysis of classic aerospace manufacturing textbooks and guidelines. Subsequently, utilizing LLM generation techniques, we meticulously construct multiple-choice questions with multiple correct answers of varying difficulty. Following this, different LLM models are employed to answer these questions, and their accuracy is recorded. Experimental results demonstrate that the capabilities of LLMs in aerospace professional knowledge are in urgent need of improvement. This study provides a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for the application of LLMs in aerospace manufacturing, addressing a critical gap in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Hyun Park, Utsawb Laminchhane, Umer Farooq, Uma Sivakumar, Arpan Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized for machine translation, yet their predictions often exhibit uncertainties that hinder interpretability and user trust. Effectively visualizing these uncertainties can enhance the usability of LLM outputs, particularly in contexts where translation accuracy is critical. This paper addresses two primary objectives: (1) providing users with token-level insights into model confidence and (2) developing a web-based visualization tool to quantify and represent translation uncertainties. To achieve these goals, we utilized the T5 model with the WMT19 dataset for translation tasks and evaluated translation quality using established metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE. We introduced three novel uncertainty quantification (UQ) metrics: (1) the geometric mean of token probabilities, (2) the arithmetic mean of token probabilities, and (3) the arithmetic mean of the kurtosis of token distributions. These metrics provide a simple yet effective framework for evaluating translation performance. Our analysis revealed a linear relationship between the traditional evaluation metrics and our UQ metrics, demonstrating the validity of our approach. Additionally, we developed an interactive web-based visualization that uses a color gradient to represent token confidence. This tool offers users a clear and intuitive understanding of translation quality while providing valuable insights into model performance. Overall, we show that our UQ metrics and visualization are both robust and interpretable, offering practical tools for evaluating and accessing machine translation systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Atla Selene Mini, a state-of-the-art small language model-as-a-judge (SLMJ). Selene Mini is a general-purpose evaluator that outperforms the best SLMJs and GPT-4o-mini on overall performance across 11 out-of-distribution benchmarks, spanning absolute scoring, classification, and pairwise preference tasks. It is the highest-scoring 8B generative model on RewardBench, surpassing strong baselines like GPT-4o and specialized judges. To achieve this, we develop a principled data curation strategy that augments public datasets with synthetically generated critiques and ensures high quality through filtering and dataset ablations. We train our model on a combined direct preference optimization (DPO) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss, and produce a highly promptable evaluator that excels in real-world scenarios. Selene Mini shows dramatically improved zero-shot agreement with human expert evaluations on financial and medical industry datasets. It is also robust to variations in prompt format. Preliminary results indicate that Selene Mini is the top-ranking evaluator in a live, community-driven Judge Arena. We release the model weights on HuggingFace (https://hf.co/AtlaAI/Selene-1-Mini-Llama-3.1-8B) and Ollama to encourage widespread community adoption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Denis Federiakin</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has necessitated the creation of benchmarks to evaluate their performance. These benchmarks resemble human tests and surveys, as they consist of sets of questions designed to measure emergent properties in the cognitive behavior of these systems. However, unlike the well-defined traits and abilities studied in social sciences, the properties measured by these benchmarks are often vaguer and less rigorously defined. The most prominent benchmarks are often grouped into leaderboards for convenience, aggregating performance metrics and enabling comparisons between models. Unfortunately, these leaderboards typically rely on simplistic aggregation methods, such as taking the average score across benchmarks. In this paper, we demonstrate the advantages of applying contemporary psychometric methodologies - originally developed for human tests and surveys - to improve the ranking of large language models on leaderboards. Using data from the Hugging Face Leaderboard as an example, we compare the results of the conventional naive ranking approach with a psychometrically informed ranking. The findings highlight the benefits of adopting psychometric techniques for more robust and meaningful evaluation of LLM performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Functional brain connectome is crucial for deciphering the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive functions and neurological disorders. Graph deep learning models have recently gained tremendous popularity in this field. However, their actual effectiveness in modeling the brain connectome remains unclear. In this study, we re-examine graph deep learning models based on four large-scale neuroimaging studies encompassing diverse cognitive and clinical outcomes. Surprisingly, we find that the message aggregation mechanism, a hallmark of graph deep learning models, does not help with predictive performance as typically assumed, but rather consistently degrades it. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid model combining a linear model with a graph attention network through dual pathways, achieving robust predictions and enhanced interpretability by revealing both localized and global neural connectivity patterns. Our findings urge caution in adopting complex deep learning models for functional brain connectome analysis, emphasizing the need for rigorous experimental designs to establish tangible performance gains and perhaps more importantly, to pursue improvements in model interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadreza Saraei, Igor Kozak, Eung-Joo Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging modality essential for diagnosing various eye diseases. Despite its clinical significance, developing OCT-based diagnostic tools faces challenges, such as limited public datasets, sparse annotations, and privacy concerns. Although deep learning has made progress in automating OCT analysis, these challenges remain unresolved. To address these limitations, we introduce the Vision Transformer-based Dual-Stream Self-Supervised Pretraining Network (ViT-2SPN), a novel framework designed to enhance feature extraction and improve diagnostic accuracy. ViT-2SPN employs a three-stage workflow: Supervised Pretraining, Self-Supervised Pretraining (SSP), and Supervised Fine-Tuning. The pretraining phase leverages the OCTMNIST dataset (97,477 unlabeled images across four disease classes) with data augmentation to create dual-augmented views. A Vision Transformer (ViT-Base) backbone extracts features, while a negative cosine similarity loss aligns feature representations. Pretraining is conducted over 50 epochs with a learning rate of 0.0001 and momentum of 0.999. Fine-tuning is performed on a stratified 5.129% subset of OCTMNIST using 10-fold cross-validation. ViT-2SPN achieves a mean AUC of 0.93, accuracy of 0.77, precision of 0.81, recall of 0.75, and an F1 score of 0.76, outperforming existing SSP-based methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background: The radiation oncology clinical practice involves many steps relying on the dynamic interplay of abundant text data. Large language models have displayed remarkable capabilities in processing complex text information. But their direct applications in specific fields like radiation oncology remain underexplored.
  Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether fine-tuning LLMs with domain knowledge can improve the performance on Task (1) treatment regimen generation, Task (2) treatment modality selection (photon, proton, electron, or brachytherapy), and Task (3) ICD-10 code prediction in radiation oncology.
  Methods: Data for 15,724 patient cases were extracted. Cases where patients had a single diagnostic record, and a clearly identifiable primary treatment plan were selected for preprocessing and manual annotation to have 7,903 cases of the patient diagnosis, treatment plan, treatment modality, and ICD-10 code. Each case was used to construct a pair consisting of patient diagnostics details and an answer (treatment regimen, treatment modality, or ICD-10 code respectively) for the supervised fine-tuning of these three tasks. Open source LLaMA2-7B and Mistral-7B models were utilized for the fine-tuning with the Low-Rank Approximations method. Accuracy and ROUGE-1 score were reported for the fine-tuned models and original models. Clinical evaluation was performed on Task (1) by radiation oncologists, while precision, recall, and F-1 score were evaluated for Task (2) and (3). One-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to statistically analyze the results.
  Results: Fine-tuned LLMs outperformed original LLMs across all tasks with p-value <= 0.001. Clinical evaluation demonstrated that over 60% of the fine-tuned LLMs-generated treatment regimens were clinically acceptable. Precision, recall, and F1-score showed improved performance of fine-tuned LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is undergoing a paradigm shift, with systems based on fine-tuned large language models (LLM) becoming increasingly competitive with traditional encoder-decoder models trained specifically for translation tasks. However, LLM-based systems are at a higher risk of generating hallucinations, which can severely undermine user's trust and safety. Most prior research on hallucination mitigation focuses on traditional MT models, with solutions that involve post-hoc mitigation - detecting hallucinated translations and re-translating them. While effective, this approach introduces additional complexity in deploying extra tools in production and also increases latency. To address these limitations, we propose a method that intrinsically learns to mitigate hallucinations during the model training phase. Specifically, we introduce a data creation framework to generate hallucination focused preference datasets. Fine-tuning LLMs on these preference datasets reduces the hallucination rate by an average of 96% across five language pairs, while preserving overall translation quality. In a zero-shot setting our approach reduces hallucinations by 89% on an average across three unseen target languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: Physical simulations are essential tools across critical fields such as mechanical and aerospace engineering, chemistry, meteorology, etc. While neural operators, particularly the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), have shown promise in predicting simulation results with impressive performance and efficiency, they face limitations when handling real-world scenarios involving coupled multi-physics outputs. Current neural operator methods either overlook the correlations between multiple physical processes or employ simplistic architectures that inadequately capture these relationships. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel coupled multi-physics neural operator learning (COMPOL) framework that extends the capabilities of Fourier operator layers to model interactions among multiple physical processes. Our approach implements feature aggregation through recurrent and attention mechanisms, enabling comprehensive modeling of coupled interactions. Our method's core is an innovative system for aggregating latent features from multi-physics processes. These aggregated features serve as enriched information sources for neural operator layers, allowing our framework to capture complex physical relationships accurately. We evaluated our coupled multi-physics neural operator across diverse physical simulation tasks, including biological systems, fluid mechanics, and multiphase flow in porous media. Our proposed model demonstrates a two to three-fold improvement in predictive performance compared to existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddharth Swaroop, Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan, Finale Doshi-Velez</p>
<p>Abstract: We provide new connections between two distinct federated learning approaches based on (i) ADMM and (ii) Variational Bayes (VB), and propose new variants by combining their complementary strengths. Specifically, we show that the dual variables in ADMM naturally emerge through the 'site' parameters used in VB with isotropic Gaussian covariances. Using this, we derive two versions of ADMM from VB that use flexible covariances and functional regularisation, respectively. Through numerical experiments, we validate the improvements obtained in performance. The work shows connection between two fields that are believed to be fundamentally different and combines them to improve federated learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyu Derek Ma, Xiaoxuan Wang, Yijia Xiao, Anthony Cuturrufo, Vijay S Nori, Eran Halperin, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical diagnosis prediction models, when provided with a patient's medical history, aim to detect potential diseases early, facilitating timely intervention and improving prognostic outcomes. However, the inherent scarcity of patient data and large disease candidate space often pose challenges in developing satisfactory models for this intricate task. The exploration of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for encapsulating clinical decision processes has been limited. We introduce MERA, a clinical diagnosis prediction model that bridges pertaining natural language knowledge with medical practice. We apply hierarchical contrastive learning on a disease candidate ranking list to alleviate the large decision space issue. With concept memorization through fine-tuning, we bridge the natural language clinical knowledge with medical codes. Experimental results on MIMIC-III and IV datasets show that MERA achieves the state-of-the-art diagnosis prediction performance and dramatically elevates the diagnosis prediction capabilities of generative LMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashish Bastola, Hao Wang, Abolfazl Razi</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical requirement for ensuring safety in autonomous driving. In this work, we leverage Cooperative Perception to share information across nearby vehicles, enabling more accurate identification and consensus of anomalous behaviors in complex traffic scenarios. To account for the real-world challenge of imperfect communication, we propose a cooperative-perception-based anomaly detection framework (CPAD), which is a robust architecture that remains effective under communication interruptions, thereby facilitating reliable performance even in low-bandwidth settings. Since no multi-agent anomaly detection dataset exists for vehicle trajectories, we introduce 15,000 different scenarios with a 90,000 trajectories benchmark dataset generated through rule-based vehicle dynamics analysis. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach outperforms standard anomaly classification methods in F1-score, AUC and showcase strong robustness to agent connection interruptions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyu Derek Ma, Yanna Ding, Zijie Huang, Jianxi Gao, Yizhou Sun, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Language Models rely on autoregressive decoding to produce the output sequence token by token. Many tasks such as preference optimization, require the model to produce task-level output consisting of multiple tokens directly by selecting candidates from a pool as predictions. Determining a task-level prediction from candidates using the ordinary token-level decoding mechanism is constrained by time-consuming decoding and interrupted gradients by discrete token selection. Existing works have been using decoding-free candidate selection methods to obtain candidate probability from initial output logits over vocabulary. Though these estimation methods are widely used, they are not systematically evaluated, especially on end tasks. We introduce an evaluation of a comprehensive collection of decoding-free candidate selection approaches on a comprehensive set of tasks, including five multiple-choice QA tasks with a small candidate pool and four clinical decision tasks with a massive amount of candidates, some with 10k+ options. We evaluate the estimation methods paired with a wide spectrum of foundation LMs covering different architectures, sizes and training paradigms. The results and insights from our analysis inform the future model design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongyu Qu, Ritchie Zhao, Ye Yu, Bin Liu, Tianyuan Yao, Junchao Zhu, Bennett A. Landman, Yucheng Tang, Yuankai Huo</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantizing deep neural networks ,reducing the precision (bit-width) of their computations, can remarkably decrease memory usage and accelerate processing, making these models more suitable for large-scale medical imaging applications with limited computational resources. However, many existing methods studied "fake quantization", which simulates lower precision operations during inference, but does not actually reduce model size or improve real-world inference speed. Moreover, the potential of deploying real 3D low-bit quantization on modern GPUs is still unexplored. In this study, we introduce a real post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that successfully implements true 8-bit quantization on state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D medical segmentation models, i.e., U-Net, SegResNet, SwinUNETR, nnU-Net, UNesT, TransUNet, ST-UNet,and VISTA3D. Our approach involves two main steps. First, we use TensorRT to perform fake quantization for both weights and activations with unlabeled calibration dataset. Second, we convert this fake quantization into real quantization via TensorRT engine on real GPUs, resulting in real-world reductions in model size and inference latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively performs 8-bit quantization on GPUs without sacrificing model performance. This advancement enables the deployment of efficient deep learning models in medical imaging applications where computational resources are constrained. The code and models have been released, including U-Net, TransUNet pretrained on the BTCV dataset for abdominal (13-label) segmentation, UNesT pretrained on the Whole Brain Dataset for whole brain (133-label) segmentation, and nnU-Net, SegResNet, SwinUNETR and VISTA3D pretrained on TotalSegmentator V2 for full body (104-label) segmentation. https://github.com/hrlblab/PTQ.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Tauhidul Islam, Lei Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in deep learning are revolutionizing science and engineering. The immense success of deep learning is largely due to its ability to extract essential high-dimensional (HD) features from input data and make inference decisions based on this information. However, current deep neural network (DNN) models face several challenges, such as the requirements of extensive amounts of data and computational resources. Here, we introduce a new learning scheme, referred to as deep-and-wide learning (DWL), to systematically capture features not only within individual input data (intra-data features) but also across the data (inter-data features). Furthermore, we propose a dual-interactive-channel network (D-Net) to realize the DWL, which leverages our Bayesian formulation of low-dimensional (LD) inter-data feature extraction and its synergistic interaction with the conventional HD representation of the dataset, for substantially enhanced computational efficiency and inference. The proposed technique has been applied to data across various disciplines for both classification and regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that DWL surpasses state-of-the-art DNNs in accuracy by a substantial margin with limited training data and improves the computational efficiency by order(s) of magnitude. The proposed DWL strategy dramatically alters the data-driven learning techniques, including emerging large foundation models, and sheds significant insights into the evolving field of AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksandar Petrov, Shruti Agarwal, Philip H. S. Torr, Adel Bibi, John Collomosse</p>
<p>Abstract: Watermarking, the practice of embedding imperceptible information into media such as images, videos, audio, and text, is essential for intellectual property protection, content provenance and attribution. The growing complexity of digital ecosystems necessitates watermarks for different uses to be embedded in the same media. However, to detect and decode all watermarks, they need to coexist well with one another. We perform the first study of coexistence of deep image watermarking methods and, contrary to intuition, we find that various open-source watermarks can coexist with only minor impacts on image quality and decoding robustness. The coexistence of watermarks also opens the avenue for ensembling watermarking methods. We show how ensembling can increase the overall message capacity and enable new trade-offs between capacity, accuracy, robustness and image quality, without needing to retrain the base models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Srikanth Thudumu, Hy Nguyen, Hung Du, Nhat Duong, Zafaryab Rasool, Rena Logothetis, Scott Barnett, Rajesh Vasa, Kon Mouzakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to automate the design of deep neural networks. However, existing NAS techniques often focus on maximising accuracy, neglecting model efficiency. This limitation restricts their use in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices and edge computing systems. Moreover, current evaluation metrics prioritise performance over efficiency, lacking a balanced approach for assessing architectures suitable for constrained scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the M-factor, a novel metric combining model accuracy and size. Four diverse NAS techniques are compared: Policy-Based Reinforcement Learning, Regularised Evolution, Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE), and Multi-trial Random Search. These techniques represent different NAS paradigms, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the M-factor. The study analyses ResNet configurations on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with a search space of 19,683 configurations. Experiments reveal that Policy-Based Reinforcement Learning and Regularised Evolution achieved M-factor values of 0.84 and 0.82, respectively, while Multi-trial Random Search attained 0.75, and TPE reached 0.67. Policy-Based Reinforcement Learning exhibited performance changes after 39 trials, while Regularised Evolution optimised within 20 trials. The research investigates the optimisation dynamics and trade-offs between accuracy and model size for each strategy. Findings indicate that, in some cases, random search performed comparably to more complex algorithms when assessed using the M-factor. These results highlight how the M-factor addresses the limitations of existing metrics by guiding NAS towards balanced architectures, offering valuable insights for selecting strategies in scenarios requiring both performance and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prashant Pilla, Raji Mekonen</p>
<p>Abstract: With the volatile and complex nature of financial data influenced by external factors, forecasting the stock market is challenging. Traditional models such as ARIMA and GARCH perform well with linear data but struggle with non-linear dependencies. Machine learning and deep learning models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, address these challenges by capturing intricate patterns and long-term dependencies. This report compares ARIMA and LSTM models in predicting the S&P 500 index, a major financial benchmark.
  Using historical price data and technical indicators, we evaluated these models using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The ARIMA model showed reasonable performance with an MAE of 462.1, RMSE of 614, and 89.8 percent accuracy, effectively capturing short-term trends but limited by its linear assumptions. The LSTM model, leveraging sequential processing capabilities, outperformed ARIMA with an MAE of 369.32, RMSE of 412.84, and 92.46 percent accuracy, capturing both short- and long-term dependencies. Notably, the LSTM model without additional features performed best, achieving an MAE of 175.9, RMSE of 207.34, and 96.41 percent accuracy, showcasing its ability to handle market data efficiently.
  Accurately predicting stock movements is crucial for investment strategies, risk assessments, and market stability. Our findings confirm the potential of deep learning models in handling volatile financial data compared to traditional ones. The results highlight the effectiveness of LSTM and suggest avenues for further improvements. This study provides insights into financial forecasting, offering a comparative analysis of ARIMA and LSTM while outlining their strengths and limitations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamel Abdous, Nairouz Mrabah, Mohamed Bouguessa</p>
<p>Abstract: High-dimensional multiplex graphs are characterized by their high number of complementary and divergent dimensions. The existence of multiple hierarchical latent relations between the graph dimensions poses significant challenges to embedding methods. In particular, the geometric distortions that might occur in the representational space have been overlooked in the literature. This work studies the problem of high-dimensional multiplex graph embedding from a geometric perspective. We find that the node representations reside on highly curved manifolds, thus rendering their exploitation more challenging for downstream tasks. Moreover, our study reveals that increasing the number of graph dimensions can cause further distortions to the highly curved manifolds. To address this problem, we propose a novel multiplex graph embedding method that harnesses hierarchical dimension embedding and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks. The proposed approach hierarchically extracts hyperbolic node representations that reside on Riemannian manifolds while gradually learning fewer and more expressive latent dimensions of the multiplex graph. Experimental results on real-world high-dimensional multiplex graphs show that the synergy between hierarchical and hyperbolic embeddings incurs much fewer geometric distortions and brings notable improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Fang, Paul Weng, Yutong Ban</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved promising results in solving online 3D Bin Packing Problems (3D-BPP). However, these DRL-based policies may perform poorly on new instances due to distribution shift. Besides generalization, we also consider adaptation, completely overlooked by previous work, which aims at rapidly finetuning these policies to a new test distribution. To tackle both generalization and adaptation issues, we propose Adaptive Selection After Pruning (ASAP), which decomposes a solver's decision-making into two policies, one for pruning and one for selection. The role of the pruning policy is to remove inherently bad actions, which allows the selection policy to choose among the remaining most valuable actions. To learn these policies, we propose a training scheme based on a meta-learning phase of both policies followed by a finetuning phase of the sole selection policy to rapidly adapt it to a test distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that ASAP exhibits excellent generalization and adaptation capabilities on in-distribution and out-of-distribution instances under both discrete and continuous setup.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengpeng Xie, Jiahang Cao, Yulong Zhang, Qiang Zhang, Renjing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, empowered with the powerful capabilities of neural networks, reinforcement learning (RL) has successfully tackled numerous challenging tasks. However, while these models demonstrate enhanced decision-making abilities, they are increasingly prone to overfitting. For instance, a trained RL model often fails to generalize to even minor variations of the same task, such as a change in background color or other minor semantic differences. To address this issue, we propose a dual-agent adversarial policy learning framework, which allows agents to spontaneously learn the underlying semantics without introducing any human prior knowledge. Specifically, our framework involves a game process between two agents: each agent seeks to maximize the impact of perturbing on the opponent's policy by producing representation differences for the same state, while maintaining its own stability against such perturbations. This interaction encourages agents to learn generalizable policies, capable of handling irrelevant features from the high-dimensional observations. Extensive experimental results on the Procgen benchmark demonstrate that the adversarial process significantly improves the generalization performance of both agents, while also being applied to various RL algorithms, e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). With the adversarial framework, the RL agent outperforms the baseline methods by a significant margin, especially in hard-level tasks, marking a significant step forward in the generalization capabilities of deep reinforcement learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Richard Katrix, Quentin Carroway, Rowan Hawkesbury, Matthias Heathfield</p>
<p>Abstract: Context-aware processing mechanisms have increasingly become a critical area of exploration for improving the semantic and contextual capabilities of language generation models. The Context-Aware Semantic Recomposition Mechanism (CASRM) was introduced as a novel framework designed to address limitations in coherence, contextual adaptability, and error propagation in large-scale text generation tasks. Through the integration of dynamically generated context vectors and attention modulation layers, CASRM enhances the alignment between token-level representations and broader contextual dependencies. Experimental evaluations demonstrated significant improvements in semantic coherence across multiple domains, including technical, conversational, and narrative text. The ability to adapt to unseen domains and ambiguous inputs was evaluated using a diverse set of test scenarios, highlighting the robustness of the proposed mechanism. A detailed computational analysis revealed that while CASRM introduces additional processing overhead, the gains in linguistic precision and contextual relevance outweigh the marginal increase in complexity. The framework also successfully mitigates error propagation in sequential tasks, improving performance in dialogue continuation and multi-step text synthesis. Additional investigations into token-level attention distribution emphasized the dynamic focus shifts enabled through context-aware enhancements. The findings suggest that CASRM offers a scalable and flexible solution for integrating contextual intelligence into existing language model architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a range of multimodal tasks; however, their practical deployment is often constrained by high computational costs and prolonged inference times. Since the vision modality typically carries more information than the text modality, compressing visual prompts offers a promising solution to alleviate these challenges. Existing approaches predominantly focus on refining model architectures or directly reducing the number of visual tokens. However, these methods often compromise inference performance due to a lack of consideration for the unique spatial and temporal characteristics of visual data. In this work, we propose a token compression paradigm that operates on both spatial and temporal dimensions. Our approach includes a learning-free, plug-and-play compression pipeline that can be seamlessly integrated into most Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) frameworks. By leveraging this method, we enhance the model inference capability while simultaneously reducing its computational cost. Experimental results on the Video-QA task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing significant improvements in efficiency without sacrificing performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haodong Hong, Yanyuan Qiao, Sen Wang, Jiajun Liu, Qi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks mainly evaluate agents based on one-time execution of individual instructions across multiple environments, aiming to develop agents capable of functioning in any environment in a zero-shot manner. However, real-world navigation robots often operate in persistent environments with relatively consistent physical layouts, visual observations, and language styles from instructors. Such a gap in the task setting presents an opportunity to improve VLN agents by incorporating continuous adaptation to specific environments. To better reflect these real-world conditions, we introduce GSA-VLN, a novel task requiring agents to execute navigation instructions within a specific scene and simultaneously adapt to it for improved performance over time. To evaluate the proposed task, one has to address two challenges in existing VLN datasets: the lack of OOD data, and the limited number and style diversity of instructions for each scene. Therefore, we propose a new dataset, GSA-R2R, which significantly expands the diversity and quantity of environments and instructions for the R2R dataset to evaluate agent adaptability in both ID and OOD contexts. Furthermore, we design a three-stage instruction orchestration pipeline that leverages LLMs to refine speaker-generated instructions and apply role-playing techniques to rephrase instructions into different speaking styles. This is motivated by the observation that each individual user often has consistent signatures or preferences in their instructions. We conducted extensive experiments on GSA-R2R to thoroughly evaluate our dataset and benchmark various methods. Based on our findings, we propose a novel method, GR-DUET, which incorporates memory-based navigation graphs with an environment-specific training strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results on all GSA-R2R splits.</p>

<p>Abstract: To address the issue of interpretability in multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are introduced in 2024. However, optimizing KAN structures is labor-intensive, typically requiring manual intervention and parameter tuning. This paper proposes GA-KAN, a genetic algorithm-based approach that automates the optimization of KANs, requiring no human intervention in the design process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that evolutionary computation is explored to optimize KANs automatically. Furthermore, inspired by the use of sparse connectivity in MLPs in effectively reducing the number of parameters, GA-KAN further explores sparse connectivity to tackle the challenge of extensive parameter spaces in KANs. GA-KAN is validated on two toy datasets, achieving optimal results without the manual tuning required by the original KAN. Additionally, GA-KAN demonstrates superior performance across five classification datasets, outperforming traditional methods on all datasets and providing interpretable symbolic formulae for the Wine and Iris datasets, thereby enhancing model transparency. Furthermore, GA-KAN significantly reduces the number of parameters over the standard KAN across all the five datasets. The core contributions of GA-KAN include automated optimization, a new encoding strategy, and a new decoding process, which together improve the accuracy and interpretability, and reduce the number of parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baoming Chang, Amin Kamali, Verena Kantere</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning (ML) in query optimization to select more efficient plans. Existing learning-based query optimizers use certain model architectures to convert tree-structured query plans into representations suitable for downstream ML tasks. As the design of these architectures significantly impacts cost estimation, we propose a tree model architecture based on Bidirectional Graph Neural Networks (Bi-GNN) aggregated by Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to achieve more accurate cost estimates. The inherent uncertainty of data and model parameters also leads to inaccurate cost estimates, resulting in suboptimal plans and less robust query performance. To address this, we implement a novel learning-to-rank cost model that effectively quantifies the uncertainty in cost estimates using approximate probabilistic ML. This model adaptively integrates quantified uncertainty with estimated costs and learns from comparing pairwise plans, achieving more robust performance. In addition, we propose the first explainability technique specifically designed for learning-based cost models. This technique explains the contribution of any subgraphs in the query plan to the final predicted cost, which can be integrated and trained with any learning-based cost model to significantly boost the model's explainability. By incorporating these innovations, we propose a cost model for a Robust and Explainable Query Optimizer, Reqo, that improves the accuracy, robustness, and explainability of cost estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in all three dimensions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Li, Hirokazu Shirado, Sauvik Das</p>
<p>Abstract: While advances in fairness and alignment have helped mitigate overt biases exhibited by large language models (LLMs) when explicitly prompted, we hypothesize that these models may still exhibit implicit biases when simulating human behavior. To test this hypothesis, we propose a technique to systematically uncover such biases across a broad range of sociodemographic categories by assessing decision-making disparities among agents with LLM-generated, sociodemographically-informed personas. Using our technique, we tested six LLMs across three sociodemographic groups and four decision-making scenarios. Our results show that state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant sociodemographic disparities in nearly all simulations, with more advanced models exhibiting greater implicit biases despite reducing explicit biases. Furthermore, when comparing our findings to real-world disparities reported in empirical studies, we find that the biases we uncovered are directionally aligned but markedly amplified. This directional alignment highlights the utility of our technique in uncovering systematic biases in LLMs rather than random variations; moreover, the presence and amplification of implicit biases emphasizes the need for novel strategies to address these biases.</p>

The approach dynamically captured behavioral anomalies, offering a robust mechanism for distinguishing between benign and malicious activities in real-time scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrated the framework's effectiveness across diverse ransomware families, with consistently high precision, recall, and overall detection accuracy. Comparative evaluations highlighted its better performance over traditional signature-based and heuristic methods, particularly in handling polymorphic and previously unseen ransomware variants. The architecture was designed with scalability and modularity in mind, ensuring compatibility with enterprise-scale environments while maintaining resource efficiency. Analysis of encryption speeds, anomaly patterns, and temporal correlations provided deeper insights into the operational strategies of ransomware, validating the framework's adaptability to evolving threats. The research contributes to advancing cybersecurity technologies by integrating dynamic graph analytics and machine learning for future innovations in threat detection. Results from this study underline the potential for transforming the way organizations detect and mitigate complex cyberattacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiansheng Huang, Sihao Hu, Fatih Ilhan, Selim Furkan Tekin, Ling Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research shows that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to harmful fine-tuning attacks -- models lose their safety alignment ability after fine-tuning on a few harmful samples. For risk mitigation, a guardrail is typically used to filter out harmful samples before fine-tuning. By designing a new red-teaming method, we in this paper show that purely relying on the moderation guardrail for data filtration is not reliable. Our proposed attack method, dubbed Virus, easily bypasses the guardrail moderation by slightly modifying the harmful data. Experimental results show that the harmful data optimized by Virus is not detectable by the guardrail with up to 100\% leakage ratio, and can simultaneously achieve superior attack performance. Finally, the key message we want to convey through this paper is that: \textbf{it is reckless to consider guardrail moderation as a clutch at straws towards harmful fine-tuning attack}, as it cannot solve the inherent safety issue of the pre-trained LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/git-disl/Virus</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreya Shukla, Prajwal Gatti, Yogesh Kumar, Vikash Yadav, Anand Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer programming textbooks and software documentations often contain flowcharts to illustrate the flow of an algorithm or procedure. Modern OCR engines often tag these flowcharts as graphics and ignore them in further processing. In this paper, we work towards making flowchart images machine-interpretable by converting them to executable Python codes. To this end, inspired by the recent success in natural language to code generation literature, we present a novel transformer-based framework, namely FloCo-T5. Our model is well-suited for this task,as it can effectively learn semantics, structure, and patterns of programming languages, which it leverages to generate syntactically correct code. We also used a task-specific pre-training objective to pre-train FloCo-T5 using a large number of logic-preserving augmented code samples. Further, to perform a rigorous study of this problem, we introduce theFloCo dataset that contains 11,884 flowchart images and their corresponding Python codes. Our experiments show promising results, and FloCo-T5 clearly outperforms related competitive baselines on code generation metrics. We make our dataset and implementation publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seffi Cohen, Niv Goldshlager, Nurit Cohen-Inger, Bracha Shapira, Lior Rokach</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various natural language processing tasks but often struggle to excel uniformly in diverse or complex domains. We propose a novel ensemble method - Diverse Fingerprint Ensemble (DFPE), which leverages the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs to achieve more robust performance. Our approach involves: (1) clustering models based on response "fingerprints" patterns, (2) applying a quantile-based filtering mechanism to remove underperforming models at a per-subject level, and (3) assigning adaptive weights to remaining models based on their subject-wise validation accuracy. In experiments on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark, DFPE outperforms the best single model by 3% overall accuracy and 5% in discipline-level accuracy. This method increases the robustness and generalization of LLMs and underscores how model selection, diversity preservation, and performance-driven weighting can effectively address challenging, multi-faceted language understanding tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueyang Cang, Yuhang Liu, Xiaoteng Zhang, Erlu Zhao, Li Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: DIFF Transformer addresses the issue of irrelevant context interference by introducing a differential attention mechanism that enhances the robustness of local attention. However, it has two critical limitations: the lack of global context modeling, which is essential for identifying globally significant tokens, and numerical instability due to the absence of strict row normalization in the attention matrix. To overcome these challenges, we propose DINT Transformer, which extends DIFF Transformer by incorporating a differential-integral mechanism. By computing global importance scores and integrating them into the attention matrix, DINT Transformer improves its ability to capture global dependencies. Moreover, the unified parameter design enforces row-normalized attention matrices, improving numerical stability. Experimental results demonstrate that DINT Transformer excels in accuracy and robustness across various practical applications, such as long-context language modeling and key information retrieval. These results position DINT Transformer as a highly effective and promising architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaowei Jiang, Charles Zhou, Yiqun Duan, Ziyi Zhao, Thomas Do, Chin-Teng Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) present a promising avenue by translating neural activity directly into text, eliminating the need for physical actions. However, existing non-invasive BCI systems have not successfully covered the entire alphabet, limiting their practicality. In this paper, we propose a novel non-invasive EEG-based BCI system with Curriculum-based Neural Spelling Framework, which recognizes all 26 alphabet letters by decoding neural signals associated with handwriting first, and then apply a Generative AI (GenAI) to enhance spell-based neural language decoding tasks. Our approach combines the ease of handwriting with the accessibility of EEG technology, utilizing advanced neural decoding algorithms and pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to translate EEG patterns into text with high accuracy. This system show how GenAI can improve the performance of typical spelling-based neural language decoding task, and addresses the limitations of previous methods, offering a scalable and user-friendly solution for individuals with communication impairments, thereby enhancing inclusive communication options.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mariia Ignashina, Paulina Bondaronek, Dan Santel, John Pestian, Julia Ive</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional depression screening methods, such as the PHQ-9, are particularly challenging for children in pediatric primary care due to practical limitations. AI has the potential to help, but the scarcity of annotated datasets in mental health, combined with the computational costs of training, highlights the need for efficient, zero-shot approaches. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of state-of-the-art LLMs for depressive symptom extraction in pediatric settings (ages 6-24). This approach aims to complement traditional screening and minimize diagnostic errors.
  Our findings show that all LLMs are 60% more efficient than word match, with Flan leading in precision (average F1: 0.65, precision: 0.78), excelling in the extraction of more rare symptoms like "sleep problems" (F1: 0.92) and "self-loathing" (F1: 0.8). Phi strikes a balance between precision (0.44) and recall (0.60), performing well in categories like "Feeling depressed" (0.69) and "Weight change" (0.78). Llama 3, with the highest recall (0.90), overgeneralizes symptoms, making it less suitable for this type of analysis. Challenges include the complexity of clinical notes and overgeneralization from PHQ-9 scores. The main challenges faced by LLMs include navigating the complex structure of clinical notes with content from different times in the patient trajectory, as well as misinterpreting elevated PHQ-9 scores.
  We finally demonstrate the utility of symptom annotations provided by Flan as features in an ML algorithm, which differentiates depression cases from controls with high precision of 0.78, showing a major performance boost compared to a baseline that does not use these features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Yang, Jiaoyan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical data are common in many domains like life sciences and e-commerce, and their embeddings often play a critical role. Although hyperbolic embeddings offer a grounded approach to representing hierarchical structures in low-dimensional spaces, their utility is hindered by optimization difficulties in hyperbolic space and dependence on handcrafted structural constraints. We propose RegD, a novel Euclidean framework that addresses these limitations by representing hierarchical data as geometric regions with two new metrics: (1) depth distance, which preserves the representational power of hyperbolic spaces for hierarchical data, and (2) boundary distance, which explicitly encodes set-inclusion relationships between regions in a general way. Our empirical evaluation on diverse real-world datasets shows consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates RegD's potential for broader applications beyond hierarchy alone tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaole He, Nilay Aishwarya, Ujwal Gadiraju</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods are being proposed to help interpret and understand how AI systems reach specific predictions. Inspired by prior work on conversational user interfaces, we argue that augmenting existing XAI methods with conversational user interfaces can increase user engagement and boost user understanding of the AI system. In this paper, we explored the impact of a conversational XAI interface on users' understanding of the AI system, their trust, and reliance on the AI system. In comparison to an XAI dashboard, we found that the conversational XAI interface can bring about a better understanding of the AI system among users and higher user trust. However, users of both the XAI dashboard and conversational XAI interfaces showed clear overreliance on the AI system. Enhanced conversations powered by large language model (LLM) agents amplified over-reliance. Based on our findings, we reason that the potential cause of such overreliance is the illusion of explanatory depth that is concomitant with both XAI interfaces. Our findings have important implications for designing effective conversational XAI interfaces to facilitate appropriate reliance and improve human-AI collaboration.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqi Li, Yingli Chen, Keyang Zhou, Xiaoxiao Hu, Zilu Zheng, Yue Yan, Xinpeng Zhang, Wei Tang, Zhenxing Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Pancreatic NEuroendocrine Tumors (pNETs) are very rare endocrine neoplasms that account for less than 5% of all pancreatic malignancies, with an incidence of only 1-1.5 cases per 100,000. Early detection of pNETs is critical for improving patient survival, but the rarity of pNETs makes segmenting them from CT a very challenging problem. So far, there has not been a dataset specifically for pNETs available to researchers. To address this issue, we propose a pNETs dataset, a well-annotated Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) dataset focused exclusively on Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors, containing data from 469 patients. This is the first dataset solely dedicated to pNETs, distinguishing it from previous collections. Additionally, we provide the baseline detection networks with a new slice-wise weight loss function designed for the UNet-based model, improving the overall pNET segmentation performance. We hope that our dataset can enhance the understanding and diagnosis of pNET Tumors within the medical community, facilitate the development of more accurate diagnostic tools, and ultimately improve patient outcomes and advance the field of oncology.</p>

<p>Abstract: The insatiable appetite of Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads for computing power is pushing the industry to develop faster and more efficient accelerators. The rigidity of custom hardware, however, conflicts with the need for scalable and versatile architectures capable of catering to the needs of the evolving and heterogeneous pool of Machine Learning (ML) models in the literature. In this context, multi-chiplet architectures assembling multiple (perhaps heterogeneous) accelerators are an appealing option that is unfortunately hindered by the still rigid and inefficient chip-to-chip interconnects. In this paper, we explore the potential of wireless technology as a complement to existing wired interconnects in this multi-chiplet approach. Using an evaluation framework from the state-of-the-art, we show that wireless interconnects can lead to speedups of 10% on average and 20% maximum. We also highlight the importance of load balancing between the wired and wireless interconnects, which will be further explored in future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Pasini, Stefan Lattner, George Fazekas</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficiently compressing high-dimensional audio signals into a compact and informative latent space is crucial for various tasks, including generative modeling and music information retrieval (MIR). Existing audio autoencoders, however, often struggle to achieve high compression ratios while preserving audio fidelity and facilitating efficient downstream applications. We introduce Music2Latent2, a novel audio autoencoder that addresses these limitations by leveraging consistency models and a novel approach to representation learning based on unordered latent embeddings, which we call summary embeddings. Unlike conventional methods that encode local audio features into ordered sequences, Music2Latent2 compresses audio signals into sets of summary embeddings, where each embedding can capture distinct global features of the input sample. This enables to achieve higher reconstruction quality at the same compression ratio. To handle arbitrary audio lengths, Music2Latent2 employs an autoregressive consistency model trained on two consecutive audio chunks with causal masking, ensuring coherent reconstruction across segment boundaries. Additionally, we propose a novel two-step decoding procedure that leverages the denoising capabilities of consistency models to further refine the generated audio at no additional cost. Our experiments demonstrate that Music2Latent2 outperforms existing continuous audio autoencoders regarding audio quality and performance on downstream tasks. Music2Latent2 paves the way for new possibilities in audio compression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amey Hengle, Aswini Kumar, Anil Bandhakavi, Tanmoy Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterspeech has been popular as an effective approach to counter online hate speech, leading to increasing research interest in automated counterspeech generation using language models. However, this field lacks standardised evaluation protocols and robust automated evaluation metrics that align with human judgement. Current automatic evaluation methods, primarily based on similarity metrics, do not effectively capture the complex and independent attributes of counterspeech quality, such as contextual relevance, aggressiveness, or argumentative coherence. This has led to an increased dependency on labor-intensive human evaluations to assess automated counter-speech generation methods. To address these challenges, we introduce CSEval, a novel dataset and framework for evaluating counterspeech quality across four dimensions: contextual-relevance, aggressiveness, argument-coherence, and suitableness. Furthermore, we propose Auto-Calibrated COT for Counterspeech Evaluation (ACE), a prompt-based method with auto-calibrated chain-of-thoughts (CoT) for scoring counterspeech using large language models. Our experiments show that ACE outperforms traditional metrics like ROUGE, METEOR, and BertScore in correlating with human judgement, indicating a significant advancement in automated counterspeech evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in recent voice conversion (VC) systems, enhancing speaker similarity in zero-shot scenarios remains challenging. This challenge arises from the difficulty of generalizing and adapting speaker characteristics in speech within zero-shot environments, which is further complicated by mismatch between the training and inference processes. To address these challenges, we propose VoicePrompter, a robust zero-shot VC model that leverages in-context learning with voice prompts. VoicePrompter is composed of (1) a factorization method that disentangles speech components and (2) a DiT-based conditional flow matching (CFM) decoder that conditions on these factorized features and voice prompts. Additionally, (3) latent mixup is used to enhance in-context learning by combining various speaker features. This approach improves speaker similarity and naturalness in zero-shot VC by applying mixup to latent representations. Experimental results demonstrate that VoicePrompter outperforms existing zero-shot VC systems in terms of speaker similarity, speech intelligibility, and audio quality.

<p>Abstract: The current cycle of hype and anxiety concerning the benefits and risks to human society of Artificial Intelligence is fuelled, not only by the increasing use of generative AI and other AI tools by the general public, but also by claims made on behalf of such technology by popularizers and scientists. In particular, recent studies have claimed that Large Language Models (LLMs) can pass the Turing Test-a goal for AI since the 1950s-and therefore can "think". Large-scale impacts on society have been predicted as a result. Upon detailed examination, however, none of these studies has faithfully applied Turing's original instructions. Consequently, we conducted a rigorous Turing Test with GPT-4-Turbo that adhered closely to Turing's instructions for a three-player imitation game. We followed established scientific standards where Turing's instructions were ambiguous or missing. For example, we performed a Computer-Imitates-Human Game (CIHG) without constraining the time duration and conducted a Man-Imitates-Woman Game (MIWG) as a benchmark. All but one participant correctly identified the LLM, showing that one of today's most advanced LLMs is unable to pass a rigorous Turing Test. We conclude that recent extravagant claims for such models are unsupported, and do not warrant either optimism or concern about the social impact of thinking machines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities for task specific fine-tuning. However, in scenarios that involve multiple tasks, training a separate LoRA model for each one results in considerable inefficiency in terms of storage and inference. Moreover, existing parameter generation methods fail to capture the correlations among these tasks, making multi-task LoRA parameter generation challenging. To address these limitations, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA (ICM-LoRA), a novel approach that efficiently achieves task-specific customization of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we use training data from all tasks to train a tailored generator, Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE). CVAE takes task descriptions as inputs and produces task-aware LoRA weights as outputs. These LoRA weights are then merged with LLMs to create task-specialized models without the need for additional fine-tuning. Furthermore, we utilize in-context meta-learning for knowledge enhancement and task mapping, to capture the relationship between tasks and parameter distributions. As a result, our method achieves more accurate LoRA parameter generation for diverse tasks using CVAE. ICM-LoRA enables more accurate LoRA parameter reconstruction than current parameter reconstruction methods and is useful for implementing task-specific enhancements of LoRA parameters. At the same time, our method occupies 283MB, only 1\% storage compared with the original LoRA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haruki Sakajo, Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: Vowels are primarily characterized by tongue position. Humans have discovered these features of vowel articulation through their own experience and explicit objective observation such as using MRI. With this knowledge and our experience, we can explain and understand the relationship between tongue positions and vowels, and this knowledge is helpful for language learners to learn pronunciation. Since language models (LMs) are trained on a large amount of data that includes linguistic and medical fields, our preliminary studies indicate that an LM is able to explain the pronunciation mechanisms of vowels. However, it is unclear whether multi-modal LMs, such as vision LMs, align textual information with visual information. One question arises: do LMs associate real tongue positions with vowel articulation? In this study, we created video and image datasets from the existing real-time MRI dataset and investigated whether LMs can understand vowel articulation based on tongue positions using vision-based information. Our findings suggest that LMs exhibit potential for understanding vowels and tongue positions when reference examples are provided while they have difficulties without them.

<p>Abstract: Social media's global reach amplifies the spread of information, highlighting the need for robust Natural Language Processing tasks like stance detection across languages and modalities. Prior research predominantly focuses on text-only inputs, leaving multimodal scenarios, such as those involving both images and text, relatively underexplored. Meanwhile, the prevalence of multimodal posts has increased significantly in recent years. Although state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, their performance on multimodal and multilingual stance detection tasks remains largely unexamined. This paper evaluates state-of-the-art VLMs on a newly extended dataset covering seven languages and multimodal inputs, investigating their use of visual cues, language-specific performance, and cross-modality interactions. Our results show that VLMs generally rely more on text than images for stance detection and this trend persists across languages. Additionally, VLMs rely significantly more on text contained within the images than other visual content. Regarding multilinguality, the models studied tend to generate consistent predictions across languages whether they are explicitly multilingual or not, although there are outliers that are incongruous with macro F1, language support, and model size.</p>

We evaluate the framework on various domains, including standard planning domains like blocksworld and sliding tile puzzles, using datasets with multiple difficulty levels. Performance is assessed on syntax correctness, ensuring grammar and executability, and content correctness, verifying accurate state representation in generated PDDL problems. The proposed approach demonstrates promising results across diverse task complexities, suggesting its potential for broader applications in AI planning.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents Contourformer, a real-time contour-based instance segmentation algorithm. The method is fully based on the DETR paradigm and achieves end-to-end inference through iterative and progressive mechanisms to optimize contours. To improve efficiency and accuracy, we develop two novel techniques: sub-contour decoupling mechanisms and contour fine-grained distribution refinement.In the sub-contour decoupling mechanism, we propose a deformable attention-based module that adaptively selects sampling regions based on the current predicted contour, enabling more effective capturing of object boundary information. Additionally, we design a multi-stage optimization process to enhance segmentation precision by progressively refining sub-contours. The contour fine-grained distribution refinement technique aims to further improve the ability to express fine details of contours.These innovations enable Contourformer to achieve stable and precise segmentation for each instance while maintaining real-time performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Contourformer on multiple benchmark datasets, including SBD, COCO, and KINS. We conduct comprehensive evaluations and comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, showing significant improvements in both accuracy and inference speed.This work provides a new solution for contour-based instance segmentation tasks and lays a foundation for future research, with the potential to become a strong baseline method in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixue Zeng, Xiaoyan Zhao, Matthew Cartier, Tong Yu, Jing Wang, Xin Meng, Zhiyu Sheng, Maryam Satarpour, John M Cormack, Allison Bean, Ryan Nussbaum, Maya Maurer, Emily Landis-Walkenhorst, Dinesh Kumbhare, Kang Kim, Ajay Wasan, Jiantao Pu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel segmentation-aware joint training framework called generative reinforcement network (GRN) that integrates segmentation loss feedback to optimize both image generation and segmentation performance in a single stage. An image enhancement technique called segmentation-guided enhancement (SGE) is also developed, where the generator produces images tailored specifically for the segmentation model. Two variants of GRN were also developed, including GRN for sample-efficient learning (GRN-SEL) and GRN for semi-supervised learning (GRN-SSL). GRN's performance was evaluated using a dataset of 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans from 29 subjects. The annotations included six anatomical structures: dermis, superficial fat, superficial fascial membrane (SFM), deep fat, deep fascial membrane (DFM), and muscle. Our results show that GRN-SEL with SGE reduces labeling efforts by up to 70% while achieving a 1.98% improvement in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) compared to models trained on fully labeled datasets. GRN-SEL alone reduces labeling efforts by 60%, GRN-SSL with SGE decreases labeling requirements by 70%, and GRN-SSL alone by 60%, all while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised models. These findings suggest the effectiveness of the GRN framework in optimizing segmentation performance with significantly less labeled data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for ultrasound image analysis and reducing the burdens associated with data annotation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Sharshar, Yasser Attia, Mohammad Yaqub, Mohsen Guizani</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional remote spirometry lacks the precision required for effective pulmonary monitoring. We present a novel, non-invasive approach using multimodal predictive models that integrate RGB or thermal video data with patient metadata. Our method leverages energy-efficient Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for the regression of Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) and classification of Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), using lightweight CNNs to overcome SNN limitations in regression tasks. Multimodal data integration is improved with a Multi-Head Attention Layer, and we employ K-Fold validation and ensemble learning to boost robustness. Using thermal data, our SNN models achieve 92% accuracy on a breathing-cycle basis and 99.5% patient-wise. PEF regression models attain Relative RMSEs of 0.11 (thermal) and 0.26 (RGB), with an MAE of 4.52% for FEV1/FVC predictions, establishing state-of-the-art performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto Carlevaro, Teodoro Alamo, Fabrizio Dabbene, Maurizio Mongelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Probabilistic guarantees on the prediction of data-driven classifiers are necessary to define models that can be considered reliable. This is a key requirement for modern machine learning in which the goodness of a system is measured in terms of trustworthiness, clearly dividing what is safe from what is unsafe. The spirit of this paper is exactly in this direction. First, we introduce a formal definition of {\epsilon}-Safe Decision Region, a subset of the input space in which the prediction of a target (safe) class is probabilistically guaranteed. Second, we prove that, when data come from exponential family distributions, the form of such a region is analytically determined and controllable by design parameters, i.e. the probability of sampling the target class and the confidence on the prediction. However, the request of having exponential data is not always possible. Inspired by this limitation, we developed Multi Cost SVM, an SVM based algorithm that approximates the safe region and is also able to handle unbalanced data. The research is complemented by experiments and code available for reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aitor Arrieta, Miriam Ugarte, Pablo Valle, Jos\'e Antonio Parejo, Sergio Segura</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an integral part of our daily lives. However, they impose certain risks, including those that can harm individuals' privacy, perpetuate biases and spread misinformation. These risks highlight the need for robust safety mechanisms, ethical guidelines, and thorough testing to ensure their responsible deployment. Safety of LLMs is a key property that needs to be thoroughly tested prior the model to be deployed and accessible to the general users. This paper reports the external safety testing experience conducted by researchers from Mondragon University and University of Seville on OpenAI's new o3-mini LLM as part of OpenAI's early access for safety testing program. In particular, we apply our tool, ASTRAL, to automatically and systematically generate up to date unsafe test inputs (i.e., prompts) that helps us test and assess different safety categories of LLMs. We automatically generate and execute a total of 10,080 unsafe test input on a early o3-mini beta version. After manually verifying the test cases classified as unsafe by ASTRAL, we identify a total of 87 actual instances of unsafe LLM behavior. We highlight key insights and findings uncovered during the pre-deployment external testing phase of OpenAI's latest LLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philip Moreira Tomei, Rupal Jain, Matija Franklin</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper argues that market governance mechanisms should be considered a key approach in the governance of artificial intelligence (AI), alongside traditional regulatory frameworks. While current governance approaches have predominantly focused on regulation, we contend that market-based mechanisms offer effective incentives for responsible AI development. We examine four emerging vectors of market governance: insurance, auditing, procurement, and due diligence, demonstrating how these mechanisms can affirm the relationship between AI risk and financial risk while addressing capital allocation inefficiencies. While we do not claim that market forces alone can adequately protect societal interests, we maintain that standardised AI disclosures and market mechanisms can create powerful incentives for safe and responsible AI development. This paper urges regulators, economists, and machine learning researchers to investigate and implement market-based approaches to AI governance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keshav Bhandari, Geraint A. Wiggins, Simon Colton</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer models have made great strides in generating symbolically represented music with local coherence. However, controlling the development of motifs in a structured way with global form remains an open research area. One of the reasons for this challenge is due to the note-by-note autoregressive generation of such models, which lack the ability to correct themselves after deviations from the motif. In addition, their structural performance on datasets with shorter durations has not been studied in the literature. In this study, we propose Yin-Yang, a framework consisting of a phrase generator, phrase refiner, and phrase selector models for the development of motifs into melodies with long-term structure and controllability. The phrase refiner is trained on a novel corruption-refinement strategy which allows it to produce melodic and rhythmic variations of an original motif at generation time, thereby rectifying deviations of the phrase generator. We also introduce a new objective evaluation metric for quantifying how smoothly the motif manifests itself within the piece. Evaluation results show that our model achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art transformer models while having the advantage of being controllable and making the generated musical structure semi-interpretable, paving the way for musical analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ankush Agarwal, Ganesh S, Chaitanya Devaguptapu</p>
<p>Abstract: Answering questions that require reasoning and aggregation across both structured (tables) and unstructured (raw text) data sources presents significant challenges. Current methods rely on fine-tuning and high-quality, human-curated data, which is difficult to obtain. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results for multi-hop question answering (QA) over single-source text data in a zero-shot setting, yet exploration into multi-source Table-Text QA remains limited. In this paper, we present a novel Hybrid Graph-based approach for Table-Text QA that leverages LLMs without fine-tuning. Our method constructs a unified Hybrid Graph from textual and tabular data, pruning information based on the input question to provide the LLM with relevant context concisely. We evaluate our approach on the challenging Hybrid-QA and OTT-QA datasets using state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA-3. Our method achieves the best zero-shot performance on both datasets, improving Exact Match scores by up to 10% on Hybrid-QA and 5.4% on OTT-QA. Moreover, our approach reduces token usage by up to 53% compared to the original context.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17771">2SSP: A Two-Stage Framework for Structured Pruning of LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabrizio Sandri, Elia Cunegatti, Giovanni Iacca</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel Two-Stage framework for Structured Pruning (2SSP) for pruning Large Language Models (LLMs), which combines two different strategies of pruning, namely Width and Depth Pruning. The first stage (Width Pruning) removes entire neurons, hence their corresponding rows and columns, aiming to preserve the connectivity among the pruned structures in the intermediate state of the Feed-Forward Networks in each Transformer block. This is done based on an importance score measuring the impact of each neuron over the output magnitude. The second stage (Depth Pruning), instead, removes entire Attention submodules. This is done by applying an iterative process that removes the Attention submodules with the minimum impact on a given metric of interest (in our case, perplexity). We also propose a novel mechanism to balance the sparsity rate of the two stages w.r.t. to the desired global sparsity. We test 2SSP on four LLM families and three sparsity rates (25\%, 37.5\%, and 50\%), measuring the resulting perplexity over three language modeling datasets as well as the performance over six downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms five state-of-the-art competitors over three language modeling and six downstream tasks, with an up to two-order-of-magnitude gain in terms of pruning time.

Building upon CosyVoice, we incorporate a $S^{3}$ tokenizer, a large language model (LLM), an optimal-transport conditional flow matching model (OT-CFM), and a grapheme to phoneme prediction model, to generate realistic speech that closely mimics human utterances. Our evaluation demonstrates BreezyVoice's superior performance in both general and code-switching contexts, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in generating high-fidelity speech. Additionally, we address the challenges of generalizability in modeling long-tail speakers and polyphone disambiguation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mariano V. Ntrougkas, Vasileios Mezaris, Ioannis Patras</p>
<p>Abstract: The adoption of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in critical fields where predictions need to be accompanied by justifications is hindered by their inherent black-box nature. In this paper, we introduce P-TAME (Perturbation-based Trainable Attention Mechanism for Explanations), a model-agnostic method for explaining DNN-based image classifiers. P-TAME employs an auxiliary image classifier to extract features from the input image, bypassing the need to tailor the explanation method to the internal architecture of the backbone classifier being explained. Unlike traditional perturbation-based methods, which have high computational requirements, P-TAME offers an efficient alternative by generating high-resolution explanations in a single forward pass during inference. We apply P-TAME to explain the decisions of VGG-16, ResNet-50, and ViT-B-16, three distinct and widely used image classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method matches or outperforms previous explainability methods, including model-specific approaches. Code and trained models will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sobhan Hemati, Ghazal Alabtah, Saghir Alfasly, H. R. Tizhoosh</p>
<p>Abstract: A crucial step to efficiently integrate Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in computational pathology is assigning a single high-quality feature vector, i.e., one embedding, to each WSI. With the existence of many pre-trained deep neural networks and the emergence of foundation models, extracting embeddings for sub-images (i.e., tiles or patches) is straightforward. However, for WSIs, given their high resolution and gigapixel nature, inputting them into existing GPUs as a single image is not feasible. As a result, WSIs are usually split into many patches. Feeding each patch to a pre-trained model, each WSI can then be represented by a set of patches, hence, a set of embeddings. Hence, in such a setup, WSI representation learning reduces to set representation learning where for each WSI we have access to a set of patch embeddings. To obtain a single embedding from a set of patch embeddings for each WSI, multiple set-based learning schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the WSI search performance of multiple recently developed aggregation techniques (mainly set representation learning techniques) including simple average or max pooling operations, Deep Sets, Memory networks, Focal attention, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Fisher Vector, and deep sparse and binary Fisher Vector on four different primary sites including bladder, breast, kidney, and Colon from TCGA. Further, we benchmark the search performance of these methods against the median of minimum distances of patch embeddings, a non-aggregating approach used for WSI retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Kaykobad Reza, Niki Nezakati, Ameya Patil, Mashhour Solh, M. Salman Asif</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning often relies on designing new models and complex training strategies to achieve optimal performance. We present Unified Unimodal Adaptation (U2A), which jointly fine-tunes pretrained unimodal encoders using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for various multimodal tasks. Our method significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters and eliminates the need for complex training strategies, such as alternating training, gradient modifications, or unimodal fine-tuning. To address missing modalities during both training and testing, we introduce Mask Tokens (MT), which generate missing modality features from available modalities using a single token per modality. This simplifies the process, removing the need for specialized feature estimation or prompt-tuning methods. Our evaluation demonstrates that U2A matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both complete and missing modality settings, showcasing strong performance and robustness across various modalities, tasks, and datasets. We also analyze and report the effectiveness of Mask Tokens in different missing modality scenarios. Overall, our method provides a robust, flexible, and efficient solution for multimodal learning, with minimal computational overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, particularly in environments where sparse or dense rewards bias learning. Biological systems, such as human toddlers, naturally navigate this balance by transitioning from free exploration with sparse rewards to goal-directed behavior guided by increasingly dense rewards. Inspired by this natural progression, we investigate the Toddler-Inspired Reward Transition in goal-oriented RL tasks. Our study focuses on transitioning from sparse to potential-based dense (S2D) rewards while preserving optimal strategies. Through experiments on dynamic robotic arm manipulation and egocentric 3D navigation tasks, we demonstrate that effective S2D reward transitions significantly enhance learning performance and sample efficiency. Additionally, using a Cross-Density Visualizer, we show that S2D transitions smooth the policy loss landscape, resulting in wider minima that improve generalization in RL models. In addition, we reinterpret Tolman's maze experiments, underscoring the critical role of early free exploratory learning in the context of S2D rewards.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robot caregiving should be personalized to meet the diverse needs of care recipients -- assisting with tasks as needed, while taking user agency in action into account. In physical tasks such as handover, bathing, dressing, and rehabilitation, a key aspect of this diversity is the functional range of motion (fROM), which can vary significantly between individuals. In this work, we learn to predict personalized fROM as a way to generalize robot decision-making in a wide range of caregiving tasks. We propose a novel data-driven method for predicting personalized fROM using functional assessment scores from occupational therapy. We develop a neural model that learns to embed functional assessment scores into a latent representation of the user's physical function. The model is trained using motion capture data collected from users with emulated mobility limitations. After training, the model predicts personalized fROM for new users without motion capture. Through simulated experiments and a real-robot user study, we show that the personalized fROM predictions from our model enable the robot to provide personalized and effective assistance while improving the user's agency in action.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Min, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Qian Liu, Minhao Cheng, Min Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Chatbot Arena is a popular platform for evaluating LLMs by pairwise battles, where users vote for their preferred response from two randomly sampled anonymous models. While Chatbot Arena is widely regarded as a reliable LLM ranking leaderboard, we show that crowdsourced voting can be rigged to improve (or decrease) the ranking of a target model $m_{t}$. We first introduce a straightforward target-only rigging strategy that focuses on new battles involving $m_{t}$, identifying it via watermarking or a binary classifier, and exclusively voting for $m_{t}$ wins. However, this strategy is practically inefficient because there are over $190$ models on Chatbot Arena and on average only about $1\%$ of new battles will involve $m_{t}$. To overcome this, we propose omnipresent rigging strategies, exploiting the Elo rating mechanism of Chatbot Arena that any new vote on a battle can influence the ranking of the target model $m_{t}$, even if $m_{t}$ is not directly involved in the battle. We conduct experiments on around $1.7$ million historical votes from the Chatbot Arena Notebook, showing that omnipresent rigging strategies can improve model rankings by rigging only hundreds of new votes. While we have evaluated several defense mechanisms, our findings highlight the importance of continued efforts to prevent vote rigging.

These tuning methods and benchmarks overlook critical aspects like evidence-based reasoning and handling distracting information. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark that simulates real-world diagnostic scenarios, integrating noise and difficulty levels aligned with USMLE standards. Moreover, we explore dialogue-based fine-tuning, which transforms static datasets into conversational formats to better capture iterative reasoning processes. Experiments show that dialogue-tuned models outperform traditional methods, with improvements of $9.64\%$ in multi-round reasoning scenarios and $6.18\%$ in accuracy in a noisy environment. Our findings highlight dialogue tuning as a promising approach for advancing clinically aligned and robust medical AI systems.</p>

In this paper, we present the SAX4BPM framework developed to generate SAX explanations. The SAX4BPM suite consists of a set of services and a central knowledge repository. The functionality of these services is to elicit the various knowledge ingredients that underlie SAX explanations. A key innovative component among these ingredients is the causal process execution view. In this work, we integrate the framework with an LLM to leverage its power to synthesize the various input ingredients for the sake of improved SAX explanations. Since the use of LLMs for SAX is also accompanied by a certain degree of doubt related to its capacity to adequately fulfill SAX along with its tendency for hallucination and lack of inherent capacity to reason, we pursued a methodological evaluation of the perceived quality of the generated explanations. We developed a designated scale and conducted a rigorous user study. Our findings show that the input presented to the LLMs aided with the guard-railing of its performance, yielding SAX explanations having better-perceived fidelity. This improvement is moderated by the perception of trust and curiosity. More so, this improvement comes at the cost of the perceived interpretability of the explanation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhurim Cakiqi, Max A. Little</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal identification in causal Bayes nets (CBNs) is an important tool in causal inference allowing the derivation of interventional distributions from observational distributions where this is possible in principle. However, most existing formulations of causal identification using techniques such as d-separation and do-calculus are expressed within the mathematical language of classical probability theory on CBNs. However, there are many causal settings where probability theory and hence current causal identification techniques are inapplicable such as relational databases, dataflow programs such as hardware description languages, distributed systems and most modern machine learning algorithms. We show that this restriction can be lifted by replacing the use of classical probability theory with the alternative axiomatic foundation of symmetric monoidal categories. In this alternative axiomatization, we show how an unambiguous and clean distinction can be drawn between the general syntax of causal models and any specific semantic implementation of that causal model. This allows a purely syntactic algorithmic description of general causal identification by a translation of recent formulations of the general ID algorithm through fixing. Our description is given entirely in terms of the non-parametric ADMG structure specifying a causal model and the algebraic signature of the corresponding monoidal category, to which a sequence of manipulations is then applied so as to arrive at a modified monoidal category in which the desired, purely syntactic interventional causal model, is obtained. We use this idea to derive purely syntactic analogues of classical back-door and front-door causal adjustment, and illustrate an application to a more complex causal model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilun Hao, Yongchao Chen, Yang Zhang, Chuchu Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to directly generate correct plans for complex multi-constraint planning problems, even with self-verification and self-critique. For example, a U.S. domestic travel planning benchmark TravelPlanner was proposed in Xie et al. (2024), where the best LLM OpenAI o1-preview can only find viable travel plans with a 10% success rate given all needed information. In this work, we tackle this by proposing an LLM-based planning framework that formalizes and solves complex multi-constraint planning problems as constrained satisfiability problems, which are further consumed by sound and complete satisfiability solvers. We start with TravelPlanner as the primary use case and show that our framework achieves a success rate of 93.9% and is effective with diverse paraphrased prompts. More importantly, our framework has strong zero-shot generalizability, successfully handling unseen constraints in our newly created unseen international travel dataset and generalizing well to new fundamentally different domains. Moreover, when user input queries are infeasible, our framework can identify the unsatisfiable core, provide failure reasons, and offers personalized modification suggestions. We show that our framework can modify and solve for an average of 81.6% and 91.7% unsatisfiable queries from two datasets and prove with ablations that all key components of our framework are effective and necessary.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Purva Pruthi, David Jensen</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world systems can be represented as sets of interacting components. Examples of such systems include computational systems such as query processors, natural systems such as cells, and social systems such as families. Many approaches have been proposed in traditional (associational) machine learning to model such structured systems, including statistical relational models and graph neural networks. Despite this prior work, existing approaches to estimating causal effects typically treat such systems as single units, represent them with a fixed set of variables and assume a homogeneous data-generating process. We study a compositional approach for estimating individual treatment effects (ITE) in structured systems, where each unit is represented by the composition of multiple heterogeneous components. This approach uses a modular architecture to model potential outcomes at each component and aggregates component-level potential outcomes to obtain the unit-level potential outcomes. We discover novel benefits of the compositional approach in causal inference - systematic generalization to estimate counterfactual outcomes of unseen combinations of components and improved overlap guarantees between treatment and control groups compared to the classical methods for causal effect estimation. We also introduce a set of novel environments for empirically evaluating the compositional approach and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using both simulated and real-world data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilun Hao, Yang Zhang, Chuchu Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in solving planning problems, there is a trade-off between flexibility and complexity. LLMs, as zero-shot planners themselves, are still not capable of directly generating valid plans for complex planning problems such as multi-constraint or long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, many frameworks aiming to solve complex planning problems often rely on task-specific preparatory efforts, such as task-specific in-context examples and pre-defined critics/verifiers, which limits their cross-task generalization capability. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by observing that the core of many planning problems lies in optimization problems: searching for the optimal solution (best plan) with goals subject to constraints (preconditions and effects of decisions). With LLMs' commonsense, reasoning, and programming capabilities, this opens up the possibilities of a universal LLM-based approach to planning problems. Inspired by this observation, we propose LLMFP, a general-purpose framework that leverages LLMs to capture key information from planning problems and formally formulate and solve them as optimization problems from scratch, with no task-specific examples needed. We apply LLMFP to 9 planning problems, ranging from multi-constraint decision making to multi-step planning problems, and demonstrate that LLMFP achieves on average 83.7% and 86.8% optimal rate across 9 tasks for GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming the best baseline (direct planning with OpenAI o1-preview) with 37.6% and 40.7% improvements. We also validate components of LLMFP with ablation experiments and analyzed the underlying success and failure reasons. Project page: https://sites.google.com/view/llmfp.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tian Yu Liu, Stefano Soatto</p>
<p>Abstract: The semantic similarity between sample expressions measures the distance between their latent 'meaning'. Such meanings are themselves typically represented by textual expressions, often insufficient to differentiate concepts at fine granularity. We propose a novel approach whereby the semantic similarity among textual expressions is based not on other expressions they can be rephrased as, but rather based on the imagery they evoke. While this is not possible with humans, generative models allow us to easily visualize and compare generated images, or their distribution, evoked by a textual prompt. Therefore, we characterize the semantic similarity between two textual expressions simply as the distance between image distributions they induce, or 'conjure.' We show that by choosing the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the reverse-time diffusion stochastic differential equations (SDEs) induced by each textual expression, this can be directly computed via Monte-Carlo sampling. Our method contributes a novel perspective on semantic similarity that not only aligns with human-annotated scores, but also opens up new avenues for the evaluation of text-conditioned generative models while offering better interpretability of their learnt representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Rago, Stylianos Loukas Vasileiou, Francesca Toni, Tran Cao Son, William Yeoh</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradual semantics (GS) have demonstrated great potential in argumentation, in particular for deploying quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs) in a number of real-world settings, from judgmental forecasting to explainable AI. In this paper, we provide a novel methodology for obtaining GS for statement graphs, a form of structured argumentation framework, where arguments and relations between them are built from logical statements. Our methodology differs from existing approaches in the literature in two main ways. First, it naturally accommodates incomplete information, so that arguments with partially specified premises can play a meaningful role in the evaluation. Second, it is modularly defined to leverage on any GS for QBAFs. We also define a set of novel properties for our GS and study their suitability alongside a set of existing properties (adapted to our setting) for two instantiations of our GS, demonstrating their advantages over existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Bettini, Ryan Kortvelesy, Amanda Prorok</p>
<p>Abstract: Many of the world's most pressing issues, such as climate change and global peace, require complex collective problem-solving skills. Recent studies indicate that diversity in individuals' behaviors is key to developing such skills and increasing collective performance. Yet behavioral diversity in collective artificial learning is understudied, with today's machine learning paradigms commonly favoring homogeneous agent strategies over heterogeneous ones, mainly due to computational considerations. In this work, we employ diversity measurement and control paradigms to study the impact of behavioral heterogeneity in several facets of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Through experiments in team play and other cooperative tasks, we show the emergence of unbiased behavioral roles that improve team outcomes; how behavioral diversity synergizes with morphological diversity; how diverse agents are more effective at finding cooperative solutions in sparse reward settings; and how behaviorally heterogeneous teams learn and retain latent skills to overcome repeated disruptions. Overall, our results indicate that, by controlling diversity, we can obtain non-trivial benefits over homogeneous training paradigms, demonstrating that diversity is a fundamental component of collective artificial learning, an insight thus far overlooked.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study proposes the design and implementation of a multimodal LLM-based Multi-Agent System (MAS) leveraging a No-Code platform to address the practical constraints and significant entry barriers associated with AI adoption in enterprises. Advanced AI technologies, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), often pose challenges due to their technical complexity and high implementation costs, making them difficult for many organizations to adopt. To overcome these limitations, this research develops a No-Code-based Multi-Agent System designed to enable users without programming knowledge to easily build and manage AI systems. The study examines various use cases to validate the applicability of AI in business processes, including code generation from image-based notes, Advanced RAG-based question-answering systems, text-based image generation, and video generation using images and prompts. These systems lower the barriers to AI adoption, empowering not only professional developers but also general users to harness AI for significantly improved productivity and efficiency. By demonstrating the scalability and accessibility of No-Code platforms, this study advances the democratization of AI technologies within enterprises and validates the practical applicability of Multi-Agent Systems, ultimately contributing to the widespread adoption of AI across various industries.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05247">Online Prompt Selection for Program Synthesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixuan Li, Lewis Frampton, Federico Mora, Elizabeth Polgreen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in the domain of program synthesis. This level of performance is not, however, universal across all tasks, all LLMs and all prompting styles. There are many areas where one LLM dominates, one prompting style dominates, or where calling a symbolic solver is a better choice than an LLM. A key challenge for the user then, is to identify not only when an LLM is the right choice of solver, and the appropriate LLM to call for a given synthesis task, but also the right way to call it. A non-expert user who makes the wrong choice, incurs a cost both in terms of results (number of tasks solved, and the time it takes to solve them) and financial cost, if using a closed-source language model via a commercial API. We frame this choice as an online learning problem. We use a multi-armed bandit algorithm to select which symbolic solver, or LLM and prompt combination to deploy in order to maximize a given reward function (which may prioritize solving time, number of synthesis tasks solved, or financial cost of solving). We implement an instance of this approach, called CYANEA, and evaluate it on synthesis queries from the literature in ranking function synthesis, from the syntax-guided synthesis competition, and fresh, unseen queries generated from SMT problems. CYANEA solves 37.2% more queries than the best single solver and achieves results within 4% of the virtual best solver.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence requires deliberate reasoning, temporal awareness, and effective constraint management, capabilities traditional LLMs often lack due to their reliance on pattern matching, limited self-verification, and inconsistent constraint handling. We introduce Multi-Agent Collaborative Intelligence (MACI), a framework comprising three key components: 1) a meta-planner (MP) that identifies, formulates, and refines all roles and constraints of a task (e.g., wedding planning) while generating a dependency graph, with common-sense augmentation to ensure realistic and practical constraints; 2) a collection of agents to facilitate planning and address task-specific requirements; and 3) a run-time monitor that manages plan adjustments as needed. By decoupling planning from validation, maintaining minimal agent context, and integrating common-sense reasoning, MACI overcomes the aforementioned limitations and demonstrates robust performance in two scheduling problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steffen van Bergerem</p>
<p>Abstract: We study Boolean classification problems over relational background structures in the logical framework introduced by Grohe and Tur\'an (TOCS 2004). It is known (Grohe and Ritzert, LICS 2017) that classifiers definable in first-order logic over structures of polylogarithmic degree can be learned in sublinear time, where the degree of the structure and the running time are measured in terms of the size of the structure. We generalise the results to the first-order logic with counting FOCN, which was introduced by Kuske and Schweikardt (LICS 2017) as an expressive logic generalising various other counting logics. Specifically, we prove that classifiers definable in FOCN over classes of structures of polylogarithmic degree can be consistently learned in sublinear time. This can be seen as a first step towards extending the learning framework to include numerical aspects of machine learning. We extend the result to agnostic probably approximately correct (PAC) learning for classes of structures of degree at most $(\log \log n)^c$ for some constant $c$. Moreover, we show that bounding the degree is crucial to obtain sublinear-time learning algorithms. That is, we prove that, for structures of unbounded degree, learning is not possible in sublinear time, even for classifiers definable in plain first-order logic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guang Ping He</p>
<p>Abstract: Finding gradients is a crucial step in training machine learning models. For quantum neural networks, computing gradients using the parameter-shift rule requires evaluating the cost function twice for each adjustable parameter in the network. When the total number of parameters is large, the quantum circuit must be repeatedly adjusted and executed, leading to significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel approach that computes all gradients using only a single circuit, significantly reducing both the circuit depth and the number of classical registers required. We experimentally validate our approach on both quantum simulators and IBM's real quantum hardware, demonstrating that our method significantly reduces circuit compilation time compared to the conventional approach, resulting in a substantial speedup in total runtime.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satyandra Guthula, Roman Beltiukov, Navya Battula, Wenbo Guo, Arpit Gupta, Inder Monga</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing generalizable ML-based solutions for disparate learning problems in network security is highly desired. However, despite a rich history of applying ML to network security, most existing solutions lack generalizability. This lack of progress can be attributed to an overreliance on supervised learning techniques and the associated challenges of curating well-specified labeled training data. This paper addresses a fundamental gap by introducing a novel transformer-based network foundation model, netFound. We employ self-supervised learning techniques on abundant, unlabeled network telemetry data for pre-training. This pretrained model can subsequently be fine-tuned to create generalizable learning artifacts for disparate learning tasks, even when using commonly available but challenging labeled datasets that are sparse, noisy, and skewed. To realize this goal, netFound leverages various domain-specific attributes and constraints unique to network data (packet traces) by developing multi-modal embeddings, protocol-aware tokenization, data-driven token composition, and hierarchical transformers. Our results demonstrate that netFound's domain-specific design choices ensure that it (1) effectively captures the hidden networking context in production settings, (2) outperforms four different SOTA methods on five different learning tasks, and (3) is robust to both noisy labels and learning shortcuts -- critical for developing generalizable ML models in practical settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research interest in autonomous agents is on the rise as an emerging topic. The notable achievements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the considerable potential to attain human-like intelligence in autonomous agents. However, the challenge lies in enabling these agents to learn, reason, and navigate uncertainties in dynamic environments. Context awareness emerges as a pivotal element in fortifying multi-agent systems when dealing with dynamic situations. Despite existing research focusing on both context-aware systems and multi-agent systems, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys outlining techniques for integrating context-aware systems with multi-agent systems. To address this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art context-aware multi-agent systems. First, we outline the properties of both context-aware systems and multi-agent systems that facilitate integration between these systems. Subsequently, we propose a general process for context-aware systems, with each phase of the process encompassing diverse approaches drawn from various application domains such as collision avoidance in autonomous driving, disaster relief management, utility management, supply chain management, human-AI interaction, and others. Finally, we discuss the existing challenges of context-aware multi-agent systems and provide future research directions in this field.</p>

Our evaluation highlights three key findings: First, fine-tuning on API Pack enables open-source models to outperform GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in generating code for entirely new API calls. We show this by fine-tuning CodeLlama-13B on 20,000 Python instances from API Pack. Second, fine-tuning on a large dataset in one language, combined with smaller datasets from others, improves API generation accuracy across multiple languages. Third, we confirm the benefits of larger datasets for API generalization, as increasing fine-tuning data to one million instances enhances generalization to new APIs.

Even simple animals are able to develop and execute complex plans, which has not yet been replicated in robotics using pure closed-loop input control. We propose a solution to this problem by defining a set of discrete and temporary closed-loop controllers, called ``Tasks'', each representing a closed-loop behaviour. We further introduce a supervisory module which has an innate understanding of physics and causality, through which it can simulate the execution of Task sequences over time and store the results in a model of the environment. On the basis of this model, plans can be made by chaining temporary closed-loop controllers. Our proposed framework was implemented for a real robot and tested in two scenarios as proof of concept.</p>

<p>Abstract: The performance of machine learning models relies heavily on the quality of input data, yet real-world applications often face significant data-related challenges. A common issue arises when curating training data or deploying models: two datasets from the same domain may exhibit differing distributions. While many techniques exist for detecting such distribution shifts, there is a lack of comprehensive methods to explain these differences in a human-understandable way beyond opaque quantitative metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a versatile toolbox of interpretable methods for comparing datasets. Using a variety of case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across diverse data modalities -- including tabular data, text data, images, time series signals -- in both low and high-dimensional settings. These methods complement existing techniques by providing actionable and interpretable insights to better understand and address distribution shifts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Hartwig, Dominik Engel, Leon Sick, Hannah Kniesel, Tristan Payer, Poonam Poonam, Michael Gl\"ockler, Alex B\"auerle, Timo Ropinski</p>
<p>Abstract: AI-based text-to-image models do not only excel at generating realistic images, they also give designers more and more fine-grained control over the image content. Consequently, these approaches have gathered increased attention within the computer graphics research community, which has been historically devoted towards traditional rendering techniques, that offer precise control over scene parameters (e.g., objects, materials, and lighting). While the quality of conventionally rendered images is assessed through well established image quality metrics, such as SSIM or PSNR, the unique challenges of text-to-image generation require other, dedicated quality metrics. These metrics must be able to not only measure overall image quality, but also how well images reflect given text prompts, whereby the control of scene and rendering parameters is interweaved. Within this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of such text-to-image quality metrics, and propose a taxonomy to categorize these metrics. Our taxonomy is grounded in the assumption, that there are two main quality criteria, namely compositional quality and general quality, that contribute to the overall image quality. Besides the metrics, this survey covers dedicated text-to-image benchmark datasets, over which the metrics are frequently computed. Finally, we identify limitations and open challenges in the field of text-to-image generation, and derive guidelines for practitioners conducting text-to-image evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Debidatta Dwibedi, Vidhi Jain, Jonathan Tompson, Andrew Zisserman, Yusuf Aytar</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce FlexCap, a vision-language model that generates region-specific descriptions of varying lengths. FlexCap is trained to produce length-conditioned captions for input boxes, enabling control over information density, with descriptions ranging from concise object labels to detailed captions. To achieve this, we create large-scale training datasets of image region descriptions with varying lengths from captioned web images. We demonstrate FlexCap's effectiveness in several applications: first, it achieves strong performance in dense captioning tasks on the Visual Genome dataset. Second, we show how FlexCap's localized descriptions can serve as input to a large language model to create a visual question answering (VQA) system, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple VQA benchmarks. Our experiments illustrate FlexCap's utility for tasks including image labeling, object attribute recognition, and visual dialog. Project webpage: https://flex-cap.github.io .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuu Jinnai, Tetsuro Morimura, Kaito Ariu, Kenshi Abe</p>
<p>Abstract: Best-of-N (BoN) sampling with a reward model has been shown to be an effective strategy for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences at the time of decoding. BoN sampling is susceptible to a problem known as reward hacking when the accuracy of the reward model is not high enough due to the quality or the quantity of the preference dataset. Because the reward model is an imperfect proxy for the true objective, over-optimizing its value can compromise its performance on the true objective. In this research, we propose MBR-BoN, a variant of BoN that aims to mitigate reward hacking at inference time by incorporating the Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) objective as a proximity regularization term. We show empirically and analytically that the MBR objective quantifies the proximity of the response to the reference policy, serving as a proximity regularizer. We evaluate MBR-BoN on the AlpacaFarm and Anthropic's hh-rlhf datasets and show that it outperforms both BoN sampling and MBR decoding. We also evaluate MBR-BoN to generate a pairwise preference learning dataset for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Empirical results show that models trained on a dataset generated with MBR-BoN outperform those with vanilla BoN. Our code is available at https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/regularized-bon</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erblin Isaku, Christoph Laaber, Hassan Sartaj, Shaukat Ali, Thomas Schwitalla, Jan F. Nyg{\aa}rd</p>
<p>Abstract: The Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) uses an automated cancer registration support system (CaReSS) to support core cancer registry activities, i.e, data capture, data curation, and producing data products and statistics for various stakeholders. GURI is a core component of CaReSS, which is responsible for validating incoming data with medical rules. Such medical rules are manually implemented by medical experts based on medical standards, regulations, and research. Since large language models (LLMs) have been trained on a large amount of public information, including these documents, they can be employed to generate tests for GURI. Thus, we propose an LLM-based test generation and differential testing approach (LLMeDiff) to test GURI. We experimented with four different LLMs, two medical rule engine implementations, and 58 real medical rules to investigate the hallucination, success, time efficiency, and robustness of the LLMs to generate tests, and these tests' ability to find potential issues in GURI. Our results showed that GPT-3.5 hallucinates the least, is the most successful, and is generally the most robust; however, it has the worst time efficiency. Our differential testing revealed 22 medical rules where implementation inconsistencies were discovered (e.g., regarding handling rule versions). Finally, we provide insights for practitioners and researchers based on the results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoyu Zhang, Shaoyu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper examines the evolving landscape of machine learning (ML) and its profound impact across various sectors, with a special focus on the emerging field of Privacy-preserving Machine Learning (PPML). As ML applications become increasingly integral to industries like telecommunications, financial technology, and surveillance, they raise significant privacy concerns, necessitating the development of PPML strategies. The paper highlights the unique challenges in safeguarding privacy within ML frameworks, which stem from the diverse capabilities of potential adversaries, including their ability to infer sensitive information from model outputs or training data.
  We delve into the spectrum of threat models that characterize adversarial intentions, ranging from membership and attribute inference to data reconstruction. The paper emphasizes the importance of maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of training data, outlining current research efforts that focus on refining training data to minimize privacy-sensitive information and enhancing data processing techniques to uphold privacy.
  Through a comprehensive analysis of privacy leakage risks and countermeasures in both centralized and collaborative learning settings, this paper aims to provide a thorough understanding of effective strategies for protecting ML training data against privacy intrusions. It explores the balance between data privacy and model utility, shedding light on privacy-preserving techniques that leverage cryptographic methods, Differential Privacy, and Trusted Execution Environments. The discussion extends to the application of these techniques in sensitive domains, underscoring the critical role of PPML in ensuring the privacy and security of ML systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantin Holzhausen, Mia Merlid, H{\aa}kon Olav Torvik, Anders Malthe-S{\o}renssen, Mikkel Elle Lepper{\o}d</p>
<p>Abstract: Backpropagation-optimized artificial neural networks, while precise, lack robustness, leading to unforeseen behaviors that affect their safety. Biological neural systems do solve some of these issues already. Unlike artificial models, biological neurons adjust connectivity based on neighboring cell activity. Understanding the biological mechanisms of robustness can pave the way towards building trust worthy and safe systems. Robustness in neural representations is hypothesized to correlate with the smoothness of the encoding manifold. Recent work suggests power law covariance spectra, which were observed studying the primary visual cortex of mice, to be indicative of a balanced trade-off between accuracy and robustness in representations. Here, we show that unsupervised local learning models with winner takes all dynamics learn such power law representations, providing upcoming studies a mechanistic model with that characteristic. Our research aims to understand the interplay between geometry, spectral properties, robustness, and expressivity in neural representations. Hence, we study the link between representation smoothness and spectrum by using weight, Jacobian and spectral regularization while assessing performance and adversarial robustness. Our work serves as a foundation for future research into the mechanisms underlying power law spectra and optimally smooth encodings in both biological and artificial systems. The insights gained may elucidate the mechanisms that realize robust neural networks in mammalian brains and inform the development of more stable and reliable artificial systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avinash Mudireddy, Tyler Bell, Raghu Mudumbai</p>
<p>Abstract: We prove a new asymptotic equipartition property for the perplexity of long texts generated by a language model and present supporting experimental evidence from open-source models. Specifically we show that the logarithmic perplexity of any large text generated by a language model must asymptotically converge to the average entropy of its token distributions. This defines a "typical set" that all long synthetic texts generated by a language model must belong to. We show that this typical set is a vanishingly small subset of all possible grammatically correct outputs. These results suggest possible applications to important practical problems such as (a) detecting synthetic AI-generated text, and (b) testing whether a text was used to train a language model. We make no simplifying assumptions (such as stationarity) about the statistics of language model outputs, and therefore our results are directly applicable to practical real-world models without any approximations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Hinns, David Martens</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of deep learning in image classification has brought unprecedented accuracy but also highlighted a key issue: the use of 'shortcuts' by models. Such shortcuts are easy-to-learn patterns from the training data that fail to generalise to new data. Examples include the use of a copyright watermark to recognise horses, snowy background to recognise huskies, or ink markings to detect malignant skin lesions. The explainable AI (XAI) community has suggested using instance-level explanations to detect shortcuts without external data, but this requires the examination of many explanations to confirm the presence of such shortcuts, making it a labour-intensive process. To address these challenges, we introduce Counterfactual Frequency (CoF) tables, a novel approach that aggregates instance-based explanations into global insights, and exposes shortcuts. The aggregation implies the need for some semantic concepts to be used in the explanations, which we solve by labelling the segments of an image. We demonstrate the utility of CoF tables across several datasets, revealing the shortcuts learned from them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruizhong Qiu, Weiliang Will Zeng, James Ezick, Christopher Lott, Hanghang Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly pushed the frontiers of program synthesis. Advancement of LLM-based program synthesis calls for a thorough evaluation of LLM-generated code. Most evaluation frameworks focus on the (functional) correctness of generated code; efficiency, as an important measure of code quality, has been overlooked in existing evaluations. In this work, we develop ENAMEL (EfficeNcy AutoMatic EvaLuator), a rigorous and high-standard benchmark for evaluating the capability of LLMs in generating efficient code. Firstly, we propose a new efficiency metric called eff@k, which generalizes the pass@k metric from correctness to efficiency and appropriately handles right-censored execution time. Furthermore, we derive an unbiased and variance-reduced estimator of eff@k via Rao--Blackwellization; we also provide a numerically stable implementation for the new estimator. Secondly, to set a high-standard for efficiency evaluation, we employ a human expert to design best algorithms and implementations as our reference solutions of efficiency, many of which are much more efficient than existing canonical solutions in HumanEval and HumanEval+. Moreover, to ensure a rigorous evaluation, we employ a human expert to curate strong test case generators to filter out wrong code and differentiate suboptimal algorithms. An extensive study across 30 popular LLMs using our benchmark ENAMEL shows that LLMs still fall short of generating expert-level efficient code. Using two subsets of our problem set, we demonstrate that such deficiency is because current LLMs struggle in designing advanced algorithms and are barely aware of implementation optimization. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/q-rz/enamel .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaojie Fang, Shenghao Zhu, Yifei Chen, Binfeng Zou, Fan Jia, Chang Liu, Xiang Feng, Linwei Qiu, Feiwei Qin, Jin Fan, Changbiao Chu, Changmiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive, irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that often originates from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). This progression results in significant memory loss and severely affects patients' quality of life. Clinical trials have consistently shown that early and targeted interventions for individuals with MCI may slow or even prevent the advancement of AD. Research indicates that accurate medical classification requires diverse multimodal data, including detailed assessment scales and neuroimaging techniques like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). However, simultaneously collecting the aforementioned three modalities for training presents substantial challenges. To tackle these difficulties, we propose GFE-Mamba, a multimodal classifier founded on Generative Feature Extractor. The intermediate features provided by this Extractor can compensate for the shortcomings of PET and achieve profound multimodal fusion in the classifier. The Mamba block, as the backbone of the classifier, enables it to efficiently extract information from long-sequence scale information. Pixel-level Bi-cross Attention supplements pixel-level information from MRI and PET. We provide our rationale for developing this cross-temporal progression prediction dataset and the pre-trained Extractor weights. Our experimental findings reveal that the GFE-Mamba model effectively predicts the progression from MCI to AD and surpasses several leading methods in the field.

<p>Abstract: Streamlining constraints (or streamliners, for short) narrow the search space, enhancing the speed and feasibility of solving complex constraint satisfaction problems. Traditionally, streamliners were crafted manually or generated through systematically combined atomic constraints with high-effort offline testing. Our approach utilizes the creativity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to propose effective streamliners for problems specified in the MiniZinc constraint programming language and integrates feedback to the LLM with quick empirical tests for validation. Evaluated across seven diverse constraint satisfaction problems, our method achieves substantial runtime reductions. We compare the results to obfuscated and disguised variants of the problem to see whether the results depend on LLM memorization. We also analyze whether longer off-line runs improve the quality of streamliners and whether the LLM can propose good combinations of streamliners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyun Chen, Martin King, Yading Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Dose prediction plays a key role in knowledge-based planning (KBP) by automatically generating patient-specific dose distribution. Recent advances in deep learning-based dose prediction methods necessitates collaboration among data contributors for improved performance. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a solution, enabling medical centers to jointly train deep-learning models without compromising patient data privacy. We developed the FedKBP framework to evaluate the performances of centralized, federated, and individual (i.e. separated) training of dose prediction model on the 340 plans from OpenKBP dataset. To simulate FL and individual training, we divided the data into 8 training sites. To evaluate the effect of inter-site data variation on model training, we implemented two types of case distributions: 1) Independent and identically distributed (IID), where the training and validating cases were evenly divided among the 8 sites, and 2) non-IID, where some sites have more cases than others. The results show FL consistently outperforms individual training on both model optimization speed and out-of-sample testing scores, highlighting the advantage of FL over individual training. Under IID data division, FL shows comparable performance to centralized training, underscoring FL as a promising alternative to traditional pooled-data training. Under non-IID division, larger sites outperformed smaller sites by up to 19% on testing scores, confirming the need of collaboration among data owners to achieve better prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, non-IID FL showed reduced performance as compared to IID FL, posing the need for more sophisticated FL method beyond mere model averaging to handle data variation among participating sites.</p>

<p>Abstract: Explanations for autonomous vehicle (AV) decisions may build trust, however, explanations can contain errors. In a simulated driving study (n = 232), we tested how AV explanation errors, driving context characteristics (perceived harm and driving difficulty), and personal traits (prior trust and expertise) affected a passenger's comfort in relying on an AV, preference for control, confidence in the AV's ability, and explanation satisfaction. Errors negatively affected all outcomes. Surprisingly, despite identical driving, explanation errors reduced ratings of the AV's driving ability. Severity and potential harm amplified the negative impact of errors. Contextual harm and driving difficulty directly impacted outcome ratings and influenced the relationship between errors and outcomes. Prior trust and expertise were positively associated with outcome ratings. Results emphasize the need for accurate, contextually adaptive, and personalized AV explanations to foster trust, reliance, satisfaction, and confidence. We conclude with design, research, and deployment recommendations for trustworthy AV explanation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Pohland, Claire Tomlin</p>
<p>Abstract: Perception-based navigation systems are useful for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) navigation in complex terrains, where traditional depth-based navigation schemes are insufficient. However, these data-driven methods are highly dependent on their training data and can fail in surprising and dramatic ways with little warning. To ensure the safety of the vehicle and the surrounding environment, it is imperative that the navigation system is able to recognize the predictive uncertainty of the perception model and respond safely and effectively in the face of uncertainty. In an effort to enable safe navigation under perception uncertainty, we develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method to estimate the model's level of familiarity with an input image as a whole and with specific regions in the image. We find that the overall competency score can correctly predict correctly classified, misclassified, and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We also confirm that the regional competency maps can accurately distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar regions across images. We then use this competency information to develop a planning and control scheme that enables effective navigation while maintaining a low probability of error. We find that the competency-aware scheme greatly reduces the number of collisions with unfamiliar obstacles, compared to a baseline controller with no competency awareness. Furthermore, the regional competency information is very valuable in enabling efficient navigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neha Prakriya, Jui-Nan Yen, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Jason Cong</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional Large Language Model (LLM) pretraining relies on autoregressive language modeling with randomly sampled data from web-scale datasets. Inspired by human learning techniques like spaced repetition, we hypothesize that random sampling leads to high training costs, lower-quality models, and significant data forgetting. To address these inefficiencies, we propose the Learn-Focus-Review (LFR) paradigm -- a dynamic training approach that adapts to the model's learning progress. LFR tracks the model's learning performance across data blocks (sequences of tokens) and prioritizes revisiting challenging regions of the dataset that are more prone to being forgotten, enabling better retention and more efficient learning. Using the LFR paradigm, we pretrained Llama and GPT models on the SlimPajama and OpenWebText datasets, respectively. These models were evaluated on downstream tasks across various domains, including question answering, problem-solving, commonsense reasoning, language modeling, and translation. Compared to baseline models trained on the full datasets, LFR consistently achieved lower perplexity and higher accuracy, while using only 5%--19% of the training tokens. Furthermore, LFR matched the performance of industry-standard Pythia models with up to 2$\times$ the parameter count, using just 3.2% of the training tokens, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Low trust remains a significant barrier to Autonomous Vehicle (AV) adoption. To design trustworthy AVs, we need to better understand the individual traits, attitudes, and experiences that impact people's trust judgements. We use machine learning to understand the most important factors that contribute to young adult trust based on a comprehensive set of personal factors gathered via survey (n = 1457). Factors ranged from psychosocial and cognitive attributes to driving style, experiences, and perceived AV risks and benefits. Using the explainable AI technique SHAP, we found that perceptions of AV risks and benefits, attitudes toward feasibility and usability, institutional trust, prior experience, and a person's mental model are the most important predictors. Surprisingly, psychosocial and many technology- and driving-specific factors were not strong predictors. Results highlight the importance of individual differences for designing trustworthy AVs for diverse groups and lead to key implications for future design and research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mansi Sakarvadia, Aswathy Ajith, Arham Khan, Nathaniel Hudson, Caleb Geniesse, Kyle Chard, Yaoqing Yang, Ian Foster, Michael W. Mahoney</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models (LMs) can "memorize" information, i.e., encode training data in their weights in such a way that inference-time queries can lead to verbatim regurgitation of that data. This ability to extract training data can be problematic, for example, when data are private or sensitive. In this work, we investigate methods to mitigate memorization: three regularizer-based, three finetuning-based, and eleven machine unlearning-based methods, with five of the latter being new methods that we introduce. We also introduce TinyMem, a suite of small, computationally-efficient LMs for the rapid development and evaluation of memorization-mitigation methods. We demonstrate that the mitigation methods that we develop using TinyMem can successfully be applied to production-grade LMs, and we determine via experiment that: regularizer-based mitigation methods are slow and ineffective at curbing memorization; fine-tuning-based methods are effective at curbing memorization, but overly expensive, especially for retaining higher accuracies; and unlearning-based methods are faster and more effective, allowing for the precise localization and removal of memorized information from LM weights prior to inference. We show, in particular, that our proposed unlearning method BalancedSubnet outperforms other mitigation methods at removing memorized information while preserving performance on target tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> ZiXiao Zhao, Fatemeh H. Fard</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in developing Pre-trained Language Models for Code (Code-PLMs) have urged many areas of Software Engineering (SE) and brought breakthrough results for many SE tasks. Though these models have achieved the state-of-the-art performance for SE tasks for many popular programming languages, such as Java and Python, the Scientific Software and its related languages like R programming language have rarely benefited or even been evaluated with the Code-PLMs. Research has shown that R has many differences with other programming languages and requires specific techniques. In this study, we provide the first insights for code intelligence for R. For this purpose, we collect and open source an R dataset, and evaluate Code-PLMs for the two tasks of code summarization and method name prediction using several settings and strategies, including the differences in two R styles, Tidy-verse and Base R. Our results demonstrate that the studied models have experienced varying degrees of performance degradation when processing R programming language code, which is supported by human evaluation. Additionally, not all models show performance improvement in R-specific tasks even after multi-language fine-tuning. The dual syntax paradigms in R significantly impact the models' performance, particularly in code summarization tasks. Furthermore, the project-specific context inherent in R codebases significantly impacts the performance when attempting cross-project training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text generation is the automated process of producing written or spoken language using computational methods. It involves generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on predefined rules or learned patterns. However, challenges in text generation arise from maintaining coherence, ensuring diversity and creativity, and avoiding biases or inappropriate content. This research paper developed a novel approach to improve text generation in the context of joint Natural Language Generation (NLG) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) learning. The data is prepared by gathering and preprocessing annotated datasets, including cleaning, tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal. Feature extraction techniques such as POS tagging, Bag of words, and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) are applied. Transformer-based encoders and decoders, capturing long range dependencies and improving source-target sequence modelling. Pre-trained language models like Optimized BERT are incorporated, along with a Hybrid Redfox Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm (HRAHA). Reinforcement learning with policy gradient techniques, semi-supervised training, improved attention mechanisms, and differentiable approximations like straight-through Gumbel SoftMax estimator are employed to fine-tune the models and handle complex linguistic tasks effectively. The proposed model is implemented using Python.</p>

However, such centralization could raise privacy issues concerning the storage of sensitive data. To address this issue, federated learning was developed. It is a newly distributed learning technique that enables to collaboratively train a deep learning model on decentralized devices, referred to as clients, without compromising their data privacy. Traditional federated learning methods often suffer from severe performance degradation when the data distribution among clients differs significantly. This becomes especially problematic in the case of label distribution skew, where the distribution of labels varies across clients. To address this, a novel method called FedEntOpt is proposed. FedEntOpt is designed to mitigate performance issues caused by label distribution skew by maximizing the entropy of the global label distribution of the selected client subset in each federated learning round. This ensures that the aggregated model parameters from the clients were exhibited to data from all available labels, which improves the accuracy of the global model. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms by up to 6\% in classification accuracy under standard settings regardless of the model size. Moreover, it exhibits robust and superior performance in scenarios with low participation rates and client dropout, achieving increases in classification accuracy of over 30\%. In addition, FedEntOpt offers the flexibility to be combined with existing algorithms, enhancing their performance by over 40\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhe Huang, Xingbo Wang, Hao Liu, Fanqi Kong, Aoyang Qin, Min Tang, Song-Chun Zhu, Mingjie Bi, Siyuan Qi, Xue Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional interactive environments limit agents' intelligence growth with fixed tasks. Recently, single-agent environments address this by generating new tasks based on agent actions, enhancing task diversity. We consider the decision-making problem in multi-agent settings, where tasks are further influenced by social connections, affecting rewards and information access. However, existing multi-agent environments lack a combination of adaptive physical surroundings and social connections, hindering the learning of intelligent behaviors. To address this, we introduce AdaSociety, a customizable multi-agent environment featuring expanding state and action spaces, alongside explicit and alterable social structures. As agents progress, the environment adaptively generates new tasks with social structures for agents to undertake. In AdaSociety, we develop three mini-games showcasing distinct social structures and tasks. Initial results demonstrate that specific social structures can promote both individual and collective benefits, though current reinforcement learning and LLM-based algorithms show limited effectiveness in leveraging social structures to enhance performance. Overall, AdaSociety serves as a valuable research platform for exploring intelligence in diverse physical and social settings. The code is available at https://github.com/bigai-ai/AdaSociety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Guan, Jian Cao, Shiyou Qian, Jianqi Gao, Chun Ouyang</p>
<p>Abstract: Software systems often record important runtime information in logs to help with troubleshooting. Log-based anomaly detection has become a key research area that aims to identify system issues through log data, ultimately enhancing the reliability of software systems. Traditional deep learning methods often struggle to capture the semantic information embedded in log data, which is typically organized in natural language. In this paper, we propose LogLLM, a log-based anomaly detection framework that leverages large language models (LLMs). LogLLM employs BERT for extracting semantic vectors from log messages, while utilizing Llama, a transformer decoder-based model, for classifying log sequences. Additionally, we introduce a projector to align the vector representation spaces of BERT and Llama, ensuring a cohesive understanding of log semantics. Unlike conventional methods that require log parsers to extract templates, LogLLM preprocesses log messages with regular expressions, streamlining the entire process. Our framework is trained through a novel three-stage procedure designed to enhance performance and adaptability. Experimental results across four public datasets demonstrate that LogLLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Even when handling unstable logs, it effectively captures the semantic meaning of log messages and detects anomalies accurately.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Younggyo Seo, Pieter Abbeel</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), we train a value function to understand the long-term consequence of executing a single action. However, the value of taking each action can be ambiguous in robotics as robot movements are typically the aggregate result of executing multiple small actions. Moreover, robotic training data often consists of noisy trajectories, in which each action is noisy but executing a series of actions results in a meaningful robot movement. This further makes it difficult for the value function to understand the effect of individual actions. To address this, we introduce Coarse-to-fine Q-Network with Action Sequence (CQN-AS), a novel value-based RL algorithm that learns a critic network that outputs Q-values over a sequence of actions, i.e., explicitly training the value function to learn the consequence of executing action sequences. We study our algorithm on 53 robotic tasks with sparse and dense rewards, as well as with and without demonstrations, from BiGym, HumanoidBench, and RLBench. We find that CQN-AS outperforms various baselines, in particular on humanoid control tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyle Thompson, Nuno Saavedra, Pedro Carrott, Kevin Fisher, Alex Sanchez-Stern, Yuriy Brun, Jo\~ao F. Ferreira, Sorin Lerner, Emily First</p>
<p>Abstract: Formal verification using proof assistants, such as Coq, enables the creation of high-quality software. However, the verification process requires significant expertise and manual effort to write proofs. Recent work has explored automating proof synthesis using machine learning and large language models (LLMs). This work has shown that identifying relevant premises, such as lemmas and definitions, can aid synthesis. We present Rango, a fully automated proof synthesis tool for Coq that automatically identifies relevant premises and also similar proofs from the current project and uses them during synthesis. Rango uses retrieval augmentation at every step of the proof to automatically determine which proofs and premises to include in the context of its fine-tuned LLM. In this way, Rango adapts to the project and to the evolving state of the proof. We create a new dataset, CoqStoq, of 2,226 open-source Coq projects and 196,929 theorems from GitHub, which includes both training data and a curated evaluation benchmark of well-maintained projects. On this benchmark, Rango synthesizes proofs for 32.0% of the theorems, which is 29% more theorems than the prior state-of-the-art tool Tactician. Our evaluation also shows that Rango adding relevant proofs to its context leads to a 47% increase in the number of theorems proven.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enna Basic, Alberto Giaretta</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for automating various programming tasks, including security-related ones, such as detecting and fixing vulnerabilities. Despite their promising capabilities, when required to produce or modify pre-existing code, LLMs could introduce vulnerabilities unbeknown to the programmer. When analyzing code, they could miss clear vulnerabilities or signal nonexistent ones. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we aim to investigate both the security benefits and potential drawbacks of using LLMs for a variety of code-related tasks. In particular, first we focus on the types of vulnerabilities that could be introduced by LLMs, when used for producing code. Second, we analyze the capabilities of LLMs to detect and fix vulnerabilities, in any given code, and how the prompting strategy of choice impacts their performance in these two tasks. Last, we provide an in-depth analysis on how data poisoning attacks on LLMs can impact performance in the aforementioned tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sascha Saralajew, Ashish Rana, Thomas Villmann, Ammar Shaker</p>
<p>Abstract: Prototype-based classification learning methods are known to be inherently interpretable. However, this paradigm suffers from major limitations compared to deep models, such as lower performance. This led to the development of the so-called deep Prototype-Based Networks (PBNs), also known as prototypical parts models. In this work, we analyze these models with respect to different properties, including interpretability. In particular, we focus on the Classification-by-Components (CBC) approach, which uses a probabilistic model to ensure interpretability and can be used as a shallow or deep architecture. We show that this model has several shortcomings, like creating contradicting explanations. Based on these findings, we propose an extension of CBC that solves these issues. Moreover, we prove that this extension has robustness guarantees and derive a loss that optimizes robustness. Additionally, our analysis shows that most (deep) PBNs are related to (deep) RBF classifiers, which implies that our robustness guarantees generalize to shallow RBF classifiers. The empirical evaluation demonstrates that our deep PBN yields state-of-the-art classification accuracy on different benchmarks while resolving the interpretability shortcomings of other approaches. Further, our shallow PBN variant outperforms other shallow PBNs while being inherently interpretable and exhibiting provable robustness guarantees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyedreza Mohseni, Seyedali Mohammadi, Deepa Tilwani, Yash Saxena, Gerald Ketu Ndawula, Sriram Vema, Edward Raff, Manas Gaur</p>
<p>Abstract: Malware authors often employ code obfuscations to make their malware harder to detect. Existing tools for generating obfuscated code often require access to the original source code (e.g., C++ or Java), and adding new obfuscations is a non-trivial, labor-intensive process. In this study, we ask the following question: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) potentially generate a new obfuscated assembly code? If so, this poses a risk to anti-virus engines and potentially increases the flexibility of attackers to create new obfuscation patterns. We answer this in the affirmative by developing the MetamorphASM benchmark comprising MetamorphASM Dataset (MAD) along with three code obfuscation techniques: dead code, register substitution, and control flow change. The MetamorphASM systematically evaluates the ability of LLMs to generate and analyze obfuscated code using MAD, which contains 328,200 obfuscated assembly code samples. We release this dataset and analyze the success rate of various LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5/4, GPT-4o-mini, Starcoder, CodeGemma, CodeLlama, CodeT5, and LLaMA 3.1) in generating obfuscated assembly code. The evaluation was performed using established information-theoretic metrics and manual human review to ensure correctness and provide the foundation for researchers to study and develop remediations to this risk.</p>

<p>Abstract: Radio remains a pervasive medium for mass information dissemination, with AM/FM stations reaching more Americans than either smartphone-based social networking or live television. Increasingly, radio broadcasts are also streamed online and accessed over the Internet. We present WavePulse, a framework that records, documents, and analyzes radio content in real-time. While our framework is generally applicable, we showcase the efficacy of WavePulse in a collaborative project with a team of political scientists focusing on the 2024 Presidential Elections. We use WavePulse to monitor livestreams of 396 news radio stations over a period of three months, processing close to 500,000 hours of audio streams. These streams were converted into time-stamped, diarized transcripts and analyzed to track answer key political science questions at both the national and state levels. Our analysis revealed how local issues interacted with national trends, providing insights into information flow. Our results demonstrate WavePulse's efficacy in capturing and analyzing content from radio livestreams sourced from the Web. Code and dataset can be accessed at \url{https://wave-pulse.io}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Vision Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a transformative technology at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, enabling machines to perceive and reason about the world through both visual and textual modalities. For example, models such as CLIP, Claude, and GPT-4V demonstrate strong reasoning and understanding abilities on visual and textual data and beat classical single modality vision models on zero-shot classification. Despite their rapid advancements in research and growing popularity in applications, a comprehensive survey of existing studies on VLMs is notably lacking, particularly for researchers aiming to leverage VLMs in their specific domains. To this end, we provide a systematic overview of VLMs in the following aspects: model information of the major VLMs developed over the past five years (2019-2024); the main architectures and training methods of these VLMs; summary and categorization of the popular benchmarks and evaluation metrics of VLMs; the applications of VLMs including embodied agents, robotics, and video generation; the challenges and issues faced by current VLMs such as hallucination, fairness, and safety.

<p>Abstract: Transformers have set new benchmarks in audio processing tasks, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to capture complex patterns and dependencies within audio data. However, their focus on pairwise interactions limits their ability to process the higher-order relations essential for identifying distinct audio objects. To address this limitation, this work introduces the Local- Higher Order Graph Neural Network (LHGNN), a graph based model that enhances feature understanding by integrating local neighbourhood information with higher-order data from Fuzzy C-Means clusters, thereby capturing a broader spectrum of audio relationships. Evaluation of the model on three publicly available audio datasets shows that it outperforms Transformer-based models across all benchmarks while operating with substantially fewer parameters. Moreover, LHGNN demonstrates a distinct advantage in scenarios lacking ImageNet pretraining, establishing its effectiveness and efficiency in environments where extensive pretraining data is unavailable.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Mice Autism Detection via Ultrasound Vocalization (MADUV) Challenge introduces the first INTERSPEECH challenge focused on detecting autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in mice through their vocalizations. Participants are tasked with developing models to automatically classify mice as either wild-type or ASD models based on recordings with a high sampling rate. Our baseline system employs a simple CNN-based classification using three different spectrogram features. Results demonstrate the feasibility of automated ASD detection, with the considered audible-range features achieving the best performance (UAR of 0.600 for segment-level and 0.625 for subject-level classification). This challenge bridges speech technology and biomedical research, offering opportunities to advance our understanding of ASD models through machine learning approaches. The findings suggest promising directions for vocalization analysis and highlight the potential value of audible and ultrasound vocalizations in ASD detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lokesh Boominathan, Yizhou Chen, Matthew McGinley, Xaq Pitkow</p>
<p>Abstract: Being attentive to task-relevant features can improve task performance, but paying attention comes with its own metabolic cost. Therefore, strategic allocation of attention is crucial in performing the task efficiently. This work aims to understand this strategy. Recently, de Gee et al. conducted experiments involving mice performing an auditory sustained attention-value task. This task required the mice to exert attention to identify whether a high-order acoustic feature was present amid the noise. By varying the trial duration and reward magnitude, the task allows us to investigate how an agent should strategically deploy their attention to maximize their benefits and minimize their costs. In our work, we develop a reinforcement learning-based normative model of the mice to understand how it balances attention cost against its benefits. The model is such that at each moment the mice can choose between two levels of attention and decide when to take costly actions that could obtain rewards. Our model suggests that efficient use of attentional resources involves alternating blocks of high attention with blocks of low attention. In the extreme case where the agent disregards sensory input during low attention states, we see that high attention is used rhythmically. Our model provides evidence about how one should deploy attention as a function of task utility, signal statistics, and how attention affects sensory evidence.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper examines the workload distribution challenges in centralized cloud systems and demonstrates how Hybrid Edge Cloud (HEC) [1] mitigates these inefficiencies. Workloads in cloud environments often follow a Pareto distribution, where a small percentage of tasks consume most resources, leading to bottlenecks and energy inefficiencies. By analyzing both traditional workloads reflective of typical IoT and smart device usage and agentic workloads, such as those generated by AI agents, robotics, and autonomous systems, this study quantifies the energy and cost savings enabled by HEC. Our findings reveal that HEC achieves energy savings of up to 75% and cost reductions exceeding 80%, even in resource-intensive agentic scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of HEC in enabling scalable, cost-effective, and sustainable computing for the next generation of intelligent systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Resource-constrained edge deployments demand AI solutions that balance high performance with stringent compute, memory, and energy limitations. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the primary strategies for accelerating deep learning models under such constraints. First, we examine model compression techniques-pruning, quantization, tensor decomposition, and knowledge distillation-that streamline large models into smaller, faster, and more efficient variants. Next, we explore Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a class of automated methods that discover architectures inherently optimized for particular tasks and hardware budgets. We then discuss compiler and deployment frameworks, such as TVM, TensorRT, and OpenVINO, which provide hardware-tailored optimizations at inference time. By integrating these three pillars into unified pipelines, practitioners can achieve multi-objective goals, including latency reduction, memory savings, and energy efficiency-all while maintaining competitive accuracy. We also highlight emerging frontiers in hierarchical NAS, neurosymbolic approaches, and advanced distillation tailored to large language models, underscoring open challenges like pre-training pruning for massive networks. Our survey offers practical insights, identifies current research gaps, and outlines promising directions for building scalable, platform-independent frameworks to accelerate deep learning models at the edge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengshi Qi, Xiaoyang Bi, Pengfei Zhu, Huadong Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Robustly predicting attention regions of interest for self-driving systems is crucial for driving safety but presents significant challenges due to the labor-intensive nature of obtaining large-scale attention labels and the domain gap between self-driving scenarios and natural scenes. These challenges are further exacerbated by complex traffic environments, including camera corruption under adverse weather, noise interferences, and central bias from long-tail distributions. To address these issues, we propose a robust unsupervised attention prediction method. An Uncertainty Mining Branch refines predictions by analyzing commonalities and differences across multiple pre-trained models on natural scenes, while a Knowledge Embedding Block bridges the domain gap by incorporating driving knowledge to adaptively enhance pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce RoboMixup, a novel data augmentation method that improves robustness against corruption through soft attention and dynamic augmentation, and mitigates central bias by integrating random cropping into Mixup as a regularizer. To systematically evaluate robustness in self-driving attention prediction, we introduce the DriverAttention-C benchmark, comprising over 100k frames across three subsets: BDD-A-C, DR(eye)VE-C, and DADA-2000-C. Our method achieves performance equivalent to or surpassing fully supervised state-of-the-art approaches on three public datasets and the proposed robustness benchmark, reducing relative corruption degradation by 58.8% and 52.8%, and improving central bias robustness by 12.4% and 11.4% in KLD and CC metrics, respectively.

<p>Abstract: Understanding the physical world is a fundamental challenge in embodied AI, critical for enabling agents to perform complex tasks and operate safely in real-world environments. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 10,002 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world -- likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA. We believe that PhysBench and PhysAgent offer valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between VLMs and physical world understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Makoto Shing, Kou Misaki, Han Bao, Sho Yokoi, Takuya Akiba</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their size poses significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation, a widely-used technique for transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a small student model, presents a promising approach for model compression. A significant remaining issue lies in the major differences between teacher and student models, namely the substantial capacity gap, mode averaging, and mode collapse, which pose barriers during distillation. To address these issues, we introduce $\textit{Temporally Adaptive Interpolated Distillation (TAID)}$, a novel knowledge distillation approach that dynamically interpolates student and teacher distributions through an adaptive intermediate distribution, gradually shifting from the student's initial distribution towards the teacher's distribution. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating TAID's ability to prevent mode collapse and empirically show its effectiveness in addressing the capacity gap while balancing mode averaging and mode collapse. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate TAID's superior performance across various model sizes and architectures in both instruction tuning and pre-training scenarios. Furthermore, we showcase TAID's practical impact by developing two state-of-the-art compact foundation models: $\texttt{TAID-LLM-1.5B}$ for language tasks and $\texttt{TAID-VLM-2B}$ for vision-language tasks. These results demonstrate TAID's effectiveness in creating high-performing and efficient models, advancing the development of more accessible AI technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Dax, Jordi Berbel, Jan Stria, Leonidas Guibas, Urs Bergmann</p>
<p>Abstract: We generate abstractions of buildings, reflecting the essential aspects of their geometry and structure, by learning to invert procedural models. We first build a dataset of abstract procedural building models paired with simulated point clouds and then learn the inverse mapping through a transformer. Given a point cloud, the trained transformer then infers the corresponding abstracted building in terms of a programmatic language description. This approach leverages expressive procedural models developed for gaming and animation, and thereby retains desirable properties such as efficient rendering of the inferred abstractions and strong priors for regularity and symmetry. Our approach achieves good reconstruction accuracy in terms of geometry and structure, as well as structurally consistent inpainting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengxuan Wu, Aryaman Arora, Atticus Geiger, Zheng Wang, Jing Huang, Dan Jurafsky, Christopher D. Manning, Christopher Potts</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained steering of language model outputs is essential for safety and reliability. Prompting and finetuning are widely used to achieve these goals, but interpretability researchers have proposed a variety of representation-based techniques as well, including sparse autoencoders (SAEs), linear artificial tomography, supervised steering vectors, linear probes, and representation finetuning. At present, there is no benchmark for making direct comparisons between these proposals. Therefore, we introduce AxBench, a large-scale benchmark for steering and concept detection, and report experiments on Gemma-2-2B and 9B. For steering, we find that prompting outperforms all existing methods, followed by finetuning. For concept detection, representation-based methods such as difference-in-means, perform the best. On both evaluations, SAEs are not competitive. We introduce a novel weakly-supervised representational method (Rank-1 Representation Finetuning; ReFT-r1), which is competitive on both tasks while providing the interpretability advantages that prompting lacks. Along with AxBench, we train and publicly release SAE-scale feature dictionaries for ReFT-r1 and DiffMean.</p>
