<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21344">Towards mitigating information leakage when evaluating safety monitors</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Gerard Boxo, Aman Neelappa, Shivam Raval</p>
<p>Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However, training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongkyu Cho, Amy B. Z. Zhang, Bilel Fehri, Sheng Wang, Rumi Chunara, Rui Song, Hengrui Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exposes the intermediate thinking process of large language models (LLMs), yet verifying those traces at scale remains unsolved. In response, we introduce the idea of decision pivots-minimal, verifiable checkpoints that any correct reasoning path must visit. We hypothesize that correct reasoning, though stylistically diverse, converge on the same pivot set, while incorrect ones violate at least one pivot. Leveraging this property, we propose a self-training pipeline that (i) samples diverse reasoning paths and mines shared decision pivots, (ii) compresses each trace into pivot-focused short-path reasoning using an auxiliary verifier, and (iii) post-trains the model using its self-generated outputs. The proposed method aligns reasoning without ground truth reasoning data or external metrics. Experiments on standard benchmarks such as LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500 show the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Jaber, Wangshu Zhu, Karthick Jayavelu, Justin Downes, Sameer Mohamed, Candace Agonafir, Linnia Hawkins, Tian Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph (KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate that "a knowledge graph is all you need" to unlock scalable and agentic workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can evolve as a shared commons. Our results illustrate a pathway toward democratizing access to climate data and establishing a reproducible, extensible framework for human--AI collaboration in scientific research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Parsa Afshar, Aryan Azimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models, the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21593">GeoEvolve: Automating Geospatial Model Discovery via Multi-Agent Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Luo, Xiayin Lou, Yu Zheng, Zhuo Zheng, Stefano Ermon</p>
<p>Abstract: Geospatial modeling provides critical solutions for pressing global challenges such as sustainability and climate change. Existing large language model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks: spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification (geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error (RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\%. Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable, high-quality evolution. These results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mafalda Malafaia, Peter A. N. Bosman, Coen Rasch, Tanja Alderliesten</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and interpretable survival analysis remains a core challenge in oncology. With growing multimodal data and the clinical need for transparent models to support validation and trust, this challenge increases in complexity. We propose an interpretable multimodal AI framework to automate survival analysis by integrating clinical variables and computed tomography imaging. Our MultiFIX-based framework uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features that are further explained: imaging features are interpreted via Grad-CAM, while clinical variables are modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic programming. Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic markers. These results highlight the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for precision oncology with MultiFIX.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21633">Semantic F1 Scores: Fair Evaluation Under Fuzzy Class Boundaries</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgios Chochlakis, Jackson Trager, Vedant Jhaveri, Nikhil Ravichandran, Alexandros Potamianos, Shrikanth Narayanan</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Semantic F1 Scores, novel evaluation metrics for subjective or fuzzy multi-label classification that quantify semantic relatedness between predicted and gold labels. Unlike the conventional F1 metrics that treat semantically related predictions as complete failures, Semantic F1 incorporates a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like scores, from which the Semantic F1 scores are derived. Unlike existing similarity-based metrics, our novel two-step precision-recall formulation enables the comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding labels or forcing matches between dissimilar labels. By granting partial credit for semantically related but nonidentical labels, Semantic F1 better reflects the realities of domains marked by human disagreement or fuzzy category boundaries. In this way, it provides fairer evaluations: it recognizes that categories overlap, that annotators disagree, and that downstream decisions based on similar predictions lead to similar outcomes. Through theoretical justification and extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real data, we show that Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological validity. Because it requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix, which is robust to misspecification, and not a rigid ontology, it is applicable across tasks and modalities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21651">Can AI Perceive Physical Danger and Intervene?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Jindal, Dmitry Kalashnikov, Oscar Chang, Divya Garikapati, Anirudha Majumdar, Pierre Sermanet, Vikas Sindhwani</p>
<p>Abstract: When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent -- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions. The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at https://asimov-benchmark.github.io/v2</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21718">Align2Speak: Improving TTS for Low Resource Languages via ASR-Guided Online Preference Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shehzeen Hussain, Paarth Neekhara, Xuesong Yang, Edresson Casanova, Subhankar Ghosh, Roy Fejgin, Ryan Langman, Mikyas Desta, Leili Tavabi, Jason Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts. We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens. Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages, substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21743">Retrieval-of-Thought: Efficient Reasoning via Reusing Thoughts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ammar Ahmed, Azal Ahmad Khan, Ayaan Ahmad, Sheng Di, Zirui Liu, Ali Anwar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large reasoning models improve accuracy by producing long reasoning traces, but this inflates latency and cost, motivating inference-time efficiency. We propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable ``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and, therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage, latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy. RoT establishes a scalable paradigm for efficient LRM reasoning via dynamic template construction through retrieval.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21765">Lifelong Learning with Behavior Consolidation for Vehicle Routing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiyuan Pei, Yi Mei, Jialin Liu, Mengjie Zhang, Xin Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed. LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way. To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue, maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks. In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings, whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth analysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and attribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional fundamental capability gaps. \href{https://github.com/StarDewXXX/UltraHorizon}{Our code will be available here.}</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly positioned as AI collaborators for building complex web-related applications like GUI agents and front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks largely emphasize visual perception or UI code generation, showing insufficient evaluation on the reasoning, robustness and safety capability required for end-to-end web applications. To bridge the gap, we introduce a comprehensive web understanding benchmark, named WebRSSBench, that jointly evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and Safety across eight tasks, such as position relationship reasoning, color robustness, and safety critical detection, etc. The benchmark is constructed from 729 websites and contains 3799 question answer pairs that probe multi-step inference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions. To ensure reliable measurement, we adopt standardized prompts, deterministic evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control combining automatic checks with targeted human verification. We evaluate 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench. The results reveal significant gaps, models still struggle with compositional and cross-element reasoning over realistic layouts, show limited robustness when facing perturbations in user interfaces and content such as layout rearrangements or visual style shifts, and are rather conservative in recognizing and avoiding safety critical or irreversible actions.

<p>Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking, Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC) Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA) completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience. Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks, achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of each component to the framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaole Dai, Shiqi Jiang, Ting Cao, Yuqing Yang, Yuanchun Li, Rui Tan, Mo Li, Lili Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward is critical to the evaluation and training of large language models (LLMs). However, existing rule-based or model-based reward methods struggle to generalize to GUI agents, where access to ground-truth trajectories or application databases is often unavailable, and static trajectory-based LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose ProRe, a proactive reward system that leverages a general-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents (actors). The reasoner schedules targeted state probing tasks, which the evaluator agents then execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional observations. This enables the reasoner to assign more accurate and verifiable rewards to GUI agents. Empirical results on over 3K trajectories demonstrate that ProRe improves reward accuracy and F1 score by up to 5.3% and 19.4%, respectively. Furthermore, integrating ProRe with state-of-the-art policy agents yields a success rate improvement of up to 22.4%.</p>

While large language models (LLMs) show significant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with heterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as verifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels for such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR, a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and DA-Code. Moreover, DS-STAR particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks that require processing multiple data files with heterogeneous formats.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Abramowitz, Nicholas Mattei</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a framework for modeling decisions with axioms that are statements about decisions, e.g., ethical constraints. Using our framework we define a taxonomy of decision axioms based on their structural properties and demonstrate a tension between the use of axioms to make decisions and the use of axioms to evaluate decisions which we call the Decision-Evaluation Paradox. We argue that the Decision-Evaluation Paradox arises with realistic axiom structures, and the paradox illuminates why one must be exceptionally careful when training models on decision data or applying axioms to make and evaluate decisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yansong Ning, Rui Liu, Jun Wang, Kai Chen, Wei Li, Jun Fang, Kan Zheng, Naiqiang Tan, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Travel planning (TP) agent has recently worked as an emerging building block to interact with external tools and resources for travel itinerary generation, ensuring enjoyable user experience. Despite its benefits, existing studies rely on hand craft prompt and fixed agent workflow, hindering more flexible and autonomous TP agent. This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic reinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent, capable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool responses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step reasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by caching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent training without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g., inconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling system, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal feasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level verifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses, enabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply augmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically replay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We deploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct comprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel enables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform existing frontier LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> So Kuroki, Yingtao Tian, Kou Misaki, Takashi Ikegami, Takuya Akiba, Yujin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S. tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and scientifically grounded research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Zheng, Jiaying Zhu, Jingyi Zhou, Qiang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning to compute, the ability to model the functional behavior of a computational graph, is a fundamental challenge for graph representation learning. Yet, the dominant paradigm is architecturally mismatched for this task. This flawed assumption, central to mainstream message passing neural networks (MPNNs) and their conventional Transformer-based counterparts, prevents models from capturing the position-aware, hierarchical nature of computation. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{TRACE}, a new paradigm built on an architecturally sound backbone and a principled learning objective. First, TRACE employs a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the step-by-step flow of computation, providing a faithful architectural backbone that replaces the flawed permutation-invariant aggregation. Second, we introduce \textbf{function shift learning}, a novel objective that decouples the learning problem. Instead of predicting the complex global function directly, our model is trained to predict only the \textit{function shift}, the discrepancy between the true global function and a simple local approximation that assumes input independence. We validate this paradigm on electronic circuits, one of the most complex and economically critical classes of computational graphs. Across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, TRACE substantially outperforms all prior architectures. These results demonstrate that our architecturally-aligned backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for the fundamental challenge of learning to compute on graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqi Chen, Yi Mei, Fangfang Zhang, Mengjie Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic job shop scheduling, a fundamental combinatorial optimisation problem in various industrial sectors, poses substantial challenges for effective scheduling due to frequent disruptions caused by the arrival of new jobs. State-of-the-art methods employ machine learning to learn scheduling policies offline, enabling rapid responses to dynamic events. However, these offline policies are often imperfect, necessitating the use of planning techniques such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve performance at online decision time. The unpredictability of new job arrivals complicates online planning, as decisions based on incomplete problem information are vulnerable to disturbances. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Robust MCTS (DyRo-MCTS) approach, which integrates action robustness estimation into MCTS. DyRo-MCTS guides the production environment toward states that not only yield good scheduling outcomes but are also easily adaptable to future job arrivals. Extensive experiments show that DyRo-MCTS significantly improves the performance of offline-learned policies with negligible additional online planning time. Moreover, DyRo-MCTS consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across various scheduling scenarios. Further analysis reveals that its ability to make robust scheduling decisions leads to long-term, sustainable performance gains under disturbances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlo Dindorf, Jonas Dully, Steven Simon, Dennis Perchthaler, Stephan Becker, Hannah Ehmann, Kjell Heitmann, Bernd Stetter, Christian Diers, Michael Fr\"ohlich</p>
<p>Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhimin Wang, Shaokang He, Duo Wu, Jinghe Wang, Linjia Kang, Jing Yu, Zhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents -- a crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renqi Chen, Zeyin Tao, Jianming Guo, Jingzhe Zhu, Yiheng Peng, Qingqing Sun, Tianyi Zhang, Shuai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: E-commerce risk management requires aggregating diverse, deeply embedded web data through multi-step, stateful interactions, which traditional scraping methods and most existing Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents cannot handle. These agents are typically limited to single-step tasks and lack the ability to manage dynamic, interactive content critical for effective risk assessment. To address this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build and deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1) RISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction trajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a meticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802 single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for standardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning framework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to enhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step Level: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early training stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical later steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to focus on tasks of varying difficulty. Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and an 8.8% improvement in offline multi-step. Moreover, it attains a top task success rate of 70.5% in online evaluation. RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific solution for automating complex web interactions, advancing the state of the art in e-commerce risk management.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21993">Bilinear relational structure fixes reversal curse and enables consistent model editing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong-Kyum Kim, Minsung Kim, Jea Kwon, Nakyeong Yang, Meeyoung Cha</p>
<p>Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanlin Zhu, Tianyu Guo, Song Mei, Stuart Russell, Nikhil Ghosh, Alberto Bietti, Jiantao Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent, where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems, but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5 only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models. Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaochong Lan, Yu Zheng, Shiteng Cao, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising, training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model. While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves, providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape. Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces. Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning profiles to meet diverse application demands.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Wang, Boye Niu, Zhongli Li, Linghui Meng, Jing Liu, Zhi Zheng, Tong Xu, Hua Wu, Haifeng Wang, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the inference stage with a "thinking longer" paradigm. Even as the foundational reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a model's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge the gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly 30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadar Peer, Eyal Weiss, Ron Alterovitz, Oren Salzman</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-objective search (MOS) has become essential in robotics, as real-world robotic systems need to simultaneously balance multiple, often conflicting objectives. Recent works explore complex interactions between objectives, leading to problem formulations that do not allow the usage of out-of-the-box state-of-the-art MOS algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a generalized problem formulation that optimizes solution objectives via aggregation functions of hidden (search) objectives. We show that our formulation supports the application of standard MOS algorithms, necessitating only to properly extend several core operations to reflect the specific aggregation functions employed. We demonstrate our approach in several diverse robotics planning problems, spanning motion-planning for navigation, manipulation and planning fr medical systems under obstacle uncertainty as well as inspection planning, and route planning with different road types. We solve the problems using state-of-the-art MOS algorithms after properly extending their core operations, and provide empirical evidence that they outperform by orders of magnitude the vanilla versions of the algorithms applied to the same problems but without objective aggregation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) present fascinating opportunities for innovation, their rapid development is also significantly impacting our environment. In response to growing resource-awareness in the field, quantification tools such as the ML Emissions Calculator and CodeCarbon were developed to estimate the energy consumption and carbon emissions of running AI models. They are easy to incorporate into AI projects, however also make pragmatic assumptions and neglect important factors, raising the question of estimation accuracy. This study systematically evaluates the reliability of static and dynamic energy estimation approaches through comparisons with ground-truth measurements across hundreds of AI experiments. Based on the proposed validation framework, investigative insights into AI energy demand and estimation inaccuracies are provided. While generally following the patterns of AI energy consumption, the established estimation approaches are shown to consistently make errors of up to 40%. By providing empirical evidence on energy estimation quality and errors, this study establishes transparency and validates widely used tools for sustainable AI development. It moreover formulates guidelines for improving the state-of-the-art and offers code for extending the validation to other domains and tools, thus making important contributions to resource-aware ML and AI sustainability research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seoyoung Lee, Seonbin Yoon, Seongbeen Lee, Hyesoo Kim, Joo Yong Sim</p>
<p>Abstract: GUI task automation streamlines repetitive tasks, but existing LLM or VLM-based planner-executor agents suffer from brittle generalization, high latency, and limited long-horizon coherence. Their reliance on single-shot reasoning or static plans makes them fragile under UI changes or complex tasks. Log2Plan addresses these limitations by combining a structured two-level planning framework with a task mining approach over user behavior logs, enabling robust and adaptable GUI automation. Log2Plan constructs high-level plans by mapping user commands to a structured task dictionary, enabling consistent and generalizable automation. To support personalization and reuse, it employs a task mining approach from user behavior logs that identifies user-specific patterns. These high-level plans are then grounded into low-level action sequences by interpreting real-time GUI context, ensuring robust execution across varying interfaces. We evaluated Log2Plan on 200 real-world tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rate and execution time. Notably, it maintains over 60.0% success rate even on long-horizon task sequences, highlighting its robustness in complex, multi-step workflows.</p>

<p>Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better reflect clinical data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses. Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our work paves the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven solutions in healthcare.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksandar Terzi\'c, Nicolas Menet, Michael Hersche, Thomas Hofmann, Abbas Rahimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity, as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA). While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity, they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of variable-length English sentences.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22297">Large Language Models as Nondeterministic Causal Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sander Beckers</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work by Chatzi et al. and Ravfogel et al. has developed, for the first time, a method for generating counterfactuals of probabilistic Large Language Models. Such counterfactuals tell us what would - or might - have been the output of an LLM if some factual prompt ${\bf x}$ had been ${\bf x}^*$ instead. The ability to generate such counterfactuals is an important necessary step towards explaining, evaluating, and comparing, the behavior of LLMs. I argue, however, that the existing method rests on an ambiguous interpretation of LLMs: it does not interpret LLMs literally, for the method involves the assumption that one can change the implementation of an LLM's sampling process without changing the LLM itself, nor does it interpret LLMs as intended, for the method involves explicitly representing a nondeterministic LLM as a deterministic causal model. I here present a much simpler method for generating counterfactuals that is based on an LLM's intended interpretation by representing it as a nondeterministic causal model instead. The advantage of my simpler method is that it is directly applicable to any black-box LLM without modification, as it is agnostic to any implementation details. The advantage of the existing method, on the other hand, is that it directly implements the generation of a specific type of counterfactuals that is useful for certain purposes, but not for others. I clarify how both methods relate by offering a theoretical foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals in LLMs based on their intended semantics, thereby laying the groundwork for novel application-specific methods for generating counterfactuals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hieu Tran, Zonghai Yao, Nguyen Luong Tran, Zhichao Yang, Feiyun Ouyang, Shuo Han, Razieh Rahimi, Hong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking, Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and \textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation}, \textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and \textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent work has explored training Large Language Model (LLM) search agents with reinforcement learning (RL) for open-domain question answering (QA). However, most evaluations focus solely on final answer accuracy, overlooking how these agents reason with and act on external evidence. We introduce SeekBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the \textit{epistemic competence} of LLM search agents through step-level analysis of their response traces. SeekBench comprises 190 expert-annotated traces with over 1,800 response steps generated by LLM search agents, each enriched with evidence annotations for granular analysis of whether agents (1) generate reasoning steps grounded in observed evidence, (2) adaptively reformulate searches to recover from low-quality results, and (3) have proper calibration to correctly assess whether the current evidence is sufficient for providing an answer.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models increasingly rely on diverse training data to achieve robust generalization. However, collecting large-scale real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation (EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent, geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground, background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a 200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in boosting policy generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikhil Baid, Hannah Erlebach, Paul Hellegouarch, Frederico Wieser</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have recently opened up new frontiers in the field of artificial life (ALife) by providing powerful tools to automate search through ALife simulations. Previous work aligns ALife simulations with natural language target prompts using vision-language models (VLMs). We build on Automated Search for Artificial Life (ASAL) by introducing ASAL++, a method for open-ended-like search guided by multimodal FMs. We use a second FM to propose new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history. This induces an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets.
  We explore two strategies: (1) evolving a simulation to match a single new prompt at each iteration (Evolved Supervised Targets: EST) and (2) evolving a simulation to match the entire sequence of generated prompts (Evolved Temporal Targets: ETT). We test our method empirically in the Lenia substrate using Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets, and show that EST promotes greater visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary sequences.
  Our results suggest that ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shichao Weng, Zhiqiang Wang, Yuhua Zhou, Rui Lu, Ting Liu, Zhiyang Teng, Xiaozhang Liu, Hanmeng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and (3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenglin Yu, Yang Yu, Songmiao Wang, Yucheng Wang, Yifan Yang, Jinjia Li, Ming Li, Hongxia Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in organizing and executing complex tasks, and many such agents are now widely used in various application scenarios. However, developing these agents requires carefully designed workflows, carefully crafted prompts, and iterative tuning, which requires LLM techniques and domain-specific expertise. These hand-crafted limitations hinder the scalability and cost-effectiveness of LLM agents across a wide range of industries. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{InfiAgent}, a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework that can be applied to \textbf{infi}nite scenarios, which introduces several key innovations: a generalized "agent-as-a-tool" mechanism that automatically decomposes complex agents into hierarchical multi-agent systems; a dual-audit mechanism that ensures the quality and stability of task completion; an agent routing function that enables efficient task-agent matching; and an agent self-evolution mechanism that autonomously restructures the agent DAG based on new tasks, poor performance, or optimization opportunities. Furthermore, InfiAgent's atomic task design supports agent parallelism, significantly improving execution efficiency. This framework evolves into a versatile pyramid-like multi-agent system capable of solving a wide range of problems. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that InfiAgent achieves 9.9\% higher performance compared to ADAS (similar auto-generated agent framework), while a case study of the AI research assistant InfiHelper shows that it generates scientific papers that have received recognition from human reviewers at top-tier IEEE conferences.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22504">Estimating the Empowerment of Language Model Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyeop Song, Jeff Gore, Max Kleiman-Weiner</p>
<p>Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities. Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments, including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and evaluator bias. The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus input on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character recognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a retrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers, and external references, enabling a large language model to assign scores with explicit, evidence-linked reasoning. Unlike prior tablet-based exam systems that primarily digitize responses, TrueGradeAI advances the field by incorporating explainable automation, bias mitigation, and auditable grading trails. By uniting handwriting preservation with scalable and transparent evaluation, the framework reduces environmental costs, accelerates feedback cycles, and progressively builds a reusable knowledge base, while actively working to mitigate grading bias and ensure fairness in assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Li, Guanzhi Deng, Ronghao Chen, Junrong Yue, Shuo Zhang, Qinghua Zhao, Linqi Song, Lijie Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations, thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of black-box models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyang Li, Xiao Jia, Zhanzhan Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulation is a frontier in computational social science. Understanding the social logics these agents embody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how altruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges in large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a Schelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma, compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central finding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We identify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default to prioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly increase under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and "Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic, consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to themselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings of these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to systematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the first evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic tendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model selection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of choosing an intrinsic social action logic. While "Adaptive Egoists" may offer a more suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, "Altruistic Optimizers" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or scenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Zhou, Tianyi Xu, Jianghao Lin, Dongdong Ge</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning. Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive, outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover, the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of both our own model and other existing LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and cloud-based AI agents is transforming human-AI collaboration into bidirectional, multimodal interaction. However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way communication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional compress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose UniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that bridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or plain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the communication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while maintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression, lightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific designs-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token redundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low bitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These results establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for next-generation multimodal interactive communication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixuan Han, Fan Ma, Ruijie Quan, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However, existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search (DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siwei Wang, Yifei Shen, Haoran Sun, Shi Feng, Shang-Hua Teng, Li Dong, Yaru Hao, Wei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction, focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gurbinder Gill, Ritvik Gupta, Denis Lusson, Anand Chandrashekar, Donald Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the standard paradigm for answering questions on enterprise data. Traditionally, RAG has centered on text-based semantic search and re-ranking. However, this approach falls short when dealing with questions beyond data summarization or non-text data. This has led to various attempts to supplement RAG to bridge the gap between RAG, the implementation paradigm, and the question answering problem that enterprise users expect it to solve. Given that contemporary RAG is a collection of techniques rather than a defined implementation, discussion of RAG and related question-answering systems benefits from a problem-oriented understanding.
  We propose a new classification framework (L1-L5) to categorize systems based on data modalities and task complexity of the underlying question answering problems: L1 (Surface Knowledge of Unstructured Data) through L4 (Reflective and Reasoned Knowledge) and the aspirational L5 (General Intelligence). We also introduce benchmarks aligned with these levels and evaluate four state-of-the-art platforms: LangChain, Azure AI Search, OpenAI, and Corvic AI. Our experiments highlight the value of multi-space retrieval and dynamic orchestration for enabling L1-L4 capabilities. We empirically validate our findings using diverse datasets indicative of enterprise use cases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a foundational component of modern AI systems, yet it introduces significant privacy risks by exposing user queries to service providers. To address this, we introduce PIR-RAG, a practical system for privacy-preserving RAG. PIR-RAG employs a novel architecture that uses coarse-grained semantic clustering to prune the search space, combined with a fast, lattice-based Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol. This design allows for the efficient retrieval of entire document clusters, uniquely optimizing for the end-to-end RAG workflow where full document content is required. Our comprehensive evaluation against strong baseline architectures, including graph-based PIR and Tiptoe-style private scoring, demonstrates PIR-RAG's scalability and its superior performance in terms of "RAG-Ready Latency"-the true end-to-end time required to securely fetch content for an LLM. Our work establishes PIR-RAG as a viable and highly efficient solution for privacy in large-scale AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiyeon Kim, Yingjie Hu, Negar Elhami-Khorasani, Kai Sun, Ryan Zhenqi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting the spread of wildfires is essential for effective fire management and risk assessment. With the fast advancements of artificial intelligence (AI), various deep learning models have been developed and utilized for wildfire spread prediction. However, there is limited understanding of the advantages and limitations of these models, and it is also unclear how deep learning-based fire spread models can be compared with existing non-AI fire models. In this work, we assess the ability of five typical deep learning models integrated with weather and environmental variables for wildfire spread prediction based on over ten years of wildfire data in the state of Hawaii. We further use the 2023 Maui fires as a case study to compare the best deep learning models with a widely-used fire spread model, FARSITE. The results show that two deep learning models, i.e., ConvLSTM and ConvLSTM with attention, perform the best among the five tested AI models. FARSITE shows higher precision, lower recall, and higher F1-score than the best AI models, while the AI models offer higher flexibility for the input data. By integrating AI models with an explainable AI method, we further identify important weather and environmental factors associated with the 2023 Maui wildfires.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahedi Hasan</p>
<p>Abstract: Seismic velocity inversion is a key task in geophysical exploration, enabling the reconstruction of subsurface structures from seismic wave data. It is critical for high-resolution seismic imaging and interpretation. Traditional physics-driven methods, such as Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), are computationally demanding, sensitive to initialization, and limited by the bandwidth of seismic data. Recent advances in deep learning have led to data-driven approaches that treat velocity inversion as a dense prediction task. This research benchmarks three advanced encoder-decoder architectures -- U-Net, U-Net++, and DeepLabV3+ -- together with SeismoLabV3+, an optimized variant of DeepLabV3+ with a ResNeXt50 32x4d backbone and task-specific modifications -- for seismic velocity inversion using the ThinkOnward 2025 Speed \& Structure dataset, which consists of five-channel seismic shot gathers paired with high-resolution velocity maps. Experimental results show that SeismoLabV3+ achieves the best performance, with MAPE values of 0.03025 on the internal validation split and 0.031246 on the hidden test set as scored via the official ThinkOnward leaderboard. These findings demonstrate the suitability of deep segmentation networks for seismic velocity inversion and underscore the value of tailored architectural refinements in advancing geophysical AI models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Zhang, Wenzhe Yin, Shujian Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective cross-modal retrieval requires robust alignment of heterogeneous data types. Most existing methods focus on bi-modal retrieval tasks and rely on distributional alignment techniques such as Kullback-Leibler divergence, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and correlation alignment. However, these methods often suffer from critical limitations, including numerical instability, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and their inability to capture the full structure of the underlying distributions. In this paper, we introduce the Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence, a hyperparameter-free measure that improves both training stability and retrieval performance. We further propose a novel Generalized CS (GCS) divergence inspired by H\"older's inequality. This extension enables direct alignment of three or more modalities within a unified mathematical framework through a bidirectional circular comparison scheme, eliminating the need for exhaustive pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both bi-modal and tri-modal retrieval tasks. The code of our CS/GCS divergence is publicly available at https://github.com/JiahaoZhang666/CSD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose an information-topological framework in which cycle closure is the fundamental mechanism of memory and consciousness. Memory is not a static store but the ability to re-enter latent cycles in neural state space, with invariant cycles serving as carriers of meaning by filtering order-specific noise and preserving what persists across contexts. The dot-cycle dichotomy captures this: transient dots scaffold exploration, while nontrivial cycles encode low-entropy content invariants that stabilize memory. Biologically, polychronous neural groups realize 1-cycles through delay-locked spiking reinforced by STDP, nested within theta-gamma rhythms that enforce boundary cancellation. These micro-cycles compose hierarchically, extending navigation loops into general memory and cognition. The perception-action cycle introduces high-order invariance: closure holds even across sense-act alternations, generalizing ancestral homing behavior. Sheaf-cosheaf duality formalizes this process: sheaves glue perceptual fragments into global sections, cosheaves decompose global plans into actions and closure aligns top-down predictions with bottom-up cycles. Consciousness then arises as the persistence of high-order invariants that integrate (unity) yet differentiate (richness) across contexts. We conclude that cycle is all you need: persistent invariants enable generalization in non-ergodic environments with long-term coherence at minimal energetic cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Sadegh Khorshidi, Navid Yazdanjue, Hassan Gharoun, Mohammad Reza Nikoo, Fang Chen, Amir H. Gandomi</p>
<p>Abstract: We study symbolic surrogate modeling of frozen Transformer embeddings to obtain compact, auditable classifiers with calibrated probabilities. For five benchmarks (SST2G, 20NG, MNIST, CIFAR10, MSC17), embeddings from ModernBERT, DINOv2, and SigLIP are partitioned on the training set into disjoint, information-preserving views via semantic-preserving feature partitioning (SPFP). A cooperative multi-population genetic program (MEGP) then learns additive, closed-form logit programs over these views. Across 30 runs per dataset we report F1, AUC, log-loss, Brier, expected calibration error (ECE), and symbolic complexity; a canonical model is chosen by a one-standard-error rule on validation F1 with a parsimony tie-break. Temperature scaling fitted on validation yields substantial ECE reductions on test. The resulting surrogates achieve strong discrimination (up to F1 around 0.99 on MNIST, CIFAR10, MSC17; around 0.95 on SST2G), while 20NG remains most challenging. We provide reliability diagrams, dimension usage and overlap statistics, contribution-based importances, and global effect profiles (PDP and ALE), demonstrating faithful, cross-modal explanations grounded in explicit programs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huizhe Zhang, Jintang Li, Yuchang Zhu, Liang Chen, Li Kuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are exemplary deep models designed for graph data. Message passing mechanism enables GNNs to effectively capture graph topology and push the performance boundaries across various graph tasks. However, the trend of developing such complex machinery for graph representation learning has become unsustainable on large-scale graphs. The computational and time overhead make it imperative to develop more energy-efficient GNNs to cope with the explosive growth of real-world graphs. Spiking Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), which integrate biologically plausible learning via unique spike-based neurons, have emerged as a promising energy-efficient alternative. Different layers communicate with sparse and binary spikes, which facilitates computation and storage of intermediate graph representations. Despite the proliferation of SGNNs proposed in recent years, there is no systematic benchmark to explore the basic design principles of these brain-inspired networks on the graph data. To bridge this gap, we present SGNNBench to quantify progress in the field of SGNNs. Specifically, SGNNBench conducts an in-depth investigation of SGNNs from multiple perspectives, including effectiveness, energy efficiency, and architectural design. We comprehensively evaluate 9 state-of-the-art SGNNs across 18 datasets. Regarding efficiency, we empirically compare these baselines w.r.t model size, memory usage, and theoretical energy consumption to reveal the often-overlooked energy bottlenecks of SGNNs. Besides, we elaborately investigate the design space of SGNNs to promote the development of a general SGNN paradigm.</p>

<p>Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanshun Xu, Long Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training pipelines or downstream control logic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Sadegh Khorshidi, Navid Yazdanjue, Hassan Gharoun, Mohammad Reza Nikoo, Fang Chen, Amir H. Gandomi</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents domain-informed genetic superposition programming (DIGSP), a symbolic regression framework tailored for engineering systems governed by separable physical mechanisms. DIGSP partitions the input space into domain-specific feature subsets and evolves independent genetic programming (GP) populations to model material-specific effects. Early evolution occurs in isolation, while ensemble fitness promotes inter-population cooperation. To enable symbolic superposition, an adaptive hierarchical symbolic abstraction mechanism (AHSAM) is triggered after stagnation across all populations. AHSAM performs analysis of variance- (ANOVA) based filtering to identify statistically significant individuals, compresses them into symbolic constructs, and injects them into all populations through a validation-guided pruning cycle. The DIGSP is benchmarked against a baseline multi-gene genetic programming (BGP) model using a dataset of steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) beams. Across 30 independent trials with 65% training, 10% validation, and 25% testing splits, DIGSP consistently outperformed BGP in training and test root mean squared error (RMSE). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test confirmed statistical significance (p < 0.01), and DIGSP showed tighter error distributions and fewer outliers. No significant difference was observed in validation RMSE due to limited sample size. These results demonstrate that domain-informed structural decomposition and symbolic abstraction improve convergence and generalization. DIGSP offers a principled and interpretable modeling strategy for systems where symbolic superposition aligns with the underlying physical structure.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images. However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenkai Wang, Vincent Lee, Yizhen Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model hallucination represents a critical challenge where outputs deviate from factual accuracy due to distributional biases in training data. While recent investigations establish that specific hidden layers exhibit differences between hallucinatory and factual content, the precise localization of hallucination signals within layers remains unclear, limiting the development of efficient detection methods. We propose a dual-model architecture integrating a Projected Fusion (PF) block for adaptive inter-layer feature weighting and a Differential Feature Learning (DFL) mechanism that identifies discriminative features by computing differences between parallel encoders learning complementary representations from identical inputs. Through systematic experiments across HaluEval's question answering, dialogue, and summarization datasets, we demonstrate that hallucination signals concentrate in highly sparse feature subsets, achieving significant accuracy improvements on question answering and dialogue tasks. Notably, our analysis reveals a hierarchical "funnel pattern" where shallow layers exhibit high feature diversity while deep layers demonstrate concentrated usage, enabling detection performance to be maintained with minimal degradation using only 1\% of feature dimensions. These findings suggest that hallucination signals are more concentrated than previously assumed, offering a pathway toward computationally efficient detection systems that could reduce inference costs while maintaining accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Jordan, Mohammadreza Akbari Lor, Peter Koulen, Mei-Ling Shyu, Shu-Ching Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%, representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67% and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Deng, Yanyan Shen, Ziyuan Pei, Youmin Chen, Linpeng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses large language model (LLM) hallucinations by grounding responses in external knowledge, but its effectiveness is compromised by poor-quality retrieved contexts containing irrelevant or noisy information. While existing approaches attempt to improve performance through context selection based on predefined context quality assessment metrics, they show limited gains over standard RAG. We attribute this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate model for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a hierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and global inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision and end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and multiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality contexts while preserving critical information.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingkai Peng, Jun Jiang, Meng Tong, Shuai Li, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu, Kejiang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks. Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover, text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps: firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts, the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) providers boast big numbers for maximum context window sizes. To test the real world use of context windows, we 1) define a concept of maximum effective context window, 2) formulate a testing method of a context window's effectiveness over various sizes and problem types, and 3) create a standardized way to compare model efficacy for increasingly larger context window sizes to find the point of failure. We collected hundreds of thousands of data points across several models and found significant differences between reported Maximum Context Window (MCW) size and Maximum Effective Context Window (MECW) size. Our findings show that the MECW is, not only, drastically different from the MCW but also shifts based on the problem type. A few top of the line models in our test group failed with as little as 100 tokens in context; most had severe degradation in accuracy by 1000 tokens in context. All models fell far short of their Maximum Context Window by as much as 99 percent. Our data reveals the Maximum Effective Context Window shifts based on the type of problem provided, offering clear and actionable insights into how to improve model accuracy and decrease model hallucination rates.</p>

<p>Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art results in both salient object detection and edge detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhicheng Du, Qingyang Shi, Jiasheng Lu, Yingshan Liang, Xinyu Zhang, Yiran Wang, Peiwu Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP). However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation metric for the relevance of multiple modalities (N modalities, N>=3) via multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by 13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: As smart tourism evolves, AI-powered chatbots have become indispensable for delivering personalized, real-time assistance to travelers while promoting sustainability and efficiency. However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where adversaries manipulate inputs to elicit unintended behaviors such as leaking sensitive information or generating harmful content. This paper presents a case study on the design and implementation of a secure retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbot for Hsinchu smart tourism services. The system integrates RAG with API function calls, multi-layered linguistic analysis, and guardrails against injections, achieving high contextual awareness and security. Key features include a tiered response strategy, RAG-driven knowledge grounding, and intent decomposition across lexical, semantic, and pragmatic levels. Defense mechanisms include system norms, gatekeepers for intent judgment, and reverse RAG text to prioritize verified data. We also benchmark a GPT-5 variant (released 2025-08-07) to assess inherent robustness. Evaluations with 674 adversarial prompts and 223 benign queries show over 95% accuracy on benign tasks and substantial detection of injection attacks. GPT-5 blocked about 85% of attacks, showing progress yet highlighting the need for layered defenses. Findings emphasize contributions to sustainable tourism, multilingual accessibility, and ethical AI deployment. This work offers a practical framework for deploying secure chatbots in smart tourism and contributes to resilient, trustworthy AI applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sameer Prabhu, Amit Patwardhan, Ramin Karim</p>
<p>Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayu Yang, Hui Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Connecting conversation with external domain knowledge is vital for conversational recommender systems (CRS) to correctly understand user preferences. However, existing solutions either require domain-specific engineering, which limits flexibility, or rely solely on large language models, which increases the risk of hallucination. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) holds promise, its naive use in CRS is hindered by noisy dialogues that weaken retrieval and by overlooked nuances among similar items. We propose ReGeS, a reciprocal Retrieval-Generation Synergy framework that unifies generation-augmented retrieval to distill informative user intent from conversations and retrieval-augmented generation to differentiate subtle item features. This synergy obviates the need for extra annotations, reduces hallucinations, and simplifies continuous updates. Experiments on multiple CRS benchmarks show that ReGeS achieves state-of-the-art performance in recommendation accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of reciprocal synergy for knowledge-intensive CRS tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksa Jelaca, Ying Jiao, Chang Tian, Marie-Francine Moens</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge. Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts, and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiraz S Kaderuppan, Jonathan Mar, Andrew Irvine, Anurag Sharma, Muhammad Ramadan Saifuddin, Wai Leong Eugene Wong, Wai Lok Woo</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis. Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g. confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution (SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal (non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative & economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously (termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy, even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinfeng Yu, Hailong Zhang, Meiling Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enrico Cassano, Riccardo Renzulli, Marco Nurisso, Mirko Zaffaroni, Alan Perotti, Marco Grangetto</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity (i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network, individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning. We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization. Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object removal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guandong Pan, Yaqian Yang, Shi Chen, Xin Wang, Longzhao Liu, Hongwei Zheng, Shaoting Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: In affective neuroscience and emotion-aware AI, understanding how complex auditory stimuli drive emotion arousal dynamics remains unresolved. This study introduces a computational framework to model the brain's encoding of naturalistic auditory inputs into dynamic behavioral/neural responses across three datasets (SEED, LIRIS, self-collected BAVE). Guided by neurobiological principles of parallel auditory hierarchy, we decompose audio into multilevel auditory features (through classical algorithms and wav2vec 2.0/Hubert) from the original and isolated human voice/background soundtrack elements, mapping them to emotion-related responses via cross-dataset analyses. Our analysis reveals that high-level semantic representations (derived from the final layer of wav2vec 2.0/Hubert) exert a dominant role in emotion encoding, outperforming low-level acoustic features with significantly stronger mappings to behavioral annotations and dynamic neural synchrony across most brain regions ($p < 0.05$). Notably, middle layers of wav2vec 2.0/hubert (balancing acoustic-semantic information) surpass the final layers in emotion induction across datasets. Moreover, human voices and soundtracks show dataset-dependent emotion-evoking biases aligned with stimulus energy distribution (e.g., LIRIS favors soundtracks due to higher background energy), with neural analyses indicating voices dominate prefrontal/temporal activity while soundtracks excel in limbic regions. By integrating affective computing and neuroscience, this work uncovers hierarchical mechanisms of auditory-emotion encoding, providing a foundation for adaptive emotion-aware systems and cross-disciplinary explorations of audio-affective interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanish Suwal, Dipkamal Bhusal, Michael Clifford, Nidhi Rastogi</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG) across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns, excessive pruning undermines interpretability.</p>

<p>Abstract: This survey explores the integration of Federated Learning (FL) with Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), with particular emphasis on deep learning and quantum machine learning approaches. FL enables collaborative model training across distributed devices while preserving data privacy-a critical requirement in network security contexts where sensitive traffic data cannot be centralized. Our comprehensive analysis systematically examines the full spectrum of FL architectures, deployment strategies, communication protocols, and aggregation methods specifically tailored for intrusion detection. We provide an in-depth investigation of privacy-preserving techniques, model compression approaches, and attack-specific federated solutions for threats including DDoS, MITM, and botnet attacks. The survey further delivers a pioneering exploration of Quantum FL (QFL), discussing quantum feature encoding, quantum machine learning algorithms, and quantum-specific aggregation methods that promise exponential speedups for complex pattern recognition in network traffic. Through rigorous comparative analysis of classical and quantum approaches, identification of research gaps, and evaluation of real-world deployments, we outline a concrete roadmap for industrial adoption and future research directions. This work serves as an authoritative reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to enhance privacy, efficiency, and robustness of federated intrusion detection systems in increasingly complex network environments, while preparing for the quantum-enhanced cybersecurity landscape of tomorrow.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21391">MIXRAG : Mixture-of-Experts Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Textual Graph Understanding and Question Answering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lihui Liu, Carl J. Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of applications. However, they often suffer from hallucinations in knowledge-intensive domains due to their reliance on static pretraining corpora. To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources during inference. Among these sources, textual graphs provide structured and semantically rich information that supports more precise and interpretable reasoning. This has led to growing interest in graph-based RAG systems. Despite their potential, most existing approaches rely on a single retriever to identify relevant subgraphs, which limits their ability to capture the diverse aspects of complex queries. Moreover, these systems often struggle to accurately judge the relevance of retrieved content, making them prone to distraction by irrelevant noise. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose MIXRAG, a Mixture-of-Experts Graph-RAG framework that introduces multiple specialized graph retrievers and a dynamic routing controller to better handle diverse query intents. Each retriever is trained to focus on a specific aspect of graph semantics, such as entities, relations, or subgraph topology. A Mixture-of-Experts module adaptively selects and fuses relevant retrievers based on the input query. To reduce noise in the retrieved information, we introduce a query-aware GraphEncoder that carefully analyzes relationships within the retrieved subgraphs, highlighting the most relevant parts while down-weighting unnecessary noise. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms various baselines. MIXRAG is effective across a wide range of graph-based tasks in different domains. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyu Ma, Wanli Ni, Zhijin Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions, which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its effectiveness for image transmission tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Sharifian, Saber Salehkaleybar, Negar Kiyavash</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of causal structure learning from a combination of observational and interventional data generated by a linear non-Gaussian structural equation model that might contain cycles. Recent results show that using mere observational data identifies the causal graph only up to a permutation-equivalence class. We obtain a combinatorial characterization of this class by showing that each graph in an equivalence class corresponds to a perfect matching in a bipartite graph. This bipartite representation allows us to analyze how interventions modify or constrain the matchings. Specifically, we show that each atomic intervention reveals one edge of the true matching and eliminates all incompatible causal graphs. Consequently, we formalize the optimal experiment design task as an adaptive stochastic optimization problem over the set of equivalence classes with a natural reward function that quantifies how many graphs are eliminated from the equivalence class by an intervention. We show that this reward function is adaptive submodular and provide a greedy policy with a provable near-optimal performance guarantee. A key technical challenge is to efficiently estimate the reward function without having to explicitly enumerate all the graphs in the equivalence class. We propose a sampling-based estimator using random matchings and analyze its bias and concentration behavior. Our simulation results show that performing a small number of interventions guided by our stochastic optimization framework recovers the true underlying causal structure.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current molecular generative models primarily focus on improving drug-target binding affinity and specificity, often neglecting the system-level phenotypic effects elicited by compounds. Transcriptional profiles, as molecule-level readouts of drug-induced phenotypic shifts, offer a powerful opportunity to guide molecular design in a phenotype-aware manner. We present PhenoMoler, a phenotype-guided molecular generation framework that integrates a chemistry large language model with expression profiles to enable biologically informed drug design. By conditioning the generation on drug-induced differential expression signatures, PhenoMoler explicitly links transcriptional responses to chemical structure. By selectively masking and reconstructing specific substructures-scaffolds, side chains, or linkers-PhenoMoler supports fine-grained, controllable molecular optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhenoMoler generates chemically valid, novel, and diverse molecules aligned with desired phenotypic profiles. Compared to FDA-approved drugs, the generated compounds exhibit comparable or enhanced drug-likeness (QED), optimized physicochemical properties, and superior binding affinity to key cancer targets. These findings highlight PhenoMoler's potential for phenotype-guided and structure-controllable molecular optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Liu, Lan Zhang, Xiaoyong Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns. Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual and multicultural environments where moral reasoning is essential for generating ethically appropriate responses. Yet, the dominant pretraining of LLMs on English-language data raises critical concerns about their ability to generalize judgments across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. In this work, we systematically investigate how language mediates moral decision-making in LLMs. We translate two established moral reasoning benchmarks into five culturally and typologically diverse languages, enabling multilingual zero-shot evaluation. Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in LLMs' moral judgments across languages, often reflecting cultural misalignment. Through a combination of carefully constructed research questions, we uncover the underlying drivers of these disparities, ranging from disagreements to reasoning strategies employed by LLMs. Finally, through a case study, we link the role of pretraining data in shaping an LLM's moral compass. Through this work, we distill our insights into a structured typology of moral reasoning errors that calls for more culturally-aware AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing custom reasoning models via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that can incorporate organization-specific knowledge has great potential to address problems faced by enterprise customers. In many of these problems, the reward function is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We apply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the ability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to SQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving careful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL approach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our model also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD is only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly applicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science, and coding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khaloud S. AlKhalifah, Malak Mashaabi, Hend Al-Khalifa</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance, background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding 10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance, with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\% male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted activities were frequently observed across all three models. Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans, offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shehtab Zaman, Chengyan Liu, Kenneth Chiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Idempotent generative networks (IGNs) are a new line of generative models based on idempotent mapping to a target manifold. IGNs support both single-and multi-step generation, allowing for a flexible trade-off between computational cost and sample quality. But similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), conventional IGNs require adversarial training and are prone to training instabilities and mode collapse. Diffusion and score-based models are popular approaches to generative modeling that iteratively transport samples from one distribution, usually a Gaussian, to a target data distribution. These models have gained popularity due to their stable training dynamics and high-fidelity generation quality. However, this stability and quality come at the cost of high computational cost, as the data must be transported incrementally along the entire trajectory. New sampling methods, model distillation, and consistency models have been developed to reduce the sampling cost and even perform one-shot sampling from diffusion models. In this work, we unite diffusion and IGNs by distilling idempotent models from diffusion model scores, called SIGN. Our proposed method is highly stable and does not require adversarial losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed score-based training methods and empirically show that IGNs can be effectively distilled from a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling faster inference than iterative score-based models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, allowing users to trade off quality for efficiency. These models operate directly on the source domain; they can project corrupted or alternate distributions back onto the target manifold, enabling zero-shot editing of inputs. We validate our models on multiple image datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results for idempotent models on the CIFAR and CelebA datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hude Liu, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Jennifer Yuntong Zhang, Zhao Song, Han Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and text-to-image support our theory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adit Jain, Brendan Rappazzo</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a leading approach for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Most current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens. While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought. Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements (5--35 \% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniil D. Sirota, Sergey A. Khan, Sergey L. Kostikov, Kirill A. Butov</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface reservoir systems based on the developed neural operator architecture (TFNO-opt). Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator, tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional methods. This opens up new opportunities for the effective control of complex reservoir systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jillian Xu, Dylan Zhou, Vinay Shukla, Yang Yang, Junrui Ruan, Shuhuai Lin, Wenfei Zou, Yinxiao Liu, Karthik Lakshmanan</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting often improves classification accuracy, but it introduces a significant throughput penalty with rationale generation (Wei et al., 2022; Cheng and Van Durme, 2024). To resolve this trade-off, we introduce Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD), a simple training method for decoder-only language models (LMs) that adds (i) a pooled classification head used during training and inference and (ii) a reasoning head supervised by teacher rationales used only in training. We train with a loss function that is a weighted sum of label cross-entropy and token-level LM loss over input-plus-rationale sequences. On seven SuperGLUE tasks, DHRD yields relative gains of 0.65-5.47% over pooled baselines, with notably larger gains on entailment/causal tasks. Since we disable the reasoning head at test time, inference throughput matches pooled classifiers and exceeds CoT decoding on the same backbones by 96-142 times in QPS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junkai Zhang, Zihao Wang, Lin Gui, Swarnashree Mysore Sathyendra, Jaehwan Jeong, Victor Veitch, Wei Wang, Yunzhong He, Bing Liu, Lifeng Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from \emph{reward over-optimization}, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the inability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones. This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this, we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training improvements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Salman Beigi, Omid Etesami, Mohammad Mahmoody, Amir Najafi</p>
<p>Abstract: We study optimal transport between two high-dimensional distributions $\mu,\nu$ in $R^n$ from an algorithmic perspective: given $x \sim \mu$, find a close $y \sim \nu$ in $poly(n)$ time, where $n$ is the dimension of $x,y$. Thus, running time depends on the dimension rather than the full representation size of $\mu,\nu$. Our main result is a general algorithm for transporting any product distribution $\mu$ to any $\nu$ with cost $\Delta + \delta$ under $\ell_p^p$, where $\Delta$ is the Knothe-Rosenblatt transport cost and $\delta$ is a computational error decreasing with runtime. This requires $\nu$ to be "sequentially samplable" with bounded average sampling cost, a new but natural notion.
  We further prove:
  An algorithmic version of Talagrand's inequality for transporting the standard Gaussian $\Phi^n$ to arbitrary $\nu$ under squared Euclidean cost. For $\nu = \Phi^n$ conditioned on a set $\mathcal{S}$ of measure $\varepsilon$, we construct the sequential sampler in expected time $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ using membership oracle access to $\mathcal{S}$. This yields an algorithmic transport from $\Phi^n$ to $\Phi^n|\mathcal{S}$ in $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ time and expected squared distance $O(\log 1/\varepsilon)$, optimal for general $\mathcal{S}$ of measure $\varepsilon$.
  As corollary, we obtain the first computational concentration result (Etesami et al. SODA 2020) for Gaussian measure under Euclidean distance with dimension-independent transportation cost, resolving an open question of Etesami et al. Specifically, for any $\mathcal{S}$ of Gaussian measure $\varepsilon$, most $\Phi^n$ samples can be mapped to $\mathcal{S}$ within distance $O(\sqrt{\log 1/\varepsilon})$ in $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ time.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy. Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed probability flows.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21519">$\mathbf{Li_2}$: A Framework on Dynamics of Feature Emergence and Delayed Generalization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuandong Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been studied extensively, it remains an open question whether there is a mathematical framework to characterize what kind of features emerge, how and in which conditions it happens from training, for complex structured inputs. We propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature learning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$ across layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden representation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only depends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their representation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about target labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we provably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of memorization and generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naisong Zhou, Saisamarth Rajesh Phaye, Milos Cernak, Tijana Stojkovic, Andy Pearce, Andrea Cavallaro, Andy Harper</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have achieved state-of-the-art performance for perceptual quality in speech enhancement (SE). However, their iterative nature requires numerous Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), posing a challenge for real-time applications. On the contrary, flow matching offers a more efficient alternative by learning a direct vector field, enabling high-quality synthesis in just a few steps using deterministic ordinary differential equation~(ODE) solvers. We thus introduce Shortcut Flow Matching for Speech Enhancement (SFMSE), a novel approach that trains a single, step-invariant model. By conditioning the velocity field on the target time step during a one-stage training process, SFMSE can perform single, few, or multi-step denoising without any architectural changes or fine-tuning. Our results demonstrate that a single-step SFMSE inference achieves a real-time factor (RTF) of 0.013 on a consumer GPU while delivering perceptual quality comparable to a strong diffusion baseline requiring 60 NFEs. This work also provides an empirical analysis of the role of stochasticity in training and inference, bridging the gap between high-quality generative SE and low-latency constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sathwik Karnik, Somil Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in everyday tools, raising urgent safety concerns about their tendency to generate harmful content. The dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment, BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together, these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.</p>

The system is based on a sentence embedding model which gives an accuracy of 56%. After eliminating synonyms and incorporating entity extraction, the accuracy jumps to 86%. With such a system, farmers can progress towards easier information about farming related practices and hence a better agricultural output. The job of the Call Center workforce would be made easier and the hard work of various such workers can be redirected to a better goal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianan Zhou, Fleur Corbett, Joori Byun, Talya Porat, Nejra van Zalk</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactive intelligent agents are being integrated across society. Despite achieving human-like capabilities, humans' responses to these agents remain poorly understood, with research fragmented across disciplines. We conducted a first systematic synthesis comparing a range of psychological and behavioural responses in matched human-agent vs. human-human dyadic interactions. A total of 162 eligible studies (146 contributed to the meta-analysis; 468 effect sizes) were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, which integrated frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Our results indicate that individuals exhibited less prosocial behaviour and moral engagement when interacting with agents vs. humans. They attributed less agency and responsibility to agents, perceiving them as less competent, likeable, and socially present. In contrast, individuals' social alignment (i.e., alignment or adaptation of internal states and behaviours with partners), trust in partners, personal agency, task performance, and interaction experiences were generally comparable when interacting with agents vs. humans. We observed high effect-size heterogeneity for many subjective responses (i.e., social perceptions of partners, subjective trust, and interaction experiences), suggesting context-dependency of partner effects. By examining the characteristics of studies, participants, partners, interaction scenarios, and response measures, we also identified several moderators shaping partner effects. Overall, functional behaviours and interactive experiences with agents can resemble those with humans, whereas fundamental social attributions and moral/prosocial concerns lag in human-agent interactions. Agents are thus afforded instrumental value on par with humans but lack comparable intrinsic value, providing practical implications for agent design and regulation.</p>

A consistent domain penalty appears for clinical speech and remains significant across models. Error analysis attributes much of this penalty to false alarms and missed detections, aligning with short turns and frequent overlap. We test lightweight domain adaptation by fine-tuning a segmentation module on accent-matched data; it reduces error but does not eliminate the gap. Our contributions include a controlled benchmark across domains, a concise approach to error decomposition and conversation-level profiling, and an adaptation recipe that is easy to reproduce. Results point to overlap-aware segmentation and balanced clinical resources as practical next steps.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing. Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment, while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs, achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyi Chen, Zhangyu Wang, Fabian Deuser, Johann Maximilian Zollner, Martin Werner</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly at finer granularity.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e., predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating pixels rather than directly modeling motion.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two prominent self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition: DINOv3, which processes frames independently through spatial feature extraction, and V-JEPA2, which employs joint temporal modeling across video sequences. We evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs 0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories. These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and reliability constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingxiao Kong, Cong Yang, Oya Deniz Beyan, Zeyd Boukhers</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) presents significant challenges and opportunities for optimizing multiple objectives in Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce a MORL taxonomy and examine the advantages and limitations of various MORL methods when applied to LLM optimization, identifying the need for efficient and flexible approaches that accommodate personalization functionality and inherent complexities in LLMs and RL. We propose a vision for a MORL benchmarking framework that addresses the effects of different methods on diverse objective relationships. As future research directions, we focus on meta-policy MORL development that can improve efficiency and flexibility through its bi-level learning paradigm, highlighting key research questions and potential solutions for improving LLM performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Paul E. Apolinario, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: On-device learning is essential for personalization, privacy, and long-term adaptation in resource-constrained environments. Achieving this requires efficient learning, both fine-tuning existing models and continually acquiring new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Yet both settings are constrained by high memory cost of storing activations during backpropagation. Existing activation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated low-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead. Also, such methods have not been explored for continual learning. We propose LANCE (Low-rank Activation Compression), a framework that performs one-shot higher-order Singular Value Decompsoition (SVD) to obtain a reusable low-rank subspace for activation projection. This eliminates repeated decompositions, reducing both memory and computation. Moreover, fixed low-rank subspaces further enable on-device continual learning by allocating tasks to orthogonal subspaces without storing large task-specific matrices. Experiments show that LANCE reduces activation storage up to 250$\times$ while maintaining accuracy comparable to full backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets, Flowers102, and CUB-200 datasets. On continual learning benchmarks (Split CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), it achieves performance competitive with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost. These results position LANCE as a practical and scalable solution for efficient fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Zhu, David H. Yang, Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri, Keerthiram Murugesan, Tejaswini Pedapati, Pin-Yu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The expanding long-context capabilities of large language models are constrained by a significant memory bottleneck: the key-value (KV) cache required for autoregressive generation. This bottleneck is substantial; for instance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of 4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's weights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising direction, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that performs poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations, we introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid storage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that not all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial first and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors for attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies low-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's algorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a comprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates during decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving context. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention modules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or even improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular, OjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in dynamically tracking context shifts. These results establish our hybrid framework as a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zitong Lan, Yiduo Hao, Mingmin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio editing plays a central role in VR/AR immersion, virtual conferencing, sound design, and other interactive media. However, recent generative audio editing models depend on template-like instruction formats and are restricted to mono-channel audio. These models fail to deal with declarative audio editing, where the user declares what the desired outcome should be, while leaving the details of editing operations to the system. We introduce SmartDJ, a novel framework for stereo audio editing that combines the reasoning capability of audio language models with the generative power of latent diffusion. Given a high-level instruction, SmartDJ decomposes it into a sequence of atomic edit operations, such as adding, removing, or spatially relocating events. These operations are then executed by a diffusion model trained to manipulate stereo audio. To support this, we design a data synthesis pipeline that produces paired examples of high-level instructions, atomic edit operations, and audios before and after each edit operation. Experiments demonstrate that SmartDJ achieves superior perceptual quality, spatial realism, and semantic alignment compared to prior audio editing methods. Demos are available at https://zitonglan.github.io/project/smartdj/smartdj.html.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialin Wu, Shreya Saha, Yiqing Bo, Meenakshi Khosla</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define representational structure beyond surface design categories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anjiang Wei, Tarun Suresh, Tianran Sun, Haoze Wu, Ke Wang, Alex Aiken</p>
<p>Abstract: Program verification relies on loop invariants, yet automatically discovering strong invariants remains a long-standing challenge. We introduce a principled framework for evaluating LLMs on invariant synthesis. Our approach uses a verifier-based decision procedure with a formal soundness guarantee and assesses not only correctness but also the speedup that invariants provide in verification. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art LLMs, and existing LLM-based verifiers against the traditional solver UAutomizer. While LLM-based verifiers represent a promising direction, they do not yet offer a significant advantage over UAutomizer. Model capability also proves critical, as shown by sharp differences in speedups across models, and our benchmark remains an open challenge for current LLMs. Finally, we show that supervised fine-tuning and Best-of-N sampling can improve performance: fine-tuning on 3589 instances raises the percentage of speedup cases for Qwen3-Coder-480B from 8% to 29.2%, and Best-of-N sampling with N=16 improves Claude-sonnet-4 from 8.8% to 22.1%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prakhar Sharma, Haohuang Wen, Vinod Yegneswaran, Ashish Gehani, Phillip Porras, Zhiqiang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks is being accelerated by the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) paradigm -- an open, interoperable architecture that enables intelligent, modular applications across public telecom and private enterprise domains. While this openness creates unprecedented opportunities for innovation, it also expands the attack surface, demanding resilient, low-cost, and autonomous security solutions. Legacy defenses remain largely reactive, labor-intensive, and inadequate for the scale and complexity of next-generation systems. Current O-RAN applications focus mainly on network optimization or passive threat detection, with limited capability for closed-loop, automated response.
  To address this critical gap, we present an agentic AI framework for fully automated, end-to-end threat mitigation in 6G O-RAN environments. MobiLLM orchestrates security workflows through a modular multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework features a Threat Analysis Agent for real-time data triage, a Threat Classification Agent that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to map anomalies to specific countermeasures, and a Threat Response Agent that safely operationalizes mitigation actions via O-RAN control interfaces. Grounded in trusted knowledge bases such as the MITRE FiGHT framework and 3GPP specifications, and equipped with robust safety guardrails, MobiLLM provides a blueprint for trustworthy AI-driven network security. Initial evaluations demonstrate that MobiLLM can effectively identify and orchestrate complex mitigation strategies, significantly reducing response latency and showcasing the feasibility of autonomous security operations in 6G.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rina Panigrahy, Vatsal Sharan</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety, trust and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) are aspirational goals in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and there are several informal interpretations of these notions. In this paper, we propose strict, mathematical definitions of safety, trust, and AGI, and demonstrate a fundamental incompatibility between them. We define safety of a system as the property that it never makes any false claims, trust as the assumption that the system is safe, and AGI as the property of an AI system always matching or exceeding human capability. Our core finding is that -- for our formal definitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI system: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are easily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system. We note that we consider strict mathematical definitions of safety and trust, and it is possible for real-world deployments to instead rely on alternate, practical interpretations of these notions. We show our results for program verification, planning, and graph reachability. Our proofs draw parallels to G\"odel's incompleteness theorems and Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting problem, and can be regarded as interpretations of G\"odel's and Turing's results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Bizzaro, Alessandro Daniele</p>
<p>Abstract: Neurosymbolic integration (NeSy) blends neural-network learning with symbolic reasoning. The field can be split between methods injecting hand-crafted rules into neural models, and methods inducing symbolic rules from data. We introduce Logic of Hypotheses (LoH), a novel language that unifies these strands, enabling the flexible integration of data-driven rule learning with symbolic priors and expert knowledge. LoH extends propositional logic syntax with a choice operator, which has learnable parameters and selects a subformula from a pool of options. Using fuzzy logic, formulas in LoH can be directly compiled into a differentiable computational graph, so the optimal choices can be learned via backpropagation. This framework subsumes some existing NeSy models, while adding the possibility of arbitrary degrees of knowledge specification. Moreover, the use of Goedel fuzzy logic and the recently developed Goedel trick yields models that can be discretized to hard Boolean-valued functions without any loss in performance. We provide experimental analysis on such models, showing strong results on tabular data and on the Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task, while producing interpretable decision rules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Salim, Jordan Yu, Xilei Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: While deep learning models excel at predictive tasks, they often overfit due to their complex structure and large number of parameters, causing them to memorize training data, including noise, rather than learn patterns that generalize to new data. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new regularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep Neural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships in complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically, our method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear baseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while preserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a comprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference, measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements into the training objective. We test and validate the proposed methodology using a real-world ridesourcing dataset from Chicago and a synthetically created dataset. Experiments across various neural network architectures show that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance model performance. DIM enhances the predictive performance of deep neural networks by applying domain-informed monotonicity constraints to regularize model behavior and mitigate overfitting</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahindra Singh Rautela, Alexander Most, Siddharth Mansingh, Bradley C. Love, Ayan Biswas, Diane Oyen, Earl Lawrence</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyong Park, Oron Levy, Rebecca Adaimi, Asaf Liberman, Gierad Laput, Abdelkareem Bedri</p>
<p>Abstract: Wearable accelerometers are used for a wide range of applications, such as gesture recognition, gait analysis, and sports monitoring. Yet most existing foundation models focus primarily on classifying common daily activities such as locomotion and exercise, limiting their applicability to the broader range of tasks that rely on other signal characteristics. We present SlotFM, an accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong generalization for sensing foundation models.</p>

The environment is implemented as a Gymnasium interface that supplies observations -- including schema details, intermediate results, and execution feedback -- and receives actions that represent database exploration (e.g., previewing tables, sampling column values, retrieving unique values) as well as relational algebra operations (e.g., filter, project, join). We detail the motivation and the design of the environment. In the demo, we showcase the utility of the environment by contrasting it with contemporary LLMs that query databases. QueryGym serves as a practical testbed for research in error remediation, transparency, and reinforcement learning for query generation. For the associated demo, see https://ibm.biz/QueryGym.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Kremer, Ali Javadi-Abhari, Priyanka Mukhopadhyay</p>
<p>Abstract: An efficient implementation of unitary operators is important in order to practically realize the computational advantages claimed by quantum algorithms over their classical counterparts. In this paper we study the potential of using reinforcement learning (RL) in order to synthesize quantum circuits, while optimizing the T-count and CS-count, of unitaries that are exactly implementable by the Clifford+T and Clifford+CS gate sets, respectively. In general, the complexity of existing algorithms depend exponentially on the number of qubits and the non-Clifford-count of unitaries. We have designed our RL framework to work with channel representation of unitaries, that enables us to perform matrix operations efficiently, using integers only. We have also incorporated pruning heuristics and a canonicalization of operators, in order to reduce the search complexity. As a result, compared to previous works, we are able to implement significantly larger unitaries, in less time, with much better success rate and improvement factor. Our results for Clifford+T synthesis on two qubits achieve close-to-optimal decompositions for up to 100 T gates, 5 times more than previous RL algorithms and to the best of our knowledge, the largest instances achieved with any method to date. Our RL algorithm is able to recover previously-known optimal linear complexity algorithm for T-count-optimal decomposition of 1 qubit unitaries. For 2-qubit Clifford+CS unitaries, our algorithm achieves a linear complexity, something that could only be accomplished by a previous algorithm using $SO(6)$ representation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human privacy preferences requires understanding individuals' nuanced disclosure behaviors beyond general norms. Yet eliciting such boundaries remains challenging due to the context-dependent nature of privacy decisions and the complex trade-offs involved. We present an AI-powered elicitation approach that probes individuals' privacy boundaries through a discriminative task. We conducted a between-subjects study that systematically varied communication roles and delegation conditions, resulting in 1,681 boundary specifications from 169 participants for 61 scenarios. We examined how these contextual factors and individual differences influence the boundary specification. Quantitative results show that communication roles influence individuals' acceptance of detailed and identifiable disclosure, AI delegation and individuals' need for privacy heighten sensitivity to disclosed identifiers, and AI delegation results in less consensus across individuals. Our findings highlight the importance of situating privacy preference elicitation within real-world data flows. We advocate using nuanced privacy boundaries as an alignment goal for future AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many institutions are currently grappling with teaching artificial intelligence (AI) in the face of growing demand and relevance in our world. The Computing Research Association (CRA) has conducted 32 moderated virtual roundtable discussions of 202 experts committed to improving AI education. These discussions slot into four focus areas: AI Knowledge Areas and Pedagogy, Infrastructure Challenges in AI Education, Strategies to Increase Capacity in AI Education, and AI Education for All. Roundtables were organized around institution type to consider the particular goals and resources of different AI education environments. We identified the following high-level community needs to increase capacity in AI education. A significant digital divide creates major infrastructure hurdles, especially for smaller and under-resourced institutions. These challenges manifest as a shortage of faculty with AI expertise, who also face limited time for reskilling; a lack of computational infrastructure for students and faculty to develop and test AI models; and insufficient institutional technical support. Compounding these issues is the large burden associated with updating curricula and creating new programs. To address the faculty gap, accessible and continuous professional development is crucial for faculty to learn about AI and its ethical dimensions. This support is particularly needed for under-resourced institutions and must extend to faculty both within and outside of computing programs to ensure all students have access to AI education. We have compiled and organized a list of resources that our participant experts mentioned throughout this study. These resources contribute to a frequent request heard during the roundtables: a central repository of AI education resources for institutions to freely use across higher education.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout. This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states, highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and enhance AI agent training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqing Wang, Yibo Wen, William Pattie, Xiao Luo, Weimin Wu, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Abhishek Pandey, Han Liu, Kaize Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Lead optimization in drug discovery requires efficiently navigating vast chemical space through iterative cycles to enhance molecular properties while preserving structural similarity to the original lead compound. Despite recent advances, traditional optimization methods struggle with sample efficiency-achieving good optimization performance with limited oracle evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach through their in-context learning and instruction following capabilities, which align naturally with these iterative processes. However, existing LLM-based methods fail to leverage this strength, treating each optimization step independently. To address this, we present POLO (Preference-guided multi-turn Optimization for Lead Optimization), which enables LLMs to learn from complete optimization trajectories rather than isolated steps. At its core, POLO introduces Preference-Guided Policy Optimization (PGPO), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that extracts learning signals at two complementary levels: trajectory-level optimization reinforces successful strategies, while turn-level preference learning provides dense comparative feedback by ranking intermediate molecules within each trajectory. Through this dual-level learning from intermediate evaluation, POLO achieves superior sample efficiency by fully exploiting each costly oracle call. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POLO achieves 84% average success rate on single-property tasks (2.3x better than baselines) and 50% on multi-property tasks using only 500 oracle evaluations, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in sample-efficient molecular optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehwish Mehmood, Ivor Spence, Muhammad Fahim</p>
<p>Abstract: Lightweight retinal vessel segmentation is important for the early diagnosis of vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in a real-world clinical environment with limited computational resources. Although segmentation methods based on deep learning are improving, existing models are still facing challenges of small vessel segmentation and high computational costs. To address these challenges, we proposed a new vascular segmentation network, LFA-Net, which incorporates a newly designed attention module, LiteFusion-Attention. This attention module incorporates residual learning connections, Vision Mamba-inspired dynamics, and modulation-based attention, enabling the model to capture local and global context efficiently and in a lightweight manner. LFA-Net offers high performance with 0.11 million parameters, 0.42 MB memory size, and 4.46 GFLOPs, which make it ideal for resource-constrained environments. We validated our proposed model on DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB with outstanding performance in terms of dice scores of 83.28, 87.44, and 84.50% and Jaccard indices of 72.85, 79.31, and 74.70%, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linxiao Zeng, Haoyun Deng, Kangyuan Shu, Shizhen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in various text generation tasks. However, it remains challenging to use them off-the-shelf in streaming applications (such as live translation), where the output must continually update as the input context expands, while still maintaining a reasonable computational cost to meet the latency requirement.
  In this work, we reexamine the re-translation approach to simultaneous translation and propose Self-Speculative Biased Decoding, a novel inference paradigm designed to avoid repeatedly generating output from scratch for a consistently growing input stream. We propose using the most recent output as a draft for the current growing input context. During the verification stage, the output will be biased towards the draft token for a higher draft acceptance rate. This strategy not only minimizes flickering that might distract users but also leads to higher speedups. Conventional decoding may take charge from the point of divergence after draft verification and continue until the end condition is met.
  Unlike existing speculative decoding strategies, our approach eliminates the need for draft computations, making it a model-agnostic and plug-and-play solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications. Experimental results on simultaneous text-to-text re-translation demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.7x speedup compared to conventional auto-regressive re-translation without compromising quality. Additionally, it significantly reduces flickering by 80% by incorporating the display-only mask-k technique.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ciyuan Peng, Nguyen Linh Dan Le, Shan Jin, Dexuan Ding, Shuo Yu, Feng Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain graph learning has demonstrated significant achievements in the fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, existing methods struggle to selectively learn disease-related knowledge, leading to heavy parameters and computational costs. This challenge diminishes their efficiency, as well as limits their practicality for real-world clinical applications. To this end, we propose a lightweight Brain PathoGraph Learning (BrainPoG) model that enables efficient brain graph learning by pathological pattern filtering and pathological feature distillation. Specifically, BrainPoG first contains a filter to extract the pathological pattern formulated by highly disease-relevant subgraphs, achieving graph pruning and lesion localization. A PathoGraph is therefore constructed by dropping less disease-relevant subgraphs from the whole brain graph. Afterwards, a pathological feature distillation module is designed to reduce disease-irrelevant noise features and enhance pathological features of each node in the PathoGraph. BrainPoG can exclusively learn informative disease-related knowledge while avoiding less relevant information, achieving efficient brain graph learning. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that BrainPoG exhibits superiority in both model performance and computational efficiency across various brain disease detection tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The goal of coreset selection methods is to identify representative subsets of datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing methods often ignore the possibility of annotation errors and require fixed pruning ratios, making them impractical in real-world settings. We present HyperCore, a robust and adaptive coreset selection framework designed explicitly for noisy environments. HyperCore leverages lightweight hypersphere models learned per class, embedding in-class samples close to a hypersphere center while naturally segregating out-of-class samples based on their distance. By using Youden's J statistic, HyperCore can adaptively select pruning thresholds, enabling automatic, noise-aware data pruning without hyperparameter tuning. Our experiments reveal that HyperCore consistently surpasses state-of-the-art coreset selection methods, especially under noisy and low-data regimes. HyperCore effectively discards mislabeled and ambiguous points, yielding compact yet highly informative subsets suitable for scalable and noise-free learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: The goal of coreset selection is to identify representative subsets of datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing approaches paradoxically require expensive training-based signals, e.g., gradients, decision boundary estimates or forgetting counts, computed over the entire dataset prior to pruning, which undermines their very purpose by requiring training on samples they aim to avoid. We introduce SubZeroCore, a novel, training-free coreset selection method that integrates submodular coverage and density into a single, unified objective. To achieve this, we introduce a sampling strategy based on a closed-form solution to optimally balance these objectives, guided by a single hyperparameter that explicitly controls the desired coverage for local density measures. Despite no training, extensive evaluations show that SubZeroCore matches training-based baselines and significantly outperforms them at high pruning rates, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. SubZeroCore also demonstrates superior robustness to label noise, highlighting its practical effectiveness and scalability for real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miao Yu, Zhenhong Zhou, Moayad Aloqaily, Kun Wang, Biwei Huang, Stephen Wang, Yueming Jin, Qingsong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks through data poisoning, yet the internal mechanisms governing these attacks remain a black box. Previous research on interpretability for LLM safety tends to focus on alignment, jailbreak, and hallucination, but overlooks backdoor mechanisms, making it difficult to understand and fully eliminate the backdoor threat. In this paper, aiming to bridge this gap, we explore the interpretable mechanisms of LLM backdoors through Backdoor Attribution (BkdAttr), a tripartite causal analysis framework. We first introduce the Backdoor Probe that proves the existence of learnable backdoor features encoded within the representations. Building on this insight, we further develop Backdoor Attention Head Attribution (BAHA), efficiently pinpointing the specific attention heads responsible for processing these features. Our primary experiments reveals these heads are relatively sparse; ablating a minimal \textbf{$\sim$ 3%} of total heads is sufficient to reduce the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by \textbf{over 90%}. More importantly, we further employ these findings to construct the Backdoor Vector derived from these attributed heads as a master controller for the backdoor. Through only \textbf{1-point} intervention on \textbf{single} representation, the vector can either boost ASR up to \textbf{$\sim$ 100% ($\uparrow$)} on clean inputs, or completely neutralize backdoor, suppressing ASR down to \textbf{$\sim$ 0% ($\downarrow$)} on triggered inputs. In conclusion, our work pioneers the exploration of mechanistic interpretability in LLM backdoors, demonstrating a powerful method for backdoor control and revealing actionable insights for the community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Cao, Yang Liu, Longhan Zhang, Yifan Wu, Zhixun Li, Yuyu Luo, Hong Cheng, Yang Ren, Tong-Yi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Crystal property prediction, governed by quantum mechanical principles, is computationally prohibitive to solve exactly for large many-body systems using traditional density functional theory. While machine learning models have emerged as efficient approximations for large-scale applications, their performance is strongly influenced by the choice of atomic representation. Although modern graph-based approaches have progressively incorporated more structural information, they often fail to capture long-term atomic interactions due to finite receptive fields and local encoding schemes. This limitation leads to distinct crystals being mapped to identical representations, hindering accurate property prediction. To address this, we introduce PRDNet that leverages unique reciprocal-space diffraction besides graph representations. To enhance sensitivity to elemental and environmental variations, we employ a data-driven pseudo-particle to generate a synthetic diffraction pattern. PRDNet ensures full invariance to crystallographic symmetries. Extensive experiments are conducted on Materials Project, JARVIS-DFT, and MatBench, demonstrating that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abolfazl Asudeh (Mila),  Zeinab (Mila),  Asoodeh, Bita Asoodeh, Omid Asudeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Discretizing raw features into bucketized attribute representations is a popular step before sharing a dataset. It is, however, evident that this step can cause significant bias in data and amplify unfairness in downstream tasks.
  In this paper, we address this issue by introducing the unbiased binning problem that, given an attribute to bucketize, finds its closest discretization to equal-size binning that satisfies group parity across different buckets. Defining a small set of boundary candidates, we prove that unbiased binning must select its boundaries from this set. We then develop an efficient dynamic programming algorithm on top of the boundary candidates to solve the unbiased binning problem.
  Finding an unbiased binning may sometimes result in a high price of fairness, or it may not even exist, especially when group values follow different distributions. Considering that a small bias in the group ratios may be tolerable in such settings, we introduce the epsilon-biased binning problem that bounds the group disparities across buckets to a small value epsilon. We first develop a dynamic programming solution, DP, that finds the optimal binning in quadratic time. The DP algorithm, while polynomial, does not scale to very large settings. Therefore, we propose a practically scalable algorithm, based on local search (LS), for epsilon-biased binning. The key component of the LS algorithm is a divide-and-conquer (D&C) algorithm that finds a near-optimal solution for the problem in near-linear time. We prove that D&C finds a valid solution for the problem unless none exists. The LS algorithm then initiates a local search, using the D&C solution as the upper bound, to find the optimal solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhou Zhang, Ning Lv, Teng Wang, Jisheng Dang</p>
<p>Abstract: Group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated significant potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning. However, its practical deployment is impeded by an excessively slow training process, primarily attributed to the computationally intensive autoregressive generation of multiple responses per query, which makes the generation phase the primary performance bottleneck. Although speculative decoding presents a promising direction for acceleration, its direct application in GRPO achieves limited speedup under high-concurrency training conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a concurrency-aware speculative decoding framework that dynamically adjusts the drafting and verification strategy according to real-time concurrency levels, thereby maximizing the acceleration of the generation process. Furthermore, to address performance degradation arising from distributional drift between the evolving target model and the fixed draft model during training, we introduce an online draft learning mechanism that enables the draft model to continuously adapt using feedback signals from the target model. Experimental results across multiple mathematical reasoning datasets and models demonstrate that the proposed method achieves end-to-end speedups of 2.35x to 2.72x, significantly surpassing baseline approaches in efficiency.

<p>Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with diverse cultures. Consequently, evaluating their cultural awareness is essential for further advancing global alignment of LLMs. However, existing RM evaluations fall short in assessing cultural awareness due to the scarcity of culturally relevant evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we propose Cultural Awareness Reward modeling Benchmark (CARB), covering 10 distinct cultures across 4 cultural domains. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art RMs reveals their deficiencies in modeling cultural awareness and demonstrates a positive correlation between performance on CARB and downstream multilingual cultural alignment tasks. Further analysis identifies the spurious correlations within culture-aware reward modeling, wherein RM's scoring relies predominantly on surface-level features rather than authentic cultural nuance understanding. To address these, we propose Think-as-Locals to elicit deeper culturally grounded reasoning from generative RMs via reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) and employ well-designed rewards to ensure accurate preference judgments and high-quality structured evaluation criteria generation. Experimental results validate its efficacy in mitigating spurious features interference and advancing culture-aware reward modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Liu, Bohao Zhao, Jingtao Ding, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately forecasting chaotic systems, prevalent in domains such as weather prediction and fluid dynamics, remains a significant scientific challenge. The inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system, they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications, which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics. ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40% compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning. Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Lei, Jiayu Zhang, Yue Ma, Xinyu Wang, Long Chen, Liang Tang, Yiqiang Yan, Fei Su, Zhicheng Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However, existing methods either require substantial training resources or are specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding, STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control. Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory controllability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditi Kabra, Jonathan Laurent, Sagar Bharadwaj, Ruben Martins, Stefan Mitsch, Andr\'e Platzer</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous cyber-physical systems like robots and self-driving cars could greatly benefit from using formal methods to reason reliably about their control decisions. However, before a problem can be solved it needs to be stated. This requires writing a formal physics model of the cyber-physical system, which is a complex task that traditionally requires human expertise and becomes a bottleneck.
  This paper experimentally studies whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate the formalization process. A 20 problem benchmark suite is designed drawing from undergraduate level physics kinematics problems. In each problem, the LLM is provided with a natural language description of the objects' motion and must produce a model in differential game logic (dGL). The model is (1) syntax checked and iteratively refined based on parser feedback, and (2) semantically evaluated by checking whether symbolically executing the dGL formula recovers the solution to the original physics problem. A success rate of 70% (best over 5 samples) is achieved. We analyze failing cases, identifying directions for future improvement. This provides a first quantitative baseline for LLM-based autoformalization from natural language to a hybrid games logic with continuous dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohan Deb, Qiaobo Li, Mayank Shrivastava, Arindam Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Uniform bounds on sketched inner products of vectors or matrices underpin several important computational and statistical results in machine learning and randomized algorithms, including the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (J-L) lemma, the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), randomized sketching, and approximate linear algebra. However, many modern analyses involve *sketched bilinear forms*, for which existing uniform bounds either do not apply or are not sharp on general sets. In this work, we develop a general framework to analyze such sketched bilinear forms and derive uniform bounds in terms of geometric complexities of the associated sets. Our approach relies on generic chaining and introduces new techniques for handling suprema over pairs of sets. We further extend these results to the setting where the bilinear form involves a sum of $T$ independent sketching matrices and show that the deviation scales as $\sqrt{T}$. This unified analysis recovers known results such as the J-L lemma as special cases, while extending RIP-type guarantees. Additionally, we obtain improved convergence bounds for sketched Federated Learning algorithms where such cross terms arise naturally due to sketched gradient compression, and design sketched variants of bandit algorithms with sharper regret bounds that depend on the geometric complexity of the action and parameter sets, rather than the ambient dimension.</p>

<p>Abstract: As a model-agnostic approach to long context modeling, multi-agent systems can process inputs longer than a large language model's context window without retraining or architectural modifications. However, their performance often heavily relies on hand-crafted multi-agent collaboration strategies and prompt engineering, which limit generalizability. In this work, we introduce a principled framework that formalizes the model-agnostic long context modeling problem as a compression problem, yielding an information-theoretic compression objective. Building on this framework, we propose Graph of Agents (GoA), which dynamically constructs an input-dependent collaboration structure that maximizes this objective. For Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen3 8B across six document question answering benchmarks, GoA improves the average $F_1$ score of retrieval-augmented generation by 5.7\% and a strong multi-agent baseline using a fixed collaboration structure by 16.35\%, respectively. Even with only a 2K context window, GoA surpasses the 128K context window Llama 3.1 8B on LongBench, showing a dramatic increase in effective context length.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely, Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order, improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1 enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores, thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thanh-Long V. Le, Myeongho Jeon, Kim Vu, Viet Lai, Eunho Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful framework for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current methods such as GRPO rely only on problems where the model responses to the same input differ in correctness, while ignoring those where all responses receive the same reward - so-called zero-variance prompts. In this work, we argue that such prompts are not useless but can, in fact, provide meaningful feedback for policy optimization. To this end, we introduce RL with Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP), a novel algorithm that extract learning signals from zero-variance prompts. RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes errors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level characteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61 points in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently outperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts. These results highlight the untapped potential of learning from zero-variance prompts in RLVR.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a practical and scalable approach to enhancing large language models in areas such as math, code, and other structured tasks. Two questions motivate this paper: how much of the reported gains survive under strictly parity-controlled evaluation, and whether RLVR is cost-free or exacts a measurable tax. We argue that progress is real, but gains are often overstated due to three forces - an RLVR tax, evaluation pitfalls, and data contamination. Using a partial-prompt contamination audit and matched-budget reproductions across base and RL models, we show that several headline gaps shrink or vanish under clean, parity-controlled evaluation. We then propose a tax-aware training and evaluation protocol that co-optimizes accuracy, grounding, and calibrated abstention and standardizes budgeting and provenance checks. Applied to recent RLVR setups, this protocol yields more reliable estimates of reasoning gains and, in several cases, revises prior conclusions. Our position is constructive: RLVR is valuable and industry-ready; we advocate keeping its practical benefits while prioritizing reliability, safety, and measurement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bochuan Cao, Changjiang Li, Yuanpu Cao, Yameng Ge, Ting Wang, Jinghui Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted across various applications, leveraging customized system prompts for diverse tasks. Facing potential system prompt leakage risks, model developers have implemented strategies to prevent leakage, primarily by disabling LLMs from repeating their context when encountering known attack patterns. However, it remains vulnerable to new and unforeseen prompt-leaking techniques. In this paper, we first introduce a simple yet effective prompt leaking attack to reveal such risks. Our attack is capable of extracting system prompts from various LLM-based application, even from SOTA LLM models such as GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our findings further inspire us to search for a fundamental solution to the problems by having no system prompt in the context. To this end, we propose SysVec, a novel method that encodes system prompts as internal representation vectors rather than raw text. By doing so, SysVec minimizes the risk of unauthorized disclosure while preserving the LLM's core language capabilities. Remarkably, this approach not only enhances security but also improves the model's general instruction-following abilities. Experimental results demonstrate that SysVec effectively mitigates prompt leakage attacks, preserves the LLM's functional integrity, and helps alleviate the forgetting issue in long-context scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naibin Gu, Zhenyu Zhang, Yuchen Feng, Yilong Chen, Peng Fu, Zheng Lin, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun, Hua Wu, Weiping Wang, Haifeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models typically fix the number of activated experts $k$ at both training and inference. Intuitively, activating more experts at inference $k'$ (where $k'> k$) means engaging a larger set of model parameters for the computation and thus is expected to improve performance. However, contrary to this intuition, we find the scaling range to be so narrow that performance begins to degrade rapidly after only a slight increase in the number of experts. Further investigation reveals that this degradation stems from a lack of learned collaboration among experts. To address this, we introduce Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel training framework that enables MoE models to scale the number of activated experts at inference without incurring additional training overhead. By simultaneously training experts to collaborate in diverse combinations and encouraging the router for high-quality selections, EMoE ensures robust performance across computational budgets at inference. We conduct extensive experiments on various MoE settings. Our results show that EMoE significantly expands the effective performance-scaling range, extending it to as much as 2-3$\times$ the training-time $k$, while also pushing the model's peak performance to a higher level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kemal Sami Karaca, Bahaeddin Eravc{\i}</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the qualitative intent of citations is essential for a comprehensive assessment of academic research, a task that poses unique challenges for agglutinative languages like Turkish. This paper introduces a systematic methodology and a foundational dataset to address this problem. We first present a new, publicly available dataset of Turkish citation intents, created with a purpose-built annotation tool. We then evaluate the performance of standard In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating that its effectiveness is limited by inconsistent results caused by manually designed prompts. To address this core limitation, we introduce a programmable classification pipeline built on the DSPy framework, which automates prompt optimization systematically. For final classification, we employ a stacked generalization ensemble to aggregate outputs from multiple optimized models, ensuring stable and reliable predictions. This ensemble, with an XGBoost meta-model, achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.3\%. Ultimately, this study provides the Turkish NLP community and the broader academic circles with a foundational dataset and a robust classification framework paving the way for future qualitative citation studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Wang, Zhaojun Ding, Xuansheng Wu, Siyue Sun, Ninghao Liu, Xiaoming Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated scoring plays a crucial role in education by reducing the reliance on human raters, offering scalable and immediate evaluation of student work. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in this task, their use as end-to-end raters faces challenges such as low accuracy, prompt sensitivity, limited interpretability, and rubric misalignment. These issues hinder the implementation of LLM-based automated scoring in assessment practice. To address the limitations, we propose AutoSCORE, a multi-agent LLM framework enhancing automated scoring via rubric-aligned Structured COmponent REcognition. With two agents, AutoSCORE first extracts rubric-relevant components from student responses and encodes them into a structured representation (i.e., Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent), which is then used to assign final scores (i.e., Scoring Agent). This design ensures that model reasoning follows a human-like grading process, enhancing interpretability and robustness. We evaluate AutoSCORE on four benchmark datasets from the ASAP benchmark, using both proprietary and open-source LLMs (GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.1-8B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B). Across diverse tasks and rubrics, AutoSCORE consistently improves scoring accuracy, human-machine agreement (QWK, correlations), and error metrics (MAE, RMSE) compared to single-agent baselines, with particularly strong benefits on complex, multi-dimensional rubrics, and especially large relative gains on smaller LLMs. These results demonstrate that structured component recognition combined with multi-agent design offers a scalable, reliable, and interpretable solution for automated scoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alzahra Altalib, Chunhui Li, Alessandro Perelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used for image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). It provides real time visualization at low cost and dose. However, photon scattering and beam hindrance cause artifacts in CBCT. These include inaccurate Hounsfield Units (HU), reducing reliability for dose calculation, and adaptive planning. By contrast, computed tomography (CT) offers better image quality and accurate HU calibration but is usually acquired offline and fails to capture intra-treatment anatomical changes. Thus, accurate CBCT-to-CT synthesis is needed to close the imaging-quality gap in adaptive radiotherapy workflows.
  To cater to this, we propose a novel diffusion-based conditional generative model, coined EqDiff-CT, to synthesize high-quality CT images from CBCT. EqDiff-CT employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to iteratively inject noise and learn latent representations that enable reconstruction of anatomically consistent CT images. A group-equivariant conditional U-Net backbone, implemented with e2cnn steerable layers, enforces rotational equivariance (cyclic C4 symmetry), helping preserve fine structural details while minimizing noise and artifacts.
  The system was trained and validated on the SynthRAD2025 dataset, comprising CBCT-CT scans across multiple head-and-neck anatomical sites, and we compared it with advanced methods such as CycleGAN and DDPM. EqDiff-CT provided substantial gains in structural fidelity, HU accuracy and quantitative metrics. Visual findings further confirm the improved recovery, sharper soft tissue boundaries, and realistic bone reconstructions. The findings suggest that the diffusion model has offered a robust and generalizable framework for CBCT improvements. The proposed solution helps in improving the image quality as well as the clinical confidence in the CBCT-guided treatment planning and dose calculations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunchen Li, Shaohui Lin, Zhou Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical behavior of generative models under finite training populations. Within the stochastic interpolation generative framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal velocity field and score function when only a finite number of training samples are available. We demonstrate that, under some regularity conditions, the deterministic generative process exactly recovers the training samples, while the stochastic generative process manifests as training samples with added Gaussian noise. Beyond the idealized setting, we consider model estimation errors and introduce formal definitions of underfitting and overfitting specific to generative models. Our theoretical analysis reveals that, in the presence of estimation errors, the stochastic generation process effectively produces convex combinations of training samples corrupted by a mixture of uniform and Gaussian noise. Experiments on generation tasks and downstream tasks such as classification support our theory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialiang Li, Wenzheng Wu, Gaojing Zhang, Yifan Han, Wenzhao Lian</p>
<p>Abstract: Successfully solving long-horizon manipulation tasks remains a fundamental challenge. These tasks involve extended action sequences and complex object interactions, presenting a critical gap between high-level symbolic planning and low-level continuous control. To bridge this gap, two essential capabilities are required: robust long-horizon task planning and effective goal-conditioned manipulation. Existing task planning methods, including traditional and LLM-based approaches, often exhibit limited generalization or sparse semantic reasoning. Meanwhile, image-conditioned control methods struggle to adapt to unseen tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose SAGE, a novel framework for Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution in Long-Horizon Manipulation Tasks. SAGE utilizes semantic scene graphs as a structural representation for scene states. A structural scene graph enables bridging task-level semantic reasoning and pixel-level visuo-motor control. This also facilitates the controllable synthesis of accurate, novel sub-goal images. SAGE consists of two key components: (1) a scene graph-based task planner that uses VLMs and LLMs to parse the environment and reason about physically-grounded scene state transition sequences, and (2) a decoupled structural image editing pipeline that controllably converts each target sub-goal graph into a corresponding image through image inpainting and composition. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that SAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance on distinct long-horizon tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiageng Wu, Kevin Xie, Bowen Gu, Nils Kr\"uger, Kueiyu Joshua Lin, Jie Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to clinical care, a domain where both accuracy and transparent reasoning are critical for safe and trustworthy deployment. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits step-by-step reasoning, has demonstrated improvements in performance and interpretability across a wide range of tasks. However, its effectiveness in clinical contexts remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of electronic health records (EHRs), the primary source of clinical documentation, which are often lengthy, fragmented, and noisy. In this work, we present the first large-scale systematic study of CoT for clinical text understanding. We assess 95 advanced LLMs on 87 real-world clinical text tasks, covering 9 languages and 8 task types. Contrary to prior findings in other domains, we observe that 86.3\% of models suffer consistent performance degradation in the CoT setting. More capable models remain relatively robust, while weaker ones suffer substantial declines. To better characterize these effects, we perform fine-grained analyses of reasoning length, medical concept alignment, and error profiles, leveraging both LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and clinical expert evaluation. Our results uncover systematic patterns in when and why CoT fails in clinical contexts, which highlight a critical paradox: CoT enhances interpretability but may undermine reliability in clinical text tasks. This work provides an empirical basis for clinical reasoning strategies of LLMs, highlighting the need for transparent and trustworthy approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woosung Joung, Daewon Chae, Jinkyu Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: ControlNet has enabled detailed spatial control in text-to-image diffusion models by incorporating additional visual conditions such as depth or edge maps. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions. In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition (e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengzhou Chen, Hongyuan Liang, Tao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: To efficiently tune configuration for better system performance (e.g., latency), many tuners have leveraged a surrogate model to expedite the process instead of solely relying on the profoundly expensive system measurement. As such, it is naturally believed that we need more accurate models. However, the fact of accuracy can lie-a somewhat surprising finding from prior work-has left us many unanswered questions regarding what role the surrogate model plays in configuration tuning. This paper provides the very first systematic exploration and discussion, together with a resolution proposal, to disclose the many faces of surrogate models for configuration tuning, through the novel perspective of fitness landscape analysis. We present a theory as an alternative to accuracy for assessing the model usefulness in tuning, based on which we conduct an extensive empirical study involving up to 27,000 cases. Drawing on the above, we propose Model4Tune, an automated predictive tool that estimates which model-tuner pairs are the best for an unforeseen system without expensive tuner profiling. Our results suggest that Moldel4Tune, as one of the first of its kind, performs significantly better than random guessing in 79%-82% of the cases. Our results not only shed light on the possible future research directions but also offer a practical resolution that can assist practitioners in evaluating the most useful model for configuration tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Political stance detection in low-resource and culturally complex settings poses a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). In the Thai political landscape - marked by indirect language, polarized figures, and entangled sentiment and stance - LLMs often display systematic biases such as sentiment leakage and favoritism toward entities. These biases undermine fairness and reliability. We present ThaiFACTUAL, a lightweight, model-agnostic calibration framework that mitigates political bias without requiring fine-tuning. ThaiFACTUAL uses counterfactual data augmentation and rationale-based supervision to disentangle sentiment from stance and reduce bias. We also release the first high-quality Thai political stance dataset, annotated with stance, sentiment, rationales, and bias markers across diverse entities and events. Experimental results show that ThaiFACTUAL significantly reduces spurious correlations, enhances zero-shot generalization, and improves fairness across multiple LLMs. This work highlights the importance of culturally grounded debiasing techniques for underrepresented languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taeyoung Yun, Pierre-Luc St-Charles, Jinkyoo Park, Yoshua Bengio, Minsu Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce \textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in computation.

<p>Abstract: Learning-based planners are sensitive to the long-tailed distribution of driving data. Common maneuvers dominate datasets, while dangerous or rare scenarios are sparse. This imbalance can bias models toward the frequent cases and degrade performance on critical scenarios. To tackle this problem, we compare balancing strategies for sampling training data and find reweighting by trajectory pattern an effective approach. We then present FlowDrive, a flow-matching trajectory planner that learns a conditional rectified flow to map noise directly to trajectory distributions with few flow-matching steps. We further introduce moderated, in-the-loop guidance that injects small perturbation between flow steps to systematically increase trajectory diversity while remaining scene-consistent. On nuPlan and the interaction-focused interPlan benchmarks, FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based planners and approaches methods with rule-based refinements. After adding moderated guidance and light post-processing (FlowDrive*), it achieves overall state-of-the-art performance across nearly all benchmark splits.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image contrast was a fundamental factor in visual perception and played a vital role in overall image quality. However, most no reference image quality assessment NR IQA models struggled to accurately evaluate contrast distortions under diverse real world conditions. In this study, we proposed a deep learning based framework for blind contrast quality assessment by customizing and fine-tuning three pre trained architectures, EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and MobileNetV2, for perceptual Mean Opinion Score, along with an additional model built on a Siamese network, which indicated a limited ability to capture perceptual contrast distortions. Each model is modified with a contrast-aware regression head and trained end to end using targeted data augmentations on two benchmark datasets, CID2013 and CCID2014, containing synthetic and authentic contrast distortions. Performance is evaluated using Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, which assess the alignment between predicted and human rated scores. Among these three models, our customized EfficientNet B0 model achieved state-of-the-art performance with PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369 on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and outperforming other deep baselines. These results highlighted the models robustness and effectiveness in capturing perceptual contrast distortion. Overall, the proposed method demonstrated that contrast aware adaptation of lightweight pre trained networks can yield a high performing, scalable solution for no reference contrast quality assessment suitable for real time and resource constrained applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iris Delikoura (May), Yi. R (May),  Fung, Pan Hui</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming education by enabling personalization, feedback, and knowledge access, while also raising concerns about risks to students and learning systems. Yet empirical evidence on these risks remains fragmented. This paper presents a systematic review of 70 empirical studies across computer science, education, and psychology. Guided by four research questions, we examine: (i) which applications of LLMs in education have been most frequently explored; (ii) how researchers have measured their impact; (iii) which risks stem from such applications; and (iv) what mitigation strategies have been proposed. We find that research on LLMs clusters around three domains: operational effectiveness, personalized applications, and interactive learning tools. Across these, model-level risks include superficial understanding, bias, limited robustness, anthropomorphism, hallucinations, privacy concerns, and knowledge constraints. When learners interact with LLMs, these risks extend to cognitive and behavioural outcomes, including reduced neural activity, over-reliance, diminished independent learning skills, and a loss of student agency. To capture this progression, we propose an LLM-Risk Adapted Learning Model that illustrates how technical risks cascade through interaction and interpretation to shape educational outcomes. As the first synthesis of empirically assessed risks, this review provides a foundation for responsible, human-centred integration of LLMs in education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zilun Zhang, Zian Guan, Tiancheng Zhao, Haozhan Shen, Tianyu Li, Yuxiang Cai, Zhonggen Su, Zhaojun Liu, Jianwei Yin, Xiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges, as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions, and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zikun Guo, Xinyue Xu, Pei Xiang, Shu Yang, Xin Han, Di Wang, Lijie Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable, exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses, with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for evidence anchored defenses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sigmund Hennum H{\o}eg, Aksel Vaaler, Chaoqi Liu, Olav Egeland, Yilun Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Constructing robots to accomplish long-horizon tasks is a long-standing challenge within artificial intelligence. Approaches using generative methods, particularly Diffusion Models, have gained attention due to their ability to model continuous robotic trajectories for planning and control. However, we show that these models struggle with long-horizon tasks that involve complex decision-making and, in general, are prone to confusing different modes of behavior, leading to failure. To remedy this, we propose to augment continuous trajectory generation by simultaneously generating a high-level symbolic plan. We show that this requires a novel mix of discrete variable diffusion and continuous diffusion, which dramatically outperforms the baselines. In addition, we illustrate how this hybrid diffusion process enables flexible trajectory synthesis, allowing us to condition synthesized actions on partial and complete symbolic conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomoya Yoshida, Shuhei Kurita, Taichi Nishimura, Shinsuke Mori</p>
<p>Abstract: Egocentric videos capture how humans manipulate objects and tools, providing diverse motion cues for learning object manipulation. Unlike the costly, expert-driven manual teleoperation commonly used in training Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs), egocentric videos offer a scalable alternative. However, prior studies that leverage such videos for training robot policies typically rely on auxiliary annotations, such as detailed hand-pose recordings. Consequently, it remains unclear whether VLAs can be trained directly from raw egocentric videos. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging EgoScaler, a framework that extracts 6DoF object manipulation trajectories from egocentric videos without requiring auxiliary recordings. We apply EgoScaler to four large-scale egocentric video datasets and automatically refine noisy or incomplete trajectories, thereby constructing a new large-scale dataset for VLA pre-training. Our experiments with a state-of-the-art $\pi_0$ architecture in both simulated and real-robot environments yield three key findings: (i) pre-training on our dataset improves task success rates by over 20\% compared to training from scratch, (ii) the performance is competitive with that achieved using real-robot datasets, and (iii) combining our dataset with real-robot data yields further improvements. These results demonstrate that egocentric videos constitute a promising and scalable resource for advancing VLA research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jewon Lee, Wooksu Shin, Seungmin Yang, Ki-Ung Song, DongUk Lim, Jaeyeon Kim, Tae-Ho Kim, Bo-Kyeong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end, we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V* benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a 3x inference speedup.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seongho Joo, Kyungmin Min, Jahyun Koo, Kyomin Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the great advancement of Language modeling in recent days, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT3 are notorious for generating non-factual responses, so-called "hallucination" problems. Existing methods for detecting and alleviating this hallucination problem require external resources or the internal state of LLMs, such as the output probability of each token. Given the LLM's restricted external API availability and the limited scope of external resources, there is an urgent demand to establish the Black-Box approach as the cornerstone for effective hallucination detection. In this work, we propose a simple black-box hallucination detection metric after the investigation of the behavior of LLMs under expression of uncertainty. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that LLMs generate consistent responses when they present factual responses while non-consistent responses vice versa. Based on the analysis, we propose an efficient black-box hallucination detection metric with the expression of uncertainty. The experiment demonstrates that our metric is more predictive of the factuality in model responses than baselines that use internal knowledge of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saurav Jha, Stefan K. Ehrlich</p>
<p>Abstract: Healthcare robotics requires robust multimodal perception and reasoning to ensure safety in dynamic clinical environments. Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general-purpose capabilities but remain limited in temporal reasoning, uncertainty estimation, and structured outputs needed for robotic planning. We present a lightweight agentic multimodal framework for video-based scene understanding. Combining the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model with a SmolAgent-based orchestration layer, it supports chain-of-thought reasoning, speech-vision fusion, and dynamic tool invocation. The framework generates structured scene graphs and leverages a hybrid retrieval module for interpretable and adaptive reasoning. Evaluations on the Video-MME benchmark and a custom clinical dataset show competitive accuracy and improved robustness compared to state-of-the-art VLMs, demonstrating its potential for applications in robot-assisted surgery, patient monitoring, and decision support.</p>

However, diffusion models like Stable Diffusion lack the intuitive latent vector control found in GANs, limiting their flexibility for artistic expression. This paper introduces \workname, a framework for integrating customizable latent space operations into the diffusion process. By enabling direct manipulation of conceptual and spatial representations, this approach expands creative possibilities in generative art. We demonstrate the potential of this framework through two artworks, \textit{Infinitepedia} and \textit{Latent Motion}, highlighting its use in conceptual blending and dynamic motion generation. Our findings reveal latent space structures with semantic and meaningless regions, offering insights into the geometry of diffusion models and paving the way for further explorations of latent space.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP) has achieved remarkable progress. Nonetheless, significant challenges remain in handling texts with ambiguity, polysemy, or uncertainty. We introduce the Fuzzy Reasoning Chain (FRC) framework, which integrates LLM semantic priors with continuous fuzzy membership degrees, creating an explicit interaction between probability-based reasoning and fuzzy membership reasoning. This transition allows ambiguous inputs to be gradually transformed into clear and interpretable decisions while capturing conflicting or uncertain signals that traditional probability-based methods cannot. We validate FRC on sentiment analysis tasks, where both theoretical analysis and empirical results show that it ensures stable reasoning and facilitates knowledge transfer across different model scales. These findings indicate that FRC provides a general mechanism for managing subtle and ambiguous expressions with improved interpretability and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qifeng Wang, Weigang Li, Lei Nie, Xin Xu, Wenping Liu, Zhe Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: As a key technology for autonomous navigation and positioning in mobile robots, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) odometry is widely used in autonomous driving applications. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based methods have become the core technique in LiDAR odometry due to their efficient and accurate point cloud registration capability. However, some existing ICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which may cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence of an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic environments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR odometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose. First, distributed coarse registration based on density filtering is employed to obtain the initial pose estimation. The reliable initial pose is then selected by comparing it with the motion prediction pose, reducing the initial error between the source and target point clouds. Subsequently, by combining the current and historical errors, the adaptive threshold is dynamically adjusted to accommodate the real-time changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, based on the reliable initial pose and the adaptive threshold, point-to-plane adaptive ICP registration is performed from the current frame to the local map, achieving high-precision alignment of the source and target point clouds. Extensive experiments on the public KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances the accuracy of LiDAR odometry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aravindhan G, Yuvaraj Govindarajulu, Parin Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of Automatic Speech Recognition systems to adversarial examples, which can deceive these systems into misinterpreting input speech commands. While previous research has primarily focused on white-box attacks with constrained optimizations, and transferability based black-box attacks against commercial Automatic Speech Recognition devices, this paper explores cost efficient white-box attack and non transferability black-box adversarial attacks on Automatic Speech Recognition systems, drawing insights from approaches such as Fast Gradient Sign Method and Zeroth-Order Optimization. Further, the novelty of the paper includes how poisoning attack can degrade the performances of state-of-the-art models leading to misinterpretation of audio signals. Through experimentation and analysis, we illustrate how hybrid models can generate subtle yet impactful adversarial examples with very little perturbation having Signal Noise Ratio of 35dB that can be generated within a minute. These vulnerabilities of state-of-the-art open source model have practical security implications, and emphasize the need for adversarial security.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anya Belz, Simon Mille, Craig Thomson</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior work has shown that two NLP evaluation experiments that report results for the same quality criterion name (e.g. Fluency) do not necessarily evaluate the same aspect of quality, and the comparability implied by the name can be misleading. Not knowing when two evaluations are comparable in this sense means we currently lack the ability to draw reliable conclusions about system quality on the basis of multiple, independently conducted evaluations. This in turn hampers the ability of the field to progress scientifically as a whole, a pervasive issue in NLP since its beginning (Sparck Jones, 1981). It is hard to see how the issue of unclear comparability can be fully addressed other than by the creation of a standard set of quality criterion names and definitions that the several hundred quality criterion names actually in use in the field can be mapped to, and grounded in. Taking a strictly descriptive approach, the QCET Quality Criteria for Evaluation Taxonomy derives a standard set of quality criterion names and definitions from three surveys of evaluations reported in NLP, and structures them into a hierarchy where each parent node captures common aspects of its child nodes. We present QCET and the resources it consists of, and discuss its three main uses in (i) establishing comparability of existing evaluations, (ii) guiding the design of new evaluations, and (iii) assessing regulatory compliance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anton Korznikov, Andrey Galichin, Alexey Dontsov, Oleg Y. Rogov, Ivan Oseledets, Elena Tutubalina</p>
<p>Abstract: Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite: steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not guarantee precise control over model behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohuan Pei, Yuxing Chen, Siyu Xu, Yunke Wang, Yuheng Shi, Chang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotic manipulation with Vision-Language-Action models requires efficient inference over long-horizon multi-modal context, where attention to dense visual tokens dominates computational cost. Existing methods optimize inference speed by reducing visual redundancy within VLA models, but they overlook the varying redundancy across robotic manipulation stages. We observe that the visual token redundancy is higher in coarse manipulation phase than in fine-grained operations, and is strongly correlated with the action dynamic. Motivated by this observation, we propose \textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{P}runing (\textbf{ADP}), a multi-modal pruning framework that integrates text-driven token selection with action-aware trajectory gating. Our method introduces a gating mechanism that conditions the pruning signal on recent action trajectories, using past motion windows to adaptively adjust token retention ratios in accordance with dynamics, thereby balancing computational efficiency and perceptual precision across different manipulation stages. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO suites and diverse real-world scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces FLOPs and action inference latency (\textit{e.g.} $1.35 \times$ speed up on OpenVLA-OFT) while maintaining competitive success rates (\textit{e.g.} 25.8\% improvements with OpenVLA) compared to baselines, thereby providing a simple plug-in path to efficient robot policies that advances the efficiency and performance frontier of robotic manipulation.

<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) powered code agents are rapidly transforming software engineering by automating tasks such as testing, debugging, and repairing, yet the security risks of their generated code have become a critical concern. Existing benchmarks have offered valuable insights but remain insufficient: they often overlook the genuine context in which vulnerabilities were introduced or adopt narrow evaluation protocols that fail to capture either functional correctness or newly introduced vulnerabilities. We therefore introduce SecureAgentBench, a benchmark of 105 coding tasks designed to rigorously evaluate code agents' capabilities in secure code generation. Each task includes (i) realistic task settings that require multi-file edits in large repositories, (ii) aligned contexts based on real-world open-source vulnerabilities with precisely identified introduction points, and (iii) comprehensive evaluation that combines functionality testing, vulnerability checking through proof-of-concept exploits, and detection of newly introduced vulnerabilities using static analysis. We evaluate three representative agents (SWE-agent, OpenHands, and Aider) with three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-V3.1). Results show that (i) current agents struggle to produce secure code, as even the best-performing one, SWE-agent supported by DeepSeek-V3.1, achieves merely 15.2% correct-and-secure solutions, (ii) some agents produce functionally correct code but still introduce vulnerabilities, including new ones not previously recorded, and (iii) adding explicit security instructions for agents does not significantly improve secure coding, underscoring the need for further research. These findings establish SecureAgentBench as a rigorous benchmark for secure code generation and a step toward more reliable software development with LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Algorithmic recourse seeks to provide individuals with actionable recommendations that increase their chances of receiving favorable outcomes from automated decision systems (e.g., loan approvals). While prior research has emphasized robustness to model updates, considerably less attention has been given to the temporal dynamics of recourse--particularly in competitive, resource-constrained settings where recommendations shape future applicant pools. In this work, we present a novel time-aware framework for algorithmic recourse, explicitly modeling how candidate populations adapt in response to recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based recourse algorithm that captures the evolving dynamics of the environment to generate recommendations that are both feasible and valid. We design our recommendations to be durable, supporting validity over a predefined time horizon T. This durability allows individuals to confidently reapply after taking time to implement the suggested changes. Through extensive experiments in complex simulation environments, we show that our approach substantially outperforms existing baselines, offering a superior balance between feasibility and long-term validity. Together, these results underscore the importance of incorporating temporal and behavioral dynamics into the design of practical recourse systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Wang, Tao Yang, Hongtao Tian, Yunsheng Shi, Qiyao Ma, Xiaotao Liu, Ting Yao, Wenbo Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Critic-free methods like GRPO reduce memory demands by estimating advantages from multiple rollouts but tend to converge slowly, as critical learning signals are diluted by an abundance of uninformative samples and tokens. To tackle this challenge, we propose the \textbf{Dynamic Dual-Level Down-Sampling (D$^3$S)} framework that prioritizes the most informative samples and tokens across groups to improve the efficient of policy optimization. D$^3$S operates along two levels: (1) the sample-level, which selects a subset of rollouts to maximize advantage variance ($\text{Var}(A)$). We theoretically proven that this selection is positively correlated with the upper bound of the policy gradient norms, yielding higher policy gradients. (2) the token-level, which prioritizes tokens with a high product of advantage magnitude and policy entropy ($|A_{i,t}|\times H_{i,t}$), focusing updates on tokens where the policy is both uncertain and impactful. Moreover, to prevent overfitting to high-signal data, D$^3$S employs a dynamic down-sampling schedule inspired by curriculum learning. This schedule starts with aggressive down-sampling to accelerate early learning and gradually relaxes to promote robust generalization. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1 demonstrate that integrating D$^3$S into advanced RL algorithms achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalization while requiring \textit{fewer} samples and tokens across diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our code is added in the supplementary materials and will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is driving a revolution in the way scientists design, develop, and deploy data-intensive software. However, the adoption of ML presents new challenges for the computing infrastructure, particularly in terms of provisioning and orchestrating access to hardware accelerators for development, testing, and production. The INFN-funded project AI_INFN (Artificial Intelligence at INFN) aims at fostering the adoption of ML techniques within INFN use cases by providing support on multiple aspects, including the provisioning of AI-tailored computing resources. It leverages cloud-native solutions in the context of INFN Cloud, to share hardware accelerators as effectively as possible, ensuring the diversity of the Institute's research activities is not compromised. In this contribution, we provide an update on the commissioning of a Kubernetes platform designed to ease the development of GPU-powered data analysis workflows and their scalability on heterogeneous distributed computing resources, also using the offloading mechanism with Virtual Kubelet and InterLink API. This setup can manage workflows across different resource providers, including sites of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid and supercomputers such as CINECA Leonardo, providing a model for use cases requiring dedicated infrastructures for different parts of the workload.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Chi, Wenlin Zhong, Yiquan Wu, Wei Wang, Kun Kuang, Fei Wu, Minghui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Legal Article Prediction (LAP) is a critical task in legal text classification, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automatically predict relevant legal articles based on the fact descriptions of cases. As a foundational step in legal decision-making, LAP plays a pivotal role in determining subsequent judgments, such as charges and penalties. Despite its importance, existing methods face significant challenges in addressing the complexities of LAP. Supervised classification models (SCMs), such as CNN and BERT, struggle to fully capture intricate fact patterns due to their inherent limitations. Conversely, large language models (LLMs), while excelling in generative tasks, perform suboptimally in predictive scenarios due to the abstract and ID-based nature of legal articles. Furthermore, the diversity of legal systems across jurisdictions exacerbates the issue, as most approaches are tailored to specific countries and lack broader applicability. To address these limitations, we propose Uni-LAP, a universal framework for legal article prediction that integrates the strengths of SCMs and LLMs through tight collaboration. Specifically, in Uni-LAP, the SCM is enhanced with a novel Top-K loss function to generate accurate candidate articles, while the LLM employs syllogism-inspired reasoning to refine the final predictions. We evaluated Uni-LAP on datasets from multiple jurisdictions, and empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) poses a significant and challenging problem critical for applications in robotics and logistics, particularly due to its combinatorial complexity and the partial observability inherent in realistic environments. Decentralized reinforcement learning methods commonly encounter two substantial difficulties: first, they often yield self-centered behaviors among agents, resulting in frequent collisions, and second, their reliance on complex communication modules leads to prolonged training times, sometimes spanning weeks. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient decentralized planning framework based on the Decision Transformer (DT), uniquely leveraging offline reinforcement learning to substantially reduce training durations from weeks to mere hours. Crucially, our approach effectively handles long-horizon credit assignment and significantly improves performance in scenarios with sparse and delayed rewards. Furthermore, to overcome adaptability limitations inherent in standard RL methods under dynamic environmental changes, we integrate a large language model (GPT-4o) to dynamically guide agent policies. Extensive experiments in both static and dynamically changing environments demonstrate that our DT-based approach, augmented briefly by GPT-4o, significantly enhances adaptability and performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyu Shan, Mingyang Song, Chang Dai, Di Liang, Han Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs) tackle complex reasoning by eliciting explicit step-by-step rationales. However, CoT's verbosity increases latency and memory usage and may propagate early errors across long chains. We propose the Reasoning Capsule (R-Capsule), a framework that aims to combine the efficiency of latent reasoning with the transparency of explicit CoT. The core idea is to compress the high-level plan into a small set of learned latent tokens (a Reasoning Capsule) while keeping execution steps lightweight or explicit. This hybrid approach is inspired by the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, where we encourage the capsule to be approximately minimal yet sufficient for the task. Minimality is encouraged via a low-capacity bottleneck, which helps improve efficiency. Sufficiency is encouraged via a dual objective: a primary task loss for answer accuracy and an auxiliary plan-reconstruction loss that encourages the capsule to faithfully represent the original textual plan. The reconstruction objective helps ground the latent space, thereby improving interpretability and reducing the use of uninformative shortcuts. Our framework strikes a balance between efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability, thereby reducing the visible token footprint of reasoning while maintaining or improving accuracy on complex benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijing Hu, Jingyang Li, Zhihui Lu, Pan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by letting a lightweight draft model propose multiple tokens that the target model verifies in parallel. Yet existing training objectives optimize only a single greedy draft path, while decoding follows a tree policy that re-ranks and verifies multiple branches. This draft policy misalignment limits achievable speedups. We introduce Group Tree Optimization (GTO), which aligns training with the decoding-time tree policy through two components: (i) Draft Tree Reward, a sampling-free objective equal to the expected acceptance length of the draft tree under the target model, directly measuring decoding performance; (ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training, a stable optimization scheme that contrasts trees from the current and a frozen reference draft model, forming debiased group-standardized advantages and applying a PPO-style surrogate along the longest accepted sequence for robust updates. We further prove that increasing our Draft Tree Reward provably improves acceptance length and speedup. Across dialogue (MT-Bench), code (HumanEval), and math (GSM8K), and multiple LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Vicuna-1.3-13B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B), GTO increases acceptance length by 7.4% and yields an additional 7.7% speedup over prior state-of-the-art EAGLE-3. By bridging draft policy misalignment, GTO offers a practical, general solution for efficient LLM inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yicheng Jiang, Jin Yuan, Hua Yuan, Yao Zhang, Yong Rui</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional image generation models have achieved remarkable results by leveraging text-based control to generate customized images. However, the high resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and privacy concerns, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised distillation framework. Specifically, we improve the performance of the student model by introducing a tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different levels of knowledge. To enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity, we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data. Our experiments reveal that Refine-Control achieves significant reductions in computational cost and latency, while maintaining high-fidelity generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianzhi Yan, Le Liu, Youcheng Pan, Shiwei Chen, Zike Yuan, Yang Xiang, Buzhou Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves performance on complex tasks but introduces significant inference latency due to verbosity. We propose Multiround Adaptive Chain-of-Thought Compression (MACC), a framework that leverages the token elasticity phenomenon--where overly small token budgets can paradoxically increase output length--to progressively compress CoTs via multiround refinement. This adaptive strategy allows MACC to determine the optimal compression depth for each input. Our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 5.6 percent over state-of-the-art baselines, while also reducing CoT length by an average of 47 tokens and significantly lowering latency. Furthermore, we show that test-time performance--accuracy and token length--can be reliably predicted using interpretable features like perplexity and compression rate on the training set. Evaluated across different models, our method enables efficient model selection and forecasting without repeated fine-tuning, demonstrating that CoT compression is both effective and predictable.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takashi Morita</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector quantization, which discretizes a continuous vector space into a finite set of representative vectors (a codebook), has been widely adopted in modern machine learning. Despite its effectiveness, vector quantization poses a fundamental challenge: the non-differentiable quantization step blocks gradient backpropagation. Smoothed vector quantization addresses this issue by relaxing the hard assignment of a codebook vector into a weighted combination of codebook entries, represented as the matrix product of a simplex vector and the codebook. Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers should remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2) all codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse. Existing methods typically address these desiderata separately. By contrast, the present study introduces a simple and intuitive regularization that promotes both simultaneously by minimizing the distance between each simplex vertex and its $K$-nearest smoothed quantizers. Experiments on representative benchmarks, including discrete image autoencoding and contrastive speech representation learning, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more reliable codebook utilization and improves performance compared to prior approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: The demand for efficient large language model (LLM) inference has intensified the focus on sparsification techniques. While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16 pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support more flexible sparsity patterns.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Durgesh Kalwar, Mayank Baranwal, Harshad Khadilkar</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's data-sensitive landscape, distributed learning emerges as a vital tool, not only fortifying privacy measures but also streamlining computational operations. This becomes especially crucial within fully decentralized infrastructures where local processing is imperative due to the absence of centralized aggregation. Here, we introduce DYNAWEIGHT, a novel framework to information aggregation in multi-agent networks. DYNAWEIGHT offers substantial acceleration in decentralized learning with minimal additional communication and memory overhead. Unlike traditional static weight assignments, such as Metropolis weights, DYNAWEIGHT dynamically allocates weights to neighboring servers based on their relative losses on local datasets. Consequently, it favors servers possessing diverse information, particularly in scenarios of substantial data heterogeneity. Our experiments on various datasets MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 incorporating various server counts and graph topologies, demonstrate notable enhancements in training speeds. Notably, DYNAWEIGHT functions as an aggregation scheme compatible with any underlying server-level optimization algorithm, underscoring its versatility and potential for widespread integration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pavan Karjol, Vivek V Kashyap, Rohan Kashyap, Prathosh A P</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we introduce a method for learning group (known or unknown) equivariant functions by learning the associated quadratic form $x^T A x$ corresponding to the group from the data. Certain groups, known as orthogonal groups, preserve a specific quadratic form, and we leverage this property to uncover the underlying symmetry group under the assumption that it is orthogonal. By utilizing the corresponding unique symmetric matrix and its inherent diagonal form, we incorporate suitable inductive biases into the neural network architecture, leading to models that are both simplified and efficient. Our approach results in an invariant model that preserves norms, while the equivariant model is represented as a product of a norm-invariant model and a scale-invariant model, where the ``product'' refers to the group action.
  Moreover, we extend our framework to a more general setting where the function acts on tuples of input vectors via a diagonal (or product) group action. In this extension, the equivariant function is decomposed into an angular component extracted solely from the normalized first vector and a scale-invariant component that depends on the full Gram matrix of the tuple. This decomposition captures the inter-dependencies between multiple inputs while preserving the underlying group symmetry.
  We assess the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks, including polynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia matrix prediction. Comparative analysis with baseline methods demonstrates that our model consistently excels in both discovering the underlying symmetry and efficiently learning the corresponding equivariant function.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models derive their generalization capability from diverse training data, yet collecting embodied robot interaction data remains prohibitively expensive. In contrast, human demonstration videos are far more scalable and cost-efficient to collect, and recent studies confirm their effectiveness in training VLA models. However, a significant domain gap persists between human videos and robot-executed videos, including unstable camera viewpoints, visual discrepancies between human hands and robotic arms, and differences in motion dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose MimicDreamer, a framework that turns fast, low-cost human demonstrations into robot-usable supervision by jointly aligning vision, viewpoint, and actions to directly support policy training. For visual alignment, we propose H2R Aligner, a video diffusion model that generates high-fidelity robot demonstration videos by transferring motion from human manipulation footage. For viewpoint stabilization, EgoStabilizer is proposed, which canonicalizes egocentric videos via homography and inpaints occlusions and distortions caused by warping. For action alignment, we map human hand trajectories to the robot frame and apply a constrained inverse kinematics solver to produce feasible, low-jitter joint commands with accurate pose tracking. Empirically, VLA models trained purely on our synthesized human-to-robot videos achieve few-shot execution on real robots. Moreover, scaling training with human data significantly boosts performance compared to models trained solely on real robot data; our approach improves the average success rate by 14.7\% across six representative manipulation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we offer a simple argument for the conclusion that the outputs of large language models (LLMs) are meaningless. Our argument is based on two key premises: (a) that certain kinds of intentions are needed in order for LLMs' outputs to have literal meanings, and (b) that LLMs cannot plausibly have the right kinds of intentions. We defend this argument from various types of responses, for example, the semantic externalist argument that deference can be assumed to take the place of intentions and the semantic internalist argument that meanings can be defined purely in terms of intrinsic relations between concepts, such as conceptual roles. We conclude the paper by discussing why, even if our argument is sound, the outputs of LLMs nevertheless seem meaningful and can be used to acquire true beliefs and even knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mu Huang, Linning Xu, Mingyue Dai, Yidi Shao, Bo Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulating physically plausible trajectories toward user-defined goals is a fundamental yet challenging task in fluid dynamics. While particle-based simulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference remains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are irreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail to converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator (R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a single graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate inverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse the underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling forward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and efficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the parameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than optimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed of strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates iterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On goal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex target shapes (e.g., characters "L" and "N") through vivid, physically consistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiago Fernandes Tavares</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised analysis of text corpora is challenging, especially in data-scarce domains where traditional topic models struggle. While these models offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data, resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks, particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels. RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source corpus.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study examines the potential impact of reinforcement learning (RL)-enabled autonomous vehicles (AV) on urban traffic flow in a mixed traffic environment. We focus on a simplified day-to-day route choice problem in a multi-agent setting. We consider a city network where human drivers travel through their chosen routes to reach their destinations in minimum travel time. Then, we convert one-third of the population into AVs, which are RL agents employing Deep Q-learning algorithm. We define a set of optimization targets, or as we call them behaviors, namely selfish, collaborative, competitive, social, altruistic, and malicious. We impose a selected behavior on AVs through their rewards. We run our simulations using our in-house developed RL framework PARCOUR. Our simulations reveal that AVs optimize their travel times by up to 5\%, with varying impacts on human drivers' travel times depending on the AV behavior. In all cases where AVs adopt a self-serving behavior, they achieve shorter travel times than human drivers. Our findings highlight the complexity differences in learning tasks of each target behavior. We demonstrate that the multi-agent RL setting is applicable for collective routing on traffic networks, though their impact on coexisting parties greatly varies with the behaviors adopted.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for the automatic discovery of one-parameter subgroups ($H_{\gamma}$) of $SO(3)$ and, more generally, $SO(n)$. One-parameter subgroups of $SO(n)$ are crucial in a wide range of applications, including robotics, quantum mechanics, and molecular structure analysis. Our method utilizes the standard Jordan form of skew-symmetric matrices, which define the Lie algebra of $SO(n)$, to establish a canonical form for orbits under the action of $H_{\gamma}$. This canonical form is then employed to derive a standardized representation for $H_{\gamma}$-invariant functions. By learning the appropriate parameters, the framework uncovers the underlying one-parameter subgroup $H_{\gamma}$. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through tasks such as double pendulum modeling, moment of inertia prediction, top quark tagging and invariant polynomial regression, where it successfully recovers meaningful subgroup structure and produces interpretable, symmetry-aware representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reconstructing object deformation from a single image remains a significant challenge in computer vision and graphics.

To address this, we propose DeformSplat, a novel framework that effectively guides 3D Gaussian deformation from only a single image. Our method introduces two main technical contributions. First, we present Gaussian-to-Pixel Matching which bridges the domain gap between 3D Gaussian representations and 2D pixel observations. This enables robust deformation guidance from sparse visual cues. Second, we propose Rigid Part Segmentation consisting of initialization and refinement. This segmentation explicitly identifies rigid regions, crucial for maintaining geometric coherence during deformation. By combining these two techniques, our approach can reconstruct consistent deformations from a single image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods and naturally extends to various applications,such as frame interpolation and interactive object manipulation.</p>

Notably, CR adaptively emphasizes domain-appropriate reasoning styles. It prioritizes abductive and deductive reasoning for medical question answering, but shifts to causal, deductive, and inductive methods for scientific reasoning.

<p>Abstract: Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously addressing their monosemous limitations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandra Cimpean, Nicole Orzan, Catholijn Jonker, Pieter Libin, Ann Now\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Equity in real-world sequential decision problems can be enforced using fairness-aware methods. Therefore, we require algorithms that can make suitable and transparent trade-offs between performance and the desired fairness notions. As the desired performance-fairness trade-off is hard to specify a priori, we propose a framework where multiple trade-offs can be explored. Insights provided by the reinforcement learning algorithm regarding the obtainable performance-fairness trade-offs can then guide stakeholders in selecting the most appropriate policy. To capture fairness, we propose an extended Markov decision process, $f$MDP, that explicitly encodes individuals and groups. Given this $f$MDP, we formalise fairness notions in the context of sequential decision problems and formulate a fairness framework that computes fairness measures over time. We evaluate our framework in two scenarios with distinct fairness requirements: job hiring, where strong teams must be composed while treating applicants equally, and fraud detection, where fraudulent transactions must be detected while ensuring the burden on customers is fairly distributed. We show that our framework learns policies that are more fair across multiple scenarios, with only minor loss in performance reward. Moreover, we observe that group and individual fairness notions do not necessarily imply one another, highlighting the benefit of our framework in settings where both fairness types are desired. Finally, we provide guidelines on how to apply this framework across different problem settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haorui Chen, Chengze Li, Jia Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a novel software development paradigm known as "vibe coding," where users interact with coding agents through high-level natural language. However, existing evaluation benchmarks for code generation inadequately assess an agent's vibe coding capabilities. Existing benchmarks are misaligned, as they either require code-level specifications or focus narrowly on issue-solving, neglecting the critical scenario of feature implementation within the vibe coding paradiam. To address this gap, we propose FeatBench, a novel benchmark for vibe coding that focuses on feature implementation. Our benchmark is distinguished by several key features: 1. Pure Natural Language Prompts. Task inputs consist solely of abstract natural language descriptions, devoid of any code or structural hints. 2. A Rigorous & Evolving Data Collection Process. FeatBench is built on a multi-level filtering pipeline to ensure quality and a fully automated pipeline to evolve the benchmark, mitigating data contamination. 3. Comprehensive Test Cases. Each task includes Fail-to-Pass (F2P) and Pass-to-Pass (P2P) tests to verify correctness and prevent regressions. 4. Diverse Application Domains. The benchmark includes repositories from diverse domains to ensure it reflects real-world scenarios. We evaluate two state-of-the-art agent frameworks with four leading LLMs on FeatBench. Our evaluation reveals that feature implementation within the vibe coding paradigm is a significant challenge, with the highest success rate of only 29.94%. Our analysis also reveals a tendency for "aggressive implementation," a strategy that paradoxically leads to both critical failures and superior software design. We release FeatBench, our automated collection pipeline, and all experimental results to facilitate further community research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyang Liu, Tao Zhu, Zineng Dong, Yuntian Liu, Qingfeng Guo, Zhaoxuan Liu, Yu Chen, Tao Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statements from natural language into formal languages, has seen significant advancements, yet the development of automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing metrics for formal statement similarity often fail to balance semantic and structural information. String-based approaches capture syntactic structure but ignore semantic meaning, whereas proof-based methods validate semantic equivalence but disregard structural nuances and, critically, provide no graded similarity score in the event of proof failure. To address these issues, we introduce ASSESS (A Semantic and Structural Evaluation Framework for Statement Similarity), which comprehensively integrates semantic and structural information to provide a continuous similarity score. Our framework first transforms formal statements into Operator Trees to capture their syntactic structure and then computes a similarity score using our novel TransTED (Transformation Tree Edit Distance) Similarity metric, which enhances traditional Tree Edit Distance by incorporating semantic awareness through transformations. For rigorous validation, we present EPLA (Evaluating Provability and Likeness for Autoformalization), a new benchmark of 524 expert-annotated formal statement pairs derived from miniF2F and ProofNet, with labels for both semantic provability and structural likeness. Experiments on EPLA demonstrate that TransTED Similarity outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and the highest Kappa coefficient. The benchmark, and implementation code will be made public soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbin Hu, Huihao Jing, Haochen Shi, Haoran Li, Yangqiu Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities, elevating the critical importance of LLM safety. However, existing safety methods rely on ad-hoc taxonomy and lack a rigorous, systematic protection, failing to ensure safety for the nuanced and complex behaviors of modern LLM systems. To address this problem, we solve LLM safety from legal compliance perspectives, named safety compliance. In this work, we posit relevant established legal frameworks as safety standards for defining and measuring safety compliance, including the EU AI Act and GDPR, which serve as core legal frameworks for AI safety and data security in Europe. To bridge the gap between LLM safety and legal compliance, we first develop a new benchmark for safety compliance by generating realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with legal statutes. Subsequently, we align Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization (GRPO) to construct a safety reasoner, Compliance Reasoner, which effectively aligns LLMs with legal standards to mitigate safety risks. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the Compliance Reasoner achieves superior performance on the new benchmark, with average improvements of +10.45% for the EU AI Act and +11.85% for GDPR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifang Zhang, Pengfei Duan, Yiwen Yang, Shengwu Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, the main approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the hallucination issue is incorporating Knowledge Graphs(KGs).However, LLMs typically treat KGs as plain text, extracting only semantic information and limiting their use of the crucial structural aspects of KGs. Another challenge is the gap between the embedding spaces of KGs encoders and LLMs text embeddings, which hinders the effective integration of structured knowledge. To overcome these obstacles, we put forward the SSKG-LLM, an innovative model architecture that is designed to efficiently integrate both the Structural and Semantic information of KGs into the reasoning processes of LLMs. SSKG-LLM incorporates the Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) module and the Knowledge Graph Encoding (KGE) module to preserve semantics while utilizing structure. Then, the Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) module is incorporated to enable LLMs to understand KGs embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments and provide a detailed analysis to explore how incorporating the structural information of KGs can enhance the factual reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code are available at https://github.com/yfangZhang/SSKG-LLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haochen Gong, Chenxiao Li, Rui Chang, Wenbo Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based computer-use agents represent a convergence of AI and OS capabilities, enabling natural language to control system- and application-level functions. However, due to LLMs' inherent uncertainty issues, granting agents control over computers poses significant security risks. When agent actions deviate from user intentions, they can cause irreversible consequences. Existing mitigation approaches, such as user confirmation and LLM-based dynamic action validation, still suffer from limitations in usability, security, and performance. To address these challenges, we propose CSAgent, a system-level, static policy-based access control framework for computer-use agents. To bridge the gap between static policy and dynamic context and user intent, CSAgent introduces intent- and context-aware policies, and provides an automated toolchain to assist developers in constructing and refining them. CSAgent enforces these policies through an optimized OS service, ensuring that agent actions can only be executed under specific user intents and contexts. CSAgent supports protecting agents that control computers through diverse interfaces, including API, CLI, and GUI. We implement and evaluate CSAgent, which successfully defends against more than 99.36% of attacks while introducing only 6.83% performance overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation. To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed, which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.</p>

WIRE also enjoys a host of desirable theoretical properties, including equivariance under node ordering permutation, compatibility with linear attention, and (under select assumptions) asymptotic dependence on graph resistive distance. We test WIRE on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including identifying monochromatic subgraphs, semantic segmentation of point clouds, and more standard graph benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stina Sundstedt, Mattias Wingren, Susanne H\"agglund, Daniel Ventus</p>
<p>Abstract: Preschool children with language vulnerabilities -- such as developmental language disorders or immigration related language challenges -- often require support to strengthen their expressive language skills. Based on the principle of implicit learning, speech-language therapists (SLTs) typically embed target morphological structures (e.g., third person -s) into everyday interactions or game-based learning activities. Educators are recommended by SLTs to do the same. This approach demands precise linguistic knowledge and real-time production of various morphological forms (e.g., "Daddy wears these when he drives to work"). The task becomes even more demanding when educators or parent also must keep children engaged and manage turn-taking in a game-based activity. In the TalBot project our multiprofessional team have developed an application in which the Furhat conversational robot plays the word retrieval game "Alias" with children to improve language skills. Our application currently employs a large language model (LLM) to manage gameplay, dialogue, affective responses, and turn-taking. Our next step is to further leverage the capacity of LLMs so the robot can generate and deliver specific morphological targets during the game. We hypothesize that a robot could outperform humans at this task. Novel aspects of this approach are that the robot could ultimately serve as a model and tutor for both children and professionals and that using LLM capabilities in this context would support basic communication needs for children with language vulnerabilities. Our long-term goal is to create a robust LLM-based Robot-Assisted Language Learning intervention capable of teaching a variety of morphological structures across different languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Wang, Mayank Jobanputra, Ji-Ung Lee, Soyoung Oh, Isabel Valera, Vera Demberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) models often replicate or amplify social bias from training data, raising concerns about fairness. At the same time, their black-box nature makes it difficult for users to recognize biased predictions and for developers to effectively mitigate them. While some studies suggest that input-based explanations can help detect and mitigate bias, others question their reliability in ensuring fairness. Existing research on explainability in fair NLP has been predominantly qualitative, with limited large-scale quantitative analysis. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study of the relationship between explainability and fairness in hate speech detection, focusing on both encoder- and decoder-only models. We examine three key dimensions: (1) identifying biased predictions, (2) selecting fair models, and (3) mitigating bias during model training. Our findings show that input-based explanations can effectively detect biased predictions and serve as useful supervision for reducing bias during training, but they are unreliable for selecting fair models among candidates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonjun Lee, Haon Park, Doehyeon Lee, Bumsub Ham, Suhyun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models, growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models. Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of T2V models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Li, Zheng Yang, Zhongbin Zhou, Feng Xue, Zhonglin Jiang, Wenxiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models (LLMs) deliver exceptional performance and reduced inference costs compared to dense LLMs. However, their large parameter counts result in prohibitive memory requirements, limiting practical deployment. While existing pruning methods primarily focus on expert-level pruning, this coarse granularity often leads to substantial accuracy degradation. In this work, we introduce HEAPr, a novel pruning algorithm that decomposes experts into smaller, indivisible atomic experts, enabling more precise and flexible atomic expert pruning. To measure the importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information based on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address the computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information, HEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the second-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert parameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic expert outputs. This approach reduces the space complexity from $O(d^4)$, where d is the model's dimensionality, to $O(d^2)$. HEAPr requires only two forward passes and one backward pass on a small calibration set to compute the importance of atomic experts. Extensive experiments on MoE models, including DeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE family, demonstrate that HEAPr outperforms existing expert-level pruning methods across a wide range of compression ratios and benchmarks. Specifically, HEAPr achieves nearly lossless compression at compression ratios of 20% ~ 25% in most models, while also reducing FLOPs nearly by 20%.

<p>Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation, their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps (instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with higher fidelity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive results across domains, yet learning an optimal policy typically requires extensive interaction data, limiting practical deployment. A common remedy is to leverage priors, such as pre-collected datasets or reference policies, but their utility degrades under task mismatch between training and deployment. While prior work has sought to address this mismatch, it has largely been restricted to in-distribution settings. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Policy Backbone (APB), a meta-transfer RL method that inserts lightweight linear layers before and after a shared backbone, thereby enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) while preserving prior knowledge during adaptation. Our results show that APB improves sample efficiency over standard RL and adapts to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks where existing meta-RL baselines typically fail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunwoo Kim, Junha Lee, Mincheol Choi, Jeonghwan Lee, Jaeshin Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models have become increasingly large and complex, resulting in higher memory consumption and computational demands. Consequently, model loading times and initial inference latency have increased, posing significant challenges in mobile and latency-sensitive environments where frequent model loading and unloading are required, which directly impacts user experience. While Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing large teacher models into smaller student ones, it often comes at the cost of reduced performance. To address this trade-off, we propose Progressive Weight Loading (PWL), a novel technique that enables fast initial inference by first deploying a lightweight student model, then incrementally replacing its layers with those of a pre-trained teacher model. To support seamless layer substitution, we introduce a training method that not only aligns intermediate feature representations between student and teacher layers, but also improves the overall output performance of the student model. Our experiments on VGG, ResNet, and ViT architectures demonstrate that models trained with PWL maintain competitive distillation performance and gradually improve accuracy as teacher layers are loaded-matching the final accuracy of the full teacher model without compromising initial inference speed. This makes PWL particularly suited for dynamic, resource-constrained deployments where both responsiveness and performance are critical.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) algorithms typically focus on mapping visual features to semantic labels or attempt to enhance learning by fusing visual and attribute information. However, these methods fail to fully exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information for more accurate recognition. Although recent works have started to consider using attribute text as additional input to enhance the association between visual and semantic information, these methods are still in their infancy. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes the construction of a multi-modal knowledge graph, which is utilized to mine the relationships between local visual features and text, as well as the relationships between attributes and extensive visual context samples. Specifically, we propose an effective multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that fully considers the relationships among attributes and the relationships between attributes and vision tokens. To effectively model these relationships, this paper introduces a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance the standard pedestrian attribute recognition framework. Comprehensive experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph for the PAR task, establishing a strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition.

We show that this failure is preceded by Hessian spectral collapse at new-task initialization, where meaningful curvature directions vanish and gradient descent becomes ineffective. To characterize the necessary condition for successful training, we introduce the notion of $\tau$-trainability and show that current plasticity preserving algorithms can be unified under this framework. Targeting spectral collapse directly, we then discuss the Kronecker factored approximation of the Hessian, which motivates two regularization enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying $L2$ penalties. Experiments on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks confirm that combining these two regularizers effectively preserves plasticity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Vossel, Till Mossakowski, Bj\"orn Gehrke</p>
<p>Abstract: Automating the translation of natural language to first-order logic (FOL) is crucial for knowledge representation and formal methods, yet remains challenging. We present a systematic evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs for this task, comparing architectures (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and training strategies. Using the MALLS and Willow datasets, we explore techniques like vocabulary extension, predicate conditioning, and multilingual training, introducing metrics for exact match, logical equivalence, and predicate alignment. Our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate lists, outperforming GPT-4o and even the DeepSeek-R1-0528 model with CoT reasoning ability as well as symbolic systems like ccg2lambda. Key findings show: (1) predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%, (2) T5 models surpass larger decoder-only LLMs, and (3) models generalize to unseen logical arguments (FOLIO dataset) without specific training. While structural logic translation proves robust, predicate extraction emerges as the main bottleneck.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amit Roy, Abulhair Saparov</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning capability is essential to ensure the factual correctness of the responses of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), and robust reasoning about transitive relations is instrumental in many settings, such as causal inference. Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of transformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A causes B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive relations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g., knowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then there is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can learn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input prompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from training examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this study, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train transformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer transitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that transformers are capable of learning connectivity on "grid-like'' directed graphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and connectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that the dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of transformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional grid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In addition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly better generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs. However, if the graph is not a grid graph and contains many disconnected components, transformers struggle to learn the connectivity task, especially when the number of components is large.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marie Brockschmidt, Maresa Schr\"oder, Stefan Feuerriegel</p>
<p>Abstract: Survival analysis is a cornerstone of clinical research by modeling time-to-event outcomes such as metastasis, disease relapse, or patient death. Unlike standard tabular data, survival data often come with incomplete event information due to dropout, or loss to follow-up. This poses unique challenges for synthetic data generation, where it is crucial for clinical research to faithfully reproduce both the event-time distribution and the censoring mechanism. In this paper, we propose SurvDiff, an end-to-end diffusion model specifically designed for generating synthetic data in survival analysis. SurvDiff is tailored to capture the data-generating mechanism by jointly generating mixed-type covariates, event times, and right-censoring, guided by a survival-tailored loss function. The loss encodes the time-to-event structure and directly optimizes for downstream survival tasks, which ensures that SurvDiff (i) reproduces realistic event-time distributions and (ii) preserves the censoring mechanism. Across multiple datasets, we show that \survdiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in both distributional fidelity and downstream evaluation metrics across multiple medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, SurvDiff is the first diffusion model explicitly designed for generating synthetic survival data.</p>

<p>Abstract: The capability of predicting environmental dynamics underpins both biological neural systems and general embodied AI in adapting to their surroundings. Yet prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge; and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce stochastic activations. This novel strategy randomly selects between several non-linear functions in the feed-forward layer of a large language model. In particular, we choose between SILU or RELU depending on a Bernoulli draw. This strategy circumvents the optimization problem associated with RELU, namely, the constant shape for negative inputs that prevents the gradient flow. We leverage this strategy in two ways:
  (1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model with RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors. This reduces the inference FLOPs and translates into a significant speedup in the CPU. Interestingly, this leads to much better results than training from scratch with the RELU activation function.
  (2) We evaluate stochastic activations for generation. This strategy performs reasonably well: it is only slightly inferior to the best deterministic non-linearity, namely SILU combined with temperature scaling. This offers an alternative to existing strategies by providing a controlled way to increase the diversity of the generated text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob B. Landsberg, Elizabeth A. Barnes</p>
<p>Abstract: AI-based climate and weather models have rapidly gained popularity, providing faster forecasts with skill that can match or even surpass that of traditional dynamical models. Despite this success, these models face a key challenge: predicting future climates while being trained only with historical data. In this study, we investigate this issue by analyzing boreal winter land temperature biases in AI weather and climate models. We examine two weather models, FourCastNet V2 Small (FourCastNet) and Pangu Weather (Pangu), evaluating their predictions for 2020-2025 and Ai2 Climate Emulator version 2 (ACE2) for 1996-2010. These time periods lie outside of the respective models' training sets and are significantly more recent than the bulk of their training data, allowing us to assess how well the models generalize to new, i.e. more modern, conditions. We find that all three models produce cold-biased mean temperatures, resembling climates from 15-20 years earlier than the period they are predicting. In some regions, like the Eastern U.S., the predictions resemble climates from as much as 20-30 years earlier. Further analysis shows that FourCastNet's and Pangu's cold bias is strongest in the hottest predicted temperatures, indicating limited training exposure to modern extreme heat events. In contrast, ACE2's bias is more evenly distributed but largest in regions, seasons, and parts of the temperature distribution where climate change has been most pronounced. These findings underscore the challenge of training AI models exclusively on historical data and highlight the need to account for such biases when applying them to future climate prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niharika Hegde, Subarnaduti Paul, Lars Joel-Frey, Manuel Brack, Kristian Kersting, Martin Mundt, Patrick Schramowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at operating at scale by leveraging social media and various data crawled from the web. Whereas existing corpora are diverse, their frequent lack of long-term temporal structure may however limit an LLM's ability to contextualize semantic and normative evolution of language and to capture diachronic variation. To support analysis and training for the latter, we introduce CHRONOBERG, a temporally structured corpus of English book texts spanning 250 years, curated from Project Gutenberg and enriched with a variety of temporal annotations. First, the edited nature of books enables us to quantify lexical semantic change through time-sensitive Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) analysis and to construct historically calibrated affective lexicons to support temporally grounded interpretation. With the lexicons at hand, we demonstrate a need for modern LLM-based tools to better situate their detection of discriminatory language and contextualization of sentiment across various time-periods. In fact, we show how language models trained sequentially on CHRONOBERG struggle to encode diachronic shifts in meaning, emphasizing the need for temporally aware training and evaluation pipelines, and positioning CHRONOBERG as a scalable resource for the study of linguistic change and temporal generalization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanise Ceron, Dmitry Nikolaev, Dominik Stammbach, Debora Nozza</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to generate politically biased text, yet how such biases arise remains unclear. A crucial step toward answering this question is the analysis of training data, whose political content remains largely underexplored in current LLM research. To address this gap, we present in this paper an analysis of the pre- and post-training corpora of OLMO2, the largest fully open-source model released together with its complete dataset. From these corpora, we draw large random samples, automatically annotate documents for political orientation, and analyze their source domains and content. We then assess how political content in the training data correlates with models' stance on specific policy issues. Our analysis shows that left-leaning documents predominate across datasets, with pre-training corpora containing significantly more politically engaged content than post-training data. We also find that left- and right-leaning documents frame similar topics through distinct values and sources of legitimacy. Finally, the predominant stance in the training data strongly correlates with models' political biases when evaluated on policy issues. These findings underscore the need to integrate political content analysis into future data curation pipelines as well as in-depth documentation of filtering strategies for transparency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Zhao, Dian Jin, Zijing Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Image-to-Music (I2M) generation has garnered significant attention, with potential applications in fields such as gaming, advertising, and multi-modal art creation. However, due to the ambiguous and subjective nature of I2M tasks, most end-to-end methods lack interpretability, leaving users puzzled about the generation results. Even methods based on emotion mapping face controversy, as emotion represents only a singular aspect of art. Additionally, most learning-based methods require substantial computational resources and large datasets for training, hindering accessibility for common users. To address these challenges, we propose the first Vision Language Model (VLM)-based I2M framework that offers high interpretability and low computational cost. Specifically, we utilize ABC notation to bridge the text and music modalities, enabling the VLM to generate music using natural language. We then apply multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and self-refinement techniques to allow the VLM to produce high-quality music without external training. Furthermore, we leverage the generated motivations in text and the attention maps from the VLM to provide explanations for the generated results in both text and image modalities. To validate our method, we conduct both human studies and machine evaluations, where our method outperforms others in terms of music quality and music-image consistency, indicating promising results.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22387">SpinGPT: A Large-Language-Model Approach to Playing Poker Correctly</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Narada Maugin, Tristan Cazenave</p>
<p>Abstract: The Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm and its variants have enabled the development of pokerbots capable of beating the best human players in heads-up (1v1) cash games and competing with them in six-player formats. However, CFR's computational complexity rises exponentially with the number of players. Furthermore, in games with three or more players, following Nash equilibrium no longer guarantees a non-losing outcome. These limitations, along with others, significantly restrict the applicability of CFR to the most popular formats: tournaments. Motivated by the recent success of Large Language Models (LLM) in chess and Diplomacy, we present SpinGPT, the first LLM tailored to Spin & Go, a popular three-player online poker format. SpinGPT is trained in two stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning on 320k high-stakes expert decisions; (2) Reinforcement Learning on 270k solver-generated hands. Our results show that SpinGPT matches the solver's actions in 78% of decisions (tolerant accuracy). With a simple deep-stack heuristic, it achieves 13.4 +/- 12.9 BB/100 versus Slumbot in heads-up over 30,000 hands (95% CI). These results suggest that LLMs could be a new way to deal with multi-player imperfect-information games like poker.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a patch-based 3D nnUNet adaptation for MR to CT and CBCT to CT image translation using the multicenter SynthRAD2025 dataset, covering head and neck (HN), thorax (TH), and abdomen (AB) regions. Our approach leverages two main network configurations: a standard UNet and a residual UNet, both adapted from nnUNet for image synthesis. The Anatomical Feature-Prioritized (AFP) loss was introduced, which compares multilayer features extracted from a compact segmentation network trained on TotalSegmentator labels, enhancing reconstruction of clinically relevant structures. Input volumes were normalized per-case using zscore normalization for MRIs, and clipping plus dataset level zscore normalization for CBCT and CT. Training used 3D patches tailored to each anatomical region without additional data augmentation. Models were trained for 1000 and 1500 epochs, with AFP fine-tuning performed for 500 epochs using a combined L1+AFP objective. During inference, overlapping patches were aggregated via mean averaging with step size of 0.3, and postprocessing included reverse zscore normalization. Both network configurations were applied across all regions, allowing consistent model design while capturing local adaptations through residual learning and AFP loss. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation revealed that residual networks combined with AFP yielded sharper reconstructions and improved anatomical fidelity, particularly for bone structures in MR to CT and lesions in CBCT to CT, while L1only networks achieved slightly better intensity-based metrics. This methodology provides a stable solution for cross modality medical image synthesis, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining the automatic nnUNet pipeline with residual learning and anatomically guided feature losses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly, its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated clinical workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Liang, Ruoyu Chen, Xianghao Jiao, Siyuan Liang, Shiming Liu, Qunli Zhang, Zheng Hu, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality, attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch, we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC), which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained explanations of model behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a memory- and compute-efficient method for low-communication distributed training. Existing methods reduce communication by performing multiple local updates between infrequent global synchronizations. We demonstrate that their efficiency can be significantly improved by restricting backpropagation: instead of updating all the parameters, each node updates only a fixed subset while keeping the remainder frozen during local steps. This constraint substantially reduces peak memory usage and training FLOPs, while a full forward pass over all parameters eliminates the need for cross-node activation exchange. Experiments on a $1.3$B-parameter language model trained across $32$ nodes show that our method matches the perplexity of prior low-communication approaches under identical token and bandwidth budgets while reducing training FLOPs and peak memory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Margherita Martorana, Francesca Urgese, Ilaria Tiddi, Stefan Schlobach</p>
<p>Abstract: Personal service robots are increasingly used in domestic settings to assist older adults and people requiring support. Effective operation involves not only physical interaction but also the ability to interpret dynamic environments, understand tasks, and choose appropriate actions based on context. This requires integrating both hardware components (e.g. sensors, actuators) and software systems capable of reasoning about tasks, environments, and robot capabilities. Frameworks such as the Robot Operating System (ROS) provide open-source tools that help connect low-level hardware with higher-level functionalities. However, real-world deployments remain tightly coupled to specific platforms. As a result, solutions are often isolated and hard-coded, limiting interoperability, reusability, and knowledge sharing. Ontologies and knowledge graphs offer a structured way to represent tasks, environments, and robot capabilities. Existing ontologies, such as the Socio-physical Model of Activities (SOMA) and the Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE), provide models for activities, spatial relationships, and reasoning structures. However, they often focus on specific domains and do not fully capture the connection between environment, action, robot capabilities, and system-level integration. In this work, we propose the Ontology for roBOts and acTions (OntoBOT), which extends existing ontologies to provide a unified representation of tasks, actions, environments, and capabilities. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we unify these aspects into a cohesive ontology to support formal reasoning about task execution, and (2) we demonstrate its generalizability by evaluating competency questions across four embodied agents - TIAGo, HSR, UR3, and Stretch - showing how OntoBOT enables context-aware reasoning, task-oriented execution, and knowledge sharing in service robotics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianxiang Gao, Siyuan Sun, Hailiang Liu, Hongyang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been successful in various applications due to their continuous nature and parameter-sharing efficiency. However, these unique characteristics also introduce challenges in training, particularly with respect to gradient computation accuracy and convergence analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by investigating the impact of activation functions. We demonstrate that the properties of activation functions, specifically smoothness and nonlinearity, are critical to the training dynamics. Smooth activation functions guarantee globally unique solutions for both forward and backward ODEs, while sufficient nonlinearity is essential for maintaining the spectral properties of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) during training. Together, these properties enable us to establish the global convergence of Neural ODEs under gradient descent in overparameterized regimes. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments, which not only support our analysis but also provide practical guidelines for scaling Neural ODEs, potentially leading to faster training and improved performance in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziheng Chi, Yifan Hou, Chenxi Pang, Shaobo Cui, Mubashara Akhtar, Mrinmaya Sachan</p>
<p>Abstract: Diagrams convey symbolic information in a visual format rather than a linear stream of words, making them especially challenging for AI models to process. While recent evaluations suggest that vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on diagram-related benchmarks, their reliance on knowledge, reasoning, or modality shortcuts raises concerns about whether they genuinely understand and reason over diagrams. To address this gap, we introduce Chimera, a comprehensive test suite comprising 7,500 high-quality diagrams sourced from Wikipedia; each diagram is annotated with its symbolic content represented by semantic triples along with multi-level questions designed to assess four fundamental aspects of diagram comprehension: entity recognition, relation understanding, knowledge grounding, and visual reasoning. We use Chimera to measure the presence of three types of shortcuts in visual question answering: (1) the visual-memorization shortcut, where VLMs rely on memorized visual patterns; (2) the knowledge-recall shortcut, where models leverage memorized factual knowledge instead of interpreting the diagram; and (3) the Clever-Hans shortcut, where models exploit superficial language patterns or priors without true comprehension. We evaluate 15 open-source VLMs from 7 model families on Chimera and find that their seemingly strong performance largely stems from shortcut behaviors: visual-memorization shortcuts have slight impact, knowledge-recall shortcuts play a moderate role, and Clever-Hans shortcuts contribute significantly. These findings expose critical limitations in current VLMs and underscore the need for more robust evaluation protocols that benchmark genuine comprehension of complex visual inputs (e.g., diagrams) rather than question-answering shortcuts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pei Xu, Zhen Wu, Ruocheng Wang, Vishnu Sarukkai, Kayvon Fatahalian, Ioannis Karamouzas, Victor Zordan, C. Karen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning a control policy for a multi-phase, long-horizon task, such as basketball maneuvers, remains challenging for reinforcement learning approaches due to the need for seamless policy composition and transitions between skills. A long-horizon task typically consists of distinct subtasks with well-defined goals, separated by transitional subtasks with unclear goals but critical to the success of the entire task. Existing methods like the mixture of experts and skill chaining struggle with tasks where individual policies do not share significant commonly explored states or lack well-defined initial and terminal states between different phases. In this paper, we introduce a novel policy integration framework to enable the composition of drastically different motor skills in multi-phase long-horizon tasks with ill-defined intermediate states. Based on that, we further introduce a high-level soft router to enable seamless and robust transitions between the subtasks. We evaluate our framework on a set of fundamental basketball skills and challenging transitions. Policies trained by our approach can effectively control the simulated character to interact with the ball and accomplish the long-horizon task specified by real-time user commands, without relying on ball trajectory references.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Shaw, James Cohan, Jacob Eisenstein, Kristina Toutanova</p>
<p>Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle offers a formal framework for applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled, universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization, highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changhun Kim, Timon Conrad, Redwanul Karim, Julian Oelhaf, David Riebesel, Tom\'as Arias-Vergara, Andreas Maier, Johann J\"ager, Siming Bayer</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-informed graph neural networks (PIGNNs) have emerged as fast AC power-flow solvers that can replace classic Newton--Raphson (NR) solvers, especially when thousands of scenarios must be evaluated. However, current PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption. We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases, capturing the grid's anisotropy, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of 4--32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage and 0.08$^\circ$ in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5\% and 87.1\%, respectively. With streaming micro-batches, it delivers 2--5$\times$ faster batched inference than NR on 4--1024-bus grids.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability to reason from audio, including speech, paralinguistic cues, environmental sounds, and music, is essential for AI agents to interact effectively in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on static or single-scene settings and do not fully capture scenarios where multiple speakers, unfolding events, and heterogeneous audio sources interact. To address these challenges, we introduce MDAR, a benchmark for evaluating models on complex, multi-scene, and dynamically evolving audio reasoning tasks. MDAR comprises 3,000 carefully curated question-answer pairs linked to diverse audio clips, covering five categories of complex reasoning and spanning three question types. We benchmark 26 state-of-the-art audio language models on MDAR and observe that they exhibit limitations in complex reasoning tasks. On single-choice questions, Qwen2.5-Omni (open-source) achieves 76.67% accuracy, whereas GPT-4o Audio (closed-source) reaches 68.47%; however, GPT-4o Audio substantially outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni on the more challenging multiple-choice and open-ended tasks. Across all three question types, no model achieves 80% performance. These findings underscore the unique challenges posed by MDAR and its value as a benchmark for advancing audio reasoning research.Code and benchmark can be found at https://github.com/luckyerr/MDAR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boshra Ariguib, Mathias Niepert, Andrei Manolache</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality molecular representations are essential for property prediction and molecular design, yet large labeled datasets remain scarce. While self-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many existing approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex generative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable 3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce C-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework that integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns molecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their complementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as modeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate both geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or expensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich 3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on MoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal self-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and molecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to new chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antreas Ioannou, Andreas Shiamishis, Nora Hollenstein, Nezihe Merve G\"urel</p>
<p>Abstract: In an era dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), understanding their capabilities and limitations, especially in high-stakes fields like law, is crucial. While LLMs such as Meta's LLaMA, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, DeepSeek, and other emerging models are increasingly integrated into legal workflows, their performance in multilingual, jurisdictionally diverse, and adversarial contexts remains insufficiently explored. This work evaluates LLaMA and Gemini on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks, and assesses their adversarial robustness in legal tasks through character and word-level perturbations. We use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation. We moreover present an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline designed to support multilingual, task-diverse benchmarking of any combination of LLMs and datasets, with a particular focus on legal tasks, including classification, summarization, open questions, and general reasoning. Our findings confirm that legal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below 50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on general-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields more stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt sensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across languages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a language and its syntactic similarity to English. We also observe that LLaMA is weaker than Gemini, with the latter showing an average advantage of about 24 percentage points across the same task. Despite improvements in newer LLMs, challenges remain in deploying them reliably for critical, multilingual legal applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Li, Kaiqi Yang, Yucheng Chu, Hui Liu, Jiliang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for problem-solving tasks. Most recent work improves their performance through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with labeled data or reinforcement learning (RL) from task feedback. In this paper, we study a new perspective: the divergence in solutions generated by LLMs for a single problem. We show that higher solution divergence is positively related to better problem-solving abilities across various models. Based on this finding, we propose solution divergence as a novel metric that can support both SFT and RL strategies. We test this idea on three representative problem domains and find that using solution divergence consistently improves success rates. These results suggest that solution divergence is a simple but effective tool for advancing LLM training and evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sadia Asif, Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models deployed in sensitive applications increasingly require the ability to unlearn specific knowledge, such as user requests, copyrighted materials, or outdated information, without retraining from scratch to ensure regulatory compliance, user privacy, and safety. This task, known as machine unlearning, aims to remove the influence of targeted data (forgetting) while maintaining performance on the remaining data (retention). A common approach is to formulate this as a multi-objective problem and reduce it to a single-objective problem via scalarization, where forgetting and retention losses are combined using a weighted sum. However, this often results in unstable training dynamics and degraded model utility due to conflicting gradient directions. To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a penalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes forgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our method enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a similarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and retention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step. To ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our approach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model utility compared to prior methods. Extensive experiments across vision and language benchmarks demonstrate that OFMU consistently outperforms existing unlearning methods in both forgetting efficacy and retained utility.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a machine learning pipeline for biomarker discovery in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), integrating eight publicly available microarray datasets from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC). After robust preprocessing we trained an XGBoost classifier optimized via Bayesian search. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to identify key features for model prediction, indicating thus possible biomarkers. These were compared with genes identified through classical Differential Expression Analysis (DEA). Our comparison revealed both overlapping and unique biomarkers between SHAP and DEA, suggesting complementary strengths. Enrichment analysis confirmed the biological relevance of SHAP-selected genes, linking them to pathways such as sphingolipid signaling, Th1/Th2/Th17 cell differentiation, and Epstein-Barr virus infection all known to be associated with MS. This study highlights the value of combining explainable AI (xAI) with traditional statistical methods to gain deeper insights into disease mechanism.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mutual understanding of artificial agents' decisions is key to ensuring a trustworthy and successful human-robot interaction. Hence, robots are expected to make reasonable decisions and communicate them to humans when needed. In this article, the focus is on an approach to modeling and reasoning about the comparison of two competing plans, so that robots can later explain the divergent result. First, a novel ontological model is proposed to formalize and reason about the differences between competing plans, enabling the classification of the most appropriate one (e.g., the shortest, the safest, the closest to human preferences, etc.). This work also investigates the limitations of a baseline algorithm for ontology-based explanatory narration. To address these limitations, a novel algorithm is presented, leveraging divergent knowledge between plans and facilitating the construction of contrastive narratives. Through empirical evaluation, it is observed that the explanations excel beyond the baseline method.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI-powered companion chatbots (AICCs) such as Replika are increasingly popular, offering empathetic interactions, yet their psychosocial impacts remain unclear. We examined how engaging with AICCs shaped wellbeing and how users perceived these experiences. First, we conducted a large-scale quasi-experimental study of longitudinal Reddit data, applying stratified propensity score matching and Difference-in-Differences regression. Findings revealed mixed effects -- greater affective and grief expression, readability, and interpersonal focus, alongside increases in language about loneliness and suicidal ideation. Second, we complemented these results with 15 semi-structured interviews, which we thematically analyzed and contextualized using Knapp's relationship development model. We identified trajectories of initiation, escalation, and bonding, wherein AICCs provided emotional validation and social rehearsal but also carried risks of over-reliance and withdrawal. Triangulating across methods, we offer design implications for AI companions that scaffold healthy boundaries, support mindful engagement, support disclosure without dependency, and surface relationship stages -- maximizing psychosocial benefits while mitigating risks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a major barrier to innovation. While FP8 training offers a promising solution with significant theoretical efficiency gains, its widespread adoption has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive, open-source training recipe. To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a 160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16 baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize large-scale model training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Workplace negotiations are undermined by psychological barriers, which can even derail well-prepared tactics. AI offers personalized and always -- available negotiation coaching, yet its effectiveness for negotiation preparedness remains unclear. We built Trucey, a prototype AI coach grounded in Brett's negotiation model. We conducted a between-subjects experiment (N=267), comparing Trucey, ChatGPT, and a traditional negotiation Handbook, followed by in-depth interviews (N=15). While Trucey showed the strongest reductions in fear relative to both comparison conditions, the Handbook outperformed both AIs in usability and psychological empowerment. Interviews revealed that the Handbook's comprehensive, reviewable content was crucial for participants' confidence and preparedness. In contrast, although participants valued AI's rehearsal capability, its guidance often felt verbose and fragmented -- delivered in bits and pieces that required additional effort -- leaving them uncertain or overwhelmed. These findings challenge assumptions of AI superiority and motivate hybrid designs that integrate structured, theory-driven content with targeted rehearsal, clear boundaries, and adaptive scaffolds to address psychological barriers and support negotiation preparedness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantum generative models based on instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits show great promise in learning complex distributions while maintaining classical trainability. However, current implementations suffer from two key limitations: lack of controllability over generated outputs and severe generation bias towards certain expected patterns. We present a Controllable Quantum Generative Framework, ConQuER, which addresses both challenges through a modular circuit architecture. ConQuER embeds a lightweight controller circuit that can be directly combined with pre-trained IQP circuits to precisely control the output distribution without full retraining. Leveraging the advantages of IQP, our scheme enables precise control over properties such as the Hamming Weight distribution with minimal parameter and gate overhead. In addition, inspired by the controller design, we extend this modular approach through data-driven optimization to embed implicit control paths in the underlying IQP architecture, significantly reducing generation bias on structured datasets. ConQuER retains efficient classical training properties and high scalability. We experimentally validate ConQuER on multiple quantum state datasets, demonstrating its superior control accuracy and balanced generation performance, only with very low overhead cost over original IQP circuits. Our framework bridges the gap between the advantages of quantum computing and the practical needs of controllable generation modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lute Lillo, Nick Cheney</p>
<p>Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings: (i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Asynchronous patient-clinician messaging via EHR portals is a growing source of clinician workload, prompting interest in large language models (LLMs) to assist with draft responses. However, LLM outputs may contain clinical inaccuracies, omissions, or tone mismatches, making robust evaluation essential. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a clinically grounded error ontology comprising 5 domains and 59 granular error codes, developed through inductive coding and expert adjudication; (2) we develop a retrieval-augmented evaluation pipeline (RAEC) that leverages semantically similar historical message-response pairs to improve judgment quality; and (3) we provide a two-stage prompting architecture using DSPy to enable scalable, interpretable, and hierarchical error detection. Our approach assesses the quality of drafts both in isolation and with reference to similar past message-response pairs retrieved from institutional archives. Using a two-stage DSPy pipeline, we compared baseline and reference-enhanced evaluations on over 1,500 patient messages. Retrieval context improved error identification in domains such as clinical completeness and workflow appropriateness. Human validation on 100 messages demonstrated superior agreement (concordance = 50% vs. 33%) and performance (F1 = 0.500 vs. 0.256) of context-enhanced labels vs. baseline, supporting the use of our RAEC pipeline as AI guardrails for patient messaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Tenedini, Riccardo Zamboni, Mirco Mutti, Marcello Restelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite its recent successes, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is notoriously sample-inefficient. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the standard practice of optimizing policies directly in the high-dimensional and highly redundant parameter space $\Theta$. This challenge is greatly compounded in multi-task settings. In this work, we develop a novel, unsupervised approach that compresses the policy parameter space $\Theta$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\mathcal{Z}$. We train a generative model $g:\mathcal{Z}\to\Theta$ by optimizing a behavioral reconstruction loss, which ensures that the latent space is organized by functional similarity rather than proximity in parameterization. We conjecture that the inherent dimensionality of this manifold is a function of the environment's complexity, rather than the size of the policy network. We validate our approach in continuous control domains, showing that the parameterization of standard policy networks can be compressed up to five orders of magnitude while retaining most of its expressivity. As a byproduct, we show that the learned manifold enables task-specific adaptation via Policy Gradient operating in the latent space $\mathcal{Z}$.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks, yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL) recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL. At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth. To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb over-confidence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junkang Wu, Kexin Huang, Jiancan Wu, An Zhang, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) strengthens LLM reasoning, but training often oscillates between {entropy collapse} and {entropy explosion}. We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in value-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes negative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile Advantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile baseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <= 1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it targets remaining failures. Under first-order softmax updates, we prove {two-sided entropy safety}, giving lower and upper bounds on one-step entropy change that curb explosion and prevent collapse. Empirically, this minimal modification stabilizes entropy, sparsifies credit assignment (with tuned K, roughly 80% of responses receive zero advantage), and yields sustained pass@1 gains on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023. These results identify {baseline design} -- rather than token-level heuristics -- as the primary mechanism for scaling RLVR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasmine Omri, Connor Ding, Tsachy Weissman, Thierry Tambe</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii) patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about 97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission efficient for edge cloud learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aayush Mishra, Daniel Khashabi, Anqi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to specialize model behavior by training weights to produce intended target responses for queries. In contrast, In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions or demonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and more calibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost of more inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internal computations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICL and SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods achieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this observation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation Alignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning. Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy and calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results on 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only practically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner mechanics of model adaptation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We provide a theoretical analysis for end-to-end training Discrete Flow Matching (DFM) generative models. DFM is a promising discrete generative modeling framework that learns the underlying generative dynamics by training a neural network to approximate the transformative velocity field. Our analysis establishes a clear chain of guarantees by decomposing the final distribution estimation error. We first prove that the total variation distance between the generated and target distributions is controlled by the risk of the learned velocity field. We then bound this risk by analyzing its two primary sources: (i) Approximation Error, where we quantify the capacity of the Transformer architecture to represent the true velocity, and (ii) Estimation Error, where we derive statistical convergence rates that bound the error from training on a finite dataset. By composing these results, we provide the first formal proof that the distribution generated by a trained DFM model provably converges to the true data distribution as the training set size increases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Futuhi, Nathan R. Sturtevant</p>
<p>Abstract: Heuristic functions are central to the performance of search algorithms such as A-star, where admissibility - the property of never overestimating the true shortest-path cost - guarantees solution optimality. Recent deep learning approaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees on generalization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of these limitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimization problem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function that enforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this method yields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance than compressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study the sample complexity of learning heuristics. By leveraging PDB abstractions and the structural properties of graphs such as the Rubik's Cube, we tighten the bound on the number of training samples needed for A-star to generalize. Replacing a general hypothesis class with a ReLU neural network gives bounds that depend primarily on the network's width and depth, rather than on graph size. Using the same network, we also provide the first generalization guarantees for goal-dependent heuristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Shen, Yingfa Chen, Zhen Leng Thai, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: While Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable language modeling performance, their high complexities result in high costs when processing long contexts. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as linear attention and state space models have gained popularity due to their constant per-token complexities. However, these recurrent models struggle with tasks that require accurate recall of contextual information from long contexts, because all contextual information is compressed into a constant-size recurrent state. Previous works have shown that recall ability is positively correlated with the recurrent state size, yet directly training RNNs with larger recurrent states results in high training costs. In this paper, we introduce StateX, a training pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNs through post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention and state space models, we design post-training architectural modifications to scale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters. Experiments on models up to 1.3B parameters demonstrate that StateX efficiently enhances the recall and in-context learning ability of RNNs without incurring high post-training costs or compromising other capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gen Li, Yuling Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), which learns a reward model from human preference data and then optimizes a policy to favor preferred responses, has emerged as a central paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. In this paper, we investigate exploration principles for online RLHF, where one seeks to adaptively collect new preference data to refine both the reward model and the policy in a data-efficient manner. By examining existing optimism-based exploration algorithms, we identify a drawback in their sampling protocol: they tend to gather comparisons that fail to reduce the most informative uncertainties in reward differences, and we prove lower bounds showing that such methods can incur linear regret over exponentially long horizons. Motivated by this insight, we propose a new exploration scheme that directs preference queries toward reducing uncertainty in reward differences most relevant to policy improvement. Under a multi-armed bandit model of RLHF, we establish regret bounds of order $T^{(\beta+1)/(\beta+2)}$, where $\beta>0$ is a hyperparameter that balances reward maximization against mitigating distribution shift. To our knowledge, this is the first online RLHF algorithm with regret scaling polynomially in all model parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangxin Zhou, Zichen Liu, Haonan Wang, Chao Du, Min Lin, Chongxuan Li, Liang Wang, Tianyu Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a variational reasoning framework for language models that treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through variational inference. Starting from the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we extend it to a multi-trace objective for tighter bounds and propose a forward-KL formulation that stabilizes the training of the variational posterior. We further show that rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL, including GRPO, can be interpreted as local forward-KL objectives, where an implicit weighting by model accuracy naturally arises from the derivation and reveals a previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions. We empirically validate our method on the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides a principled probabilistic perspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields stable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renjie Luo, Zichen Liu, Xiangyan Liu, Chao Du, Min Lin, Wenhu Chen, Wei Lu, Tianyu Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methods typically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much of their richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbal feedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image generation, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the feedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback pairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum likelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping stage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh feedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more expressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arkadiy Saakyan, Najoung Kim, Smaranda Muresan, Tuhin Chakrabarty</p>
<p>Abstract: N-gram novelty is widely used to evaluate language models' ability to generate text outside of their training data. More recently, it has also been adopted as a metric for measuring textual creativity. However, theoretical work on creativity suggests that this approach may be inadequate, as it does not account for creativity's dual nature: novelty (how original the text is) and appropriateness (how sensical and pragmatic it is). We investigate the relationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542 expert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality via close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gram novelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% of top-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative, cautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone. Furthermore, unlike human-written text, higher n-gram novelty in open-source LLMs correlates with lower pragmaticality. In an exploratory study with frontier close-source models, we additionally confirm that they are less likely to produce creative expressions than humans. Using our dataset, we test whether zero-shot, few-shot, and finetuned models are able to identify creative expressions (a positive aspect of writing) and non-pragmatic ones (a negative aspect). Overall, frontier LLMs exhibit performance much higher than random but leave room for improvement, especially struggling to identify non-pragmatic expressions. We further find that LLM-as-a-Judge novelty scores from the best-performing model were predictive of expert writer preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zimu Lu, Houxing Ren, Yunqiao Yang, Ke Wang, Zhuofan Zong, Junting Pan, Mingjie Zhan, Hongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on repository-level code-generation tasks. However, for tasks such as website codebase generation, which depend heavily on visual effects and user-interaction feedback, current code agents rely only on simple code execution for feedback and verification. This approach fails to capture the actual quality of the generated code. In this paper, we propose WebGen-Agent, a novel website-generation agent that leverages comprehensive and multi-level visual feedback to iteratively generate and refine the website codebase. Detailed and expressive text descriptions and suggestions regarding the screenshots and GUI-agent testing of the websites are generated by a visual language model (VLM), together with scores that quantify their quality. The screenshot and GUI-agent scores are further integrated with a backtracking and select-best mechanism, enhancing the performance of the agent. Utilizing the accurate visual scores inherent in the WebGen-Agent workflow, we further introduce \textit{Step-GRPO with Screenshot and GUI-agent Feedback} to improve the ability of LLMs to act as the reasoning engine of WebGen-Agent. By using the screenshot and GUI-agent scores at each step as the reward in Step-GRPO, we provide a dense and reliable process supervision signal, which effectively improves the model's website-generation ability. On the WebGen-Bench dataset, WebGen-Agent increases the accuracy of Claude-3.5-Sonnet from 26.4% to 51.9% and its appearance score from 3.0 to 3.9, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art agent system. Additionally, our Step-GRPO training approach increases the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct from 38.9% to 45.4% and raises the appearance score from 3.4 to 3.7.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22645">Hierarchical Representation Matching for CLIP-based Class-Incremental Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen-Hao Wen, Yan Wang, Ji Feng, Han-Jia Ye, De-Chuan Zhan, Da-Wei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as "a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details. Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons? While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension -- whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e., spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises 4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by 34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation. Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s. real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest). By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Xing, Xiaoyi Dong, Yuhang Zang, Yuhang Cao, Jianze Liang, Qidong Huang, Jiaqi Wang, Feng Wu, Dahua Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning. A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks and brains both learn and share superficial similarities: processing nodes are likened to neurons and adjustable weights are likened to modifiable synapses. But can a unified theoretical framework be found to underlie them both? Here we show that the equations used to describe neuronal avalanches in living brains can also be applied to cascades of activity in deep neural networks. These equations are derived from non-equilibrium statistical physics and show that deep neural networks learn best when poised between absorbing and active phases. Because these networks are strongly driven by inputs, however, they do not operate at a true critical point but within a quasi-critical regime -- one that still approximately satisfies crackling noise scaling relations. By training networks with different initializations, we show that maximal susceptibility is a more reliable predictor of learning than proximity to the critical point itself. This provides a blueprint for engineering improved network performance. Finally, using finite-size scaling we identify distinct universality classes, including Barkhausen noise and directed percolation. This theoretical framework demonstrates that universal features are shared by both biological and artificial neural networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models and multimodal systems have spurred interest in voice-first AI assistants, yet existing benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating the full range of these systems' capabilities. We introduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AI assistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Eval comprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasks include natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn dialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highly heterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21 open-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the response content and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three key findings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-source models; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding; and (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, the mid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listening accuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal (audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult for current models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safety alignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorous framework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AI assistants.

<p>Abstract: We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunfei Ge, Ya-Ting Yang, Quanyan Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: The pervasive integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has introduced complex challenges in the responsibility and accountability in the event of incidents involving AI-enabled systems. The interconnectivity of these systems, ethical concerns of AI-induced incidents, coupled with uncertainties in AI technology and the absence of corresponding regulations, have made traditional responsibility attribution challenging. To this end, this work proposes a Computational Reflective Equilibrium (CRE) approach to establish a coherent and ethically acceptable responsibility attribution framework for all stakeholders. The computational approach provides a structured analysis that overcomes the limitations of conceptual approaches in dealing with dynamic and multifaceted scenarios, showcasing the framework's traceability, coherence, and adaptivity properties in the responsibility attribution process. We examine the pivotal role of the initial activation level associated with claims in equilibrium computation. Using an AI-assisted medical decision-support system as a case study, we illustrate how different initializations lead to diverse responsibility distributions. The framework offers valuable insights into accountability in AI-induced incidents, facilitating the development of a sustainable and resilient system through continuous monitoring, revision, and reflection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuang Niu, Md Sayed Tanveer, Md Zabirul Islam, Parisa Kaviani, Qing Lyu, Mannudeep K. Kalra, Christopher T. Whitlow, Ge Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current LLMs for creating fully-structured reports face the challenges of formatting errors, content hallucinations, and privacy leakage issues when uploading data to external servers.We aim to develop an open-source, accurate LLM for creating fully-structured and standardized LCS reports from varying free-text reports across institutions and demonstrate its utility in automatic statistical analysis and individual lung nodule retrieval. With IRB approvals, our retrospective study included 5,442 de-identified LDCT LCS radiology reports from two institutions. We constructed two evaluation datasets by labeling 500 pairs of free-text and fully-structured radiology reports and one large-scale consecutive dataset from January 2021 to December 2023. Two radiologists created a standardized template for recording 27 lung nodule features on LCS. We designed a dynamic-template-constrained decoding method to enhance existing LLMs for creating fully-structured reports from free-text radiology reports. Using consecutive structured reports, we automated descriptive statistical analyses and a nodule retrieval prototype. Our best LLM for creating fully-structured reports achieved high performance on cross-institutional datasets with an F1 score of about 97%, with neither formatting errors nor content hallucinations. Our method consistently improved the best open-source LLMs by up to 10.42%, and outperformed GPT-4o by 17.19%. The automatically derived statistical distributions were consistent with prior findings regarding attenuation, location, size, stability, and Lung-RADS. The retrieval system with structured reports allowed flexible nodule-level search and complex statistical analysis. Our developed software is publicly available for local deployment and further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ram Ramrakhya, Matthew Chang, Xavier Puig, Ruta Desai, Zsolt Kira, Roozbeh Mottaghi</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied agents operating in household environments must interpret ambiguous and under-specified human instructions. A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent is tasked with a single or multi-object rearrangement task using an under-specified instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines including GPT-4o as well as supervised fine-tuned MLLMs on our task. Our results show that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin (10.4-16.5%), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beomjun Kim, Kangyeon Kim, Sunwoo Kim, Yeonsang Shin, Heejin Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: AI safety has emerged as a critical priority as these systems are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. We propose the first domain-agnostic AI safety ensuring framework that achieves strong safety guarantees while preserving high performance, grounded in rigorous theoretical foundations. Our framework includes: (1) an optimization component with chance constraints, (2) a safety classification model, (3) internal test data, (4) conservative testing procedures, (5) informative dataset quality measures, and (6) continuous approximate loss functions with gradient computation. Furthermore, to our knowledge, we mathematically establish the first scaling law in AI safety research, relating data quantity to safety-performance trade-offs. Experiments across reinforcement learning, natural language generation, and production planning validate our framework and demonstrate superior performance. Notably, in reinforcement learning, we achieve 3 collisions during 10M actions, compared with 1,000-3,000 for PPO-Lag baselines at equivalent performance levels -- a safety level unattainable by previous AI methods. We believe our framework opens a new foundation for safe AI deployment across safety-critical domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuo Yang, Daolang Wang, Lingli Ge, Beilun Wang, Tianfan Fu, Yuqiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world scientific and industrial applications require the optimization of expensive black-box functions. Bayesian Optimization (BO) provides an effective framework for such problems. However, traditional BO methods are prone to get trapped in local optima and often lack interpretable insights. To address this issue, this paper designs Reasoning BO, a novel framework that leverages reasoning models to guide the sampling process in BO while incorporating multi-agent systems and knowledge graphs for online knowledge accumulation. By integrating the reasoning and contextual understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we can provide strong guidance to enhance the BO process. As the optimization progresses, Reasoning BO provides real-time sampling recommendations along with critical insights grounded in plausible scientific theories, aiding in the discovery of superior solutions within the search space. We systematically evaluate our approach across 10 diverse tasks encompassing synthetic mathematical functions and complex real-world applications. The framework demonstrates its capability to progressively refine sampling strategies through real-time insights and hypothesis evolution, effectively identifying higher-performing regions of the search space for focused exploration. This process highlights the powerful reasoning and context-learning abilities of LLMs in optimization scenarios. For example, in the Direct Arylation task, our method increased the yield to 60.7%, whereas traditional BO achieved only a 25.2% yield. Furthermore, our investigation reveals that smaller LLMs, when fine-tuned through reinforcement learning, can attain comparable performance to their larger counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maytus Piriyajitakonkij, Rujikorn Charakorn, Weicheng Tao, Wei Pan, Mingfei Sun, Cheston Tan, Mengmi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Language is a powerful communicative and cognitive tool. It enables humans to express thoughts, share intentions, and reason about complex phenomena. Despite our fluency in using and understanding language, the question of how it arises and evolves over time remains unsolved. A leading hypothesis in linguistics and anthropology posits that language evolved to meet the ecological and social demands of early human cooperation. Language did not arise in isolation, but through shared survival goals. Inspired by this view, we investigate the emergence of language in multi-agent Foraging Games. These environments are designed to reflect the cognitive and ecological constraints believed to have influenced the evolution of communication. Agents operate in a shared grid world with only partial knowledge about other agents and the environment, and must coordinate to complete games like picking up high-value targets or executing temporally ordered actions. Using end-to-end deep reinforcement learning, agents learn both actions and communication strategies from scratch. We find that agents develop communication protocols with hallmark features of natural language: arbitrariness, interchangeability, displacement, cultural transmission, and compositionality. We quantify each property and analyze how different factors, such as population size, social dynamics, and temporal dependencies, shape specific aspects of the emergent language. Our framework serves as a platform for studying how language can evolve from partial observability, temporal reasoning, and cooperative goals in embodied multi-agent settings. We will release all data, code, and models publicly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renfei Dang, Zhening Li, Shujian Huang, Jiajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning models often exhibit overthinking, characterized by redundant reasoning steps. We identify \emph{internal bias} elicited by the input question as a key trigger of such behavior. Upon encountering a problem, the model immediately forms a preliminary guess about the answer, which we term an internal bias since it may not be explicitly generated, and it arises without systematic reasoning. When this guess conflicts with its subsequent reasoning, the model tends to engage in excessive reflection, resulting in wasted computation. We validate the association between internal bias and overthinking across multiple models and diverse reasoning tasks. To demonstrate the causal relationship more rigorously, we conduct two counterfactual interventions, showing that removing the input question after the model reduces the redundant reasoning across various complex reasoning tasks, and manually injecting bias affects overthinking accordingly. Further interpretability experiments suggest that excessive attention to the input question serves as a key mechanism through which internal bias influences subsequent reasoning trajectories. Finally, we evaluated several methods aimed at mitigating overthinking, yet the influence of internal bias persisted under all conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoqing Zhang, Kehai Chen, Zhuosheng Zhang, Rumei Li, Rongxiang Weng, Yang Xiang, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models have increased interest in Device-Control Agents (DC agents) for managing graphical user interfaces (GUIs). With the growing complexity and integration of such agents into various applications, effective evaluation methods have become crucial. The current evaluation method for DC agents primarily focuses on the instruction level, providing the current state (e.g., screenshots) and past execution history to determine actions for target instructions, helping identify potential execution failures. However, in GUI environments, a single state may contain multiple interactive widgets, each linked to different instructions, presenting an opportunity for diverse actions based on various instruction targets. Evaluating the agent's performance solely at the instruction level may overlook the broader context of these interactions. To capture a more comprehensive view of agent performance, we propose a new evaluation method, XBOUND, to evaluate the accuracy of instruction completion on a per-state basis. XBOUND provides a state-level evaluation framework, serving as a tool to assess agents' capabilities within environmental states. Our evaluation yields several key insights: UI-TARS stands out as the strongest 7B model, current agents display a bimodal performance pattern in instruction unification, and sub-7B models remain limited in state mastery. We further identify GPT-based planning as a critical bottleneck, and show that grounding data mainly benefits action matching, while trajectory data is more effective for instruction unification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jenny Zhang, Shengran Hu, Cong Lu, Robert Lange, Jeff Clune</p>
<p>Abstract: Today's AI systems have human-designed, fixed architectures and cannot autonomously and continuously improve themselves. The advance of AI could itself be automated. If done safely, that would accelerate AI development and allow us to reap its benefits much sooner. Meta-learning can automate the discovery of novel algorithms, but is limited by first-order improvements and the human design of a suitable search space. The G\"odel machine proposed a theoretical alternative: a self-improving AI that repeatedly modifies itself in a provably beneficial manner. Unfortunately, proving that most changes are net beneficial is impossible in practice. We introduce the Darwin G\"odel Machine (DGM), a self-improving system that iteratively modifies its own code (thereby also improving its ability to modify its own codebase) and empirically validates each change using coding benchmarks. Inspired by Darwinian evolution and open-endedness research, the DGM maintains an archive of generated coding agents. It grows the archive by sampling an agent from it and using a foundation model to create a new, interesting, version of the sampled agent. This open-ended exploration forms a growing tree of diverse, high-quality agents and allows the parallel exploration of many different paths through the search space. Empirically, the DGM automatically improves its coding capabilities (e.g., better code editing tools, long-context window management, peer-review mechanisms), increasing performance on SWE-bench from 20.0% to 50.0%, and on Polyglot from 14.2% to 30.7%. Furthermore, the DGM significantly outperforms baselines without self-improvement or open-ended exploration. All experiments were done with safety precautions (e.g., sandboxing, human oversight). The DGM is a significant step toward self-improving AI, capable of gathering its own stepping stones along paths that unfold into endless innovation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in language models have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning abilities, prompting the exploration of in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) to extend the promise to decision domains. Due to involving more complex dynamics and temporal correlations, existing ICRL approaches may face challenges in learning from suboptimal trajectories and achieving precise in-context inference. In the paper, we propose \textbf{S}calable \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{Q}-\textbf{L}earning (\textbf{SICQL}), an innovative framework that harnesses dynamic programming and world modeling to steer ICRL toward efficient reward maximization and task generalization, while retaining the scalability and stability of supervised pretraining. We design a prompt-based multi-head transformer architecture that simultaneously predicts optimal policies and in-context value functions using separate heads. We pretrain a generalized world model to capture task-relevant information, enabling the construction of a compact prompt that facilitates fast and precise in-context inference. During training, we perform iterative policy improvement by fitting a state value function to an upper-expectile of the Q-function, and distill the in-context value functions into policy extraction using advantage-weighted regression. Extensive experiments across a range of discrete and continuous environments show consistent performance gains over various types of baselines, especially when learning from suboptimal data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqi Liu, Xuemeng Song, Jiaxi Li, Yinwei Wei, Na Zheng, Jianhua Yin, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for mitigating hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although existing methods have achieved significant progress by utilizing vision-oriented contrastive objectives for enhancing MLLMs' attention to visual inputs and hence reducing hallucination, they suffer from non-rigorous optimization objective function and indirect preference supervision. To address these limitations, we propose a Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization (SymMPO), which conducts symmetric preference learning with direct preference supervision (i.e., response pairs) for visual understanding enhancement, while maintaining rigorous theoretical alignment with standard DPO. In addition to conventional ordinal preference learning, SymMPO introduces a preference margin consistency loss to quantitatively regulate the preference gap between symmetric preference pairs. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmarks demonstrate SymMPO's superior performance, validating its effectiveness in hallucination mitigation of MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentao Zhang, Liang Zeng, Yuzhen Xiao, Yongcong Li, Ce Cui, Yilei Zhao, Rui Hu, Yang Liu, Yahui Zhou, Bo An</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs-based agent systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex tasks. Nevertheless, current protocols (e.g., A2A and MCP) suffer from insufficient capabilities in context management, limited adaptability to diverse environments, and the absence of dynamic agent architectures. To address these limitations, we propose the Tool-Environment-Agent (TEA) Protocol, which establishes a principled basis for integrating environments, agents, and tools into an unified system. The TEA protocol treats environments and agents as first-class resources, enabling comprehensive context management and adaptive environment integration. Based on this protocol, we introduce AgentOrchestra, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with a central planning agent that decomposes complex objectives and coordinates specialized agents. Each sub-agent is dedicated to specific functions, providing capabilities for data analysis, file operations, web navigation, and interactive reasoning. Notably, AgentOrchestra introduces a tool manager agent that supports intelligent evolution through dynamic tool creation, retrieval, and reuse mechanisms. Experiments on three widely used benchmarks show that AgentOrchestra consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance of 83.39% on GAIA and ranking among the top general-purpose LLM-based agents. These results highlight the effectiveness of the TEA Protocol and hierarchical organization in building general-purpose multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miho Koda, Yu Zheng, Ruixian Ma, Mingyang Sun, Devesh Pansare, Fabio Duarte, Paolo Santi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), particularly those enhanced through reinforced post-training, have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, as exemplified by models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1. However, these capabilities are predominantly benchmarked on domains like mathematical problem solving and code generation, leaving open the question of whether such reasoning skills generalize to complex real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce LocationReasoner, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities in the context of real-world site selection, where models must identify feasible locations by reasoning over diverse and complicated spatial, environmental, and logistic constraints. The benchmark covers carefully crafted queries of varying difficulty levels and is supported by a sandbox environment with in-house tools for constraint-based location search. Automated verification further guarantees the scalability of the benchmark, enabling the addition of arbitrary number of queries. Extensive evaluations on real-world site selection data from Boston, New York, and Tampa reveal that state-of-the-art reasoning models offer limited improvement over their non-reasoning predecessors in real-world contexts, with even the latest OpenAI o4 model failing on 30% of site selection tasks. Moreover, agentic strategies such as ReAct and Reflexion often suffer from over-reasoning, leading to worse outcomes than direct prompting. With key limitations of LLMs in holistic and non-linear reasoning highlighted, we release LocationReasoner to foster the development of LLMs and agents capable of robust, grounded reasoning in real-world decision-making tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Bahloul, Simon Malberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al., 2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration. Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge (Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and (2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeiyoon Park, Yongshin Han, Minseop Kim, Kisu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed research on role-playing agents (RPAs). However, the process of collecting character-specific utterances and continually updating model parameters to track rapidly changing persona attributes is resource-intensive. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can alleviate this problem, if a persona does not contain knowledge relevant to a given query, RAG-based RPAs are prone to hallucination, making it challenging to generate accurate responses. In this paper, we propose Amadeus, a training-free framework that can significantly enhance persona consistency even when responding to questions that lie beyond a character's knowledge. Amadeus is composed of Adaptive Context-aware Text Splitter (ACTS), Guided Selection (GS), and Attribute Extractor (AE). To facilitate effective RAG-based role-playing, ACTS partitions each character's persona into optimally sized, overlapping chunks and augments this representation with hierarchical contextual information. AE identifies a character's general attributes from the chunks retrieved by GS and uses these attributes as a final context to maintain robust persona consistency even when answering out-of-knowledge questions. To underpin the development and rigorous evaluation of RAG-based RPAs, we manually construct CharacterRAG, a role-playing dataset that consists of persona documents for 15 distinct fictional characters totaling 976K written characters, and 450 question-answer pairs. We find that our proposed method effectively models not only the knowledge possessed by characters, but also various attributes such as personality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Collaborative partnership matters in inquiry-oriented education. However, most study partners are selected either rely on experience-based assignments with little scientific planning or build on rule-based machine assistants, encountering difficulties in knowledge expansion and inadequate flexibility. This paper proposes an LLM-empowered agent model for simulating and selecting learning partners tailored to inquiry-oriented learning, named InqEduAgent. Generative agents are designed to capture cognitive and evaluative features of learners in real-world scenarios. Then, an adaptive matching algorithm with Gaussian process augmentation is formulated to identify patterns within prior knowledge. Optimal learning-partner matches are provided for learners facing different exercises. The experimental results show the optimal performance of InqEduAgent in most knowledge-learning scenarios and LLM environment with different levels of capabilities. This study promotes the intelligent allocation of human-based learning partners and the formulation of AI-based learning partners.

<p>Abstract: Existing multimodal browsing benchmarks often fail to require genuine multimodal reasoning, as many tasks can be solved with text-only heuristics without vision-in-the-loop verification. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a 311-task benchmark that enforces multimodal understanding by requiring extraction and propagation of fine-grained visual cues through iterative image-text retrieval and cross-validation under retrieval noise. Our curation procedure seeds questions whose answers require extrapolating from spatial cues and temporal traces to out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. Beyond the dataset, we provide a model-agnostic agent framework with standard browsing tools and a set-of-mark (SoM) module, which lets the agent place marks, crop subregions, and launch targeted image/text searches. SoM enables provenance-aware zoom-and-retrieve and improves robustness in multi-step reasoning. We evaluated closed- and open-source MLLMs in this framework. The strongest system achieves an end-to-end accuracy of 36.0%, and integrating SoM produces consistent gains in multiple settings, with improvements up to +3.9 points. From failure analysis, we observe recurring errors in locating relevant webpages and distinguishing between visually similar events. These results underscore the challenges of real-world multimodal search and establish MMSearch-Plus as a rigorous benchmark for advancing agentic MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusheng Zheng, Yanpeng Hu, Wei Zhang, Andi Quinn</p>
<p>Abstract: Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act"). Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic analysis.
  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathn Chang, Leonhard Piff, Suvadip Sana, Jasmine X. Li, Lionel Levine</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al., 2003), yielding scores that reflect a weighted consensus judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground truth labels, as it is designed to quantify subjective traits for which reasonable judges may disagree on the correct label. Hence, to validate our method, we collect human judgments on the same ensemble of models and show that EigenBench's judgments align closely with those of human evaluators. We further demonstrate that EigenBench can recover model rankings on the GPQA benchmark without access to objective labels, supporting its viability as a framework for evaluating subjective values for which no ground truths exist.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Xu, Jiacong Hu, Ke Zhang, Lei Yu, Yuxin Tang, Xinyuan Song, Yiqun Duan, Lynn Ai, Bill Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM, Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremias Ferrao, Matthijs van der Lende, Ilija Lichkovski, Clement Neo</p>
<p>Abstract: Prevailing alignment methods induce opaque parameter changes, making it difficult to audit what the model truly learns. To address this, we introduce Feature Steering with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL), a framework that trains a lightweight adapter to steer model behavior by modulating interpretable sparse features. First, we theoretically show that this mechanism is principled and expressive enough to approximate the behavioral shifts of post-training processes. Then, we apply this framework to the task of preference optimization and perform a causal analysis of the learned policy. We find that the model relies on stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality, disproportionately steering features related to style and formatting over those tied to alignment concepts like honesty. Despite exploiting this heuristic, FSRL proves to be an effective alignment method, achieving a substantial reduction in preference loss. Overall, FSRL offers an interpretable control interface and a practical way to diagnose how preference optimization pressures manifest at the feature level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antoni Guasch, Maria Isabel Valdez</p>
<p>Abstract: The "black box" nature of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) presents critical limitations in reliability and transparency, fueling the debate around the "illusion of thinking" and the challenge of state hallucinations in agentic systems. In response, we introduce The STAR-XAI Protocol (Socratic, Transparent, Agentic, Reasoning - for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence), a novel operational methodology for training and operating verifiably reliable AI agents. Our method reframes the human-AI interaction as a structured Socratic dialogue governed by an explicit, evolving symbolic rulebook (the Consciousness Transfer Package - CTP) and a suite of integrity protocols, including a state-locking Checksum that eradicates internal state corruption. Through an exhaustive case study in the complex strategic game "Caps i Caps," we demonstrate that this "Clear Box" framework transforms an opaque LRM into a disciplined strategist. The agent not only exhibits the emergence of complex tactics, such as long-term planning, but also achieves ante-hoc transparency by justifying its intentions before acting. Crucially, it demonstrates Second-Order Agency by identifying and correcting flaws in its own supervisor-approved plans, leading to empirically-proven, 100% reliable state tracking and achieving "zero hallucinations by design." The STAR-XAI Protocol thus offers a practical pathway toward building AI agents that are not just high-performing but intrinsically auditable, trustworthy, and reliable.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19517">Cognitive Load Limits in Large Language Models: Benchmarking Multi-Hop Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sai Teja Reddy Adapala</p>
<p>Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed a critical gap between their performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic, information-rich environments. While models excel at isolated tasks, the computational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational cognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context Saturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key mechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive Evaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these load factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N = 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant performance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller open-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) exhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all conditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In contrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85% accuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation under context saturation ($\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These findings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor to reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under uncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenliang Li, Rui Yan, Xu Zhang, Li Chen, Hongji Zhu, Jing Zhao, Junjun Li, Mengru Li, Wei Cao, Zihang Jiang, Wei Wei, Kun Zhang, Shaohua Kevin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable potential in medical applications, yet they face substantial challenges in handling complex real-world clinical diagnoses using conventional prompting methods. Current prompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated inferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To address this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD) framework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent pipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors how physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and accurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a MACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician agents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and human oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390 real-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs (Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves primary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with gains up to 22.3% (MACD). In direct comparison with physician-only diagnosis under the same evaluation protocol, MACD achieves comparable or superior performance, with improvements up to 16%. Furthermore, the MACD-human workflow yields an 18.6% improvement over physician-only diagnosis, demonstrating the synergistic potential of human-AI collaboration. Notably, the self-learned clinical knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability across LLMs, and capacity for model-specific personalization.This work thus presents a scalable self-learning paradigm that bridges the gap between the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1) Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1) distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment. The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without requiring additional training or human annotations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuemiao Zhang, Can Ren, Chengying Tu, Rongxiang Weng, Shuo Wang, Hongfei Yan, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only 10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of downstream RL performance by 7.81%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eleonora Lopez, Eleonora Grassucci, Danilo Comminiello</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiologists interpret mammography exams by jointly analyzing all four views, as correlations among them are crucial for accurate diagnosis. Recent methods employ dedicated fusion blocks to capture such dependencies, but these are often hindered by view dominance, training instability, and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce multi-view hypercomplex learning, a novel learning paradigm for multi-view breast cancer classification based on parameterized hypercomplex neural networks (PHNNs). Thanks to hypercomplex algebra, our models intrinsically capture both intra- and inter-view relations. We propose PHResNets for two-view exams and two complementary four-view architectures: PHYBOnet, optimized for efficiency, and PHYSEnet, optimized for accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view models, while also generalizing across radiographic modalities and tasks such as disease classification from chest X-rays and multimodal brain tumor segmentation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Berry, David Meger</p>
<p>Abstract: This work introduces an efficient novel approach for epistemic uncertainty estimation for ensemble models for regression tasks using pairwise-distance estimators (PaiDEs). Utilizing the pairwise-distance between model components, these estimators establish bounds on entropy. We leverage this capability to enhance the performance of Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD). Notably, unlike sample-based Monte Carlo estimators, PaiDEs exhibit a remarkable capability to estimate epistemic uncertainty at speeds up to 100 times faster while covering a significantly larger number of inputs at once and demonstrating superior performance in higher dimensions. To validate our approach, we conducted a varied series of regression experiments on commonly used benchmarks: 1D sinusoidal data, $\textit{Pendulum}$, $\textit{Hopper}$, $\textit{Ant}$ and $\textit{Humanoid}$. For each experimental setting, an active learning framework was applied to demonstrate the advantages of PaiDEs for epistemic uncertainty estimation. We compare our approach to existing active learning methods and find that our approach outperforms on high-dimensional regression tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning approach named Value Decomposition Framework with Disentangled World Model to address the challenge of achieving a common goal of multiple agents interacting in the same environment with reduced sample complexity. Due to scalability and non-stationarity problems posed by multi-agent systems, model-free methods rely on a considerable number of samples for training. In contrast, we use a modularized world model, composed of action-conditioned, action-free, and static branches, to unravel the complicated environment dynamics. Our model produces imagined outcomes based on past experience, without sampling directly from the real environment. We employ variational auto-encoders and variational graph auto-encoders to learn the latent representations for the world model, which is merged with a value-based framework to predict the joint action-value function and optimize the overall training objective. Experimental results on StarCraft II micro-management, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, and Level-Based Foraging challenges demonstrate that our method achieves high sample efficiency and exhibits superior performance compared to other baselines across a wide range of multi-agent learning tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The dominant paradigm in AI ethics and value alignment is highly anthropocentric. The focus of these disciplines is strictly on human values which limits the depth and breadth of their insights. Recently, attempts to expand to a sentientist perspective have been initiated. We argue that neither of these outlooks is sufficient to capture the actual complexity of the biosphere and ensure that AI does not damage it. Thus, we propose a new paradigm -- Biospheric AI that assumes an ecocentric perspective. We discuss hypothetical ways in which such an AI might be designed. Moreover, we give directions for research and application of the modern AI models that would be consistent with the biospheric interests. All in all, this work attempts to take first steps towards a comprehensive program of research that focuses on the interactions between AI and the biosphere.</p>

<p>Abstract: The sustainable utilization of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is crucial to the global energy transition and carbon neutrality, yet data scarcity and heterogeneity remain major barriers across remanufacturing, reusing, and recycling. This dissertation develops a machine learning assisted framework to address these challenges throughout the battery lifecycle. A physics informed quality control model predicts long-term degradation from limited early-cycle data, while a generative learning based residual value assessment method enables rapid and accurate evaluation of retired batteries under random conditions. A federated learning strategy achieves privacy preserving and high precision cathode material sorting, supporting efficient recycling. Furthermore, a unified diagnostics and prognostics framework based on correlation alignment enhances adaptability across tasks such as state of health estimation, state of charge estimation, and remaining useful life prediction under varied testing protocols. Collectively, these contributions advance sustainable battery management by integrating physics, data generation, privacy preserving collaboration, and adaptive learning, offering methodological innovations to promote circular economy and global carbon neutrality.</p>

This work tackles the subset selection problem: selecting a small set of the most informative examples from a large unlabeled pool for annotation. We propose a simple and effective method that combines feature norms, randomization, and orthogonality (via the Gram-Schmidt process) to select diverse and informative samples. Feature norms serve as a proxy for informativeness, while randomization and orthogonalization reduce redundancy and encourage coverage of the feature space. Extensive experiments on image and text benchmarks, including CIFAR-10/100, Tiny ImageNet, ImageNet, OrganAMNIST, and Yelp, show that our method consistently improves subset selection performance, both as a standalone approach and when integrated with existing techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faried Abu Zaid, Daniel Neider, Mustafa Yal\c{c}{\i}ner</p>
<p>Abstract: Formal verification has emerged as a promising method to ensure the safety and reliability of neural networks. However, many relevant properties, such as fairness or global robustness, pertain to the entire input space. If one applies verification techniques naively, the neural network is checked even on inputs that do not occur in the real world and have no meaning. To tackle this shortcoming, we propose the VeriFlow architecture as a flow-based density model tailored to allow any verification approach to restrict its search to some data distribution of interest. We argue that our architecture is particularly well suited for this purpose because of two major properties. First, we show that the transformation that is defined by our model is piecewise affine. Therefore, the model allows the usage of verifiers based on constraint solving with linear arithmetic. Second, upper density level sets (UDL) of the data distribution are definable via linear constraints in the latent space. As a consequence, representations of UDLs specified by a given probability are effectively computable in the latent space. This property allows for effective verification with a fine-grained, probabilistically interpretable control of how a-typical the inputs subject to verification are.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study compared the performance of classical feature-based machine learning models (CMLs) and large language models (LLMs) in predicting COVID-19 mortality using high-dimensional tabular data from 9,134 patients across four hospitals. Seven CML models, including XGBoost and random forest (RF), were evaluated alongside eight LLMs, such as GPT-4 and Mistral-7b, which performed zero-shot classification on text-converted structured data. Additionally, Mistral- 7b was fine-tuned using the QLoRA approach. XGBoost and RF demonstrated superior performance among CMLs, achieving F1 scores of 0.87 and 0.83 for internal and external validation, respectively. GPT-4 led the LLM category with an F1 score of 0.43, while fine-tuning Mistral-7b significantly improved its recall from 1% to 79%, yielding a stable F1 score of 0.74 during external validation. Although LLMs showed moderate performance in zero-shot classification, fine-tuning substantially enhanced their effectiveness, potentially bridging the gap with CML models. However, CMLs still outperformed LLMs in handling high-dimensional tabular data tasks. This study highlights the potential of both CMLs and fine-tuned LLMs in medical predictive modeling, while emphasizing the current superiority of CMLs for structured data analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian J. Wetzel, Zakaria Patel</p>
<p>Abstract: It has been demonstrated that artificial neural networks like autoencoders or Siamese networks encode meaningful concepts in their latent spaces. However, there does not exist a comprehensive framework for retrieving this information in a human-readable form without prior knowledge. In quantitative disciplines concepts are typically formulated as equations. Hence, in order to extract these concepts, we introduce a framework for finding closed-form interpretations of neurons in latent spaces of artificial neural networks. The interpretation framework is based on embedding trained neural networks into an equivalence class of functions that encode the same concept. We interpret these neural networks by finding an intersection between the equivalence class and human-readable equations defined by a symbolic search space. Computationally, this framework is based on finding a symbolic expression whose normalized gradients match the normalized gradients of a specific neuron with respect to the input variables. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by retrieving invariants of matrices and conserved quantities of dynamical systems from latent spaces of Siamese neural networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection employs machine learning classification models to distinguish between individuals with AD and those without. Different from conventional classification tasks, we identify within-class variation as a critical challenge in AD detection: individuals with AD exhibit a spectrum of cognitive impairments. Therefore, simplistic binary AD classification may overlook two crucial aspects: within-class heterogeneity and instance-level imbalance. In this work, we found using a sample score estimator can generate sample-specific soft scores aligning with cognitive scores. We subsequently propose two simple yet effective methods: Soft Target Distillation (SoTD) and Instance-level Re-balancing (InRe), targeting two problems respectively. Based on the ADReSS and CU-MARVEL corpora, we demonstrated and analyzed the advantages of the proposed approaches in detection performance. These findings provide insights for developing robust and reliable AD detection models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongbo Han, Jialong Yang, Guangyu Wang, Junfan Li, Qianli Xu, Mike Zheng Shou, Changqing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language foundation models (VLMs), such as CLIP, exhibit remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models can be unreliable when significant distribution gaps exist between training and test data, while fine-tuning for diverse scenarios is often costly. Cache-based test-time adapters offer an efficient alternative by storing representative test samples to guide subsequent classifications. Yet, these methods typically employ naive cache management with limited capacity, leading to severe catastrophic forgetting when samples are inevitably dropped during updates. In this paper, we propose DOTA (DistributiOnal Test-time Adaptation), a simple yet effective method addressing this limitation. Crucially, instead of merely memorizing individual test samples, DOTA continuously estimates the underlying distribution of the test data stream. Test-time posterior probabilities are then computed using these dynamically estimated distributions via Bayes' theorem for adaptation. This distribution-centric approach enables the model to continually learn and adapt to the deployment environment. Extensive experiments validate that DOTA significantly mitigates forgetting and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Wu, Jiaru Zhang, Zhiwei Steven Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have become powerful image generation tools, especially for few-shot fine-tuning where a pretrained DM is fine-tuned on a small image set to capture specific styles or objects. Many people upload these personalized checkpoints online, fostering communities such as Civitai and HuggingFace. However, model owners may overlook the data leakage risks when releasing fine-tuned checkpoints. Moreover, concerns regarding copyright violations arise when unauthorized data is used during fine-tuning. In this paper, we ask: "Can training data be extracted from these fine-tuned DMs shared online?" A successful extraction would present not only data leakage threats but also offer tangible evidence of copyright infringement. To answer this, we propose FineXtract, a framework for extracting fine-tuning data. Our method approximates fine-tuning as a gradual shift in the model's learned distribution -- from the original pretrained DM toward the fine-tuning data. By extrapolating the models before and after fine-tuning, we guide the generation toward high-probability regions within the fine-tuned data distribution. We then apply a clustering algorithm to extract the most probable images from those generated using this extrapolated guidance. Experiments on DMs fine-tuned with datasets including WikiArt, DreamBooth, and real-world checkpoints posted online validate the effectiveness of our method, extracting about 20% of fine-tuning data in most cases.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingxu Wang, Mengzhu Wang, Houcheng Su, Nan Yin, Quanming Yao, James Kwok</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Graph Networks (SGNs) have demonstrated significant potential in graph classification by emulating brain-inspired neural dynamics to achieve energy-efficient computation. However, existing SGNs are generally constrained to in-distribution scenarios and struggle with distribution shifts. In this paper, we first propose the domain adaptation problem in SGNs, and introduce a novel framework named Degree-Consicious Spiking Graph for Cross-Domain Adaptation (DeSGraDA). DeSGraDA enhances generalization across domains with three key components. First, we introduce the degree-conscious spiking representation module by adapting spike thresholds based on node degrees, enabling more expressive and structure-aware signal encoding. Then, we perform temporal distribution alignment by adversarially matching membrane potentials between domains, ensuring effective performance under domain shift while preserving energy efficiency. Additionally, we extract consistent predictions across two spaces to create reliable pseudo-labels, effectively leveraging unlabeled data to enhance graph classification performance. Furthermore, we establish the first generalization bound for SGDA, providing theoretical insights into its adaptation performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that DeSGraDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both classification accuracy and energy efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingfa Chen, Xinrong Zhang, Shengding Hu, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in recurrent architectures, such as Mamba and RWKV, have showcased strong language capabilities. Unlike transformer-based models, these architectures encode all contextual information into a fixed-size state, leading to great inference efficiency. However, this approach can cause information interference, where different token data conflicts, resulting in performance degradation and incoherent outputs beyond a certain context length. To prevent this, most RNNs incorporate mechanisms designed to "forget" earlier tokens. In this paper, we reveal that Mamba-based models struggle to effectively forget earlier tokens even with built-in forgetting mechanisms. We demonstrate that this issue stems from training on contexts that are too short for the state size, enabling the model to perform well without needing to learn how to forget. Then, we show that the minimum training length required for the model to learn forgetting scales linearly with the state size, and the maximum context length for accurate retrieval of a 5-digit passkey scales exponentially with the state size, indicating that the model retains some information beyond the point where forgetting begins. These findings highlight a critical limitation in current RNN architectures and provide valuable insights for improving long-context modeling. Our work suggests that future RNN designs must account for the interplay between state size, training length, and forgetting mechanisms to achieve robust performance in long-context tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bokai Hu, Sai Ashish Somayajula, Xin Pan, Pengtao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) under 14B parameters continue to underperform on natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, often trailing smaller models like BERT-base on benchmarks such as GLUE and SuperGLUE. Motivated by the success of reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks (e.g., DeepSeek), we explore Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as a framework to improve the NLU capabilities of LLMs. We frame NLU as a reinforcement learning environment, treating token generation as a sequence of actions and optimizing for reward signals based on alignment with ground-truth labels. PPO consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning, yielding an average improvement of 6.3 points on GLUE, and surpasses zero-shot and few-shot prompting by 38.7 and 26.1 points, respectively. Notably, PPO-tuned models outperform GPT-4o by over 4\% on average across sentiment and natural language inference tasks, including gains of 7.3\% on the Mental Health dataset and 10.9\% on SIGA-nli. This work highlights a promising direction for adapting LLMs to new tasks by reframing them as reinforcement learning problems, enabling learning through simple end-task rewards rather than extensive data curation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Liang, Shweta Bhardwaj, Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-quality or scarce data has posed significant challenges for training deep neural networks in practice. While classical data augmentation cannot contribute very different new data, diffusion models opens up a new door to build self-evolving AI by generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data through text-guided prompts. However, text-only guidance cannot control synthetic images' proximity to the original images, resulting in out-of-distribution data detrimental to the model performance. To overcome the limitation, we study image guidance to achieve a spectrum of interpolations between synthetic and real images. With stronger image guidance, the generated images are similar to the training data but hard to learn. While with weaker image guidance, the synthetic images will be easier for model but contribute to a larger distribution gap with the original data. The generated full spectrum of data enables us to build a novel "Diffusion Curriculum (DisCL)". DisCL adjusts the image guidance level of image synthesis for each training stage: It identifies and focuses on hard samples for the model and assesses the most effective guidance level of synthetic images to improve hard data learning. We apply DisCL to two challenging tasks: long-tail (LT) classification and learning from low-quality data. It focuses on lower-guidance images of high-quality to learn prototypical features as a warm-up of learning higher-guidance images that might be weak on diversity or quality. Extensive experiments showcase a gain of 2.7% and 2.1% in OOD and ID macro-accuracy when applying DisCL to iWildCam dataset. On ImageNet-LT, DisCL improves the base model's tail-class accuracy from 4.4% to 23.64% and leads to a 4.02% improvement in all-class accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manav Vora, Ilan Shomorony, Melkior Ornik</p>
<p>Abstract: We study capacity- and budget-constrained multi-agent MDPs (CB-MA-MDPs), a class that captures many maintenance and scheduling tasks in which each agent can irreversibly fail and a planner must decide (i) when to apply a restorative action and (ii) which subset of agents to treat in parallel. The global budget limits the total number of restorations, while the capacity constraint bounds the number of simultaneous actions, turning na\"ive dynamic programming into a combinatorial search that scales exponentially with the number of agents. We propose a two-stage solution that remains tractable for large systems. First, a Linear Sum Assignment Problem (LSAP)-based grouping partitions the agents into r disjoint sets (r = capacity) that maximise diversity in expected time-to-failure, allocating budget to each set proportionally. Second, a meta-trained PPO policy solves each sub-MDP, leveraging transfer across groups to converge rapidly. To validate our approach, we apply it to the problem of scheduling repairs for a large team of industrial robots, constrained by a limited number of repair technicians and a total repair budget. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in terms of maximizing the average uptime of the robot team, particularly for large team sizes. Lastly, we confirm the scalability of our approach through a computational complexity analysis across varying numbers of robots and repair technicians.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaedong Hwang, Brian Cheung, Zhang-Wei Hong, Akhilan Boopathy, Pulkit Agrawal, Ila Fiete</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale pretrained models are widely leveraged as foundations for learning new specialized tasks via fine-tuning, with the goal of maintaining the general performance of the model while allowing it to gain new skills. A valuable goal for all such models is robustness: the ability to perform well on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. We assess whether fine-tuning preserves the overall robustness of the pretrained model, and observed that models pretrained on large datasets exhibited strong catastrophic forgetting and loss of OOD generalization. To systematically assess robustness preservation in fine-tuned models, we propose the Robustness Inheritance Benchmark (ImageNet-RIB). The benchmark, which can be applied to any pretrained model, consists of a set of related but distinct OOD (downstream) tasks and involves fine-tuning on one of the OOD tasks in the set then testing on the rest. We find that though continual learning methods help, fine-tuning reduces robustness across pretrained models. Surprisingly, models pretrained on the largest and most diverse datasets (e.g., LAION-2B) exhibit both larger robustness losses and lower absolute robustness after fine-tuning on small datasets, relative to models pretrained on smaller datasets. These findings suggest that starting with the strongest foundation model is not necessarily the best approach for performance on specialist tasks. https://jd730.github.io/projects/ImageNet-RIB</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongmin Park, Sebin Kim, Taehong Moon, Minkyu Kim, Kangwook Lee, Jaewoong Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often struggle to generate rare compositions of concepts, e.g., objects with unusual attributes. In this paper, we show that the compositional generation power of diffusion models on such rare concepts can be significantly enhanced by the Large Language Model (LLM) guidance. We start with empirical and theoretical analysis, demonstrating that exposing frequent concepts relevant to the target rare concepts during the diffusion sampling process yields more accurate concept composition. Based on this, we propose a training-free approach, R2F, that plans and executes the overall rare-to-frequent concept guidance throughout the diffusion inference by leveraging the abundant semantic knowledge in LLMs. Our framework is flexible across any pre-trained diffusion models and LLMs, and can be seamlessly integrated with the region-guided diffusion approaches. Extensive experiments on three datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, RareBench, containing various prompts with rare compositions of concepts, R2F significantly surpasses existing models including SD3.0 and FLUX by up to 28.1%p in T2I alignment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Onur Boyar, Hiroyuki Hanada, Ichiro Takeuchi</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid discovery of new chemical compounds is essential for advancing global health and developing treatments. While generative models show promise in creating novel molecules, challenges remain in ensuring the real-world applicability of these molecules and finding such molecules efficiently. To address this challenge, we introduce Conditional Latent Space Molecular Scaffold Optimization (CLaSMO), which integrates a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) with Latent Space Bayesian Optimization (LSBO) to strategically modify molecules while preserving similarity to the original input, effectively framing the task as constrained optimization. Our LSBO setting improves the sample-efficiency of the molecular optimization, and our modification approach helps us to obtain molecules with higher chances of real-world applicability. CLaSMO explores substructures of molecules in a sample-efficient manner by performing BO in the latent space of a CVAE conditioned on the atomic environment of the molecule to be optimized. Our extensive evaluations across diverse optimization tasks, including rediscovery, docking score, and multi-property optimization, show that CLaSMO efficiently enhances target properties, delivers remarkable sample-efficiency crucial for resource-limited applications while considering molecular similarity constraints, achieves state of the art performance, and maintains practical synthetic accessibility. We also provide an open-source web application that enables chemical experts to apply CLaSMO in a Human-in-the-Loop setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Huang, Chong Chen, Zeang Sheng, Yang Li, Wentao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world scenarios, most of the data obtained from the information retrieval (IR) system is unstructured. Converting natural language sentences into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) remains a critical challenge. We identified three limitations with respect to existing KG construction methods: (1) There could be a large amount of noise in real-world documents, which could result in extracting messy information. (2) Naive LLMs usually extract inaccurate knowledge from some domain-specific documents. (3) Hallucination phenomenon cannot be overlooked when directly using LLMs to construct KGs. In this paper, we propose \textbf{GraphJudge}, a KG construction framework to address the aforementioned challenges. In this framework, we designed an entity-centric strategy to eliminate the noise information in the documents. And we fine-tuned a LLM as a graph judge to finally enhance the quality of generated KGs. Experiments conducted on two general and one domain-specific text-graph pair datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance against various baseline methods with strong generalization abilities.

<p>Abstract: Estimating the uncertainty of responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge. While recent Bayesian methods have demonstrated effectiveness in quantifying uncertainty through low-rank weight updates, they typically require complex fine-tuning or post-training procedures. In this paper, we propose Training-Free Bayesianization (TFB), a simple yet theoretically grounded framework that efficiently transforms trained low-rank adapters into Bayesian ones without additional training. TFB systematically searches for the maximally acceptable level of variance in the weight posterior, constrained within a family of low-rank isotropic Gaussian distributions. Our theoretical analysis shows that under mild conditions, this search process is equivalent to KL-regularized variational optimization, a generalized form of variational inference. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that TFB achieves superior uncertainty estimation and generalization compared to existing methods while eliminating the need for complex Bayesianization training procedures.

<p>Abstract: Domain-adaptive post-training of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach for specialized domains such as medicine and finance. However, significant challenges remain in identifying optimal adaptation criteria and training strategies across varying data and model configurations.

Our approach consists of four key components: FinCap, which defines the core capabilities required for the target domain; FinRec, an effective training recipe that jointly optimizes continual pre-training and instruction-following, along with a novel preference data distillation method leveraging process signals from a generative reward model; FinTrain, a curated set of training datasets supporting FinRec; and FinEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite aligned with FinCap. The resulting model, Llama-Fin, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of financial tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tian Xie, Pavan Rauch, Xueru Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: When ML algorithms are deployed to automate human-related decisions, human agents may learn the underlying decision policies and adapt their behavior. Strategic Classification (SC) has emerged as a framework for studying this interaction between agents and decision-makers to design more trustworthy ML systems. Prior theoretical models in SC assume that agents are perfectly or approximately rational and respond to decision policies by optimizing their utility. However, the growing prevalence of LLMs raises the possibility that real-world agents may instead rely on these tools for strategic advice. This shift prompts two questions: (i) Can LLMs generate effective and socially responsible strategies in SC settings? (ii) Can existing SC theoretical models accurately capture agent behavior when agents follow LLM-generated advice? To investigate these questions, we examine five critical SC scenarios: hiring, loan applications, school admissions, personal income, and public assistance programs. We simulate agents with diverse profiles who interact with three commercial LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5), following their suggestions on effort allocations on features. We compare the resulting agent behaviors with the best responses in existing SC models. Our findings show that: (i) Even without access to the decision policy, LLMs can generate effective strategies that improve both agents' scores and qualification; (ii) At the population level, LLM-guided effort allocation strategies yield similar or even higher score improvements, qualification rates, and fairness metrics as those predicted by the SC theoretical model, suggesting that the theoretical model may still serve as a reasonable proxy for LLM-influenced behavior; and (iii) At the individual level, LLMs tend to produce more diverse and balanced effort allocations than theoretical models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyu Chen, Yiding Chen, Wen Sun, Xuezhou Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for large language model (LLM) alignment. This paper studies the setting of online RLHF and focus on improving sample efficiency. All existing algorithms in online RLHF, whether doing passive exploration or active exploration, suffer from a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the scale of the reward function. This fundamental limitation hinders their effectiveness in scenarios with heavily skewed preferences, e.g. questions with a unique correct solution. To address this, we introduce Self-Exploring Preference-Incentive Online Preference Optimization (SE-POPO), an online RLHF algorithm that for the first time achieves a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the reward scale, answering an open problem raised by Xie et al. (2024).. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the sample complexity of SE-POPO dominates that of existing exploration algorithms. Empirically, our systematic evaluation confirms that SE-POPO is more sample-efficient than both exploratory and non-exploratory baselines, in two primary application scenarios of RLHF as well as on public benchmarks, marking a significant step forward in RLHF algorithm design.

<p>Abstract: Dense process rewards have proven a more effective alternative to the sparse outcome-level rewards in the inference-time scaling of large language models (LLMs), particularly in tasks requiring complex multi-step reasoning. While dense rewards also offer an appealing choice for the reinforcement learning (RL) of LLMs since their fine-grained rewards have the potential to address some inherent issues of outcome rewards, such as training efficiency and credit assignment, this potential remains largely unrealized. This can be primarily attributed to the challenges of training process reward models (PRMs) online, where collecting high-quality process labels is prohibitively expensive, making them particularly vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these challenges, we propose PRIME (Process Reinforcement through IMplicit rEwards), which enables online PRM updates using only policy rollouts and outcome labels through implict process rewards. PRIME combines well with various advantage functions and forgoes the dedicated reward model training phrase that existing approaches require, substantially reducing the development overhead. We demonstrate PRIME's effectiveness on competitional math and coding. Starting from Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base, PRIME achieves a 15.1% average improvement across several key reasoning benchmarks over the SFT model. Notably, our resulting model, Eurus-2-7B-PRIME, surpasses Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on seven reasoning benchmarks with 10% of its training data.</p>

In content creation workflows, precise and simultaneous control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction enhances both accuracy and flexibility. However, existing approaches typically treat these control signals separately, largely due to the scarcity of datasets with high-quality joint annotations and mismatched control spaces across modalities. We present VidCRAFT3, a unified and flexible I2V framework that supports both independent and joint control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction by integrating three core components. Image2Cloud reconstructs a 3D point cloud from the reference image to enable precise camera motion control. ObjMotionNet encodes sparse object trajectories into multi-scale optical flow features to guide object motion. The Spatial Triple-Attention Transformer integrates lighting direction embeddings via parallel cross-attention. To address the scarcity of jointly annotated data, we curate the VideoLightingDirection (VLD) dataset of synthetic static-scene video clips with per-frame lighting-direction labels, and adopt a three-stage training strategy that enables robust learning without fully joint annotations. Extensive experiments show that VidCRAFT3 outperforms existing methods in control precision and visual coherence. Code and data will be released.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xun Wang, Zhuoran Li, Hai Zhong, Longbo Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: As a data-driven approach, offline MARL learns superior policies solely from offline datasets, ideal for domains rich in historical data but with high interaction costs and risks. However, most existing methods are task-specific, requiring retraining for new tasks, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. To address this issue, we propose a task-efficient value-based multi-task offline MARL algorithm, Skill-Discovery Conservative Q-Learning (SD-CQL). Unlike existing methods decoding actions from skills via behavior cloning, SD-CQL discovers skills in a latent space by reconstructing the next observation, evaluates fixed and variable actions separately, and uses conservative Q-learning with local value calibration to select the optimal action for each skill. It eliminates the need for local-global alignment and enables strong multi-task generalization from limited, small-scale source tasks. Substantial experiments on StarCraft II demonstrate the superior generalization performance and task-efficiency of SD-CQL. It achieves the best performance on $\textbf{13}$ out of $14$ task sets, with up to $\textbf{68.9%}$ improvement on individual task sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jathurshan Pradeepkumar, Xihao Piao, Zheng Chen, Jimeng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models are reshaping EEG analysis, yet an important problem of EEG tokenization remains a challenge. This paper presents TFM-Tokenizer, a novel tokenization framework that learns a vocabulary of time-frequency motifs from single-channel EEG signals and encodes them into discrete tokens. We propose a dual-path architecture with time-frequency masking to capture robust motif representations, and it is model-agnostic, supporting both lightweight transformers and existing foundation models for downstream tasks. Our study demonstrates three key benefits: Accuracy: Experiments on four diverse EEG benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains across both single- and multi-dataset pretraining settings, achieving up to 17% improvement in Cohen's Kappa over strong baselines. Generalization: Moreover, as a plug-and-play component, it consistently boosts the performance of diverse foundation models, including BIOT and LaBraM. Scalability: By operating at the single-channel level rather than relying on the strict 10-20 EEG system, our method has the potential to be device-agnostic. Experiments on ear-EEG sleep staging, which differs from the pretraining data in signal format, channel configuration, recording device, and task, show that our tokenizer outperforms baselines by 14%. A comprehensive token analysis reveals strong class-discriminative, frequency-aware, and consistent structure, enabling improved representation quality and interpretability.

<p>Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility of automating clinical coding in Russian, a language with limited biomedical resources. We present a new dataset for ICD coding, which includes diagnosis fields from electronic health records (EHRs) annotated with over 10,000 entities and more than 1,500 unique ICD codes. This dataset serves as a benchmark for several state-of-the-art models, including BERT, LLaMA with LoRA, and RAG, with additional experiments examining transfer learning across domains (from PubMed abstracts to medical diagnosis) and terminologies (from UMLS concepts to ICD codes). We then apply the best-performing model to label an in-house EHR dataset containing patient histories from 2017 to 2021. Our experiments, conducted on a carefully curated test set, demonstrate that training with the automated predicted codes leads to a significant improvement in accuracy compared to manually annotated data from physicians. We believe our findings offer valuable insights into the potential for automating clinical coding in resource-limited languages like Russian, which could enhance clinical efficiency and data accuracy in these contexts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adiba Mahbub Proma, Neeley Pate, James Druckman, Gourab Ghoshal, Hangfeng He, Ehsan Hoque</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) can amplify online misinformation, they also show promise in tackling misinformation. In this paper, we empirically study the capabilities of three LLMs -- ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude -- in countering political misinformation. We implement a two-step, chain-of-thought prompting approach, where models first identify credible sources for a given claim and then generate persuasive responses. Our findings suggest that models struggle to ground their responses in real news sources, and tend to prefer citing left-leaning sources. We also observe varying degrees of response diversity among models. Our findings highlight concerns about using LLMs for fact-checking through only prompt-engineering, emphasizing the need for more robust guardrails. Our results have implications for both researchers and non-technical users.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language model evaluations often fail to characterize consequential failure modes, forcing experts to inspect outputs and build new benchmarks. We introduce task elicitation, a method that automatically builds new evaluations to profile model behavior. Task elicitation finds hundreds of natural-language tasks -- an order of magnitude more than prior work -- where frontier models exhibit systematic failures, in domains ranging from forecasting to online harassment. For example, we find that Sonnet 3.5 over-associates quantum computing and AGI and that o3-mini is prone to hallucination when fabrications are repeated in-context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Yan, Yongliang Shen, Yang Liu, Jin Jiang, Mengdi Zhang, Jian Shao, Yueting Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced reasoning in large language models has achieved remarkable performance on challenging tasks, but the prevailing long-context reasoning paradigm faces critical limitations: quadratic computational scaling with sequence length, reasoning constrained by maximum context boundaries, and performance degradation beyond pre-training context windows. Existing approaches primarily compress reasoning chains without addressing the fundamental scaling problem. To overcome these challenges, we introduce InftyThink, a paradigm that transforms monolithic reasoning into an iterative process with intermediate summarization. By interleaving short reasoning segments with concise progress summaries, our approach enables unbounded reasoning depth while maintaining bounded computational costs. This creates a characteristic sawtooth memory pattern that significantly reduces computational complexity compared to traditional approaches. Furthermore, we develop a methodology for reconstructing long-context reasoning datasets into our iterative format, transforming OpenR1-Math into 333K training instances. Experiments across multiple model architectures demonstrate that our approach reduces computational costs while improving performance, with Qwen2.5-Math-7B showing 3-13% improvements across MATH500, AIME24, and GPQA_diamond benchmarks. Our work challenges the assumed trade-off between reasoning depth and computational efficiency, providing a more scalable approach to complex reasoning without architectural modifications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingfa Chen, Yutong Wu, Chenyang Song, Zhen Leng Thai, Xingyu Shen, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) is a widely adopted strategy for reducing the computational cost of attention layers in large language models (LLMs). However, current GQA configurations are often suboptimal because they overlook how context length influences inference cost. Since inference cost grows with context length, the most cost-efficient GQA configuration should also vary accordingly. In this work, we analyze the relationship among context length, model size, GQA configuration, and model loss, and introduce two innovations: (1) we decouple the total head size from the hidden size, enabling more flexible control over attention FLOPs; and (2) we jointly optimize the model size and the GQA configuration to arrive at a better allocation of inference resources between attention layers and other components. Our analysis reveals that commonly used GQA configurations are highly suboptimal for long-context scenarios. More importantly, we propose a recipe for deriving cost-optimal GQA configurations. Our results show that for long-context scenarios, one should use fewer attention heads while scaling up model size. Configurations selected by our recipe can reduce both memory usage and FLOPs by more than 50% compared to Llama-3's GQA, with *no degradation in model capabilities*. Our findings offer valuable insights for designing efficient long-context LLMs. The code is available at https://www.github.com/THUNLP/cost-optimal-gqa .</p>

Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HiRAG achieves significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital platforms used by youth has created significant challenges related to privacy, autonomy, and data protection. While AI-driven personalization offers enhanced user experiences, it often operates without clear ethical boundaries, leaving young users vulnerable to data exploitation and algorithmic biases. This paper presents a call to action for ethical AI governance, advocating for a structured framework that ensures youth-centred privacy protections, transparent data practices, and regulatory oversight. We outline key areas requiring urgent intervention, including algorithmic transparency, privacy education, parental data-sharing ethics, and accountability measures. Through this approach, we seek to empower youth with greater control over their digital identities and propose actionable strategies for policymakers, AI developers, and educators to build a fairer and more accountable AI ecosystem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin-Han Jia, Lan-Zhe Guo, Zhi Zhou, Si-Ye Han, Zi-Wen Li, Yu-Feng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world applications, it is highly challenging to detect anomalous samples with extremely sparse anomalies, as they are highly similar to and thus easily confused with normal samples. Moreover, the number of anomalous samples is inherently scarce. This results in a dual imbalance Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) problem, manifesting at both the macro and micro levels. To address this "needle-in-a-haystack problem", we find that MIL problem can be reformulated as a fine-grained PU learning problem. This allows us to address the imbalance issue in an unbiased manner using micro-level balancing mechanisms. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Balanced Fine-Grained Positive-Unlabeled (BFGPU)-based on rigorous theoretical foundations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BFGPU.</p>

Within this framework, we establish identifiability conditions for general disentangled latent variable models, analyze training dynamics, and derive sample complexity bounds for disentangled latent subspace models. To validate our theory, we conduct disentanglement experiments across diverse tasks and modalities, including subspace recovery in latent subspace Gaussian mixture models, image colorization, image denoising, and voice conversion for speech classification. Additionally, our experiments show that training strategies inspired by our theory, such as style guidance regularization, consistently enhance disentanglement performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Grgur Kova\v{c}, J\'er\'emy Perez, R\'emy Portelas, Peter Ford Dominey, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the creation of online content, creating feedback loops as subsequent generations of models will be trained on this synthetic data. Such loops were shown to lead to distribution shifts - models misrepresenting the true underlying distributions of human data (also called model collapse). However, how human data properties affect such shifts remains poorly understood. In this paper, we provide the first empirical examination of the effect of such properties on the outcome of recursive training. We first confirm that using different human datasets leads to distribution shifts of different magnitudes. Through exhaustive manipulation of dataset properties combined with regression analyses, we then identify a set of properties predicting distribution shift magnitudes. Lexical diversity is found to amplify these shifts, while semantic diversity and data quality mitigate them. Furthermore, we find that these influences are highly modular: data scrapped from a given internet domain has little influence on the content generated for another domain. Finally, experiments on political bias reveal that human data properties affect whether the initial bias will be amplified or reduced. Overall, our results portray a novel view, where different parts of internet may undergo different types of distribution shift.</p>

<p>Abstract: On-device inference offers privacy, offline use, and instant response, but consumer hardware restricts large language models (LLMs) to low throughput and capability. To overcome this challenge, we present prima.cpp, a distributed on-device inference system that runs 30-70B LLMs on consumer home clusters with mixed CPUs/GPUs, insufficient RAM/VRAM, slow disks, Wi-Fi links, and heterogeneous OSs. We introduce pipelined-ring parallelism (PRP) to overlap disk I/O with compute and communication, and address the prefetch-release conflict in mmap-based offloading. We further propose Halda, a heterogeneity-aware scheduler that co-optimizes per-device CPU/GPU workloads and device selection under RAM/VRAM constraints. On four consumer home devices, a 70B model reaches 674 ms/token TPOT with <6% memory pressure, and a 32B model with speculative decoding achieves 26 tokens/s. Compared with llama.cpp, exo, and dllama, our proposed prima.cpp achieves 5-17x lower TPOT, supports fine-grained model sizes from 8B to 70B, ensures broader cross-OS and quantization compatibility, and remains OOM-free, while also being Wi-Fi tolerant, privacy-preserving, and hardware-independent.

<p>Abstract: Navigating dilemmas involving conflicting values is challenging even for humans in high-stakes domains, let alone for AI, yet prior work has been limited to everyday scenarios. To close this gap, we introduce CLASH (Character perspective-based LLM Assessments in Situations with High-stakes), a meticulously curated dataset consisting of 345 high-impact dilemmas along with 3,795 individual perspectives of diverse values. CLASH enables the study of critical yet underexplored aspects of value-based decision-making processes, including understanding of decision ambivalence and psychological discomfort as well as capturing the temporal shifts of values in the perspectives of characters. By benchmarking 14 non-thinking and thinking models, we uncover several key findings. (1) Even strong proprietary models, such as GPT-5 and Claude-4-Sonnet, struggle with ambivalent decisions, achieving only 24.06 and 51.01 accuracy. (2) Although LLMs reasonably predict psychological discomfort, they do not adequately comprehend perspectives involving value shifts. (3) Cognitive behaviors that are effective in the math-solving and game strategy domains do not transfer to value reasoning. Instead, new failure patterns emerge, including early commitment and overcommitment. (4) The steerability of LLMs towards a given value is significantly correlated with their value preferences. (5) Finally, LLMs exhibit greater steerability when reasoning from a third-party perspective, although certain values (e.g., safety) benefit uniquely from first-person framing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toghrul Abbasli, Kentaroh Toyoda, Yuan Wang, Leon Witt, Muhammad Asif Ali, Yukai Miao, Dan Li, Qingsong Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been transformative across many domains. However, hallucination -- confidently outputting incorrect information -- remains one of the leading challenges for LLMs. This raises the question of how to accurately assess and quantify the uncertainty of LLMs. Extensive literature on traditional models has explored Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to measure uncertainty and employed calibration techniques to address the misalignment between uncertainty and accuracy. While some of these methods have been adapted for LLMs, the literature lacks an in-depth analysis of their effectiveness and does not offer a comprehensive benchmark to enable insightful comparison among existing solutions. In this work, we fill this gap via a systematic survey of representative prior works on UQ and calibration for LLMs and introduce a rigorous benchmark. Using two widely used reliability datasets, we empirically evaluate six related methods, which justify the significant findings of our review. Finally, we provide outlooks for key future directions and outline open challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first dedicated study to review the calibration methods and relevant metrics for LLMs.</p>

These local representations are combined with global parameters and decoded to continuous physical fields, enabling effective modeling of complex shape variations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Baumann, Leonardo Ayala, Silvia Seidlitz, Jan Sellner, Alexander Studier-Fischer, Berkin \"Ozdemir, Lena Maier-Hein, Slobodan Ilic</p>
<p>Abstract: Spectral imaging offers promising applications across diverse domains, including medicine and urban scene understanding, and is already established as a critical modality in remote sensing. However, variability in channel dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce CARL, a model for Camera-Agnostic Representation Learning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel dimensionality to a camera-agnostic representation, we introduce a novel spectral encoder, featuring a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism, to distill salient spectral information into learned spectral representations. Spatio-spectral pre-training is achieved with a novel feature-based self-supervision strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for future spectral foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kushagra Agrawal, Nisharg Nargund</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are foundational in simulating complex real-world scenarios involving autonomous, interacting entities. However, traditional MAS architectures often suffer from rigid coordination mechanisms and difficulty adapting to dynamic tasks. We propose MetaOrch, a neural orchestration framework for optimal agent selection in multi-domain task environments. Our system implements a supervised learning approach that models task context, agent histories, and expected response quality to select the most appropriate agent for each task. A novel fuzzy evaluation module scores agent responses along completeness, relevance, and confidence dimensions, generating soft supervision labels for training the orchestrator. Unlike previous methods that hard-code agent-task mappings, MetaOrch dynamically predicts the most suitable agent while estimating selection confidence. Experiments in simulated environments with heterogeneous agents demonstrate that our approach achieves 86.3% selection accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline strategies including random selection and round-robin scheduling. The modular architecture emphasizes extensibility, allowing agents to be registered, updated, and queried independently. Results suggest that neural orchestration offers a powerful approach to enhancing the autonomy, interpretability, and adaptability of multi-agent systems across diverse task domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: We use the notion of oracle machines and reductions from computability theory to formalise different Human-in-the-loop (HITL) setups for AI systems, distinguishing between trivial human monitoring (i.e., total functions), single endpoint human action (i.e., many-one reductions), and highly involved human-AI interaction (i.e., Turing reductions). We then proceed to show that the legal status and safety of different setups vary greatly. We present a taxonomy to categorise HITL failure modes, highlighting the practical limitations of HITL setups. We then identify omissions in UK and EU legal frameworks, which focus on HITL setups that may not always achieve the desired ethical, legal, and sociotechnical outcomes. We suggest areas where the law should recognise the effectiveness of different HITL setups and assign responsibility in these contexts, avoiding human "scapegoating". Our work shows an unavoidable trade-off between attribution of legal responsibility, and technical explainability. Overall, we show how HITL setups involve many technical design decisions, and can be prone to failures out of the humans' control. Our formalisation and taxonomy opens up a new analytic perspective on the challenges in creating HITL setups, helping inform AI developers and lawmakers on designing HITL setups to better achieve their desired outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mike Zhang, Johannes Bjerva, Russa Biswas</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce fs1, a simple yet effective method that improves the factuality of reasoning traces by sourcing them from large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) and grounding them by conditioning on knowledge graph (KG) paths. We fine-tune eight instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) on 3.9K factually grounded reasoning traces and rigorously evaluate them on six complex open-domain question-answering (QA) benchmarks encompassing 23.9K questions. Our results demonstrate that our fs1-tuned model (32B parameters) consistently outperforms instruction-tuned counterparts with parallel sampling by 6-14 absolute points (pass@$16$). Our detailed analysis shows that fs1 considerably improves model performance over more complex questions (requiring 3 or more hops on KG paths) and numerical answer types compared to the baselines. Furthermore, in single-pass inference, we notice that smaller LLMs show the most improvements. While prior works demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning traces primarily in the STEM domains, our work shows strong evidence that anchoring reasoning to factual KG paths is a critical step in transforming LLMs for reliable knowledge-intensive tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anjiang Wei, Tarun Suresh, Huanmi Tan, Yinglun Xu, Gagandeep Singh, Ke Wang, Alex Aiken</p>
<p>Abstract: Superoptimization is the task of transforming a program into a faster one while preserving its input-output behavior. In this work, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as superoptimizers, generating assembly programs that outperform code already optimized by industry-standard compilers. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for this problem, consisting of 8,072 real-world assembly programs averaging 130 lines, in contrast to prior datasets restricted to 2-15 straight-line, loop-free programs. We evaluate 23 LLMs on this benchmark and find that the strongest baseline, Claude-opus-4, achieves a 51.5% test-passing rate and a 1.43x average speedup over gcc -O3. To further enhance performance, we fine-tune models with reinforcement learning, optimizing a reward function that integrates correctness and performance speedup. Starting from Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct (61.4% correctness, 1.10x speedup), the fine-tuned model SuperCoder attains 95.0% correctness and 1.46x average speedup. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that LLMs can be applied as superoptimizers for assembly programs, establishing a foundation for future research in program performance optimization beyond compiler heuristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Li, Aoi Naito, Hirokazu Shirado</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced problem-solving through distributed information integration, but may also replicate collective reasoning failures observed in human groups. Yet the absence of a theory-grounded benchmark makes it difficult to systematically evaluate and improve such reasoning. We introduce HiddenBench, the first benchmark for evaluating collective reasoning in multi-agent LLMs. It builds on the Hidden Profile paradigm from social psychology, where individuals each hold asymmetric pieces of information and must communicate to reach the correct decision. To ground the benchmark, we formalize the paradigm with custom tasks and show that GPT-4.1 groups fail to integrate distributed knowledge, exhibiting human-like collective reasoning failures that persist even with varied prompting strategies. We then construct the full benchmark, spanning 65 tasks drawn from custom designs, prior human studies, and automatic generation. Evaluating 15 LLMs across four model families, HiddenBench exposes persistent limitations while also providing comparative insights: some models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Flash/Pro) achieve higher performance, yet scale and reasoning are not reliable indicators of stronger collective reasoning. Our work delivers the first reproducible benchmark for collective reasoning in multi-agent LLMs, offering diagnostic insight and a foundation for future research on artificial collective intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Li, Yupeng Su, Songmiao Wang, Runming Yang, Congkai Xie, Aofan Liu, Ming Li, Jiannong Cao, Yuan Xie, Ngai Wong, Hongxia Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) is a practical route to deploy reasoning-capable LLMs under tight memory and latency budgets, yet it can markedly impair mathematical reasoning (drops up to 69.81% in our harder settings). We address two deployment-critical questions with process-level precision: Where along a step-structured solution does degradation first arise? How to mitigate it while staying in the low-bit regime? Across widely used PTQ methods (AWQ, GPTQ, SmoothQuant), open-source model families (Qwen, LLaMA; 0.5--7B), and math reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, AIME), we perform format-aligned chain-of-thought with step-aligned attribution and uncover two robust regularities: (i) PTQ disproportionately elevates method and execution errors relative to high-level conceptual mistakes; and (ii) failures emerge early, with the first vulnerable step flipping and cascading to the final answer. These regularities suggest a general intervention principle: restore local token-level margins exactly at the earliest failure frontier. We instantiate this principle as a lightweight measure$\rightarrow$locate$\rightarrow$restore loop that operates directly on the quantized model: detect the first faulty step, construct our "Silver Bullet" datasets, and apply small-scale supervised/preference tuning. In our settings, as few as 332 curated examples and 3--5 minutes of compute on a single GPU recover 4-bit weight math reasoning toward the full-precision baseline while preserving PTQ efficiency. Our framework is quantizer- and architecture-agnostic within the evaluated regimes, and turns low-bit degradation from a global accuracy problem into a local, reproducible process intervention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tunyu Zhang, Haizhou Shi, Yibin Wang, Hengyi Wang, Xiaoxiao He, Zhuowei Li, Haoxian Chen, Ligong Han, Kai Xu, Huan Zhang, Dimitris Metaxas, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, their output quality remains inconsistent across various application scenarios, making it difficult to identify trustworthy responses, especially in complex tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we propose a Token-level Uncertainty estimation framework for Reasoning (TokUR) that enables LLMs to self-assess and self-improve their responses in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we introduce low-rank random weight perturbation during LLM decoding to generate predictive distributions for token-level uncertainty estimation, and we aggregate these uncertainty quantities to capture the semantic uncertainty of generated responses. Experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets of varying difficulty demonstrate that TokUR exhibits a strong correlation with answer correctness and model robustness, and the uncertainty signals produced by TokUR can be leveraged to enhance the model's reasoning performance at test time. These results highlight the effectiveness of TokUR as a principled and scalable approach for improving the reliability and interpretability of LLMs in challenging reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feijiang Han, Xiaodong Yu, Jianheng Tang, Delip Rao, Weihua Du, Lyle Ungar</p>
<p>Abstract: Token-level attention tuning, a class of training-free methods including Post-hoc Attention Steering (PASTA) and Attention Calibration (ACT), has emerged as a promising way to improve frozen LLMs with interpretable interventions. However, these methods depend on auxiliary heuristics to identify "important" task-specific tokens, which can introduce bias and limit applicability when token importance is unclear or when using optimized kernels where attention maps are inaccessible. We propose a simpler and more elegant alternative: acting only on the initial token (e.g., <BOS> in LLaMA). We show theoretically that adding lightweight biases to this token's attention logits monotonically controls the entropy of the downstream attention distribution - an effect amplified by its natural function as an attention sink. Our empirical analysis reveals that this tuning process can positively affect LLMs and better unlock their pretrained knowledge, with stronger effects in early layers and distinct scaling preferences across attention heads. Building on these insights, we introduce ZeroTuning: a training-free method that improves LLM performance by applying head-specific attention adjustments to the initial token, requiring zero parameter updates. We present two variants: a supervised mode that calibrates on validation examples, and a novel unsupervised mode that directly minimizes the model's output entropy. The method is lightweight, kernel-agnostic, and requires only four lines of modification to the standard LlamaAttention code. It achieves broad gains across 15 datasets and outperforms previous, more complex methods; for instance, with Llama-3.1-8B, it yields relative improvements of 19.9% on classification, 4.5% on question answering, and 2.1% on dialogue. ZeroTuning also works out-of-the-box with quantized inference and maintains its performance improvements with increasing context lengths.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Chanin, Tom\'a\v{s} Dulka, Adri\`a Garriga-Alonso</p>
<p>Abstract: It is assumed that sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose polysemantic activations into interpretable linear directions, as long as the activations are composed of sparse linear combinations of underlying features. However, we find that if an SAE is more narrow than the number of underlying "true features" on which it is trained, and there is correlation between features, the SAE will merge components of correlated features together, thus destroying monosemanticity. In LLM SAEs, these two conditions are almost certainly true. This phenomenon, which we call feature hedging, is caused by SAE reconstruction loss, and is more severe the narrower the SAE. In this work, we introduce the problem of feature hedging and study it both theoretically in toy models and empirically in SAEs trained on LLMs. We suspect that feature hedging may be one of the core reasons that SAEs consistently underperform supervised baselines. Finally, we use our understanding of feature hedging to propose an improved variant of matryoshka SAEs. Importantly, our work shows that SAE width is not a neutral hyperparameter: narrower SAEs suffer more from hedging than wider SAEs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minsu Kim, Jean-Pierre Falet, Oliver E. Richardson, Xiaoyin Chen, Moksh Jain, Sungjin Ahn, Sungsoo Ahn, Yoshua Bengio</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has advanced the capabilities and transparency of language models (LMs); however, reasoning chains can contain inaccurate statements that reduce performance and trustworthiness. To address this, we propose to augment each reasoning step in a CoT with a latent veracity (or correctness) variable. To efficiently explore this expanded space, we introduce Veracity Search (VS), a discrete search algorithm over veracity assignments. It performs otherwise intractable inference in the posterior distribution over latent veracity values by leveraging the LM's joint likelihood over veracity and the final answer as a proxy reward. This efficient inference-time verification method facilitates supervised fine-tuning of an Amortized Veracity Inference (AVI) machine by providing pseudo-labels for veracity. AVI generalizes VS, enabling accurate zero-shot veracity inference in novel contexts. Empirical results demonstrate that VS reliably identifies errors in logical (ProntoQA), mathematical (GSM8K), and commonsense (CommonsenseQA) reasoning benchmarks, with AVI achieving comparable zero-shot accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of latent veracity inference for providing feedback during self-correction and self-improvement.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12143">Structured Relational Representations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Arun Kumar, Paul Schrater</p>
<p>Abstract: Invariant representations are core to representation learning, yet a central challenge remains: uncovering invariants that are stable and transferable without suppressing task-relevant signals. This raises fundamental questions, requiring further inquiry, about the appropriate level of abstraction at which such invariants should be defined and which aspects of a system they should characterize. Interpretation of the environment relies on abstract knowledge structures to make sense of the current state, which leads to interactions, essential drivers of learning and knowledge acquisition. Interpretation operates at the level of higher-order relational knowledge; hence, we propose that invariant structures must be where knowledge resides, specifically as partitions defined by the closure of relational paths within an abstract knowledge space. These partitions serve as the core invariant representations, forming the structural substrate where knowledge is stored and learning occurs. On the other hand, inter-partition connectors enable the deployment of these knowledge partitions encoding task-relevant transitions. Thus, invariant partitions provide the foundational primitives of structured representation. We formalize the computational foundations for structured relational representations of the invariant partitions based on closed semiring, a relational algebraic structure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiqiang Wu, Runming Yang, Jiayi Li, Pengfei Hu, Yik-Chung Wu, Ngai Wong, Yujiu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) consistently benefit from further fine-tuning on various tasks. However, we observe that directly tuning the Instruct (i.e., instruction-tuned) models often leads to marginal improvements and even performance degeneration. Notably, paired Base models, the foundation for these Instruct variants, contain highly similar weight values (i.e., less than 2% on average for Llama 3.1 8B). The Base model tends to be a good learner yet a weak backbone without post-training. Therefore, we propose a novel Shadow-FT framework to tune the Instruct models by leveraging the corresponding Base models. The key insight is to fine-tune the Base model, and then \textit{directly} graft the learned weight updates to the Instruct model. Our proposed Shadow-FT introduces no additional parameters, is easy to implement, and significantly improves performance. We conduct extensive experiments on tuning mainstream LLMs, such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3 series, and evaluate them across 19 benchmarks covering coding, reasoning, and mathematical tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Shadow-FT consistently outperforms conventional full-parameter and parameter-efficient tuning approaches. Further analyses indicate that Shadow-FT can be applied to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and combined with direct preference optimization~(DPO).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Claudius Kienle, Benjamin Alt, Oleg Arenz, Jan Peters</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain models enable autonomous agents to solve long-horizon tasks by producing interpretable plans. However, in open-world environments, a single general domain model cannot capture the variety of tasks, so agents must generate suitable task-specific models on the fly. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their implicit common knowledge, can generate such domains, but suffer from high error rates that limit their applicability. Hence, related work relies on extensive human feed-back or prior knowledge, which undermines autonomous, open-world deployment. In this work, we propose LODGE, a framework for autonomous domain learning from LLMs and environment grounding. LODGE builds on hierarchical abstractions and automated simulations to identify and correct inconsistencies between abstraction layers and between the model and environment. Our framework is task-agnostic, as it generates predicates, operators, and their preconditions and effects, while only assuming access to a simulator and a set of generic, executable low-level skills. Experiments on two International Planning Competition ( IPC) domains and a robotic assembly domain show that LODGE yields more accurate domain models and higher task success than existing methods, requiring remarkably few environment interactions and no human feedback or demonstrations.</p>

We leverage Qwen-Audio-Chat fine-tuned on three datasets collected in-situ from hospital patients, and present a multifaceted evaluation framework encompassing a safety assessment to mitigate diagnostic biases, cross-lingual performance analysis, and modality ablation studies. VocalAgent demonstrates superior accuracy on voice disorder classification compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Its LLM-based method offers a scalable solution for broader adoption of health diagnostics, while underscoring the importance of ethical and technical validation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojie Gu, Ziying Huang, Jia-Chen Gu, Kai Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Lifelong learning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving information by continually updating their internal knowledge. An ideal system should support efficient, wide-ranging updates while preserving existing capabilities and ensuring reliable deployment. Model editing stands out as a promising solution for this goal, offering a focused and efficient way to revise a model's internal knowledge. Although recent paradigms have made notable progress, they often struggle to meet the demands of practical lifelong adaptation at scale. To bridge this gap, we propose UltraEdit, a training-, subject-, and memory-free approach that is well-suited for ultra-scalable, real-world lifelong model editing. UltraEdit fundamentally differs from traditional paradigms by computing parameter shifts in one step using only a hidden state and its gradient, making the approach simple yet efficient. To improve scalability in lifelong settings, UltraEdit employs a lifelong normalization strategy that continuously updates feature statistics across turns, allowing it to adapt to distributional shifts and maintain consistency over time. UltraEdit achieves editing speeds over 7x faster than the previous state-of-the-art method, which was also the fastest known approach, while using less than 1/4 the VRAM. This makes it the only method currently capable of editing a 7B LLM on a 24GB consumer-grade GPU. Furthermore, we construct UltraEditBench, the largest dataset in the field to date with over 2M editing pairs, and demonstrate that our method supports up to 2M edits while maintaining high accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on five datasets and six models show that UltraEdit consistently achieves superior performance across diverse model editing scenarios, taking a further step towards safe and scalable lifelong learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pinxin Liu, Haiyang Liu, Luchuan Song, Jason J. Corso, Chenliang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: When humans speak, gestures help convey communicative intentions, such as adding emphasis or describing concepts. However, current co-speech gesture generation methods rely solely on superficial linguistic cues (e.g. speech audio or text transcripts), neglecting to understand and leverage the communicative intention that underpins human gestures. This results in outputs that are rhythmically synchronized with speech but are semantically shallow. To address this gap, we introduce Intentional-Gesture, a novel framework that casts gesture generation as an intention-reasoning task grounded in high-level communicative functions. First, we curate the InG dataset by augmenting BEAT-2 with gesture-intention annotations (i.e., text sentences summarizing intentions), which are automatically annotated using large vision-language models. Next, we introduce the Intentional Gesture Motion Tokenizer to leverage these intention annotations. It injects high-level communicative functions (e.g., intentions) into tokenized motion representations to enable intention-aware gesture synthesis that are both temporally aligned and semantically meaningful, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on the BEAT-2 benchmark. Our framework offers a modular foundation for expressive gesture generation in digital humans and embodied AI. Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Intentional-Gesture</p>

<p>Abstract: Why are state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) not designed to exploit natural geometric symmetries such as 90-degree rotations and reflections? In this paper, we argue that there is no fundamental reason, and what has been missing is an efficient implementation. To this end, we introduce Octic Vision Transformers (octic ViTs) which rely on octic group equivariance to capture these symmetries. In contrast to prior equivariant models that increase computational cost, our octic linear layers achieve 5.33x reductions in FLOPs and up to 8x reductions in memory compared to ordinary linear layers. In full octic ViT blocks the computational reductions approach the reductions in the linear layers with increased embedding dimension. We study two new families of ViTs, built from octic blocks, that are either fully octic equivariant or break equivariance in the last part of the network. Training octic ViTs supervised (DeiT-III) and unsupervised (DINOv2) on ImageNet-1K, we find that they match baseline accuracy while at the same time providing substantial efficiency gains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miao Yu, Liang Lin, Guibin Zhang, Xinfeng Li, Junfeng Fang, Xingrui Yu, Ivor Tsang, Ningyu Zhang, Kun Wang, Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require iterative updates to address the outdated information problem, where LLM unlearning offers an approach for selective removal. However, mainstream unlearning methods primarily rely on fine-tuning techniques, which often lack precision in targeted unlearning and struggle to balance unlearning efficacy with general ability under massive and sequential settings. To bridge this gap, in this work, we introduce UniErase, a novel unlearning framework that demonstrates precision and balanced performances between knowledge unlearning and ability retaining. We first propose the Unlearning Token, which is optimized to steer LLMs toward a forgetting space. To achieve concrete unlearning behaviors, we further introduce the lightweight Unlearning Edit to efficiently associate the unlearning targets with this meta-token. Serving as a new unlearning paradigm via editing, UniErase achieves outstanding performances across batch, sequential, and precise unlearning tasks under fictitious and real-world knowledge scenarios. On the TOFU benchmark, compared with 8 baselines, UniErase, modifying only $\sim$ \textbf{3.66%} of the LLM parameters, outperforms the previous best-forgetting baseline by \textbf{$\sim$ 4.01$\times$} for \textbf{model ability} with even higher unlearning efficacy. Similarly, UniErase, with better ability retention, also surpasses the previous best-retaining method by \textbf{35.96%} for \textbf{unlearning efficacy}, showing balanced and dual top-tier performances in the current unlearning community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruizhe Li, Chen Chen, Yuchen Hu, Yanjun Gao, Xi Wang, Emine Yilmaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs) combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context (ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context sentences without additional fine-tuning, gradient-calculation or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG models and how they affect RAG behaviours.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Song Jin, Juntian Zhang, Yuhan Liu, Xun Zhang, Yufei Zhang, Guojun Yin, Fei Jiang, Wei Lin, Rui Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating and iterating upon recommender systems is crucial, yet traditional A/B testing is resource-intensive, and offline methods struggle with dynamic user-platform interactions. While agent-based simulation is promising, existing platforms often lack a mechanism for user actions to dynamically reshape the environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce RecInter, a novel agent-based simulation platform for recommender systems featuring a robust interaction mechanism. In RecInter platform, simulated user actions (e.g., likes, reviews, purchases) dynamically update item attributes in real-time, and introduced Merchant Agents can reply, fostering a more realistic and evolving ecosystem. High-fidelity simulation is ensured through Multidimensional User Profiling module, Advanced Agent Architecture, and LLM fine-tuned on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enriched interaction data. Our platform achieves significantly improved simulation credibility and successfully replicates emergent phenomena like Brand Loyalty and the Matthew Effect. Experiments demonstrate that this interaction mechanism is pivotal for simulating realistic system evolution, establishing our platform as a credible testbed for recommender systems research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunjin Seo, Taewon Kim, Sihyun Yu, SungSoo Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Xu, Xiang Yue, Yang Liu, Qingqing Ye, Huadi Zheng, Peizhao Hu, Minxin Du, Haibo Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) aims to remove specified data, but its efficacy is typically assessed with task-level metrics like accuracy and perplexity. We demonstrate that these metrics are often misleading, as models can appear to forget while their original behavior is easily restored through minimal fine-tuning. This phenomenon of \emph{reversibility} suggests that information is merely suppressed, not genuinely erased. To address this critical evaluation gap, we introduce a \emph{representation-level analysis framework}. Our toolkit comprises PCA-based similarity and shift, centered kernel alignment (CKA), and Fisher information, complemented by a summary metric, the mean PCA distance, to measure representational drift. Applying this framework across six unlearning methods, three data domains, and two LLMs, we identify four distinct forgetting regimes based on their \emph{reversibility} and \emph{catastrophicity}. Our analysis reveals that achieving the ideal state--irreversible, non-catastrophic forgetting--is exceptionally challenging. By probing the limits of unlearning, we identify a case of seemingly irreversible, targeted forgetting, offering new insights for designing more robust erasure algorithms. Our findings expose a fundamental gap in current evaluation practices and establish a representation-level foundation for trustworthy unlearning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noah Amsel, David Persson, Christopher Musco, Robert M. Gower</p>
<p>Abstract: Computing the polar decomposition and the related matrix sign function has been a well-studied problem in numerical analysis for decades. Recently, it has emerged as an important subroutine within the Muon algorithm for training deep neural networks. However, the requirements of this application differ sharply from classical settings: deep learning demands GPU-friendly algorithms that prioritize high throughput over high precision. We introduce Polar Express, a new method for computing the polar decomposition. Like Newton-Schulz and other classical polynomial methods, our approach uses only matrix-matrix multiplications, making it very efficient on GPUs. Inspired by earlier work of Chen & Chow and Nakatsukasa & Freund, Polar Express adapts the update rule at each iteration by solving a minimax optimization problem. We prove that this strategy minimizes error in a worst-case sense, allowing Polar Express to converge as rapidly as possible both in the early iterations and asymptotically. We also address finite-precision issues, making it practical to use in bfloat16. When integrated into the Muon training framework, our method leads to consistent improvements in validation loss when training a GPT-2 model on one billion tokens from the FineWeb dataset, outperforming recent alternatives across a range of learning rates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adnan Oomerjee, Zafeirios Fountas, Haitham Bou-Ammar, Jun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer LLMs have been shown to exhibit strong reasoning ability that scales with inference-time compute, most prominently through token-space "thinking" chains of thought. A growing line of work pushes extra computation into the model's latent space, which we term Auxiliary Latent-Space Computation (ALSC). Existing ALSC methods largely fall into three buckets: (i) token-mediated latent rollouts, (ii) residual/activation steering, and (iii) memory (KV) compression. An underexplored alternative is memory consolidation/reconsolidation, two processes in the brain that are responsible for stabilising newly formed memory traces, and, upon recall, transiently rendering established traces plastic such they can integrate new contextual information before restabilising. In Transformer LLMs, this can be seen as analogous to performing in-place rewrites of new KV segments, and rewrites of recalled past segments. In this work, we give a theoretical justification as to why memory (re)consolidation via KV cache rewrites is beneficial for improved reasoning. We do this through the lens of Information Bottleneck (IB) theory, which posits that model generalisation emerges from an optimal balance between input information compression and retention of predictive information in latent representations. We then introduce the Bottlenecked Transformer, which augments a backbone LLM with a Cache Processor, an auxiliary Transformer that performs periodic, non-causal, in-place KV rewrites at newline-delimited reasoning step boundaries. The Processor consolidates recently written KV entries and reconsolidates a small, top-k attention-selected set of prior entries. We evaluate our Bottlenecked Transformer architecture on math reasoning benchmarks. Our model sees consistent performance gains over vanilla Transformers and pause-token augmented baselines, with gains of up to +6.6pp for selected tasks/backbones.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text segmentation based on the semantic meaning of sentences is a fundamental task with broad utility in many downstream applications. In this paper, we propose a graphical model-based unsupervised learning approach, named BP-Seg for efficient text segmentation. Our method not only considers local coherence, capturing the intuition that adjacent sentences are often more related, but also effectively groups sentences that are distant in the text yet semantically similar. This is achieved through belief propagation on the carefully constructed graphical models. Experimental results on both an illustrative example and a dataset with long-form documents demonstrate that our method performs favorably compared to competing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Shani, Liron Soffer, Dan Jurafsky, Yann LeCun, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans organize knowledge into compact categories that balance compression with semantic meaning preservation. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate striking linguistic abilities, yet whether they achieve this same balance remains unclear. We apply the Information Bottleneck principle to quantitatively compare how LLMs and humans navigate this compression-meaning trade-off. Analyzing embeddings from 40+ LLMs against classic human categorization benchmarks, we uncover three key findings. First, LLMs broadly align with human categories but miss fine-grained semantic distinctions crucial for human understanding. Second, LLMs demonstrate aggressive statistical compression, achieving ``optimal'' information-theoretic efficiency, while humans prioritize contextual richness and adaptive flexibility. Third, encoder models surprisingly outperform decoder models in human alignment, suggesting that generation and understanding rely on distinct mechanisms in current architectures. In addition, training dynamics analysis reveals that conceptual structure develops in distinct phases: rapid initial formation followed by architectural reorganization, with semantic processing migrating from deeper to mid-network layers as models discover more efficient encoding. These divergent strategies, where LLMs optimize for compression and humans for adaptive utility, reveal fundamental differences between artificial and biological intelligence, guiding development toward more human-aligned AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ionut-Vlad Modoranu, Mher Safaryan, Erik Schultheis, Max Ryabinin, Artem Chumachenko, Dan Alistarh</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank optimization has emerged as a promising direction in training large language models (LLMs) to improve running time and reduce the memory usage of adaptive optimizers by constraining learning to a lower-dimensional space. Prior work typically projects gradients of linear layers using approaches based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or QR-decomposition. Applying these techniques individually to each layer in large models is computationally expensive and incurs additional memory costs due to storing the projection matrices. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient and conceptually simple, two-step procedure to approximate SVD/QR-based gradient projections into lower-dimensional spaces by using a predefined orthogonal matrix of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We dynamically select columns from the DCT matrix based on their alignment with the gradient of each layer. The effective projection matrices are obtained via a simple matmul with the DCT matrix in $O(n^3)$ time, followed by a lightweight sorting step to identify the most relevant basis vectors. For large layers, DCT can be computed via Makhoul's $N$-point algorithm based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in $O(n^2 \log(n))$ time. Due to the predefined nature of the orthogonal bases, they are computed once at the start of training. Our numerical experiments on both pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual strategy in approximating optimal low-rank projections, obtaining an approach with rank-independent running time that matches the performance of costly SVD/QR-based methods while achieving faster runtime and reduced memory usage by up to $25\%$ across different model sizes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Cheng, Zhixun Li, Yuhan Li, Yixin Song, Kangyi Zhao, Dawei Cheng, Jia Li, Hong Cheng, Jeffrey Xu Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays, real-world data, including graph-structure data, often arrives in a streaming manner, which means that learning systems need to continuously acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information. Although substantial existing works attempt to address catastrophic forgetting in graph machine learning, they are all based on training from scratch with streaming data. With the rise of pretrained models, an increasing number of studies have leveraged their strong generalization ability for continual learning. Therefore, in this work, we attempt to answer whether large language models (LLMs) can mitigate catastrophic forgetting in Graph Continual Learning (GCL). We first point out that current experimental setups for GCL have significant flaws, as the evaluation stage may lead to task ID leakage. Then, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in more realistic scenarios and find that even minor modifications can lead to outstanding results. Finally, based on extensive experiments, we propose a simple-yet-effective method, Simple Graph Continual Learning (SimGCL), that surpasses the previous state-of-the-art GNN-based baseline by around 20% under the rehearsal-free constraint. To facilitate reproducibility, we have developed an easy-to-use benchmark LLM4GCL for training and evaluating existing GCL methods. The code is available at: https://github.com/ZhixunLEE/LLM4GCL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiding Wang, Fauxu Meng, Xuefeng Zhang, Fan Jiang, Pingzhi Tang, Muhan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for large language models (LLMs), such as LoRA and PiSSA, constrain model updates to low-rank subspaces, limiting their expressiveness and leading to suboptimal performance on complex tasks. To address this, we introduce High-rank Distributed PiSSA (HD-PiSSA), a distributed PEFT approach that initializes orthogonal adapters across different devices and aggregates their delta updates collectively on W for fine-tuning. Unlike Data Parallel LoRA or PiSSA, which maintain identical adapters across all devices, HD-PiSSA assigns different principal components of the pre-trained weights to each GPU, significantly expanding the range of update directions. This results in over 16x higher effective updated ranks than data-parallel LoRA or PiSSA when fine-tuning on 8 GPUs with the same per-device adapter rank. Empirically, we evaluate HD-PiSSA across various challenging downstream tasks, including mathematics, code generation, and multi-task learning. In the multi-task setting, HD-PiSSA achieves average gains of 10.0 absolute points (14.63%) over LoRA and 4.98 points (6.60%) over PiSSA across 12 benchmarks, demonstrating its benefits from the extra optimization flexibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingjia Shen, Hao Wang, Chuan Qin, Ruijun Sun, Yang Song, Defu Lian, Hengshu Zhu, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-domain question answering (OpenQA) represents a cornerstone in natural language processing (NLP), primarily focused on extracting answers from unstructured textual data. With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based OpenQA methods have reaped the benefits of emergent understanding and answering capabilities enabled by massive parameters compared to traditional methods. However, most of these methods encounter two critical challenges: how to integrate knowledge into LLMs effectively and how to adaptively generate results with specific answer formats for various task situations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named GenKI, which aims to improve the OpenQA performance by exploring Knowledge Integration and controllable Generation on LLMs simultaneously. Specifically, we first train a dense passage retrieval model to retrieve associated knowledge from a given knowledge base. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge integration model that incorporates the retrieval knowledge into instructions during fine-tuning to intensify the model. Furthermore, to enable controllable generation in LLMs, we leverage a certain fine-tuned LLM and an ensemble based on text consistency incorporating all coherence, fluency, and answer format assurance. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, MSMARCO, and CMRC2018 datasets, featuring diverse answer formats, have demonstrated the effectiveness of GenKI with comparison of state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, ablation studies have disclosed a linear relationship between the frequency of retrieved knowledge and the model's ability to recall knowledge accurately against the ground truth.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruishuo Chen, Xun Wang, Rui Hu, Zhuoran Li, Longbo Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are effective at sampling diverse, high-reward objects, but in many real-world settings where new reward queries are infeasible, they must be trained from offline datasets. The prevailing proxy-based training methods are susceptible to error propagation, while existing proxy-free approaches often use coarse constraints that limit exploration. To address these issues, we propose Trajectory-Distilled GFlowNet (TD-GFN), a novel proxy-free training framework. TD-GFN learns dense, transition-level edge rewards from offline trajectories via inverse reinforcement learning to provide rich structural guidance for efficient exploration. Crucially, to ensure robustness, these rewards are used indirectly to guide the policy through DAG pruning and prioritized backward sampling of training trajectories. This ensures that final gradient updates depend only on ground-truth terminal rewards from the dataset, thereby preventing the error propagation. Experiments show that TD-GFN significantly outperforms a broad range of existing baselines in both convergence speed and final sample quality, establishing a more robust and efficient paradigm for offline GFlowNet training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Biomedical researchers increasingly rely on large-scale structured databases for complex analytical tasks. However, current text-to-SQL systems often struggle to map qualitative scientific questions into executable SQL, particularly when implicit domain reasoning is required. We introduce BiomedSQL, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate scientific reasoning in text-to-SQL generation over a real-world biomedical knowledge base. BiomedSQL comprises 68,000 question/SQL query/answer triples grounded in a harmonized BigQuery knowledge base that integrates gene-disease associations, causal inference from omics data, and drug approval records. Each question requires models to infer domain-specific criteria, such as genome-wide significance thresholds, effect directionality, or trial phase filtering, rather than rely on syntactic translation alone. We evaluate a range of open- and closed-source LLMs across prompting strategies and interaction paradigms. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap: GPT-o3-mini achieves 59.0% execution accuracy, while our custom multi-step agent, BMSQL, reaches 62.6%, both well below the expert baseline of 90.0%. BiomedSQL provides a new foundation for advancing text-to-SQL systems capable of supporting scientific discovery through robust reasoning over structured biomedical knowledge bases.

<p>Abstract: Learning PDE dynamics from limited data with unknown physics is challenging. Existing neural PDE solvers either require large datasets or rely on known physics (e.g., PDE residuals or handcrafted stencils), leading to limited applicability. To address these challenges, we propose Spectral-Inspired Neural Operator (SINO), which can model complex systems from just 2-5 trajectories, without requiring explicit PDE terms. Specifically, SINO automatically captures both local and global spatial derivatives from frequency indices, enabling a compact representation of the underlying differential operators in physics-agnostic regimes. To model nonlinear effects, it employs a Pi-block that performs multiplicative operations on spectral features, complemented by a low-pass filter to suppress aliasing. Extensive experiments on both 2D and 3D PDE benchmarks demonstrate that SINO achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of 1-2 orders of magnitude in accuracy. Particularly, with only 5 training trajectories, SINO outperforms data-driven methods trained on 1000 trajectories and remains predictive on challenging out-of-distribution cases where other methods fail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaomeng Yang, Zhiyu Tan, Junyan Wang, Zhijian Zhou, Hao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference learning has become a central technique for aligning generative models with human expectations. Recently, it has been extended to diffusion models through methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, existing approaches such as Diffusion-DPO suffer from two key challenges: timestep-dependent instability, caused by a mismatch between the reverse and forward diffusion processes and by high gradient variance in early noisy timesteps, and off-policy bias arising from the mismatch between optimization and data collection policies. We begin by analyzing the reverse diffusion trajectory and observe that instability primarily occurs at early timesteps with low importance weights. To address these issues, we first propose DPO-C\&M, a practical strategy that improves stability by clipping and masking uninformative timesteps while partially mitigating off-policy bias. Building on this, we introduce SDPO (Importance-Sampled Direct Preference Optimization), a principled framework that incorporates importance sampling into the objective to fully correct for off-policy bias and emphasize informative updates during the diffusion process. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B, CogVideoX-5B, and Wan2.1-1.3B demonstrate that both methods outperform standard Diffusion-DPO, with SDPO achieving superior VBench scores, human preference alignment, and training robustness. These results highlight the importance of timestep-aware, distribution-corrected optimization in diffusion-based preference learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adaptive navigation in unfamiliar environments is crucial for household service robots but remains challenging due to the need for both low-level path planning and high-level scene understanding. While recent vision-language model (VLM) based zero-shot approaches reduce dependence on prior maps and scene-specific training data, they face significant limitations: spatiotemporal discontinuity from discrete observations, unstructured memory representations, and insufficient task understanding leading to navigation failures. We propose DORAEMON (Decentralized Ontology-aware Reliable Agent with Enhanced Memory Oriented Navigation), a novel cognitive-inspired framework consisting of Ventral and Dorsal Streams that mimics human navigation capabilities. The Dorsal Stream implements the Hierarchical Semantic-Spatial Fusion and Topology Map to handle spatiotemporal discontinuities, while the Ventral Stream combines RAG-VLM and Policy-VLM to improve decision-making. Our approach also develops Nav-Ensurance to ensure navigation safety and efficiency. We evaluate DORAEMON on the HM3D, MP3D, and GOAT datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on both success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL) metrics, significantly outperforming existing methods. We also introduce a new evaluation metric (AORI) to assess navigation intelligence better. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DORAEMON's effectiveness in zero-shot autonomous navigation without requiring prior map building or pre-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Albert Tseng, Zhaofeng Sun, Christopher De Sa</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of quantization is to produce a compressed model whose output distribution is as close to the original model's as possible. To do this tractably, most quantization algorithms minimize the immediate activation error of each layer as a proxy for the end-to-end error. However, this ignores the effect of future layers, making it a poor proxy. In this work, we introduce Yet Another Quantization Algorithm (YAQA), an adaptive rounding algorithm that directly considers the error at the network's output. YAQA introduces a series of theoretical results that culminate in the first end-to-end error bounds for quantization algorithms. First, we characterize the convergence time of adaptive rounding algorithms via the structure of their Hessian approximations. We then show that the end-to-end error can be bounded by the approximation's cosine similarity to the true Hessian. This admits a natural Kronecker-factored approximation with corresponding near-optimal Hessian sketches. YAQA is provably better than GPTQ/LDLQ and empirically reduces the error by $\approx 30\%$ over these methods. YAQA even achieves a lower error than quantization aware training. This translates to state of the art performance on downstream tasks, all while adding no inference overhead.</p>

Conventional approaches, such as reservoir computing, typically require training data that incorporates long-term continuous dynamical behavior to comprehensively capture system dynamics. While advanced deep sequence models can capture transient dynamics within the training data, they often struggle to maintain predictive stability and dynamical coherence over extended horizons. Here, we propose PhyxMamba, a framework that integrates a Mamba-based state-space model with physics-informed principles to forecast long-term behavior of chaotic systems given short-term historical observations on their state evolution. We first reconstruct the attractor manifold with time-delay embeddings to extract global dynamical features. After that, we introduce a generative training scheme that enables Mamba to replicate the physical process. It is further augmented by multi-patch prediction and attractor geometry regularization for physical constraints, enhancing predictive accuracy and preserving key statistical properties of systems. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world chaotic systems demonstrate that PhyxMamba delivers superior forecasting accuracy and faithfully captures essential statistics from short-term historical observations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Liu, Zhitian Hou, Guanghao Zhu, Zhijie Sang, Congkai Xie, Hongxia Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in domains such as visual understanding and mathematical reasoning. However, their application in the medical domain is constrained by two key challenges: (1) multimodal medical datasets are scarce and often contain sparse information, limiting reasoning depth; and (2) Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), though effective in general domains, cannot reliably improve model performance in the medical domain. To overcome these challenges, during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, we incorporate high-quality textual reasoning data and general multimodal data alongside multimodal medical data to efficiently enhance foundational medical capabilities and restore the base model's reasoning ability. Moreover, considering that there are some multimodal medical datasets with sparse information, we further synthesize reflective-pattern-injected chain-of-thought (CoT) in addition to general CoT samples, equipping the model with initial reflective reasoning capabilities that provide a structured foundation for subsequent RLVR training. Finally, we introduce our InfiMed-Series models, InfiMed-SFT-3B and InfiMed-RL-3B, both of which deliver state-of-the-art performance across seven multimodal medical benchmarks. Notably, InfiMed-RL-3B achieves an average accuracy of 59.2%, outperforming even larger models like InternVL3-8B, which achieves 57.3%. Specifically, during the SFT phase, we utilized 188K samples, while the RLVR phase incorporated 36K samples, demonstrating the efficacy of both training strategies in achieving superior performance. We also conducted a series of extensive experiments, which provide valuable insights that contribute to advancing the performance of MLLMs in medical scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zheng, Yuan Yuan, Yue Zhuo, Yong Li, Paolo Santi</p>
<p>Abstract: Probing large language models (LLMs) has yielded valuable insights into their internal mechanisms by linking neural activations to interpretable semantics. However, the complex mechanisms that link neuron's functional co-activation with the emergent model capabilities remains largely unknown, hindering a deeper understanding and safer development of LLMs. In this work, we introduce graph probing, a method for uncovering the functional connectivity of LLM neurons and relating it to language generation performance. By probing models across diverse LLM families and scales, we discover a universal predictability of next-token prediction performance using only neural topology, which persists even when retaining just 1% of neuron connections. Strikingly, probing on topology outperforms probing on activation by up to 130.4%, suggesting that neural topology contains orders of richer information of LLM performance than neural activation, which can be easily extracted with simple linear or MLP probes. To explain the dependence between neural topology and language performance, we identify default networks and hub neurons in LLMs and provide causal evidence by interventional experiments on multiple benchmarks, showing that LLMs actually exploit these topological information. Further analyses suggest that neural topology can be effectively leveraged to improve the efficiency, reliability, and safety of LLMs through proof-of-concept applications in model pruning, hallucination detection, and LLM fingerprinting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Xue, Giuseppe Claudio Guarnera, Shuang Zhao, Zahra Montazeri</p>
<p>Abstract: Current video diffusion models generate visually compelling content but often violate basic laws of physics, producing subtle artifacts like rubber-sheet deformations and inconsistent object motion. We introduce a frequency-domain physics prior that improves motion plausibility without modifying model architectures. Our method decomposes common rigid motions (translation, rotation, scaling) into lightweight spectral losses, requiring only 2.7% of frequency coefficients while preserving 97%+ of spectral energy. Applied to Open-Sora, MVDIT, and Hunyuan, our approach improves both motion accuracy and action recognition by ~11% on average on OpenVID-1M (relative), while maintaining visual quality. User studies show 74--83% preference for our physics-enhanced videos. It also reduces warping error by 22--37% (depending on the backbone) and improves temporal consistency scores. These results indicate that simple, global spectral cues are an effective drop-in regularizer for physically plausible motion in video diffusion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence have significantly transformed the field of style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis (CapTTS). However, adapting CapTTS to real-world applications remains challenging due to the lack of standardized, comprehensive datasets and limited research on downstream tasks built upon CapTTS. To address these gaps, we introduce CapSpeech, a new benchmark designed for a series of CapTTS-related tasks, including style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis with sound events (CapTTS-SE), accent-captioned TTS (AccCapTTS), emotion-captioned TTS (EmoCapTTS), and text-to-speech synthesis for chat agent (AgentTTS). CapSpeech comprises over 10 million machine-annotated audio-caption pairs and nearly 0.36 million human-annotated audio-caption pairs. In addition, we introduce two new datasets collected and recorded by a professional voice actor and experienced audio engineers, specifically for the AgentTTS and CapTTS-SE tasks. Alongside the datasets, we conduct comprehensive experiments using both autoregressive and non-autoregressive models on CapSpeech. Our results demonstrate high-fidelity and highly intelligible speech synthesis across a diverse range of speaking styles. To the best of our knowledge, CapSpeech is the largest available dataset offering comprehensive annotations for CapTTS-related tasks. The experiments and findings further provide valuable insights into the challenges of developing CapTTS systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Damith Chamalke Senadeera, Xiaoyun Yang, Shibo Li, Muhammad Awais, Dimitrios Kollias, Gregory Slabaugh</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid proliferation of surveillance cameras has increased the demand for automated violence detection. While CNNs and Transformers have shown success in extracting spatio-temporal features, they struggle with long-term dependencies and computational efficiency. We propose Dual Branch VideoMamba with Gated Class Token Fusion (GCTF), an efficient architecture combining a dual-branch design and a state-space model (SSM) backbone where one branch captures spatial features, while the other focuses on temporal dynamics. The model performs continuous fusion via a gating mechanism between the branches to enhance the model's ability to detect violent activities even in challenging surveillance scenarios. We also present a new benchmark by merging RWF-2000, RLVS, SURV and VioPeru datasets in video violence detection, ensuring strict separation between training and testing sets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark and also on DVD dataset which is another novel dataset on video violence detection, offering an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating the promise of SSMs for scalable, near real-time surveillance violence detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves performance on knowledge-intensive tasks but can be derailed by wrong, irrelevant, or conflicting retrieved text, causing models to rely on inaccurate evidence and cascade errors. We propose Knowledgeable-R1, a reinforcement-learning framework that explicitly trains large language models to use parametric knowledge (PK) to resist contextual interference while still exploiting external context when it is reliably helpful. Knowledgeable-R1 introduces a joint sampling scheme that generates paired responses with and without retrieval, and learns both local advantages (within each decoding regime) and global advantages under the same input to quantify when to ignore misleading context versus adopt it. We employ an asymmetric advantage transformation that amplifies exploratory behaviors toward parametric knowledge. Experiments show that \method significantly improves robustness and reasoning accuracy in knowledge conflict scenarios and general RAG scenarios, outperforming SOTA baselines by 23% in counterfactual scenarios, and without degradation when the retrieved context is fully accurate.Our code are available at https://github.com/lcy80366872/knowledgeable-R1.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Hao, Zhengning Li, Lei Sun, Weilong Wang, Naixin Yi, Sheng Song, Caihong Qin, Mofan Zhou, Yifei Zhan, Xianpeng Lang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from 2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data proactively collected by drivers of autonomous vehicles to ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete action labels collected directly from drivers' actual driving operations, and implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3% without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geonwoo Cho, Jaemoon Lee, Jaegyun Im, Subi Lee, Jihwan Lee, Sundong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Skill-based reinforcement learning (SBRL) enables rapid adaptation in environments with sparse rewards by pretraining a skill-conditioned policy. Effective skill learning requires jointly maximizing both exploration and skill diversity. However, existing methods often face challenges in simultaneously optimizing for these two conflicting objectives. In this work, we propose a new method, Adaptive Multi-objective Projection for balancing Exploration and skill Diversification (AMPED), which explicitly addresses both: during pre-training, a gradient-surgery projection balances the exploration and diversity gradients, and during fine-tuning, a skill selector exploits the learned diversity by choosing skills suited to downstream tasks. Our approach achieves performance that surpasses SBRL baselines across various benchmarks. Through an extensive ablation study, we identify the role of each component and demonstrate that each element in AMPED is contributing to performance. We further provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, with a greedy skill selector, greater skill diversity reduces fine-tuning sample complexity. These results highlight the importance of explicitly harmonizing exploration and diversity and demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPED in enabling robust and generalizable skill learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chance Jiajie Li, Jiayi Wu, Zhenze Mo, Ao Qu, Yuhan Tang, Kaiya Ivy Zhao, Yulu Gan, Jie Fan, Jiangbo Yu, Jinhua Zhao, Paul Liang, Luis Alonso, Kent Larson</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulating society with large language models (LLMs), we argue, requires more than generating plausible behavior; it demands cognitively grounded reasoning that is structured, revisable, and traceable. LLM-based agents are increasingly used to emulate individual and group behavior, primarily through prompting and supervised fine-tuning. Yet they often lack internal coherence, causal reasoning, and belief traceability, making them unreliable for simulating how people reason, deliberate, and respond to interventions.
  To address this, we present a conceptual modeling paradigm, Generative Minds (GenMinds), which draws from cognitive science to support structured belief representations in generative agents. To evaluate such agents, we introduce the RECAP (REconstructing CAusal Paths) framework, a benchmark designed to assess reasoning fidelity via causal traceability, demographic grounding, and intervention consistency. These contributions advance a broader shift: from surface-level mimicry to generative agents that simulate thought -- not just language -- for social simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinlong Chen, Yuanxing Zhang, Yushuo Guan, Weihong Lin, Zekun Wang, Bohan Zeng, Yang Shi, Sihan Yang, Qiang Liu, Pengfei Wan, Liang Wang, Tieniu Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: The "Reason-Then-Respond" paradigm, enhanced by Reinforcement Learning, has shown great promise in advancing Multimodal Large Language Models. However, its application to the video domain has led to specialized models that excel at either question answering (QA) or captioning tasks, but struggle to master both. Naively combining reward signals from these tasks results in mutual performance degradation, which we attribute to a conflict between their opposing task natures. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training framework built upon two intermediate proxy tasks: DarkEventInfer, which presents videos with masked event segments, requiring models to infer the obscured content based on contextual video cues; and MixVidQA, which presents interleaved video sequences composed of two distinct clips, challenging models to isolate and reason about one while disregarding the other. These proxy tasks compel the model to simultaneously develop both holistic, divergent understanding and precise, convergent reasoning capabilities. Embodying this framework, we present VidBridge-R1, the first versatile video reasoning model that effectively bridges the paradigm conflict. Extensive experiments show that VidBridge-R1 achieves significant performance gains on both QA and captioning within one model, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in fostering more generalizable and powerful video understanding models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huaying Yuan, Zheng Liu, Junjie Zhou, Hongjin Qian, Yan Shu, Nicu Sebe, Ji-Rong Wen, Zhicheng Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-video understanding~(LVU) is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods either downsample frames for single-pass reasoning, sacrificing fine-grained details, or depend on textual reasoning over task-agnostic representations, hindering task-specific perception and exploration. In this paper, we propose VideoExplorer, a framework grounded in the principle of ``thinking with video'', which naturally intertwines planning, temporal grounding, and scalable perception into a coherent reasoning process. Rather than reasoning over a static context, VideoExplorer iteratively formulates sub-questions, locates relevant moments, and performs task-oriented, temporally scalable video understanding until reaching the final answer, enabling faithful, efficient, and interpretable reasoning. To address the lack of LVU training resources, we construct a long-video reasoning dataset using difficulty-adaptive sampling to ensure high-quality trajectories on complex tasks. Building on this dataset, we design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised trajectory initialization followed by trajectory-level preference optimization, encouraging adaptive temporal grounding and iterative information integration guided by downstream rewards. Extensive evaluations on popular long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate VideoExplorer's significant advantage over existing baselines, highlighting its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shivani Shukla, Himanshu Joshi, Romilla Syed</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models(LLMs) for code generation has transformed software development, yet little attention has been given to how security vulnerabilities evolve through iterative LLM feedback. This paper analyzes security degradation in AI-generated code through a controlled experiment with 400 code samples across 40 rounds of "improvements" using four distinct prompting strategies. Our findings show a 37.6% increase in critical vulnerabilities after just five iterations, with distinct vulnerability patterns emerging across different prompting approaches. This evidence challenges the assumption that iterative LLM refinement improves code security and highlights the essential role of human expertise in the loop. We propose practical guidelines for developers to mitigate these risks, emphasizing the need for robust human validation between LLM iterations to prevent the paradoxical introduction of new security issues during supposedly beneficial code "improvements".</p>

<p>Abstract: Training large language models typically demands extensive GPU memory and substantial financial investment, which poses a barrier for many small- to medium-sized teams. In this paper, we propose a full-parameter pre-training and fine-tuning framework based on block coordinate descent (BCD), enhanced with engineering optimizations, to enable efficient training of large-scale models on cost-effective RTX 4090, A100 and A800 GPU clusters. Under identical hardware configurations, we reduce the training cost of a 7B model to 33% on A100/A800 and only 2.6% on RTX 4090, compared to standard full-parameter training. It also enables large models previously restricted to A100 clusters to be trained on RTX 4090 without degrading performance. BCD achieves comparable or better accuracy than full-parameter and fine-tuning methods at most cases, with lower GPU consumption and improved hardware utilization.</p>

<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are progressively deployed in various real-world applications, personalization of LLMs has become increasingly important. While various approaches to LLM personalization such as prompt-based and training-based methods have been actively explored, the development of effective decoding-time algorithms remains largely overlooked, despite their demonstrated potential. In this paper, we propose CoPe (Contrasting Personal Preference), a novel decoding-time approach applied after performing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on user-specific data. Our core idea is to leverage reward-guided decoding specifically for personalization by maximizing each user's implicit reward signal. We evaluate CoPe across five open-ended personalized text generation tasks. Our empirical results demonstrate that CoPe achieves strong performance, improving personalization by an average of 10.57% in ROUGE-L, without relying on external reward models or additional training procedures.</p>

<p>Abstract: When large language models (LLMs) use in-context learning (ICL) to solve a new task, they must infer latent concepts from demonstration examples. This raises the question of whether and how transformers represent latent structures as part of their computation. Our work experiments with several controlled tasks, studying this question using mechanistic interpretability. First, we show that in transitive reasoning tasks with a latent, discrete concept, the model successfully identifies the latent concept and does step-by-step concept composition. This builds upon prior work that analyzes single-step reasoning. Then, we consider tasks parameterized by a latent numerical concept. We discover low-dimensional subspaces in the model's representation space, where the geometry cleanly reflects the underlying parameterization. Overall, we show that small and large models can indeed disentangle and utilize latent concepts that they learn in-context from a handful of abbreviated demonstrations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Temporal Change Description (TCD) and Future Satellite Image Forecasting (FSIF) are critical, yet historically disjointed tasks in Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) analysis. Both are fundamentally limited by the common challenge of modeling long-range temporal dynamics. To explore how to improve the performance of methods on both tasks simultaneously by enhancing long-range temporal understanding capabilities, we introduce TAMMs, the first unified framework designed to jointly perform TCD and FSIF within a single MLLM-diffusion architecture. TAMMs introduces two key innovations: Temporal Adaptation Modules (TAM) enhance frozen MLLM's ability to comprehend long-range dynamics, and Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism translates this change understanding into fine-grained generative control. This synergistic design makes the understanding from the TCD task to directly inform and improve the consistency of the FSIF task. Extensive experiments demonstrate TAMMs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art specialist baselines on both tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Ebrahimpour-Boroojeny, Yian Wang, Hari Sundaram</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we reveal a significant shortcoming in class unlearning evaluations: overlooking the underlying class geometry can cause privacy leakage. We further propose a simple yet effective solution to mitigate this issue. We introduce a membership-inference attack via nearest neighbors (MIA-NN) that uses the probabilities the model assigns to neighboring classes to detect unlearned samples. Our experiments show that existing unlearning methods are vulnerable to MIA-NN across multiple datasets. We then propose a new fine-tuning objective that mitigates this privacy leakage by approximating, for forget-class inputs, the distribution over the remaining classes that a retrained-from-scratch model would produce. To construct this approximation, we estimate inter-class similarity and tilt the target model's distribution accordingly. The resulting Tilted ReWeighting (TRW) distribution serves as the desired distribution during fine-tuning. We also show that across multiple benchmarks, TRW matches or surpasses existing unlearning methods on prior unlearning metrics. More specifically, on CIFAR-10, it reduces the gap with retrained models by 19% and 46% for U-LiRA and MIA-NN scores, accordingly, compared to the SOTA method for each category.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. Yet, existing methods are unsuitable for routing on multigraphs, which feature multiple edges with distinct attributes between node pairs, despite their strong relevance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose two graph neural network-based methods to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach operates directly on the multigraph by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. The second model, which is more scalable, first simplifies the multigraph via a learned pruning strategy and then performs autoregressive routing on the resulting simple graph. We evaluate both models empirically, across a wide range of problems and graph distributions, and demonstrate their competitive performance compared to strong heuristics and neural baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large language models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on open-source multimodal model, Qwen2.5-VL series. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more slowly but maintains prior knowledge. We study this phenomenon through learning dynamics by examining both the magnitude and direction of how training data influence prior knowledge. Our analysis shows that RFT mainly reinforces correct samples naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape, leading to weaker interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, training on RFT-simulated rollouts, which exert a small magnitude of influence and are well aligned in direction to prior knowledge, allows SFT to preserve prior knowledge better while rapidly learning new tasks. These findings suggest that distribution of training data, rather than algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timo Thun, Andrea Merlo, Rory Conlin, Dario Panici, Daniel B\"ockenhoff</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhou Wang, Song Mao, Yang Chen, Yufan Shen, Yinqiao Yan, Pinlong Cai, Ding Wang, Guohang Yan, Zhi Yu, Xuming Hu, Botian Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) increasingly integrate multiple vision encoders to improve performance on various benchmarks, assuming that diverse pretraining objectives yield complementary visual signals. However, we show this assumption often fails in practice. Through systematic encoder masking across representative multi encoder MLLMs, we find that performance typically degrades gracefully and sometimes even improves when selected encoders are masked, revealing pervasive encoder redundancy. To quantify this effect, we introduce two principled metrics: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR), which measures an encoders marginal contribution in the presence of others, and the Information Gap (IG), which captures heterogeneity in encoder utility within a model. Using these tools, we observe (i) strong specialization on tasks like OCR and Chart, where a single encoder can dominate with a CUR greater than 90%, (ii) high redundancy on general VQA and knowledge-based tasks, where encoders are largely interchangeable, (iii) instances of detrimental encoders with negative CUR. Notably, masking specific encoders can yield up to 16% higher accuracy on a specific task category and 3.6% overall performance boost compared to the full model.Furthermore, single and dual encoder variants recover over 90% of baseline on most non OCR tasks. Our analysis challenges the more encoders are better heuristic in MLLMs and provides actionable diagnostics for developing more efficient and effective multimodal architectures.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05257">Evaluating Memory in LLM Agents via Incremental Multi-Turn Interactions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanzhe Hu, Yu Wang, Julian McAuley</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this paper, based on classic theories from memory science and cognitive science, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and selective forgetting. Existing benchmarks either rely on limited context lengths or are tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally accumulate information. Moreover, no existing benchmarks cover all four competencies. We introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark transforms existing long-context datasets and incorporates newly constructed datasets into a multi-turn format, effectively simulating the incremental information processing characteristic of memory agents. By carefully selecting and curating datasets, our benchmark provides comprehensive coverage of the four core memory competencies outlined above, thereby offering a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies, underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms for LLM agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaedong Hwang, Kumar Tanmay, Seok-Jin Lee, Ayush Agrawal, Hamid Palangi, Kumar Ayush, Ila Fiete, Paul Pu Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in domains like mathematics, factual question answering, and code generation, yet their ability to reason on these tasks in different languages remains underdeveloped. Especially for low-resource languages such as Swahili or Thai, LLMs can often misinterpret prompts or default to reasoning in English. This implicit bias toward high-resource languages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. We propose M2A, a novel method that combines multi-scale multilingual alignment with language-consistency rewards on machine-translated questions, training models to reason directly and accurately in the target language. Furthermore, existing multilingual benchmarks only evaluate on final answers, overlooking whether reasoning occurs in the intended language. To close this gap, we introduce GeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark together with reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese, Swahili, and Thai. Our results show that M2A significantly enhances multilingual reasoning fidelity in both mathematical and factual reasoning tasks, highlighting that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement learning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization. https://jd730.github.io/projects/M2A_GeoFact-X</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanqun Cao, Xinyi Zhou, Zijun Gao, Chenyu Wang, Xin Gao, Zhi Zhang, Cesar de la Fuente-Nunez, Chunbin Gu, Ge Liu, Pheng-Ann Heng</p>
<p>Abstract: Protein structure prediction often hinges on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), which underperform on low-homology and orphan proteins. We introduce PLAME, a lightweight MSA design framework that leverages evolutionary embeddings from pretrained protein language models to generate MSAs that better support downstream folding. PLAME couples these embeddings with a conservation--diversity loss that balances agreement on conserved positions with coverage of plausible sequence variation. Beyond generation, we develop (i) an MSA selection strategy to filter high-quality candidates and (ii) a sequence-quality metric that is complementary to depth-based measures and predictive of folding gains. On AlphaFold2 low-homology/orphan benchmarks, PLAME delivers state-of-the-art improvements in structure accuracy (e.g., lDDT/TM-score), with consistent gains when paired with AlphaFold3. Ablations isolate the benefits of the selection strategy, and case studies elucidate how MSA characteristics shape AlphaFold confidence and error modes. Finally, we show PLAME functions as a lightweight adapter, enabling ESMFold to approach AlphaFold2-level accuracy while retaining ESMFold-like inference speed. PLAME thus provides a practical path to high-quality folding for proteins lacking strong evolutionary neighbors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Belitsky, Dawid J. Kopiczko, Michael Dorkenwald, M. Jehanzeb Mirza, James R. Glass, Cees G. M. Snoek, Yuki M. Asano</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach constructs steering vectors from reasoning traces, obtained either from teacher models (e.g., GPT-4o) or existing human annotations, that shift model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Additional experiments show that the method also scales to larger models and yields further gains on challenging datasets such as GPQA and MATH. Compared to prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of inference latency, hyperparameter stability, and ease of integration with existing inference APIs. Beyond mere reasoning induction, we show that cache steering enables controllable transfer of reasoning styles (e.g., stepwise, causal, analogical), making it a practical tool for behavior-level guidance of language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liuyi Wang, Xinyuan Xia, Hui Zhao, Hanqing Wang, Tai Wang, Yilun Chen, Chengju Liu, Qijun Chen, Jiangmiao Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free, map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyang Li, Zhanchao Xu, Yiming Li, Xuejia Chen, Darian Li, Anxin Tian, Qingfa Xiao, Cheng Deng, Jun Wang, Qing Li, Lei Chen, Mingxuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. As a result, these models cannot accurately identify and prioritize the most relevant context, leading to degraded response quality. In this paper, we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a new benchmark with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide range of long-context dialogue tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose the APTx Neuron, a novel, unified neural computation unit that integrates non-linear activation and linear transformation into a single trainable expression. The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and making the architecture both computationally efficient and elegant. The proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\alpha_i + \tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$, where all parameters $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$ are trainable. We validate our APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to $96.69\%$ test accuracy within 11 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters. The results highlight the superior expressiveness and computational efficiency of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14843">The Invisible Leash: Why RLVR May or May Not Escape Its Origin</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fang Wu, Weihao Xuan, Ximing Lu, Mingjie Liu, Yi Dong, Zaid Harchaoui, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs highlight RLVR as a promising method for enhancing AI's capabilities, particularly in solving complex logical tasks. However, it remains unclear whether the current practice of RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or mainly amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows for improved precision. This study presents an empirical investigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of the common practice of RLVR. We examine how, under current training conditions, RLVR can operate as a support-constrained optimization mechanism that may restrict the discovery of entirely original solutions, remaining constrained by the base model's initial distribution. We also identify an entropy-reward trade-off: while the current RLVR recipe reliably enhances precision, it may progressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet underrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while the current RLVR recipe consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally outweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets, failing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base model. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases token-level entropy - resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step - answer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain paths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken together, these findings reveal potential limits of the current RLVR recipe in extending reasoning horizons. Breaking this invisible leash may require future algorithmic innovations such as explicit exploration mechanisms or hybrid strategies that seed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuokun Chen, Zeren Chen, Jiahao He, Lu Sheng, Mingkui Tan, Jianfei Cai, Bohan Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but incurs substantial inference cost due to long autoregressive trajectories. Existing acceleration strategies either shorten traces via early stopping or compression, or adopt speculative decoding with a smaller model. However, speculative decoding provides limited gains when model agreement is low and rigidly enforces token-level consistency, overlooking the observation that some smaller models, when correct, produce significantly more concise reasoning traces that could reduce inference length. We introduce R-Stitch, a training-free hybrid decoding framework that leverages token-level entropy as an uncertainty proxy to delegate computation between a small language model (SLM) and an LLM. Our analysis shows that high-entropy tokens are more likely to induce errors, motivating an entropy-guided routing strategy that lets the SLM efficiently handle low-entropy tokens while delegating uncertain ones to the LLM, thereby avoiding full rollbacks and preserving answer quality. We further extend this design with R-Stitch$^{+}$, which learns an adaptive routing policy to adjust the token budget dynamically beyond fixed thresholds. By jointly reducing per-token decoding complexity and the number of generated tokens, our method achieves substantial acceleration with negligible accuracy loss. Concretely, it attains peak speedups of 3.00$\times$ on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, 3.85$\times$ on 14B, and 4.10$\times$ on QWQ-32B while maintaining accuracy comparable to full LLM decoding. Moreover, it naturally enables adaptive efficiency--accuracy trade-offs that can be tailored to diverse computational budgets without retraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mustapha Hemis, Hamza Kheddar, Mohamed Chahine Ghanem, Bachir Boudraa</p>
<p>Abstract: Steganalysis methods based on deep learning (DL) often struggle with computational complexity and challenges in generalizing across different datasets. Incorporating a graph neural network (GNN) into steganalysis schemes enables the leveraging of relational data for improved detection accuracy and adaptability. This paper presents the first application of a Graph Neural Network (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis of compressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams. The method involves straightforward graph construction from VoIP streams and employs GraphSAGE to capture hierarchical steganalysis information, including both fine grained details and high level patterns, thereby achieving high detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in uncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in VoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for short 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging conditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent over the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016 seconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds. This makes it efficient for online steganalysis tasks, providing a superior balance between detection accuracy and efficiency under the constraint of short samples with low embedding rates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kimberly Le Truong, Riccardo Fogliato, Hoda Heidari, Zhiwei Steven Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often do not exhibit enough writing style diversity, with many adhering primarily to standardized conventions. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the rich variety of communication patterns exhibited by humans. Thus, it is possible that LLMs, which are optimized on these benchmarks, may demonstrate brittle performance when faced with "non-standard" input. In this work, we test this hypothesis by rewriting evaluation prompts using persona-based LLM prompting, a low-cost method to emulate diverse writing styles. Our results show that, even with identical semantic content, variations in writing style and prompt formatting significantly impact the estimated performance of the LLM under evaluation. Notably, we identify distinct writing styles that consistently trigger either low or high performance across a range of models and tasks, irrespective of model family, size, and recency. Our work offers a scalable approach to augment existing benchmarks, improving the external validity of the assessments they provide for measuring LLM performance across linguistic variations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolai Sergeev</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Generative Logic (GL), a deterministic architecture that starts from user-supplied axiomatic definitions (and, optionally, a list of simple facts for counterexample (CE) construction), written in a minimalist Mathematical Programming Language (MPL), and systematically explores their deductive neighborhood. Definitions are compiled into a distributed grid of simple Logic Blocks (LBs) that exchange messages; whenever the premises of an inference rule unify, a new fact is emitted with full provenance to its sources, yielding replayable, auditable proof graphs. A prototype software implementation instantiates the workflow on first-order Peano arithmetic. Starting only from the Peano axioms, GL enumerates conjectures, applies normalization, type, and CE filter, and automatically reconstructs machine-checkable proofs of foundational arithmetic laws, including associativity and commutativity of addition, associativity and commutativity of multiplication, and distributivity. On commodity hardware, the prover phase requires approximately 7 seconds; a complete run finishes in about 5 minutes. Generated proofs export to navigable HTML so that every inference step can be inspected independently. We outline a hardware-software co-design path toward massively parallel realizations and describe prospective integration with probabilistic models (e.g., large language models) for auto-formalization and conjecture seeding. The Python, C++, and MPL code to reproduce the Peano experiments, along with the full proof graphs in HTML as well as machine-readable text format, are available in the project's GitHub repository at github.com/Generative-Logic/GL commit 56c9233 and are permanently archived at doi:10.5281/zenodo.17206386.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingxu Wang, Shiqi Fan, Mengzhu Wang, Siyang Gao, Chao Wang, Nan Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language queries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Existing methods primarily follow either the retrieve-then-reason paradigm, which relies on Graph Neural Networks or heuristic rules to extract static candidate paths, or dynamic path generation strategies that employ LLMs with prompting to jointly perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former lacks adaptability due to static path extraction and the absence of contextual refinement, while the latter suffers from high computational costs and limited evaluation accuracy because of their dependence on fixed scoring functions and repeated LLM calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates LLM-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with adaptive path evaluation to enable efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR leverages MCTS as a backbone, where an LLM-based planner selects the top-$k$ semantically relevant relations at each expansion step to effectively reduce the search space. To enhance evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention, thereby capturing fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, to mitigate the scarcity of high-quality supervision, DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, enabling the scorer to continually adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR significantly outperforms SOTA methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jack Zeng, Andreu Matoses Gimenez, Eugene Vinitsky, Javier Alonso-Mora, Sihao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the first decentralized method to enable real-world 6-DoF manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a team of Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states, inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition, we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller, enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete in-flight loss of one MAV.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subhey Sadi Rahman, Md. Adnanul Islam, Md. Mahbub Alam, Musarrat Zeba, Md. Abdur Rahman, Sadia Sultana Chowa, Mohaimenul Azam Khan Raiaan, Sami Azam</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and mitigation techniques. Instruction tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and RAG frameworks for external knowledge access are also reviewed. The key findings demonstrate the limitations of current metrics, the importance of validated external evidence, and the improvement of factual consistency through domain-specific customization. The review underscores the importance of building more accurate, understandable, and context-aware fact-checking. These insights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongze Tan, Jianfei Pan, Jinghao Lin, Tao Chen, Zhihang Zheng, Zhihao Tang, Haihua Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a pivotal task for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning. Conventional algorithms, however, typically adhere to a coarse-grained credit assignment paradigm, applying a uniform reward to all tokens in a sequence, a critical flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks. In this paper, we address this challenge and propose Dynamic Entropy Weighting, a novel mechanism that facilitates fine-grained rewards through two new algorithms: Group Token Policy Optimization (GTPO), which assigns an entropy-weighted reward to each token, and the analogous algorithm Sequence-Level GRPO (GRPO-S). Our approach is founded on the hypothesis that high policy entropy within a reasoning path is a powerful heuristic for cognitive effort at pivotal junctures, which can be repurposed into a learning signal. By repurposing policy entropy for reward shaping, we achieve true per-token credit assignment. Experimental results across challenging reasoning benchmarks validate the superiority of our approach, showing our methods significantly outperform a strong DAPO baseline and confirming our entropy-weighting mechanism as the key driver of this performance boost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Llu\'is Arola-Fern\'andez</p>
<p>Abstract: Whether large predictive models merely parrot their training data or produce genuine insight lacks a physical explanation. This work reports a primitive form of intuition that emerges as a metastable phase of learning that critically balances next-token prediction against future path-entropy. The intuition mechanism is discovered via mind-tuning, the minimal principle that imposes Maximum Caliber in predictive models with a control temperature-like parameter $\lambda$. Training on random walks in deterministic mazes reveals a rich phase diagram: imitation (low $\lambda$), rule-breaking hallucination (high $\lambda$), and a fragile in-between window exhibiting strong protocol-dependence (hysteresis) and multistability, where models spontaneously discover novel goal-directed strategies. These results are captured by an effective low-dimensional theory and frame intuition as an emergent property at the critical balance between memorizing what is and wondering what could be.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zian Zhai, Fan Li, Xingyu Tan, Xiaoyang Wang, Wenjie Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) has recently emerged as a promising approach for learning discrete representations of graph-structured data. However, a fundamental challenge, i.e., codebook collapse, remains underexplored in the graph domain, significantly limiting the expressiveness and generalization of graph tokens.In this paper, we present the first empirical study showing that codebook collapse consistently occurs when applying VQ to graph data, even with mitigation strategies proposed in vision or language domains. To understand why graph VQ is particularly vulnerable to collapse, we provide a theoretical analysis and identify two key factors: early assignment imbalances caused by redundancy in graph features and structural patterns, and self-reinforcing optimization loops in deterministic VQ. To address these issues, we propose RGVQ, a novel framework that integrates graph topology and feature similarity as explicit regularization signals to enhance codebook utilization and promote token diversity. RGVQ introduces soft assignments via Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization, ensuring that all codewords receive gradient updates. In addition, RGVQ incorporates a structure-aware contrastive regularization to penalize the token co-assignments among dissimilar node pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RGVQ substantially improves codebook utilization and consistently boosts the performance of state-of-the-art graph VQ backbones across multiple downstream tasks, enabling more expressive and transferable graph token representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Interactive streetscape mapping tools such as Google Street View (GSV) and Meta Mapillary enable users to virtually navigate and experience real-world environments via immersive 360{\deg} imagery but remain fundamentally inaccessible to blind users. We introduce StreetReaderAI, the first-ever accessible street view tool, which combines context-aware, multimodal AI, accessible navigation controls, and conversational speech. With StreetReaderAI, blind users can virtually examine destinations, engage in open-world exploration, or virtually tour any of the over 220 billion images and 100+ countries where GSV is deployed. We iteratively designed StreetReaderAI with a mixed-visual ability team and performed an evaluation with eleven blind users. Our findings demonstrate the value of an accessible street view in supporting POI investigations and remote route planning. We close by enumerating key guidelines for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Wu, Fei Teng, Ji Zhang, Xingwang Li, Yuxuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this, current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (ERIS) framework to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial generalization mechanism enhances robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that ERIS achieves a statistically significant improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, consistently securing the top performance rank.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eunseong Choi, June Park, Hyeri Lee, Jongwuk Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation (CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Chanin, Adri\`a Garriga-Alonso</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations, meant to correspond to interpretable concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is L0: how many SAE features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares SAE algorithms using sparsity-reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a free parameter with no single correct value aside from its effect on reconstruction. In this work we study the effect of L0 on SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set correctly, the SAE fails to disentangle the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we present a proxy metric that can help guide the search for the correct L0 for an SAE on a given training distribution. We show that our method finds the correct L0 in toy models and coincides with peak sparse probing performance in LLM SAEs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that L0 must be set correctly to train SAEs with correct features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Zhao, Xiaoyu Wang, Dan Wang, Zhonglin Jiang, Qingqing Gu, Teng Chen, Ningyuan Xi, Jinxian Qu, Yong Chen, Luo Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: World models have been widely utilized in robotics, gaming, and auto-driving. However, their applications on natural language tasks are relatively limited. In this paper, we construct the dialogue world model, which could predict the user's emotion, sentiment, and intention, and future utterances. By defining a POMDP, we argue emotion, sentiment and intention can be modeled as the user belief and solved by maximizing the information bottleneck. By this user belief modeling, we apply the model-based reinforcement learning framework to the dialogue system, and propose a framework called DreamCUB. Experiments show that the pretrained dialogue world model can achieve state-of-the-art performances on emotion classification and sentiment identification, while dialogue quality is also enhanced by joint training of the policy, critic and dialogue world model. Further analysis shows that this manner holds a reasonable exploration-exploitation balance and also transfers well to out-of-domain scenarios such as empathetic dialogues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Hude Liu, Jennifer Yuntong Zhang, Han Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We prove that a minimal Transformer with frozen weights emulates a broad class of algorithms by in-context prompting. We formalize two modes of in-context algorithm emulation. In the task-specific mode, for any continuous function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, we show the existence of a single-head softmax attention layer whose forward pass reproduces functions of the form $f(w^\top x - y)$ to arbitrary precision. This general template subsumes many popular machine learning algorithms (e.g., gradient descent, linear regression, ridge regression). In the prompt-programmable mode, we prove universality: a single fixed-weight two-layer softmax attention module emulates all algorithms from the task-specific class (i.e., each implementable by a single softmax attention) via only prompting. Our key idea is to construct prompts that encode an algorithm's parameters into token representations, creating sharp dot-product gaps that force the softmax attention to follow the intended computation. This construction requires no feed-forward layers and no parameter updates. All adaptation happens through the prompt alone. Numerical results corroborate our theory. These findings forge a direct link between in-context learning and algorithmic emulation, and offer a simple mechanism for large Transformers to serve as prompt-programmable libraries of algorithms. They illuminate how GPT-style foundation models may swap algorithms via prompts alone, and establish a form of algorithmic universality in modern Transformer models.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19463">&quot;She was useful, but a bit too optimistic&quot;: Augmenting Design with Interactive Virtual Personas</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Paluck Deep, Monica Bharadhidasan, A. Baki Kocaballi</p>
<p>Abstract: Personas have been widely used to understand and communicate user needs in human-centred design. Despite their utility, they may fail to meet the demands of iterative workflows due to their static nature, limited engagement, and inability to adapt to evolving design needs. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) pave the way for more engaging and adaptive approaches to user representation. This paper introduces Interactive Virtual Personas (IVPs): multimodal, LLM-driven, conversational user simulations that designers can interview, brainstorm with, and gather feedback from in real time via voice interface. We conducted a qualitative study with eight professional UX designers, employing an IVP named "Alice" across three design activities: user research, ideation, and prototype evaluation. Our findings demonstrate the potential of IVPs to expedite information gathering, inspire design solutions, and provide rapid user-like feedback. However, designers raised concerns about biases, over-optimism, the challenge of ensuring authenticity without real stakeholder input, and the inability of the IVP to fully replicate the nuances of human interaction. Our participants emphasised that IVPs should be viewed as a complement to, not a replacement for, real user engagement. We discuss strategies for prompt engineering, human-in-the-loop integration, and ethical considerations for effective and responsible IVP use in design. Finally, our work contributes to the growing body of research on generative AI in the design process by providing insights into UX designers' experiences of LLM-powered interactive personas.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) has the potential to enable effective decision-making over long timescales. Existing approaches, while promising, have yet to realize the benefits of large-scale training. In this work, we identify and solve several key challenges in scaling online hierarchical RL to high-throughput environments. We propose Scalable Option Learning (SOL), a highly scalable hierarchical RL algorithm which achieves a ~35x higher throughput compared to existing hierarchical methods. To demonstrate SOL's performance and scalability, we train hierarchical agents using 30 billion frames of experience on the complex game of NetHack, significantly surpassing flat agents and demonstrating positive scaling trends. We also validate SOL on MiniHack and Mujoco environments, showcasing its general applicability. Our code is open sourced at: github.com/facebookresearch/sol.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyun Zeng, Junhao Zhang, Wei Li, Mike Zheng Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i) DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale, DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1 and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits for image editing.

<p>Abstract: Current evaluation paradigms for large language models (LLMs) suffer from overestimated or biased evaluations and mismatched question difficulty, leading to incomplete evaluations of knowledge and capability boundaries, which hinder their effective application and optimization. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-as-Interviewer, a dynamic evaluation paradigm that employs LLM agents to conduct multi-turn interactions for evaluation. Unlike current benchmarking or dynamic interaction paradigms, Agent-as-Interviewer utilizes agents to invoke knowledge tools for wider and deeper knowledge in the dynamic multi-turn question generation, achieving more comprehensive evaluations of LLM's knowledge boundaries. It also leverages agents to plan query strategies for adjustment of the question difficulty levels, enhancing the difficulty control to match the actual capabilities of target LLMs. Based on this paradigm, we develop JudgeAgent, a knowledge-wise dynamic evaluation framework that employs knowledge-driven synthesis as the agent's tool and uses difficulty scoring as strategy guidance, thereby finally providing valuable suggestions to help targets optimize themselves. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of JudgeAgent's suggestions, demonstrating that Agent-as-Interviewer can accurately identify the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models.

<p>Abstract: MIDOG 2025 Track 1 requires mitosis detection in whole-slideimages (WSIs) containing non-tumor, inflamed, and necrotic re-gions. Due to the complicated and heterogeneous context, aswell as possible artifacts, there are often false positives and falsenegatives, thus degrading the detection F1-score. To addressthis problem, we propose a two-stage framework. Firstly, an im-proved YOLO11x, integrated with EMA attention and LSConv,is employed to generate mitosis candidates. We use a low confi-dence threshold to generate as many proposals as possible, en-suring the detection recall. Then, a ConvNeXt-Tiny classifieris employed to filter out the false positives, ensuring the detec-tion precision. Consequently, the proposed two-stage frame-work can generate a high detection F1-score. Evaluated on afused dataset comprising MIDOG++, MITOS_WSI_CCMCT,and MITOS_WSI_CMC, our framework achieves an F1-scoreof 0.882, which is 0.035 higher than the single-stage YOLO11xbaseline. This performance gain is produced by a significantprecision improvement, from 0.762 to 0.839, and a comparablerecall.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengxiao Tang, Yufeng Li, Zongzong Wu, Ming Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant accuracy degradation due to insufficient reasoning ability when dealing with complex and abstract tasks. Thought structures such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT) focus on enhancing the reasoning capability of LLMs. However, they suffer from inherent drawbacks such as redundancy within the same layer of the tree structure and the singularity of the paths in the chain structure. Some studies have utilized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to enhance CoT and ToT in mitigating hallucinations in LLMs, yet the fundamental shortcomings of the thought structures still persist. Furthermore, when dealing with multi-entity and multi-hop information, the retrieved verification knowledge often contains large amounts of fragmented, superficial, or even erroneous data, misleading the reasoning process of LLMs. To address these issues, we propose the Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient thought structure for LLMs. MoT explores problems in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through a "column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in multi-strategy and deep thinking while reducing redundancy in the thought nodes within the column cells, thereby enhancing the reasoning capability of LLMs. Additionally, through a fact-correction mechanism, it leverages the knowledge graph triples retrieved by RAG and the original text to construct knowledge units and correct erroneous answers. To validate the effectiveness of this method, we conducted extensive experiments in three tasks: 24-point game, question answering evaluation, and proposition writing.The results demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of that of the baseline method, proving its efficiency and accuracy.

<p>Abstract: We prove under practical assumptions that Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) introduces an intrinsic distance-dependent bias in attention scores that limits RoPE's ability to model long-context. RoPE extension methods may alleviate this issue, but they typically require post-hoc adjustments after pretraining, such as rescaling or hyperparameters retuning. This paper introduces Token-Aware Phase Attention (TAPA), a new positional encoding method that incorporates a learnable phase function into the attention mechanism. TAPA preserves token interactions over long range, extends to longer contexts with direct and light fine-tuning, extrapolates to unseen lengths, and attains significantly lower perplexity on long-context than RoPE families.</p>

Our analysis consistently shows affiliation bias favoring institutions highly ranked on common academic rankings. Additionally, we find some gender preferences, which, even though subtle in magnitude, have the potential to compound over time.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Wiesner, Matthias Wessling, Stephen Baek</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing through a ``train once, deploy anywhere'' paradigm, where a single pre-trained model adapts to countless downstream tasks without retraining. Access to a Physics Foundation Model (PFM) would be transformative -- democratizing access to high-fidelity simulations, accelerating scientific discovery, and eliminating the need for specialized solver development. Yet current physics-aware machine learning approaches remain fundamentally limited to single, narrow domains and require retraining for each new system. We present the General Physics Transformer (GPhyT), trained on 1.8 TB of diverse simulation data, that demonstrates foundation model capabilities are achievable for physics. Our key insight is that transformers can learn to infer governing dynamics from context, enabling a single model to simulate fluid-solid interactions, shock waves, thermal convection, and multi-phase dynamics without being told the underlying equations. GPhyT achieves three critical breakthroughs: (1) superior performance across multiple physics domains, outperforming specialized architectures by up to 29x, (2) zero-shot generalization to entirely unseen physical systems through in-context learning, and (3) stable long-term predictions through 50-timestep rollouts. By establishing that a single model can learn generalizable physical principles from data alone, this work opens the path toward a universal PFM that could transform computational science and engineering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Mai, Qiyue Yin, Wancheng Ni, Pei Xu, Kaiqi Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, diversity has emerged as a useful mechanism to enhance the efficiency of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing methods predominantly focus on designing policies based on individual agent characteristics, often neglecting the interplay and mutual influence among agents during policy formation. To address this gap, we propose Competitive Diversity through Constructive Conflict (CoDiCon), a novel approach that incorporates competitive incentives into cooperative scenarios to encourage policy exchange and foster strategic diversity among agents. Drawing inspiration from sociological research, which highlights the benefits of moderate competition and constructive conflict in group decision-making, we design an intrinsic reward mechanism using ranking features to introduce competitive motivations. A centralized intrinsic reward module generates and distributes varying reward values to agents, ensuring an effective balance between competition and cooperation. By optimizing the parameterized centralized reward module to maximize environmental rewards, we reformulate the constrained bilevel optimization problem to align with the original task objectives. We evaluate our algorithm against state-of-the-art methods in the SMAC and GRF environments. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDiCon achieves superior performance, with competitive intrinsic rewards effectively promoting diverse and adaptive strategies among cooperative agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tsz Ting Chung, Lemao Liu, Mo Yu, Dit-Yan Yeung</p>
<p>Abstract: Logic reasoning in natural language has been recognized as an important measure of human intelligence for Large Language Models (LLMs). Popular benchmarks may entangle multiple reasoning skills and thus provide unfaithful evaluations on the logic reasoning skill. Meanwhile, existing logic reasoning benchmarks are limited in language diversity and their distributions are deviated from the distribution of an ideal logic reasoning benchmark, which may lead to biased evaluation results. This paper thereby proposes a new classical logic benchmark DivLogicEval, consisting of natural sentences composed of diverse statements in a counterintuitive way. To ensure a more reliable evaluation, we also introduce a new evaluation metric that mitigates the influence of bias and randomness inherent in LLMs. Through experiments, we demonstrate the extent to which logical reasoning is required to answer the questions in DivLogicEval and compare the performance of different popular LLMs in conducting logical reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Senkang Hu, Xudong Han, Jinqi Jiang, Yihang Tao, Zihan Fang, Yong Dai, Sam Tak Wu Kwong, Yuguang Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting billion-parameter language models to a downstream task is still costly, even with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We re-cast task adaptation as output-distribution alignment: the objective is to steer the output distribution toward the task distribution directly during decoding rather than indirectly through weight updates. Building on this view, we introduce Steering Vector Decoding (SVD), a lightweight, PEFT-compatible, and theoretically grounded method. We start with a short warm-start fine-tune and extract a task-aware steering vector from the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence gradient between the output distribution of the warm-started and pre-trained models. This steering vector is then used to guide the decoding process to steer the model's output distribution towards the task distribution. We theoretically prove that SVD is first-order equivalent to the gradient step of full fine-tuning and derive a globally optimal solution for the strength of the steering vector. Across three tasks and nine benchmarks, SVD paired with four standard PEFT methods improves multiple-choice accuracy by up to 5 points and open-ended truthfulness by 2 points, with similar gains (1-2 points) on commonsense datasets without adding trainable parameters beyond the PEFT adapter. SVD thus offers a lightweight, theoretically grounded path to stronger task adaptation for large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jane Luo, Xin Zhang, Steven Liu, Jie Wu, Yiming Huang, Yangyu Huang, Chengyu Yin, Ying Xin, Jianfeng Liu, Yuefeng Zhan, Hao Sun, Qi Chen, Scarlett Li, Mao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models excel at generating individual functions or single files of code, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This capability is key to building coherent software systems from high-level specifications and realizing the full potential of automated code generation. The process requires planning at two levels: deciding what features and modules to build (proposal stage) and defining their implementation details (implementation stage). Current approaches rely on natural language planning, which often produces unclear specifications, misaligned components, and brittle designs due to its inherent ambiguity and lack of structure. To address these limitations, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a structured representation that encodes capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in a unified graph. By replacing free-form natural language with an explicit blueprint, RPG enables consistent long-horizon planning for repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework that operates in three stages: proposal-level planning, implementation-level construction, and graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces nearly 36K Code Lines and 445K Code Tokens, on average 3.9$\times$ larger than the strongest baseline (Claude Code), and 68$\times$ larger than other baselines. It achieves 81.5% coverage and 69.7% test accuracy, improving over Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 points. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and improves agent understanding of repositories, thus accelerating localization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eason Chen, Chuangji Li, Shizhuo Li, Zimo Xiao, Jionghao Lin, Kenneth R. Koedinger</p>
<p>Abstract: Technology-enhanced learning environments often help students retrieve relevant learning content for questions arising during self-paced study. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as novel aids for information retrieval during learning. While LLMs are effective for general-purpose question-answering, they typically lack alignment with the domain knowledge of specific course materials such as textbooks and slides. We investigate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, a knowledge graph-enhanced RAG approach, for page-level question answering in an undergraduate mathematics textbook. While RAG has been effective for retrieving discrete, contextually relevant passages, GraphRAG may excel in modeling interconnected concepts and hierarchical knowledge structures. We curate a dataset of 477 question-answer pairs, each tied to a distinct textbook page. We then compare the standard embedding-based RAG methods to GraphRAG for evaluating both retrieval accuracy-whether the correct page is retrieved-and generated answer quality via F1 scores. Our findings show that embedding-based RAG achieves higher retrieval accuracy and better F1 scores compared to GraphRAG, which tends to retrieve excessive and sometimes irrelevant content due to its entity-based structure. We also explored re-ranking the retrieved pages with LLM and observed mixed results, including performance drop and hallucinations when dealing with larger context windows. Overall, this study highlights both the promises and challenges of page-level retrieval systems in educational contexts, emphasizing the need for more refined retrieval methods to build reliable AI tutoring solutions in providing reference page numbers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dehao Zhang, Malu Zhang, Shuai Wang, Jingya Wang, Wenjie Wei, Zeyu Ma, Guoqing Wang, Yang Yang, Haizhou Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The explosive growth in sequence length has intensified the demand for effective and efficient long sequence modeling. Benefiting from intrinsic oscillatory membrane dynamics, Resonate-and-Fire (RF) neurons can efficiently extract frequency components from input signals and encode them into spatiotemporal spike trains, making them well-suited for long sequence modeling. However, RF neurons exhibit limited effective memory capacity and a trade-off between energy efficiency and training speed on complex temporal tasks. Inspired by the dendritic structure of biological neurons, we propose a Dendritic Resonate-and-Fire (D-RF) model, which explicitly incorporates a multi-dendritic and soma architecture. Each dendritic branch encodes specific frequency bands by utilizing the intrinsic oscillatory dynamics of RF neurons, thereby collectively achieving comprehensive frequency representation. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive threshold mechanism into the soma structure that adjusts the threshold based on historical spiking activity, reducing redundant spikes while maintaining training efficiency in long sequence tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains competitive accuracy while substantially ensuring sparse spikes without compromising computational efficiency during training. These results underscore its potential as an effective and efficient solution for long sequence modeling on edge platforms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Licheng Zhang, Bach Le, Naveed Akhtar, Tuan Ngo</p>
<p>Abstract: Building compliance checking (BCC) is a critical process for ensuring that constructed facilities meet regulatory standards. A core component of BCC is the accurate enumeration of facility types and their spatial distribution. Despite its importance, this problem has been largely overlooked in the literature, posing a significant challenge for BCC and leaving a critical gap in existing workflows. Performing this task manually is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to enhance automation by combining visual recognition with reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a new task for BCC: automated facility enumeration, which involves validating the quantity of each facility type against statutory requirements. To address it, we propose a novel method that integrates door detection with LLM-based reasoning. We are the first to apply LLMs to this task and further enhance their performance through a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) pipeline. Our approach generalizes well across diverse datasets and facility types. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic floor plan data demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuiye Ding, Fanda Fan, Chunyi Hou, Zheya Wang, Lei Wang, Zhengxin Yang, Jianfeng Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance, transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rose E. Guingrich, Michael S. A. Graziano</p>
<p>Abstract: Relationships with social artificial intelligence (AI) agents are on the rise. People report forming friendships, mentorships, and romantic partnerships with chatbots such as Replika, a type of social AI agent that is designed specifically for companionship. Concerns that companion chatbot relationships may harm or replace human ones have been raised, but whether and how these social consequences occur remains unclear. Prior research suggests that people's states of social need and their anthropomorphism of the AI agent may play a role in how human-AI interaction impacts human-human interaction. In this longitudinal study (N = 183), participants were randomly assigned to converse with a companion chatbot over text or to play text-based word games for 10 minutes a day for 21 consecutive days. During these 21 days, participants also completed four surveys and two audio-recorded interviews. We found that people's social health and relationships were not significantly impacted by interacting with a companion chatbot across 21 days compared to the control group. However, people who had a higher desire to socially connect anthropomorphized the chatbot more. Those who anthropomorphized the chatbot more indicated that the human-chatbot interaction had greater impacts on their social interactions and relationships with family and friends. A mediation analysis suggested that the impact of human-AI interaction on human-human social outcomes was mediated by the extent to which people anthropomorphized the AI agent, which itself was related to the desire to socially connect.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyu Zhang, Yifan Wei, Xinru Wang, Yanmin Zhu, Yangfan He, Yixuan Weng, Bin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot Dialog State Tracking (zs-DST) is essential for enabling Task-Oriented Dialog Systems (TODs) to generalize to new domains without costly data annotation. A central challenge lies in the semantic misalignment between dynamic dialog contexts and static prompts, leading to inflexible cross-layer coordination, domain interference, and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle this, we propose Hierarchical Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation (HiCoLoRA), a framework that enhances zero-shot slot inference through robust prompt alignment. It features a hierarchical LoRA architecture for dynamic layer-specific processing (combining lower-layer heuristic grouping and higher-layer full interaction), integrates Spectral Joint Domain-Slot Clustering to identify transferable associations (feeding an Adaptive Linear Fusion Mechanism), and employs Semantic-Enhanced SVD Initialization (SemSVD-Init) to preserve pre-trained knowledge. Experiments on multi-domain datasets MultiWOZ and SGD show that HiCoLoRA outperforms baselines, achieving SOTA in zs-DST. Code is available at https://github.com/carsonz/HiCoLoRA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Heidari, Wei Zhang, Ying Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector search powers transformers technology, but real-world use demands hybrid queries that combine vector similarity with attribute filters (e.g., "top document in category X, from 2023"). Current solutions trade off recall, speed, and flexibility, relying on fragile index hacks that don't scale. We introduce FusedANN (Fused Attribute-Vector Nearest Neighbor), a geometric framework that elevates filtering to ANN optimization constraints and introduces a convex fused space via a Lagrangian-like relaxation. Our method jointly embeds attributes and vectors through transformer-based convexification, turning hard filters into continuous, weighted penalties that preserve top-k semantics while enabling efficient approximate search. We prove that FusedANN reduces to exact filtering under high selectivity, gracefully relaxes to semantically nearest attributes when exact matches are insufficient, and preserves downstream ANN alpha-approximation guarantees. Empirically, FusedANN improves query throughput by eliminating brittle filtering stages, achieving superior recall-latency tradeoffs on standard hybrid benchmarks without specialized index hacks, delivering up to 3 times higher throughput and better recall than state-of-the-art hybrid and graph-based systems. Theoretically, we provide explicit error bounds and parameter selection rules that make FusedANN practical for production. This establishes a principled, scalable, and verifiable bridge between symbolic constraints and vector similarity, unlocking a new generation of filtered retrieval systems for large, hybrid, and dynamic NLP/ML workloads.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rami Zewail</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning robust representations for biosignals is often hampered by the challenge of designing effective data augmentations.Traditional methods can fail to capture the complex variations inherent in physiological data. Within this context, we propose a novel hybrid framework, Diffusion-Augmented Contrastive Learning (DACL), that fuses concepts from diffusion models and supervised contrastive learning. The DACL framework operates on a latent space created by a lightweight Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on our novel Scattering Transformer (ST) features [12]. It utilizes the diffusion forward process as a principled data augmentation technique to generate multiple noisy views of these latent embeddings. A U-Net style encoder is then trained with a supervised contrastive objective to learn a representation that balances class discrimination with robustness to noise across various diffusion time steps. We evaluated this proof-of-concept method on the PhysioNet 2017 ECG dataset, achieving a competitive AUROC of 0.7815. This work establishes a new paradigm for representation learning by using the diffusion process itself to drive the contrastive objective, creating noise-invariant embeddings that demonstrate a strong foundation for class separability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhao Chai, Anqing Jiang, Hao Jiang, Shiyi Mu, Zichong Gu, Hao Sun, Shugong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end multi-modal planning has become a transformative paradigm in autonomous driving, effectively addressing behavioral multi-modality and the generalization challenge in long-tail scenarios. We propose AnchDrive, a framework for end-to-end driving that effectively bootstraps a diffusion policy to mitigate the high computational cost of traditional generative models. Rather than denoising from pure noise, AnchDrive initializes its planner with a rich set of hybrid trajectory anchors. These anchors are derived from two complementary sources: a static vocabulary of general driving priors and a set of dynamic, context-aware trajectories. The dynamic trajectories are decoded in real-time by a Transformer that processes dense and sparse perceptual features. The diffusion model then learns to refine these anchors by predicting a distribution of trajectory offsets, enabling fine-grained refinement. This anchor-based bootstrapping design allows for efficient generation of diverse, high-quality trajectories. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark confirm that AnchDrive sets a new state-of-the-art and shows strong generalizability</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samyak Jhaveri, Vanessa Klotzmann, Crista Lopes</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of GPUs is accompanied by the increasing complexity of their hardware and parallel programming frameworks. Directive-based parallel programming standards like OpenACC simplify GPU programming to some extent by abstracting away low-level complexities, but a fair amount of expertise is still required in order to use those directives effectively.
  We introduce ACCeLLiuM, two open weights Large Language Models specifically fine-tuned for generating expert OpenACC directives for data-parallel loops, along with the supervised fine-tuning dataset that was used to train them. The ACCeLLiuM SFT dataset contains 4,033 OpenACC pragma-loop pairs mined from public GitHub C/C++ repositories, with 3,223 pairs for training and 810 for testing. Experimental evaluations show a pronounced performance gap in generating correct OpenACC pragmas between base LLMs and our fine-tuned versions. On the held-out test set, base LLMs fail to consistently generate valid pragmas, whereas LLMs fine-tuned on the ACCeLLiuM dataset generate valid pragmas with the correct directive type for $87\%$ of the data-parallel loops, and exact pragmas--including directives, clauses, clause order, and clause variables--for $50\%$ of the cases. Even when not exact, generated pragmas frequently incorporate the correct clauses in a different order than the ground-truth label, or include additional clauses that enable finer control over parallel execution, data movement, and concurrency, offering practical value beyond strict string-matching. By publicly releasing the code, models, and dataset as ACCeLLiuM we hope to establish a reproducible benchmark for LLM-powered OpenACC pragma generation, and lower the barrier to automated GPU offloading of serially written programs.</p>
