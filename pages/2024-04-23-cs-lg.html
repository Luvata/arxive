<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayuan Dong, Christian Jacobsen, Mehdi Khalloufi, Maryam Akram, Wanjiao Liu, Karthik Duraisamy, Xun Huan</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) seeks experiments that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) in model parameters. Directly estimating the EIG using nested Monte Carlo is computationally expensive and requires an explicit likelihood. Variational OED (vOED), in contrast, estimates a lower bound of the EIG without likelihood evaluations by approximating the posterior distributions with variational forms, and then tightens the bound by optimizing its variational parameters. We introduce the use of normalizing flows (NFs) for representing variational distributions in vOED; we call this approach vOED-NFs. Specifically, we adopt NFs with a conditional invertible neural network architecture built from compositions of coupling layers, and enhanced with a summary network for data dimension reduction. We present Monte Carlo estimators to the lower bound along with gradient expressions to enable a gradient-based simultaneous optimization of the variational parameters and the design variables. The vOED-NFs algorithm is then validated in two benchmark problems, and demonstrated on a partial differential equation-governed application of cathodic electrophoretic deposition and an implicit likelihood case with stochastic modeling of aphid population. The findings suggest that a composition of 4--5 coupling layers is able to achieve lower EIG estimation bias, under a fixed budget of forward model runs, compared to previous approaches. The resulting NFs produce approximate posteriors that agree well with the true posteriors, able to capture non-Gaussian and multi-modal features effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chia-Hsuan Chang, Xiaoyang Wang, Christopher C. Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence supports healthcare professionals with predictive modeling, greatly transforming clinical decision-making. This study addresses the crucial need for fairness and explainability in AI applications within healthcare to ensure equitable outcomes across diverse patient demographics. By focusing on the predictive modeling of sepsis-related mortality, we propose a method that learns a performance-optimized predictive model and then employs the transfer learning process to produce a model with better fairness. Our method also introduces a novel permutation-based feature importance algorithm aiming at elucidating the contribution of each feature in enhancing fairness on predictions. Unlike existing explainability methods concentrating on explaining feature contribution to predictive performance, our proposed method uniquely bridges the gap in understanding how each feature contributes to fairness. This advancement is pivotal, given sepsis's significant mortality rate and its role in one-third of hospital deaths. Our method not only aids in identifying and mitigating biases within the predictive model but also fosters trust among healthcare stakeholders by improving the transparency and fairness of model predictions, thereby contributing to more equitable and trustworthy healthcare delivery.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13182">Spectral Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiman Mohseni, Nick Duffield</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs) constitute a family of probabilistic models that harness the flexibility of neural networks to parameterize stochastic processes. Their capability to furnish well-calibrated predictions, combined with simple maximum-likelihood training, has established them as appealing solutions for addressing various learning problems, with a particular emphasis on meta-learning. A prominent member of this family, Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes (ConvCNPs), utilizes convolution to explicitly introduce translation equivariance as an inductive bias. However, ConvCNP's reliance on local discrete kernels in its convolution layers can pose challenges in capturing long-range dependencies and complex patterns within the data, especially when dealing with limited and irregularly sampled observations from a new task. Building on the successes of Fourier neural operators (FNOs) for approximating the solution operators of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), we propose Spectral Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes (SConvCNPs), a new addition to the NPs family that allows for more efficient representation of functions in the frequency domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixin Pan, Emma Andrews, Laura Chang, Prabhat Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation is widely used to mitigate data bias in the training dataset. However, data augmentation exposes machine learning models to privacy attacks, such as membership inference attacks. In this paper, we propose an effective combination of data augmentation and machine unlearning, which can reduce data bias while providing a provable defense against known attacks. Specifically, we maintain the fairness of the trained model with diffusion-based data augmentation, and then utilize multi-shard unlearning to remove identifying information of original data from the ML model for protection against privacy attacks. Experimental evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates that our approach can achieve significant improvements in bias reduction as well as robustness against state-of-the-art privacy attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop a thermodynamic theory for machine learning (ML) systems. Similar to physical thermodynamic systems which are characterized by energy and entropy, ML systems possess these characteristics as well. This comparison inspire us to integrate the concept of temperature into ML systems grounded in the fundamental principles of thermodynamics, and establish a basic thermodynamic framework for machine learning systems with non-Boltzmann distributions. We introduce the concept of states within a ML system, identify two typical types of state, and interpret model training and refresh as a process of state phase transition. We consider that the initial potential energy of a ML system is described by the model's loss functions, and the energy adheres to the principle of minimum potential energy. For a variety of energy forms and parameter initialization methods, we derive the temperature of systems during the phase transition both analytically and asymptotically, highlighting temperature as a vital indicator of system data distribution and ML training complexity. Moreover, we perceive deep neural networks as complex heat engines with both global temperature and local temperatures in each layer. The concept of work efficiency is introduced within neural networks, which mainly depends on the neural activation functions. We then classify neural networks based on their work efficiency, and describe neural networks as two types of heat engines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuta Sumiya, Hayaru shouno</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine-learning models, which are known to accurately predict patterns from large datasets, are crucial in decision making. Consequently, counterfactual explanations-methods explaining predictions by introducing input perturbations-have become prominent. These perturbations often suggest ways to alter the predictions, leading to actionable recommendations. However, the current techniques require resolving the optimization problems for each input change, rendering them computationally expensive. In addition, traditional encoding methods inadequately address the perturbations of categorical variables in tabular data. Thus, this study propose FastDCFlow, an efficient counterfactual explanation method using normalizing flows. The proposed method captures complex data distributions, learns meaningful latent spaces that retain proximity, and improves predictions. For categorical variables, we employed TargetEncoding, which respects ordinal relationships and includes perturbation costs. The proposed method outperformed existing methods in multiple metrics, striking a balance between trade offs for counterfactual explanations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ling Yue, Jonathan Li, Md Zabirul Islam, Bolun Xia, Tianfan Fu, Jintai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The clinical trial process, also known as drug development, is an indispensable step toward the development of new treatments. The major objective of interventional clinical trials is to assess the safety and effectiveness of drug-based treatment in treating certain diseases in the human body. However, clinical trials are lengthy, labor-intensive, and costly. The duration of a clinical trial is a crucial factor that influences overall expenses. Therefore, effective management of the timeline of a clinical trial is essential for controlling the budget and maximizing the economic viability of the research. To address this issue, We propose TrialDura, a machine learning-based method that estimates the duration of clinical trials using multimodal data, including disease names, drug molecules, trial phases, and eligibility criteria. Then, we encode them into Bio-BERT embeddings specifically tuned for biomedical contexts to provide a deeper and more relevant semantic understanding of clinical trial data. Finally, the model's hierarchical attention mechanism connects all of the embeddings to capture their interactions and predict clinical trial duration. Our proposed model demonstrated superior performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.04 years and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.39 years compared to the other models, indicating more accurate clinical trial duration prediction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feibo Jiang, Li Dong, Siwei Tu, Yubo Peng, Kezhi Wang, Kun Yang, Cunhua Pan, Dusit Niyato</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. However, their deployment in wireless networks still face challenges, i.e., a lack of privacy and security protection mechanisms. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach to address these challenges. Yet, it suffers from issues including inefficient handling with big and heterogeneous data, resource-intensive training, and high communication overhead. To tackle these issues, we first compare different learning stages and their features of LLMs in wireless networks. Next, we introduce two personalized wireless federated fine-tuning methods with low communication overhead, i.e., (1) Personalized Federated Instruction Tuning (PFIT), which employs reinforcement learning to fine-tune local LLMs with diverse reward models to achieve personalization; (2) Personalized Federated Task Tuning (PFTT), which can leverage global adapters and local Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRA) to collaboratively fine-tune local LLMs, where the local LoRAs can be applied to achieve personalization without aggregation. Finally, we perform simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two methods and comprehensively discuss open issues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoli Tang, Han Yu, Xiaoxiao Li, Sarit Kraus</p>
<p>Abstract: Auction-based federated learning (AFL) is an important emerging category of FL incentive mechanism design, due to its ability to fairly and efficiently motivate high-quality data owners to join data consumers' (i.e., servers') FL training tasks. To enhance the efficiency in AFL decision support for stakeholders (i.e., data consumers, data owners, and the auctioneer), intelligent agent-based techniques have emerged. However, due to the highly interdisciplinary nature of this field and the lack of a comprehensive survey providing an accessible perspective, it is a challenge for researchers to enter and contribute to this field. This paper bridges this important gap by providing a first-of-its-kind survey on the Intelligent Agents for AFL (IA-AFL) literature. We propose a unique multi-tiered taxonomy that organises existing IA-AFL works according to 1) the stakeholders served, 2) the auction mechanism adopted, and 3) the goals of the agents, to provide readers with a multi-perspective view into this field. In addition, we analyse the limitations of existing approaches, summarise the commonly adopted performance evaluation metrics, and discuss promising future directions leading towards effective and efficient stakeholder-oriented decision support in IA-AFL ecosystems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqi Shao, Michael G. H. Bell, Ze Wang, D. Glenn Geers, Haoning Xi, Junbin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and efficient traffic prediction is crucial for planning, management, and control of intelligent transportation systems. Most state-of-the-art methods for traffic prediction effectively predict both long-term and short-term by employing spatio-temporal neural networks as prediction models, together with transformers to learn global information on prediction objects (e.g., traffic states of road segments). However, these methods often have a high computational cost to obtain good performance. This paper introduces an innovative approach to traffic flow prediction, the Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Model (ST-SSMs), featuring the novel ST-Mamba block, which can achieve good prediction accuracy with less computational cost. A comparative analysis highlights the ST-Mamba layer's efficiency, revealing its equivalence to three attention layers, yet with markedly reduced processing time. Through rigorous testing on diverse real-world datasets, the ST-SSMs model demonstrates exceptional improvements in prediction accuracy and computational simplicity, setting new benchmarks in the domain of traffic flow forecasting</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fariba Jafari Horestani, M. Mehdi Owrang O</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we delve into the intricate relationships between diabetes and a range of health indicators, with a particular focus on the newly added variable of income. Utilizing data from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), we analyze the impact of various factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, smoking habits, and more on the prevalence of diabetes. Our comprehensive analysis not only investigates each factor in isolation but also explores their interdependencies and collective influence on diabetes. A novel aspect of our research is the examination of income as a determinant of diabetes risk, which to the best of our knowledge has been relatively underexplored in previous studies. We employ statistical and machine learning techniques to unravel the complex interplay between socio-economic status and diabetes, providing new insights into how financial well-being influences health outcomes. Our research reveals a discernible trend where lower income brackets are associated with a higher incidence of diabetes. In analyzing a blend of 33 variables, including health factors and lifestyle choices, we identified that features such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cholesterol checks, income, and Body Mass Index (BMI) are of considerable significance. These elements stand out among the myriad of factors examined, suggesting that they play a pivotal role in the prevalence and management of diabetes.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13278">Federated Transfer Learning with Task Personalization for Condition Monitoring in Ultrasonic Metal Welding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmadreza Eslaminia, Yuquan Meng, Klara Nahrstedt, Chenhui Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultrasonic metal welding (UMW) is a key joining technology with widespread industrial applications. Condition monitoring (CM) capabilities are critically needed in UMW applications because process anomalies significantly deteriorate the joining quality. Recently, machine learning models emerged as a promising tool for CM in many manufacturing applications due to their ability to learn complex patterns. Yet, the successful deployment of these models requires substantial training data that may be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Additionally, many existing machine learning models lack generalizability and cannot be directly applied to new process configurations (i.e., domains). Such issues may be potentially alleviated by pooling data across manufacturers, but data sharing raises critical data privacy concerns. To address these challenges, this paper presents a Federated Transfer Learning with Task Personalization (FTL-TP) framework that provides domain generalization capabilities in distributed learning while ensuring data privacy. By effectively learning a unified representation from feature space, FTL-TP can adapt CM models for clients working on similar tasks, thereby enhancing their overall adaptability and performance jointly. To demonstrate the effectiveness of FTL-TP, we investigate two distinct UMW CM tasks, tool condition monitoring and workpiece surface condition classification. Compared with state-of-the-art FL algorithms, FTL-TP achieves a 5.35%--8.08% improvement of accuracy in CM in new target domains. FTL-TP is also shown to perform excellently in challenging scenarios involving unbalanced data distributions and limited client fractions. Furthermore, by implementing the FTL-TP method on an edge-cloud architecture, we show that this method is both viable and efficient in practice. The FTL-TP framework is readily extensible to various other manufacturing applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiyoun Kim, Junu Kim, Kyunghoon Hur, Edward Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we provide solutions to two practical yet overlooked scenarios in federated learning for electronic health records (EHRs): firstly, we introduce EHRFL, a framework that facilitates federated learning across healthcare institutions with distinct medical coding systems and database schemas using text-based linearization of EHRs. Secondly, we focus on a scenario where a single healthcare institution initiates federated learning to build a model tailored for itself, in which the number of clients must be optimized in order to reduce expenses incurred by the host. For selecting participating clients, we present a novel precision-based method, leveraging data latents to identify suitable participants for the institution. Our empirical results show that EHRFL effectively enables federated learning across hospitals with different EHR systems. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the efficacy of our precision-based method in selecting reduced number of participating clients without compromising model performance, resulting in lower operational costs when constructing institution-specific models. We believe this work lays a foundation for the broader adoption of federated learning on EHRs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunxi Li, Tianyu Zhan, Shengyu Zhang, Kun Kuang, Jiwei Li, Zhou Zhao, Fei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we focus on heterogeneous knowledge transfer across entirely different model architectures, tasks, and modalities. Existing knowledge transfer methods (e.g., backbone sharing, knowledge distillation) often hinge on shared elements within model structures or task-specific features/labels, limiting transfers to complex model types or tasks. To overcome these challenges, we present MergeNet, which learns to bridge the gap of parameter spaces of heterogeneous models, facilitating the direct interaction, extraction, and application of knowledge within these parameter spaces. The core mechanism of MergeNet lies in the parameter adapter, which operates by querying the source model's low-rank parameters and adeptly learning to identify and map parameters into the target model. MergeNet is learned alongside both models, allowing our framework to dynamically transfer and adapt knowledge relevant to the current stage, including the training trajectory knowledge of the source model. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous knowledge transfer demonstrate significant improvements in challenging settings, where representative approaches may falter or prove less applicable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ukesh Thapa, Bipun Man Pati, Samit Thapa, Dhiraj Pyakurel, Anup Shrestha</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning techniques has led to their widespread application in various domains including water resources. However, snowmelt modeling remains an area that has not been extensively explored. In this study, we propose a state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning sequential model, leveraging the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), for snowmelt-driven discharge modeling in the Himalayan basin of the Hindu Kush Himalayan Region. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we conducted a comparative analysis with other popular models including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer. Furthermore, Nested cross-validation (CV) is used with five outer folds and three inner folds, and hyper-parameter tuning is performed on the inner folds. To evaluate the performance of the model mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), R square ($R^{2}$), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) are computed for each outer fold. The average metrics revealed that TCN outperformed the other models, with an average MAE of 0.011, RMSE of 0.023, $R^{2}$ of 0.991, KGE of 0.992, and NSE of 0.991. The findings of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the deep learning model as compared to traditional machine learning approaches for snowmelt-driven streamflow forecasting. Moreover, the superior performance of TCN highlights its potential as a promising deep learning model for similar hydrological applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moshe Eliasof, Beatrice Bevilacqua, Carola-Bibiane Sch\"onlieb, Haggai Maron</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, significant efforts have been made to refine the design of Graph Neural Network (GNN) layers, aiming to overcome diverse challenges, such as limited expressive power and oversmoothing. Despite their widespread adoption, the incorporation of off-the-shelf normalization layers like BatchNorm or InstanceNorm within a GNN architecture may not effectively capture the unique characteristics of graph-structured data, potentially reducing the expressive power of the overall architecture. Moreover, existing graph-specific normalization layers often struggle to offer substantial and consistent benefits. In this paper, we propose GRANOLA, a novel graph-adaptive normalization layer. Unlike existing normalization layers, GRANOLA normalizes node features by adapting to the specific characteristics of the graph, particularly by generating expressive representations of its neighborhood structure, obtained by leveraging the propagation of Random Node Features (RNF) in the graph. We present theoretical results that support our design choices. Our extensive empirical evaluation of various graph benchmarks underscores the superior performance of GRANOLA over existing normalization techniques. Furthermore, GRANOLA emerges as the top-performing method among all baselines within the same time complexity of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamidreza Mirkhani, Behzad Khamidehi, Kasra Rezaee</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory augmentation serves as a means to mitigate distributional shift in imitation learning. However, imitating trajectories that inadequately represent the original expert data can result in undesirable behaviors, particularly in safety-critical scenarios. We propose a trajectory augmentation method designed to maintain similarity with expert trajectory data. To accomplish this, we first cluster trajectories to identify minority yet safety-critical groups. Then, we combine the trajectories within the same cluster through geometrical transformation to create new trajectories. These trajectories are then added to the training dataset, provided that they meet our specified safety-related criteria. Our experiments exhibit that training an imitation learning model using these augmented trajectories can significantly improve closed-loop performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rob Romijnders, Christos Louizos, Yuki M. Asano, Max Welling</p>
<p>Abstract: The COVID19 pandemic had enormous economic and societal consequences. Contact tracing is an effective way to reduce infection rates by detecting potential virus carriers early. However, this was not generally adopted in the recent pandemic, and privacy concerns are cited as the most important reason. We substantially improve the privacy guarantees of the current state of the art in decentralized contact tracing. Whereas previous work was based on statistical inference only, we augment the inference with a learned neural network and ensure that this neural augmentation satisfies differential privacy. In a simulator for COVID19, even at epsilon=1 per message, this can significantly improve the detection of potentially infected individuals and, as a result of targeted testing, reduce infection rates. This work marks an important first step in integrating deep learning into contact tracing while maintaining essential privacy guarantees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thorren Kirschbaum, Annika Bande</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a new tool in chemistry to bypass expensive experiments or quantum-chemical calculations, for example, in high-throughput screening applications. However, many machine learning studies rely on small data sets, making it difficult to efficiently implement powerful deep learning architectures such as message passing neural networks. In this study, we benchmark common machine learning models for the prediction of molecular properties on small data sets, for which the best results are obtained with the message passing neural network PaiNN, as well as SOAP molecular descriptors concatenated to a set of simple molecular descriptors tailored to gradient boosting with regression trees. To further improve the predictive capabilities of PaiNN, we present a transfer learning strategy that uses large data sets to pre-train the respective models and allows to obtain more accurate models after fine-tuning on the original data sets. The pre-training labels are obtained from computationally cheap ab initio or semi-empirical models and corrected by simple linear regression on the target data set to obtain labels that are close to those of the original data. This strategy is tested on the Harvard Oxford Photovoltaics data set (HOPV, HOMO-LUMO-gaps), for which excellent results are obtained, and on the Freesolv data set (solvation energies), where this method is unsuccessful due to a complex underlying learning task and the dissimilar methods used to obtain pre-training and fine-tuning labels. Finally, we find that the final training results do not improve monotonically with the size of the pre-training data set, but pre-training with fewer data points can lead to more biased pre-trained models and higher accuracy after fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyuan Yang, Hu Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Wasserstein Barycenter (WB) is one of the most fundamental optimization problems in optimal transportation. Given a set of distributions, the goal of WB is to find a new distribution that minimizes the average Wasserstein distance to them. The problem becomes even harder if we restrict the solution to be ``$k$-sparse''. In this paper, we study the $k$-sparse WB problem in the presence of outliers, which is a more practical setting since real-world data often contains noise. Existing WB algorithms cannot be directly extended to handle the case with outliers, and thus it is urgently needed to develop some novel ideas. First, we investigate the relation between $k$-sparse WB with outliers and the clustering (with outliers) problems. In particular, we propose a clustering based LP method that yields constant approximation factor for the $k$-sparse WB with outliers problem. Further, we utilize the coreset technique to achieve the $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation factor for any $\epsilon>0$, if the dimensionality is not high. Finally, we conduct the experiments for our proposed algorithms and illustrate their efficiencies in practice.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13421">MultiConfederated Learning: Inclusive Non-IID Data handling with Decentralized Federated Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Duchesne, Kaiwen Zhang, Chamseddine Talhi</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent privacy-preserving technique for enabling use cases like confidential clinical machine learning. FL operates by aggregating models trained by remote devices which owns the data. Thus, FL enables the training of powerful global models using crowd-sourced data from a large number of learners, without compromising their privacy. However, the aggregating server is a single point of failure when generating the global model. Moreover, the performance of the model suffers when the data is not independent and identically distributed (non-IID data) on all remote devices. This leads to vastly different models being aggregated, which can reduce the performance by as much as 50% in certain scenarios.
  In this paper, we seek to address the aforementioned issues while retaining the benefits of FL. We propose MultiConfederated Learning: a decentralized FL framework which is designed to handle non-IID data. Unlike traditional FL, MultiConfederated Learning will maintain multiple models in parallel (instead of a single global model) to help with convergence when the data is non-IID. With the help of transfer learning, learners can converge to fewer models. In order to increase adaptability, learners are allowed to choose which updates to aggregate from their peers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Utsav Singh, Wesley A. Suttle, Brian M. Sadler, Vinay P. Namboodiri, Amrit Singh Bedi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce PIPER: Primitive-Informed Preference-based Hierarchical reinforcement learning via Hindsight Relabeling, a novel approach that leverages preference-based learning to learn a reward model, and subsequently uses this reward model to relabel higher-level replay buffers. Since this reward is unaffected by lower primitive behavior, our relabeling-based approach is able to mitigate non-stationarity, which is common in existing hierarchical approaches, and demonstrates impressive performance across a range of challenging sparse-reward tasks. Since obtaining human feedback is typically impractical, we propose to replace the human-in-the-loop approach with our primitive-in-the-loop approach, which generates feedback using sparse rewards provided by the environment. Moreover, in order to prevent infeasible subgoal prediction and avoid degenerate solutions, we propose primitive-informed regularization that conditions higher-level policies to generate feasible subgoals for lower-level policies. We perform extensive experiments to show that PIPER mitigates non-stationarity in hierarchical reinforcement learning and achieves greater than 50$\%$ success rates in challenging, sparse-reward robotic environments, where most other baselines fail to achieve any significant progress.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanjiang Hu, Jianglin Lan, Changliu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Safe control of neural network dynamic models (NNDMs) is important to robotics and many applications. However, it remains challenging to compute an optimal safe control in real time for NNDM. To enable real-time computation, we propose to use a sound approximation of the NNDM in the control synthesis. In particular, we propose Bernstein over-approximated neural dynamics (BOND) based on the Bernstein polynomial over-approximation (BPO) of ReLU activation functions in NNDM. To mitigate the errors introduced by the approximation and to ensure persistent feasibility of the safe control problems, we synthesize a worst-case safety index using the most unsafe approximated state within the BPO relaxation of NNDM offline. For the online real-time optimization, we formulate the first-order Taylor approximation of the nonlinear worst-case safety constraint as an additional linear layer of NNDM with the l2 bounded bias term for the higher-order remainder. Comprehensive experiments with different neural dynamics and safety constraints show that with safety guaranteed, our NNDMs with sound approximation are 10-100 times faster than the safe control baseline that uses mixed integer programming (MIP), validating the effectiveness of the worst-case safety index and scalability of the proposed BOND in real-time large-scale settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kleopatra Markou, Dimitrios Tomaras, Vana Kalogeraki, Dimitrios Gunopulos</p>
<p>Abstract: The imminent need to interpret the output of a Machine Learning model with counterfactual (CF) explanations - via small perturbations to the input - has been notable in the research community. Although the variety of CF examples is important, the aspect of them being feasible at the same time, does not necessarily apply in their entirety. This work uses different benchmark datasets to examine through the preservation of the logical causal relations of their attributes, whether CF examples can be generated after a small amount of changes to the original input, be feasible and actually useful to the end-user in a real-world case. To achieve this, we used a black box model as a classifier, to distinguish the desired from the input class and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate feasible CF examples. As an extension, we also extracted two-dimensional manifolds (one for each dataset) that located the majority of the feasible examples, a representation that adequately distinguished them from infeasible ones. For our experimentation we used three commonly used datasets and we managed to generate feasible and at the same time sparse, CF examples that satisfy all possible predefined causal constraints, by confirming their importance with the attributes in a dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deddy Jobson, Eddy Hudson</p>
<p>Abstract: Regression is typically treated as a curve-fitting process where the goal is to fit a prediction function to data. With the help of conditional generative adversarial networks, we propose to solve this age-old problem in a different way; we aim to learn a prediction function whose outputs, when paired with the corresponding inputs, are indistinguishable from feature-label pairs in the training dataset. We show that this approach to regression makes fewer assumptions on the distribution of the data we are fitting to and, therefore, has better representation capabilities. We draw parallels with generalized linear models in statistics and show how our proposal serves as an extension of them to neural networks. We demonstrate the superiority of this new approach to standard regression with experiments on multiple synthetic and publicly available real-world datasets, finding encouraging results, especially with real-world heavy-tailed regression datasets. To make our work more reproducible, we release our source code. Link to repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/regressGAN-7B71/</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13503">Predict to Minimize Swap Regret for All Payoff-Bounded Tasks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lunjia Hu, Yifan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: A sequence of predictions is calibrated if and only if it induces no swap regret to all down-stream decision tasks. We study the Maximum Swap Regret (MSR) of predictions for binary events: the swap regret maximized over all downstream tasks with bounded payoffs. Previously, the best online prediction algorithm for minimizing MSR is obtained by minimizing the K1 calibration error, which upper bounds MSR up to a constant factor. However, recent work (Qiao and Valiant, 2021) gives an ${\Omega}(T^{0.528})$ lower bound for the worst-case expected K1 calibration error incurred by any randomized algorithm in T rounds, presenting a barrier to achieving better rates for MSR. Several relaxations of MSR have been considered to overcome this barrier, via external regret (Kleinberg et al., 2023) and regret bounds depending polynomially on the number of actions in downstream tasks (Noarov et al., 2023; Roth and Shi, 2024). We show that the barrier can be surpassed without any relaxations: we give an efficient randomized prediction algorithm that guarantees $O(TlogT)$ expected MSR. We also discuss the economic utility of calibration by viewing MSR as a decision-theoretic calibration error metric and study its relationship to existing metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of deep learning has marked significant progress in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and medical imaging, primarily through the adaptation of pre-trained models for specific tasks. Traditional fine-tuning methods, involving adjustments to all parameters, face challenges due to high computational and memory demands. This has led to the development of Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, which selectively update parameters to balance computational efficiency with performance. This review examines PEFT approaches, offering a detailed comparison of various strategies highlighting applications across different domains, including text generation, medical imaging, protein modeling, and speech synthesis. By assessing the effectiveness of PEFT methods in reducing computational load, speeding up training, and lowering memory usage, this paper contributes to making deep learning more accessible and adaptable, facilitating its wider application and encouraging innovation in model optimization. Ultimately, the paper aims to contribute towards insights into PEFT's evolving landscape, guiding researchers and practitioners in overcoming the limitations of conventional fine-tuning approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Zhu, Jiachen Liu, Mosharaf Chowdhury, Fan Lai</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train machine learning (ML) models across potentially millions of edge client devices. Yet, training and customizing models for FL clients is notoriously challenging due to the heterogeneity of client data, device capabilities, and the massive scale of clients, making individualized model exploration prohibitively expensive. State-of-the-art FL solutions personalize a globally trained model or concurrently train multiple models, but they often incur suboptimal model accuracy and huge training costs.
  In this paper, we introduce FedTrans, a multi-model FL training framework that automatically produces and trains high-accuracy, hardware-compatible models for individual clients at scale. FedTrans begins with a basic global model, identifies accuracy bottlenecks in model architectures during training, and then employs model transformation to derive new models for heterogeneous clients on the fly. It judiciously assigns models to individual clients while performing soft aggregation on multi-model updates to minimize total training costs. Our evaluations using realistic settings show that FedTrans improves individual client model accuracy by 14% - 72% while slashing training costs by 1.6X - 20X over state-of-the-art solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Niu, Md Musfiqur Rahman Sanim, Zhihao Shu, Jiexiong Guan, Xipeng Shen, Miao Yin, Gagan Agrawal, Bin Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: This work is motivated by recent developments in Deep Neural Networks, particularly the Transformer architectures underlying applications such as ChatGPT, and the need for performing inference on mobile devices. Focusing on emerging transformers (specifically the ones with computationally efficient Swin-like architectures) and large models (e.g., Stable Diffusion and LLMs) based on transformers, we observe that layout transformations between the computational operators cause a significant slowdown in these applications. This paper presents SmartMem, a comprehensive framework for eliminating most layout transformations, with the idea that multiple operators can use the same tensor layout through careful choice of layout and implementation of operations. Our approach is based on classifying the operators into four groups, and considering combinations of producer-consumer edges between the operators. We develop a set of methods for searching such layouts. Another component of our work is developing efficient memory layouts for 2.5 dimensional memory commonly seen in mobile devices. Our experimental results show that SmartMem outperforms 5 state-of-the-art DNN execution frameworks on mobile devices across 18 varied neural networks, including CNNs, Transformers with both local and global attention, as well as LLMs. In particular, compared to DNNFusion, SmartMem achieves an average speedup of 2.8$\times$, and outperforms TVM and MNN with speedups of 6.9$\times$ and 7.9$\times$, respectively, on average.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have demonstrated great success in various fields of multimedia. However, the distribution shift between the training and test data challenges the effectiveness of GNNs. To mitigate this challenge, Test-Time Training (TTT) has been proposed as a promising approach. Traditional TTT methods require a demanding unsupervised training strategy to capture the information from test to benefit the main task. Inspired by the great annotation ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), we propose to enhance the test-time training on graphs with LLMs as annotators. In this paper, we design a novel Test-Time Training pipeline, LLMTTT, which conducts the test-time adaptation under the annotations by LLMs on a carefully-selected node set. Specifically, LLMTTT introduces a hybrid active node selection strategy that considers not only node diversity and representativeness, but also prediction signals from the pre-trained model. Given annotations from LLMs, a two-stage training strategy is designed to tailor the test-time model with the limited and noisy labels. A theoretical analysis ensures the validity of our method and extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LLMTTT can achieve a significant performance improvement compared to existing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to enable models to forget specific data instances when receiving deletion requests. Current research centres on efficient unlearning to erase the influence of data from the model and neglects the subsequent impacts on the remaining data. Consequently, existing unlearning algorithms degrade the model's performance after unlearning, known as \textit{over-unlearning}. This paper addresses this critical yet under-explored issue by introducing machine \underline{U}nlearning via \underline{N}ull \underline{S}pace \underline{C}alibration (UNSC), which can accurately unlearn target samples without over-unlearning. On the contrary, by calibrating the decision space during unlearning, UNSC can significantly improve the model's performance on the remaining samples. In particular, our approach hinges on confining the unlearning process to a specified null space tailored to the remaining samples, which is augmented by strategically pseudo-labeling the unlearning samples. Comparative analyses against several established baselines affirm the superiority of our approach.

<p>Abstract: The existing definitions of graph convolution, either from spatial or spectral perspectives, are inflexible and not unified. Defining a general convolution operator in the graph domain is challenging due to the lack of canonical coordinates, the presence of irregular structures, and the properties of graph symmetries. In this work, we propose a novel graph convolution framework by parameterizing the kernels as continuous functions of pseudo-coordinates derived via graph positional encoding. We name this Continuous Kernel Graph Convolution (CKGConv). Theoretically, we demonstrate that CKGConv is flexible and expressive. CKGConv encompasses many existing graph convolutions, and exhibits the same expressiveness as graph transformers in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs. Empirically, we show that CKGConv-based Networks outperform existing graph convolutional networks and perform comparably to the best graph transformers across a variety of graph datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Distinct from human cognitive processing, deep neural networks trained by backpropagation can be easily fooled by adversarial examples. To design a semantically meaningful representation learning, we discard backpropagation, and instead, propose a local contrastive learning, where the representation for the inputs bearing the same label shrink (akin to boson) in hidden layers, while those of different labels repel (akin to fermion). This layer-wise learning is local in nature, being biological plausible. A statistical mechanics analysis shows that the target fermion-pair-distance is a key parameter. Moreover, the application of this local contrastive learning to MNIST benchmark dataset demonstrates that the adversarial vulnerability of standard perceptron can be greatly mitigated by tuning the target distance, i.e., controlling the geometric separation of prototype manifolds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Resmi Ramachandranpillai, Md Fahim Sikder, David Bergstr\"om, Fredrik Heintz</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to enhance the usefulness of Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) by generating realistic de-identified data. However, the existing literature primarily focuses on the quality of synthetic health data, neglecting the crucial aspect of fairness in downstream predictions. Consequently, models trained on synthetic EHR have faced criticism for producing biased outcomes in target tasks. These biases can arise from either spurious correlations between features or the failure of models to accurately represent sub-groups. To address these concerns, we present Bias-transforming Generative Adversarial Networks (Bt-GAN), a GAN-based synthetic data generator specifically designed for the healthcare domain. In order to tackle spurious correlations (i), we propose an information-constrained Data Generation Process that enables the generator to learn a fair deterministic transformation based on a well-defined notion of algorithmic fairness. To overcome the challenge of capturing exact sub-group representations (ii), we incentivize the generator to preserve sub-group densities through score-based weighted sampling. This approach compels the generator to learn from underrepresented regions of the data manifold. We conduct extensive experiments using the MIMIC-III database. Our results demonstrate that Bt-GAN achieves SOTA accuracy while significantly improving fairness and minimizing bias amplification. We also perform an in-depth explainability analysis to provide additional evidence supporting the validity of our study. In conclusion, our research introduces a novel and professional approach to addressing the limitations of synthetic data generation in the healthcare domain. By incorporating fairness considerations and leveraging advanced techniques such as GANs, we pave the way for more reliable and unbiased predictions in healthcare applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Peng, Weiyu Li, Qing Ling</p>
<p>Abstract: Robustness to malicious attacks is of paramount importance for distributed learning. Existing works often consider the classical Byzantine attacks model, which assumes that some workers can send arbitrarily malicious messages to the server and disturb the aggregation steps of the distributed learning process. To defend against such worst-case Byzantine attacks, various robust aggregators have been proven effective and much superior to the often-used mean aggregator. In this paper, we show that robust aggregators are too conservative for a class of weak but practical malicious attacks, as known as label poisoning attacks, where the sample labels of some workers are poisoned. Surprisingly, we are able to show that the mean aggregator is more robust than the state-of-the-art robust aggregators in theory, given that the distributed data are sufficiently heterogeneous. In fact, the learning error of the mean aggregator is proven to be optimal in order. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the superiority of the mean aggregator under label poisoning attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehao Dong, Muhan Zhang, Yixin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of machine learning on non-Euclidean data such as graphs and networks. GNNs effectively implement node representation learning through neighborhood aggregation and achieve impressive results in many graph-related tasks. However, most neighborhood aggregation approaches are summation-based, which can be problematic as they may not be sufficiently expressive to encode informative graph structures. Furthermore, though the graph pooling module is also of vital importance for graph learning, especially for the task of graph classification, research on graph down-sampling mechanisms is rather limited.
  To address the above challenges, we propose a concatenation-based graph convolution mechanism that injectively updates node representations to maximize the discriminative power in distinguishing non-isomorphic subgraphs. In addition, we design a novel graph pooling module, called WL-SortPool, to learn important subgraph patterns in a deep-learning manner. WL-SortPool layer-wise sorts node representations (i.e. continuous WL colors) to separately learn the relative importance of subtrees with different depths for the purpose of classification, thus better characterizing the complex graph topology and rich information encoded in the graph. We propose a novel Subgraph Pattern GNN (SPGNN) architecture that incorporates these enhancements. We test the proposed SPGNN architecture on many graph classification benchmarks. Experimental results show that our method can achieve highly competitive results with state-of-the-art graph kernels and other GNN approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingqing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing temporal point process models are characterized by conditional intensity function. These models often require numerical approximation methods for likelihood evaluation, which potentially hurts their performance. By directly modelling the integral of the intensity function, i.e., the cumulative hazard function (CHF), the likelihood can be evaluated accurately, making it a promising approach. However, existing CHF-based methods are not well-defined, i.e., the mathematical constraints of CHF are not completely satisfied, leading to untrustworthy results. For multivariate temporal point process, most existing methods model intensity (or density, etc.) functions for each variate, limiting the scalability. In this paper, we explore using neural networks to model a flexible but well-defined CHF and learning the multivariate temporal point process with low parameter complexity. Experimental results on six datasets show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on data fitting and event prediction tasks while having significantly fewer parameters and memory usage than the strong competitors.

<p>Abstract: The B5G/6G evolution relies on connect-compute technologies and highly heterogeneous clusters with HW accelerators, which require specialized coding to be efficiently utilized. The current paper proposes a custom tool for generating multiple SW versions of a certain AI function input in high-level language, e.g., Python TensorFlow, while targeting multiple diverse HW+SW platforms. TF2AIF builds upon disparate tool-flows to create a plethora of relative containers and enable the system orchestrator to deploy the requested function on any peculiar node in the cloud-edge continuum, i.e., to leverage the performance/energy benefits of the underlying HW upon any circumstances. TF2AIF fills an identified gap in today's ecosystem and facilitates research on resource management or automated operations, by demanding minimal time or expertise from users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shitong Shao, Zikai Zhou, Huanran Chen, Zhiqiang Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset condensation, a concept within data-centric learning, efficiently transfers critical attributes from an original dataset to a synthetic version, maintaining both diversity and realism. This approach significantly improves model training efficiency and is adaptable across multiple application areas. Previous methods in dataset condensation have faced challenges: some incur high computational costs which limit scalability to larger datasets (e.g., MTT, DREAM, and TESLA), while others are restricted to less optimal design spaces, which could hinder potential improvements, especially in smaller datasets (e.g., SRe2L, G-VBSM, and RDED). To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive design framework that includes specific, effective strategies like implementing soft category-aware matching and adjusting the learning rate schedule. These strategies are grounded in empirical evidence and theoretical backing. Our resulting approach, Elucidate Dataset Condensation (EDC), establishes a benchmark for both small and large-scale dataset condensation. In our testing, EDC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reaching 48.6% on ImageNet-1k with a ResNet-18 model at an IPC of 10, which corresponds to a compression ratio of 0.78%. This performance exceeds those of SRe2L, G-VBSM, and RDED by margins of 27.3%, 17.2%, and 6.6%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junqi Jiang, Francesco Leofante, Antonio Rago, Francesca Toni</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) have emerged as a major paradigm in explainable AI research, providing recourse recommendations for users affected by the decisions of machine learning models. However, when slight changes occur in the parameters of the underlying model, CEs found by existing methods often become invalid for the updated models. The literature lacks a way to certify deterministic robustness guarantees for CEs under model changes, in that existing methods to improve CEs' robustness are heuristic, and the robustness performances are evaluated empirically using only a limited number of retrained models. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel interval abstraction technique for parametric machine learning models, which allows us to obtain provable robustness guarantees of CEs under the possibly infinite set of plausible model changes $\Delta$. We formalise our robustness notion as the $\Delta$-robustness for CEs, in both binary and multi-class classification settings. We formulate procedures to verify $\Delta$-robustness based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming, using which we further propose two algorithms to generate CEs that are $\Delta$-robust. In an extensive empirical study, we demonstrate how our approach can be used in practice by discussing two strategies for determining the appropriate hyperparameter in our method, and we quantitatively benchmark the CEs generated by eleven methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our algorithms in finding robust CEs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent research has introduced Representation Engineering (RepE) as a promising approach for understanding complex inner workings of large-scale models like Large Language Models (LLMs). However, finding practical and efficient methods to apply these representations for general and flexible model editing remains an open problem. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, we introduce a novel approach called Adversarial Representation Engineering (ARE). This method leverages RepE by using a representation sensor to guide the editing of LLMs, offering a unified and interpretable framework for conceptual model editing without degrading baseline performance. Our experiments on multiple conceptual editing confirm ARE's effectiveness. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Zhang-Yihao/Adversarial-Representation-Engineering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihang Li, Zhao Song, Weixin Wang, Junze Yin, Zheng Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Leverage score is a fundamental problem in machine learning and theoretical computer science. It has extensive applications in regression analysis, randomized algorithms, and neural network inversion. Despite leverage scores are widely used as a tool, in this paper, we study a novel problem, namely the inverting leverage score problem. We analyze to invert the leverage score distributions back to recover model parameters. Specifically, given a leverage score $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}^n$, the matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, and the vector $b \in \mathbb{R}^n$, we analyze the non-convex optimization problem of finding $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ to minimize $\| \mathrm{diag}( \sigma ) - I_n \circ (A(x) (A(x)^\top A(x) )^{-1} A(x)^\top ) \|_F$, where $A(x):= S(x)^{-1} A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d} $, $S(x) := \mathrm{diag}(s(x)) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and $s(x) : = Ax - b \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Our theoretical studies include computing the gradient and Hessian, demonstrating that the Hessian matrix is positive definite and Lipschitz, and constructing first-order and second-order algorithms to solve this regression problem. Our work combines iterative shrinking and the induction hypothesis to ensure global convergence rates for the Newton method, as well as the properties of Lipschitz and strong convexity to guarantee the performance of gradient descent. This important study on inverting statistical leverage opens up numerous new applications in interpretation, data recovery, and security.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13815">Improving Group Robustness on Spurious Correlation Requires Preciser Group Inference</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujin Han, Difan Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) models may prioritize learning spurious correlations between spurious features and true labels, leading to poor accuracy on groups where these correlations do not hold. Mitigating this issue often requires expensive spurious attribute (group) labels or relies on trained ERM models to infer group labels when group information is unavailable. However, the significant performance gap in worst-group accuracy between using pseudo group labels and using oracle group labels inspires us to consider further improving group robustness through preciser group inference. Therefore, we propose GIC, a novel method that accurately infers group labels, resulting in improved worst-group performance. GIC trains a spurious attribute classifier based on two key properties of spurious correlations: (1) high correlation between spurious attributes and true labels, and (2) variability in this correlation between datasets with different group distributions. Empirical studies on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GIC in inferring group labels, and combining GIC with various downstream invariant learning methods improves worst-group accuracy, showcasing its powerful flexibility. Additionally, through analyzing the misclassifications in GIC, we identify an interesting phenomenon called semantic consistency, which may contribute to better decoupling the association between spurious attributes and labels, thereby mitigating spurious correlation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marie Siew, Haoran Zhang, Jong-Ik Park, Yuezhou Liu, Yichen Ruan, Lili Su, Stratis Ioannidis, Edmund Yeh, Carlee Joe-Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative learning across multiple clients. In most FL work, all clients train a single learning task. However, the recent proliferation of FL applications may increasingly require multiple FL tasks to be trained simultaneously, sharing clients' computing and communication resources, which we call Multiple-Model Federated Learning (MMFL). Current MMFL algorithms use naive average-based client-task allocation schemes that can lead to unfair performance when FL tasks have heterogeneous difficulty levels, e.g., tasks with larger models may need more rounds and data to train. Just as naively allocating resources to generic computing jobs with heterogeneous resource needs can lead to unfair outcomes, naive allocation of clients to FL tasks can lead to unfairness, with some tasks having excessively long training times, or lower converged accuracies. Furthermore, in the FL setting, since clients are typically not paid for their training effort, we face a further challenge that some clients may not even be willing to train some tasks, e.g., due to high computational costs, which may exacerbate unfairness in training outcomes across tasks. We address both challenges by firstly designing FedFairMMFL, a difficulty-aware algorithm that dynamically allocates clients to tasks in each training round. We provide guarantees on airness and FedFairMMFL's convergence rate. We then propose a novel auction design that incentivizes clients to train multiple tasks, so as to fairly distribute clients' training efforts across the tasks. We show how our fairness-based learning and incentive mechanisms impact training convergence and finally evaluate our algorithm with multiple sets of learning tasks on real world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: A primary function of back-propagation is to compute both the gradient of hidden representations and parameters for optimization with gradient descent. Training large models requires high computational costs due to their vast parameter sizes. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods aim to train smaller auxiliary models to save computational space, they still present computational overheads, especially in Fine-Tuning as a Service (FTaaS) for numerous users. We introduce Collaborative Adaptation (ColA) with Gradient Learning (GL), a parameter-free, model-agnostic fine-tuning approach that decouples the computation of the gradient of hidden representations and parameters. In comparison to PEFT methods, ColA facilitates more cost-effective FTaaS by offloading the computation of the gradient to low-cost devices. We also provide a theoretical analysis of ColA and experimentally demonstrate that ColA can perform on par or better than existing PEFT methods on various benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tetsuro Morimura, Mitsuki Sakamoto, Yuu Jinnai, Kenshi Abe, Kaito Air</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) plays a crucial role in aligning language models with human preferences. While the significance of dataset quality is generally recognized, explicit investigations into its impact within the RLHF framework, to our knowledge, have been limited. This paper addresses the issue of text quality within the preference dataset by focusing on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), an increasingly adopted reward-model-free RLHF method. We confirm that text quality significantly influences the performance of models optimized with DPO more than those optimized with reward-model-based RLHF. Building on this new insight, we propose an extension of DPO, termed filtered direct preference optimization (fDPO). fDPO uses a trained reward model to monitor the quality of texts within the preference dataset during DPO training. Samples of lower quality are discarded based on comparisons with texts generated by the model being optimized, resulting in a more accurate dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO enhances the final model performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/filtered-dpo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Rong, Yingchi Mao, Yinqiu Liu, Ling Chen, Xiaoming He, Dusit Niyato</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic speed prediction is significant for intelligent navigation and congestion alleviation. However, making accurate predictions is challenging due to three factors: 1) traffic diffusion, i.e., the spatial and temporal causality existing between the traffic conditions of multiple neighboring roads, 2) the poor interpretability of traffic data with complicated spatio-temporal correlations, and 3) the latent pattern of traffic speed fluctuations over time, such as morning and evening rush. Jointly considering these factors, in this paper, we present a novel architecture for traffic speed prediction, called Interpretable Causal Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Network (ICST-DNET). Specifically, ICST-DENT consists of three parts, namely the Spatio-Temporal Causality Learning (STCL), Causal Graph Generation (CGG), and Speed Fluctuation Pattern Recognition (SFPR) modules. First, to model the traffic diffusion within road networks, an STCL module is proposed to capture both the temporal causality on each individual road and the spatial causality in each road pair. The CGG module is then developed based on STCL to enhance the interpretability of the traffic diffusion procedure from the temporal and spatial perspectives. Specifically, a time causality matrix is generated to explain the temporal causality between each road's historical and future traffic conditions. For spatial causality, we utilize causal graphs to visualize the diffusion process in road pairs. Finally, to adapt to traffic speed fluctuations in different scenarios, we design a personalized SFPR module to select the historical timesteps with strong influences for learning the pattern of traffic speed fluctuations. Extensive experimental results prove that ICST-DNET can outperform all existing baselines, as evidenced by the higher prediction accuracy, ability to explain causality, and adaptability to different scenarios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13860">Distributional Black-Box Model Inversion Attack with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Huan Bao, Kaimin Wei, Yongdong Wu, Jin Qian, Robert H. Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: A Model Inversion (MI) attack based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) aims to recover the private training data from complex deep learning models by searching codes in the latent space. However, they merely search a deterministic latent space such that the found latent code is usually suboptimal. In addition, the existing distributional MI schemes assume that an attacker can access the structures and parameters of the target model, which is not always viable in practice. To overcome the above shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel Distributional Black-Box Model Inversion (DBB-MI) attack by constructing the probabilistic latent space for searching the target privacy data. Specifically, DBB-MI does not need the target model parameters or specialized GAN training. Instead, it finds the latent probability distribution by combining the output of the target model with multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques. Then, it randomly chooses latent codes from the latent probability distribution for recovering the private data. As the latent probability distribution closely aligns with the target privacy data in latent space, the recovered data will leak the privacy of training samples of the target model significantly. Abundant experiments conducted on diverse datasets and networks show that the present DBB-MI has better performance than state-of-the-art in attack accuracy, K-nearest neighbor feature distance, and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio.</p>

<p>Abstract: In robotic control tasks, policies trained by reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation often experience a performance drop when deployed on physical hardware, due to modeling error, measurement error, and unpredictable perturbations in the real world. Robust RL methods account for this issue by approximating a worst-case value function during training, but they can be sensitive to approximation errors in the value function and its gradient before training is complete. In this paper, we hypothesize that Lipschitz regularization can help condition the approximated value function gradients, leading to improved robustness after training. We test this hypothesis by combining Lipschitz regularization with an application of Fast Gradient Sign Method to reduce approximation errors when evaluating the value function under adversarial perturbations. Our empirical results demonstrate the benefits of this approach over prior work on a number of continuous control benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) is a family of algorithms for effectively solving imperfect-information games. It decomposes the total regret into counterfactual regrets, utilizing local regret minimization algorithms, such as Regret Matching (RM) or RM+, to minimize them. Recent research establishes a connection between Online Mirror Descent (OMD) and RM+, paving the way for an optimistic variant PRM+ and its extension PCFR+. However, PCFR+ assigns uniform weights for each iteration when determining regrets, leading to substantial regrets when facing dominated actions. This work explores minimizing weighted counterfactual regret with optimistic OMD, resulting in a novel CFR variant PDCFR+. It integrates PCFR+ and Discounted CFR (DCFR) in a principled manner, swiftly mitigating negative effects of dominated actions and consistently leveraging predictions to accelerate convergence. Theoretical analyses prove that PDCFR+ converges to a Nash equilibrium, particularly under distinct weighting schemes for regrets and average strategies. Experimental results demonstrate PDCFR+'s fast convergence in common imperfect-information games. The code is available at https://github.com/rpSebastian/PDCFRPlus.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihao Zhang, kenji kawaguchi, Angela Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Most works studying representation learning focus only on classification and neglect regression. Yet, the learning objectives and therefore the representation topologies of the two tasks are fundamentally different: classification targets class separation, leading to disconnected representations, whereas regression requires ordinality with respect to the target, leading to continuous representations. We thus wonder how the effectiveness of a regression representation is influenced by its topology, with evaluation based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle.
  The IB principle is an important framework that provides principles for learning effectiveness representations. We establish two connections between it and the topology of regression representations. The first connection reveals that a lower intrinsic dimension of the feature space implies a reduced complexity of the representation Z. This complexity can be quantified as the conditional entropy of Z on the target space Y and serves as an upper bound on the generalization error. The second connection suggests learning a feature space that is topologically similar to the target space will better align with the IB principle. Based on these two connections, we introduce PH-Reg, a regularizer specific to regression that matches the intrinsic dimension and topology of the feature space with the target space. Experiments on synthetic and real-world regression tasks demonstrate the benefits of PH-Reg.</p>

We demonstrate our method on scalar predictions with the study of image feature representation in the brain from fMRI neural signals and the estimation of neural population receptive fields (NSD dataset), as well as on categorical predictions with the investigation of handwritten digit recognition (MNIST dataset).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rong Wang, Guichen Zhou, Mingjun Gao, Yunpeng Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the neural network backdoor hidden in the parameters of the federated learning model has been proved to have great security risks. Considering the characteristics of trigger generation, data poisoning and model training in backdoor attack, this paper designs a backdoor attack method based on federated learning. Firstly, aiming at the concealment of the backdoor trigger, a TrojanGan steganography model with encoder-decoder structure is designed. The model can encode specific attack information as invisible noise and attach it to the image as a backdoor trigger, which improves the concealment and data transformations of the backdoor trigger.Secondly, aiming at the problem of single backdoor trigger mode, an image poisoning attack method called combination trigger attack is proposed. This method realizes multi-backdoor triggering by multiplexing combined triggers and improves the robustness of backdoor attacks. Finally, aiming at the problem that the local training mechanism leads to the decrease of the success rate of backdoor attack, a dual model replacement backdoor attack algorithm based on federated learning is designed. This method can improve the success rate of backdoor attack while maintaining the performance of the federated learning aggregation model. Experiments show that the attack strategy in this paper can not only achieve high backdoor concealment and diversification of trigger forms under federated learning, but also achieve good attack success rate in multi-target attacks.door concealment and diversification of trigger forms but also achieve good results in multi-target attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the recent advances in machine learning, creating agents that behave realistically in simulated air combat has become a growing field of interest. This survey explores the application of machine learning techniques for modeling air combat behavior, motivated by the potential to enhance simulation-based pilot training. Current simulated entities tend to lack realistic behavior, and traditional behavior modeling is labor-intensive and prone to loss of essential domain knowledge between development steps. Advancements in reinforcement learning and imitation learning algorithms have demonstrated that agents may learn complex behavior from data, which could be faster and more scalable than manual methods. Yet, making adaptive agents capable of performing tactical maneuvers and operating weapons and sensors still poses a significant challenge. The survey examines applications, behavior model types, prevalent machine learning methods, and the technical and human challenges in developing adaptive and realistically behaving agents. Another challenge is the transfer of agents from learning environments to military simulation systems and the consequent demand for standardization. Four primary recommendations are presented regarding increased emphasis on beyond-visual-range scenarios, multi-agent machine learning and cooperation, utilization of hierarchical behavior models, and initiatives for standardization and research collaboration. These recommendations aim to address current issues and guide the development of more comprehensive, adaptable, and realistic machine learning-based behavior models for air combat applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> iachen T. Wang, Zhun Deng, Hiroaki Chiba-Okabe, Boaz Barak, Weijie J. Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems are trained on large data corpora to generate new pieces of text, images, videos, and other media. There is growing concern that such systems may infringe on the copyright interests of training data contributors. To address the copyright challenges of generative AI, we propose a framework that compensates copyright owners proportionally to their contributions to the creation of AI-generated content. The metric for contributions is quantitatively determined by leveraging the probabilistic nature of modern generative AI models and using techniques from cooperative game theory in economics. This framework enables a platform where AI developers benefit from access to high-quality training data, thus improving model performance. Meanwhile, copyright owners receive fair compensation, driving the continued provision of relevant data for generative model training. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully identifies the most relevant data sources used in artwork generation, ensuring a fair and interpretable distribution of revenues among copyright owners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Campos, Bin Yang, Tung Kieu, Miao Zhang, Chenjuan Guo, Christian S. Jensen</p>
<p>Abstract: We are witnessing an increasing availability of streaming data that may contain valuable information on the underlying processes. It is thus attractive to be able to deploy machine learning models on edge devices near sensors such that decisions can be made instantaneously, rather than first having to transmit incoming data to servers. To enable deployment on edge devices with limited storage and computational capabilities, the full-precision parameters in standard models can be quantized to use fewer bits. The resulting quantized models are then calibrated using back-propagation and full training data to ensure accuracy. This one-time calibration works for deployments in static environments. However, model deployment in dynamic edge environments call for continual calibration to adaptively adjust quantized models to fit new incoming data, which may have different distributions. The first difficulty in enabling continual calibration on the edge is that the full training data may be too large and thus not always available on edge devices. The second difficulty is that the use of back-propagation on the edge for repeated calibration is too expensive. We propose QCore to enable continual calibration on the edge. First, it compresses the full training data into a small subset to enable effective calibration of quantized models with different bit-widths. We also propose means of updating the subset when new streaming data arrives to reflect changes in the environment, while not forgetting earlier training data. Second, we propose a small bit-flipping network that works with the subset to update quantized model parameters, thus enabling efficient continual calibration without back-propagation. An experimental study, conducted with real-world data in a continual learning setting, offers insight into the properties of QCore and shows that it is capable of outperforming strong baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwen Ye, Ruonan Yu, Songhua Liu, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of large-scale AI models trained on extensive datasets has revolutionized machine learning. With these models taking on increasingly central roles in various applications, the need to understand their behavior and enhance interpretability has become paramount. To investigate the impact of changes in training data on a pre-trained model, a common approach is leave-one-out retraining. This entails systematically altering the training dataset by removing specific samples to observe resulting changes within the model. However, retraining the model for each altered dataset presents a significant computational challenge, given the need to perform this operation for every dataset variation. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework for assessing data impact, comprising offline training and online evaluation stages. During the offline training phase, we approximate the influence of training data on the target model through a distilled synset, formulated as a reversed gradient matching problem. For online evaluation, we expedite the leave-one-out process using the synset, which is then utilized to compute the attribution matrix based on the evaluation objective. Experimental evaluations, including training data attribution and assessments of data quality, demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable model behavior evaluation while significantly speeding up the process compared to the direct retraining method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwen Ye, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The training of contemporary deep learning models heavily relies on publicly available data, posing a risk of unauthorized access to online data and raising concerns about data privacy. Current approaches to creating unlearnable data involve incorporating small, specially designed noises, but these methods strictly limit data usability, overlooking its potential usage in authorized scenarios. In this paper, we extend the concept of unlearnable data to conditional data learnability and introduce \textbf{U}n\textbf{G}eneralizable \textbf{E}xamples (UGEs). UGEs exhibit learnability for authorized users while maintaining unlearnability for potential hackers. The protector defines the authorized network and optimizes UGEs to match the gradients of the original data and its ungeneralizable version, ensuring learnability. To prevent unauthorized learning, UGEs are trained by maximizing a designated distance loss in a common feature space. Additionally, to further safeguard the authorized side from potential attacks, we introduce additional undistillation optimization. Experimental results on multiple datasets and various networks demonstrate that the proposed UGEs framework preserves data usability while reducing training performance on hacker networks, even under different types of attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pawe{\l} Golik, Maciej Grzenda, El\.zbieta Sienkiewicz</p>
<p>Abstract: Travel mode choice (TMC) prediction, which can be formulated as a classification task, helps in understanding what makes citizens choose different modes of transport for individual trips. This is also a major step towards fostering sustainable transportation. As behaviour may evolve over time, we also face the question of detecting concept drift in the data. This necessitates using appropriate methods to address potential concept drift. In particular, it is necessary to decide whether batch or stream mining methods should be used to develop periodically updated TMC models. To address the challenge of the development of TMC models, we propose the novel Incremental Ensemble of Batch and Stream Models (IEBSM) method aimed at adapting travel mode choice classifiers to concept drift possibly occurring in the data. It relies on the combination of drift detectors with batch learning and stream mining models. We compare it against batch and incremental learners, including methods relying on active drift detection. Experiments with varied travel mode data sets representing both city and country levels show that the IEBSM method both detects drift in travel mode data and successfully adapts the models to evolving travel mode choice data. The method has a higher rank than batch and stream learners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Huang, Xudong Ma, Haotong Qin, Xingyu Zheng, Chengtao Lv, Hong Chen, Jie Luo, Xiaojuan Qi, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno</p>
<p>Abstract: Meta's LLaMA family has become one of the most powerful open-source Large Language Model (LLM) series. Notably, LLaMA3 models have recently been released and achieve impressive performance across various with super-large scale pre-training on over 15T tokens of data. Given the wide application of low-bit quantization for LLMs in resource-limited scenarios, we explore LLaMA3's capabilities when quantized to low bit-width. This exploration holds the potential to unveil new insights and challenges for low-bit quantization of LLaMA3 and other forthcoming LLMs, especially in addressing performance degradation problems that suffer in LLM compression. Specifically, we evaluate the 10 existing post-training quantization and LoRA-finetuning methods of LLaMA3 on 1-8 bits and diverse datasets to comprehensively reveal LLaMA3's low-bit quantization performance. Our experiment results indicate that LLaMA3 still suffers non-negligent degradation in these scenarios, especially in ultra-low bit-width. This highlights the significant performance gap under low bit-width that needs to be bridged in future developments. We expect that this empirical study will prove valuable in advancing future models, pushing the LLMs to lower bit-width with higher accuracy for being practical.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinlin Zhu, Xunkai Li, Zhengyu Wu, Di Wu, Miao Hu, Rong-Hua Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Subgraph federated learning (subgraph-FL) is a new distributed paradigm that facilitates the collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) by multi-client subgraphs. Unfortunately, a significant challenge of subgraph-FL arises from subgraph heterogeneity, which stems from node and topology variation, causing the impaired performance of the global GNN. Despite various studies, they have not yet thoroughly investigated the impact mechanism of subgraph heterogeneity. To this end, we decouple node and topology variation, revealing that they correspond to differences in label distribution and structure homophily. Remarkably, these variations lead to significant differences in the class-wise knowledge reliability of multiple local GNNs, misguiding the model aggregation with varying degrees. Building on this insight, we propose topology-aware data-free knowledge distillation technology (FedTAD), enhancing reliable knowledge transfer from the local model to the global model. Extensive experiments on six public datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedTAD over state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mhairi Dunion, Stefano V. Albrecht</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of image-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can vary depending on the position of the camera used to capture the images. Training on multiple cameras simultaneously, including a first-person egocentric camera, can leverage information from different camera perspectives to improve the performance of RL. However, hardware constraints may limit the availability of multiple cameras in real-world deployment. Additionally, cameras may become damaged in the real-world preventing access to all cameras that were used during training. To overcome these hardware constraints, we propose Multi-View Disentanglement (MVD), which uses multiple cameras to learn a policy that achieves zero-shot generalisation to any single camera from the training set. Our approach is a self-supervised auxiliary task for RL that learns a disentangled representation from multiple cameras, with a shared representation that is aligned across all cameras to allow generalisation to a single camera, and a private representation that is camera-specific. We show experimentally that an RL agent trained on a single third-person camera is unable to learn an optimal policy in many control tasks; but, our approach, benefiting from multiple cameras during training, is able to solve the task using only the same single third-person camera.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kang Luo, Yuanshao Zhu, Wei Chen, Kun Wang, Zhengyang Zhou, Sijie Ruan, Yuxuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory modeling refers to characterizing human movement behavior, serving as a pivotal step in understanding mobility patterns. Nevertheless, existing studies typically ignore the confounding effects of geospatial context, leading to the acquisition of spurious correlations and limited generalization capabilities. To bridge this gap, we initially formulate a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to decipher the trajectory representation learning process from a causal perspective. Building upon the SCM, we further present a Trajectory modeling framework (TrajCL) based on Causal Learning, which leverages the backdoor adjustment theory as an intervention tool to eliminate the spurious correlations between geospatial context and trajectories. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify that TrajCL markedly enhances performance in trajectory classification tasks while showcasing superior generalization and interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes Hugger, Virginie Uhlmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Soft targets combined with the cross-entropy loss have shown to improve generalization performance of deep neural networks on supervised classification tasks. The standard cross-entropy loss however assumes data to be categorically distributed, which may often not be the case in practice. In contrast, InfoNCE does not rely on such an explicit assumption but instead implicitly estimates the true conditional through negative sampling. Unfortunately, it cannot be combined with soft targets in its standard formulation, hindering its use in combination with sophisticated training strategies. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing a principled loss function that is compatible with probabilistic targets. Our new soft target InfoNCE loss is conceptually simple, efficient to compute, and can be derived within the framework of noise contrastive estimation. Using a toy example, we demonstrate shortcomings of the categorical distribution assumption of cross-entropy, and discuss implications of sampling from soft distributions. We observe that soft target InfoNCE performs on par with strong soft target cross-entropy baselines and outperforms hard target NLL and InfoNCE losses on popular benchmarks, including ImageNet. Finally, we provide a simple implementation of our loss, geared towards supervised classification and fully compatible with deep classification model trained with cross-entropy.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14161">Multidimensional Interpolants</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dohoon Lee, Kyogu Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In the domain of differential equation-based generative modeling, conventional approaches often rely on single-dimensional scalar values as interpolation coefficients during both training and inference phases. In this work, we introduce, for the first time, a multidimensional interpolant that extends these coefficients into multiple dimensions, leveraging the stochastic interpolant framework. Additionally, we propose a novel path optimization problem tailored to adaptively determine multidimensional inference trajectories, with a predetermined differential equation solver and a fixed number of function evaluations. Our solution involves simulation dynamics coupled with adversarial training to optimize the inference path. Notably, employing a multidimensional interpolant during training improves the model's inference performance, even in the absence of path optimization. When the adaptive, multidimensional path derived from our optimization process is employed, it yields further performance gains, even with fixed solver configurations. The introduction of multidimensional interpolants not only enhances the efficacy of models but also opens up a new domain for exploration in training and inference methodologies, emphasizing the potential of multidimensional paths as an untapped frontier.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuta Kawakami, Yuichi Takano, Akira Imakura</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the accumulation of data across various institutions has garnered attention for the technology of confidential data analysis, which improves analytical accuracy by sharing data between multiple institutions while protecting sensitive information. Among these methods, Data Collaboration Analysis (DCA) is noted for its efficiency in terms of computational cost and communication load, facilitating data sharing and analysis across different institutions while safeguarding confidential information. However, existing optimization problems for determining the necessary collaborative functions have faced challenges, such as the optimal solution for the collaborative representation often being a zero matrix and the difficulty in understanding the process of deriving solutions. This research addresses these issues by formulating the optimization problem through the segmentation of matrices into column vectors and proposing a solution method based on the generalized eigenvalue problem. Additionally, we demonstrate methods for constructing collaborative functions more effectively through weighting and the selection of efficient algorithms suited to specific situations. Experiments using real-world datasets have shown that our proposed formulation and solution for the collaborative function optimization problem achieve superior predictive accuracy compared to existing methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14197">SOFTS: Efficient Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Series-Core Fusion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Han, Xu-Yang Chen, Han-Jia Ye, De-Chuan Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields such as finance, traffic management, energy, and healthcare. Recent studies have highlighted the advantages of channel independence to resist distribution drift but neglect channel correlations, limiting further enhancements. Several methods utilize mechanisms like attention or mixer to address this by capturing channel correlations, but they either introduce excessive complexity or rely too heavily on the correlation to achieve satisfactory results under distribution drifts, particularly with a large number of channels. Addressing this gap, this paper presents an efficient MLP-based model, the Series-cOre Fused Time Series forecaster (SOFTS), which incorporates a novel STar Aggregate-Dispatch (STAD) module. Unlike traditional approaches that manage channel interactions through distributed structures, e.g., attention, STAD employs a centralized strategy. It aggregates all series to form a global core representation, which is then dispatched and fused with individual series representations to facilitate channel interactions effectively. SOFTS achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods with only linear complexity. The broad applicability of the STAD module across different forecasting models is also demonstrated empirically. For further research and development, we have made our code publicly available at https://github.com/Secilia-Cxy/SOFTS.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we consider the infinitely many armed bandit problems in rotting environments, where the mean reward of an arm may decrease with each pull, while otherwise, it remains unchanged. We explore two scenarios capturing problem-dependent characteristics regarding the decay of rewards: one in which the cumulative amount of rotting is bounded by $V_T$, referred to as the slow-rotting scenario, and the other in which the number of rotting instances is bounded by $S_T$, referred to as the abrupt-rotting scenario. To address the challenge posed by rotting rewards, we introduce an algorithm that utilizes UCB with an adaptive sliding window, designed to manage the bias and variance trade-off arising due to rotting rewards. Our proposed algorithm achieves tight regret bounds for both slow and abrupt rotting scenarios. Lastly, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithms using synthetic datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony Baptista, Alessandro Barp, Tapabrata Chakraborti, Chris Harbron, Ben D. MacArthur, Christopher R. S. Banerji</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful tools for approximating the distribution of complex data. It is known that data passing through a trained DNN classifier undergoes a series of geometric and topological simplifications. While some progress has been made toward understanding these transformations in neural networks with smooth activation functions, an understanding in the more general setting of non-smooth activation functions, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU), which tend to perform better, is required. Here we propose that the geometric transformations performed by DNNs during classification tasks have parallels to those expected under Hamilton's Ricci flow - a tool from differential geometry that evolves a manifold by smoothing its curvature, in order to identify its topology. To illustrate this idea, we present a computational framework to quantify the geometric changes that occur as data passes through successive layers of a DNN, and use this framework to motivate a notion of `global Ricci network flow' that can be used to assess a DNN's ability to disentangle complex data geometries to solve classification problems. By training more than $1,500$ DNN classifiers of different widths and depths on synthetic and real-world data, we show that the strength of global Ricci network flow-like behaviour correlates with accuracy for well-trained DNNs, independently of depth, width and data set. Our findings motivate the use of tools from differential and discrete geometry to the problem of explainability in deep learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paulo Yanez Sarmiento, Simon Witzke, Nadja Klein, Bernhard Y. Renard</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainability is a key component in many applications involving deep neural networks (DNNs). However, current explanation methods for DNNs commonly leave it to the human observer to distinguish relevant explanations from spurious noise. This is not feasible anymore when going from easily human-accessible data such as images to more complex data such as genome sequences. To facilitate the accessibility of DNN outputs from such complex data and to increase explainability, we present a modification of the widely used explanation method layer-wise relevance propagation. Our approach enforces sparsity directly by pruning the relevance propagation for the different layers. Thereby, we achieve sparser relevance attributions for the input features as well as for the intermediate layers. As the relevance propagation is input-specific, we aim to prune the relevance propagation rather than the underlying model architecture. This allows to prune different neurons for different inputs and hence, might be more appropriate to the local nature of explanation methods. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we evaluate it on two types of data, images and genomic sequences. We show that our modification indeed leads to noise reduction and concentrates relevance on the most important features compared to the baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fahim Tajwar, Anikait Singh, Archit Sharma, Rafael Rafailov, Jeff Schneider, Tengyang Xie, Stefano Ermon, Chelsea Finn, Aviral Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from preference labels plays a crucial role in fine-tuning large language models. There are several distinct approaches for preference fine-tuning, including supervised learning, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL), and contrastive learning. Different methods come with different implementation tradeoffs and performance differences, and existing empirical findings present different conclusions, for instance, some results show that online RL is quite important to attain good fine-tuning results, while others find (offline) contrastive or even purely supervised methods sufficient. This raises a natural question: what kind of approaches are important for fine-tuning with preference data and why? In this paper, we answer this question by performing a rigorous analysis of a number of fine-tuning techniques on didactic and full-scale LLM problems. Our main finding is that, in general, approaches that use on-policy sampling or attempt to push down the likelihood on certain responses (i.e., employ a "negative gradient") outperform offline and maximum likelihood objectives. We conceptualize our insights and unify methods that use on-policy sampling or negative gradient under a notion of mode-seeking objectives for categorical distributions. Mode-seeking objectives are able to alter probability mass on specific bins of a categorical distribution at a fast rate compared to maximum likelihood, allowing them to relocate masses across bins more effectively. Our analysis prescribes actionable insights for preference fine-tuning of LLMs and informs how data should be collected for maximal improvement.</p>

The wide use of 2D processing element (PE) arrays in machine learning accelerators poses new challenges of scalability and Quality of Results (QoR) for state-of-the-art academic global placers. In this work, we develop DG-RePlAce, a new and fast GPU-accelerated global placement framework built on top of the OpenROAD infrastructure, which exploits the inherent dataflow and datapath structures of machine learning accelerators. Experimental results with a variety of machine learning accelerators using a commercial 12nm enablement show that, compared with RePlAce (DREAMPlace), our approach achieves an average reduction in routed wirelength by 10% (7%) and total negative slack (TNS) by 31% (34%), with faster global placement and on-par total runtimes relative to DREAMPlace. Empirical studies on the TILOS MacroPlacement Benchmarks further demonstrate that post-route improvements over RePlAce and DREAMPlace may reach beyond the motivating application to machine learning accelerators.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the problem of learning to place logic blocks in Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and a learning-based method. In contrast to previous search-based placement algorithms, we instead employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the goal of minimizing wirelength. In addition to our preliminary learning results, we also evaluated a novel decomposition to address the nature of large search space when placing many blocks on a chipboard. Empirical experiments evaluate the effectiveness of the learning and decomposition paradigms on FPGA placement tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feihu Jiang, Chuan Qin, Jingshuai Zhang, Kaichun Yao, Xi Chen, Dazhong Shen, Chen Zhu, Hengshu Zhu, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: In the contemporary era of widespread online recruitment, resume understanding has been widely acknowledged as a fundamental and crucial task, which aims to extract structured information from resume documents automatically. Compared to the traditional rule-based approaches, the utilization of recently proposed pre-trained document understanding models can greatly enhance the effectiveness of resume understanding. The present approaches have, however, disregarded the hierarchical relations within the structured information presented in resumes, and have difficulty parsing resumes in an efficient manner. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel model, namely ERU, to achieve efficient resume understanding. Specifically, we first introduce a layout-aware multi-modal fusion transformer for encoding the segments in the resume with integrated textual, visual, and layout information. Then, we design three self-supervised tasks to pre-train this module via a large number of unlabeled resumes. Next, we fine-tune the model with a multi-granularity sequence labeling task to extract structured information from resumes. Finally, extensive experiments on a real-world dataset clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of ERU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Navid Mohammad Imran, Myounggyu Won</p>
<p>Abstract: The Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones (VRPD) seeks to optimize the routing paths for both trucks and drones, where the trucks are responsible for delivering parcels to customer locations, and the drones are dispatched from these trucks for parcel delivery, subsequently being retrieved by the trucks. Given the NP-Hard complexity of VRPD, numerous heuristic approaches have been introduced. However, improving solution quality and reducing computation time remain significant challenges. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive examination of heuristic methods designed for solving VRPD, distilling and standardizing them into core elements. We then develop a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that is seamlessly integrated with the heuristic solution components, establishing a set of universal principles for incorporating the RL framework with heuristic strategies in an aim to improve both the solution quality and computation speed. This integration has been applied to a state-of-the-art heuristic solution for VRPD, showcasing the substantial benefits of incorporating the RL framework. Our evaluation results demonstrated that the heuristic solution incorporated with our RL framework not only elevated the quality of solutions but also achieved rapid computation speeds, especially when dealing with extensive customer locations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely deployed to solve problems related to marketing attribution and budget optimization. However, AI models can be quite complex, and it can be difficult to understand model workings and insights without extensive implementation teams. In principle, recently developed large language models (LLMs), like GPT-4, can be deployed to provide marketing insights, reducing the time and effort required to make critical decisions. In practice, there are substantial challenges that need to be overcome to reliably use such models. We focus on domain-specific question-answering, SQL generation needed for data retrieval, and tabular analysis and show how a combination of semantic search, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning can be applied to dramatically improve the ability of LLMs to execute these tasks accurately. We compare both proprietary models, like GPT-4, and open-source models, like Llama-2-70b, as well as various embedding methods. These models are tested on sample use cases specific to marketing mix modeling and attribution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Darya Likhareva, Hamsini Sankaran, Sivakumar Thiyagarajan</p>
<p>Abstract: Researchers must stay current in their fields by regularly reviewing academic literature, a task complicated by the daily publication of thousands of papers. Traditional multi-label text classification methods often ignore semantic relationships and fail to address the inherent class imbalances. This paper introduces a novel approach using the SciBERT model and CNNs to systematically categorize academic abstracts from the Elsevier OA CC-BY corpus. We use a multi-segment input strategy that processes abstracts, body text, titles, and keywords obtained via BERT topic modeling through SciBERT. Here, the [CLS] token embeddings capture the contextual representation of each segment, concatenated and processed through a CNN. The CNN uses convolution and pooling to enhance feature extraction and reduce dimensionality, optimizing the data for classification. Additionally, we incorporate class weights based on label frequency to address the class imbalance, significantly improving the classification F1 score and enhancing text classification systems and literature review efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the growth of textual data across online platforms, sentiment analysis has become crucial for extracting insights from user-generated content. While traditional approaches and deep learning models have shown promise, they cannot often capture complex relationships between entities. In this paper, we propose leveraging Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCNs) for sentiment analysis, which offer interpretability and flexibility by capturing dependencies between data points represented as nodes in a graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by using pre-trained language models such as BERT and RoBERTa with RGCN architecture on product reviews from Amazon and Digikala datasets and evaluating the results. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of RGCNs in capturing relational information for sentiment analysis tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehyung Kim, Jaehyun Nam, Sangwoo Mo, Jongjin Park, Sang-Woo Lee, Minjoon Seo, Jung-Woo Ha, Jinwoo Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in various natural language processing tasks, including question answering (QA) tasks. While incorporating new information with the retrieval of relevant passages is a promising way to improve QA with LLMs, the existing methods often require additional fine-tuning which becomes infeasible with recent LLMs. Augmenting retrieved passages via prompting has the potential to address this limitation, but this direction has been limitedly explored. To this end, we design a simple yet effective framework to enhance open-domain QA (ODQA) with LLMs, based on the summarized retrieval (SuRe). SuRe helps LLMs predict more accurate answers for a given question, which are well-supported by the summarized retrieval that could be viewed as an explicit rationale extracted from the retrieved passages. Specifically, SuRe first constructs summaries of the retrieved passages for each of the multiple answer candidates. Then, SuRe confirms the most plausible answer from the candidate set by evaluating the validity and ranking of the generated summaries. Experimental results on diverse ODQA benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SuRe, with improvements of up to 4.6% in exact match (EM) and 4.0% in F1 score over standard prompting approaches. SuRe also can be integrated with a broad range of retrieval methods and LLMs. Finally, the generated summaries from SuRe show additional advantages to measure the importance of retrieved passages and serve as more preferred rationales by models and humans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuechen Zhang, Zijian Huang, Ege Onur Taga, Carlee Joe-Wong, Samet Oymak, Jiasi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent successes in natural language processing have led to the proliferation of large language models (LLMs) by multiple providers. Each LLM offering has different inference accuracy, monetary cost, and latency, and their accuracy further depends on the exact wording of the question (i.e., the specific prompt). At the same time, users often have a limit on monetary budget and latency to answer all their questions, and they do not know which LLMs to choose for each question to meet their accuracy and long-term budget requirements. To navigate this rich design space, we propose TREACLE (Thrifty Reasoning via Context-Aware LLM and Prompt Selection), a reinforcement learning policy that jointly selects the model and prompting scheme while respecting the user's monetary cost and latency constraints. TREACLE uses the problem context, including question text embeddings (reflecting the type or difficulty of a query) and the response history (reflecting the consistency of previous responses) to make smart decisions. Our evaluations on standard reasoning datasets (GSM8K, CSQA, and LLC ) with various LLMs and prompts show that TREACLE enables cost savings of up to 85% compared to baselines while maintaining high accuracy. Importantly, it provides the user with the ability to gracefully trade off accuracy for cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yidong Bai, Toshiharu Sugawara</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning, decentralized execution is a common approach, yet it suffers from the redundant computation problem. This occurs when multiple agents redundantly perform the same or similar computation due to overlapping observations. To address this issue, this study introduces a novel method referred to as locally centralized team transformer (LCTT). LCTT establishes a locally centralized execution framework where selected agents serve as leaders, issuing instructions, while the rest agents, designated as workers, act as these instructions without activating their policy networks. For LCTT, we proposed the team-transformer (T-Trans) architecture that allows leaders to provide specific instructions to each worker, and the leadership shift mechanism that allows agents autonomously decide their roles as leaders or workers. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces redundant computation, does not decrease reward levels, and leads to faster learning convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Man M. Ho, Elham Ghelichkhan, Yosep Chong, Yufei Zhou, Beatrice Knudsen, Tolga Tasdizen</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) can generate high-fidelity images from noise, offering a promising approach for augmenting histopathology images for training cancer grading models. While previous works successfully generated high-fidelity histopathology images using LDMs, the generation of image tiles to improve prostate cancer grading has not yet been explored. Additionally, LDMs face challenges in accurately generating admixtures of multiple cancer grades in a tile when conditioned by a tile mask. In this study, we train specific LDMs to generate synthetic tiles that contain multiple Gleason Grades (GGs) by leveraging pixel-wise annotations in input tiles. We introduce a novel framework named Self-Distillation from Separated Conditions (DISC) that generates GG patterns guided by GG masks. Finally, we deploy a training framework for pixel-level and slide-level prostate cancer grading, where synthetic tiles are effectively utilized to improve the cancer grading performance of existing models. As a result, this work surpasses previous works in two domains: 1) our LDMs enhanced with DISC produce more accurate tiles in terms of GG patterns, and 2) our training scheme, incorporating synthetic data, significantly improves the generalization of the baseline model for prostate cancer grading, particularly in challenging cases of rare GG5, demonstrating the potential of generative models to enhance cancer grading when data is limited.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomohiko Mizutani</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging technology has a wide range of applications, including forest management, mineral resource exploration, and Earth surface monitoring. Endmember extraction of hyperspectral images is a key step in leveraging this technology for applications. It aims to identifying the spectral signatures of materials, i.e., the major components in the observed scenes. Theoretically speaking, Hottopixx methods should be effective on problems involving extracting endmembers from hyperspectral images. Yet, these methods are challenging to perform in practice, due to high computational costs. They require us to solve LP problems, called Hottopixx models, whose size grows quadratically with the number of pixels in the image. It is thus still unclear as to whether they are actually effective or not. This study clarifies this situation. We propose an efficient and effective implementation of Hottopixx. Our implementation follows the framework of column generation, which is known as a classical but powerful means of solving large-scale LPs. We show in experiments that our implementation is applicable to the endmember extraction from real hyperspectral images and can provide estimations of endmember signatures with higher accuracy than the existing methods can.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marius Schmidt-Mengin, Alexis Benichoux, Shibeshih Belachew, Nikos Komodakis, Nikos Paragios</p>
<p>Abstract: Annotating lots of 3D medical images for training segmentation models is time-consuming. The goal of weakly supervised semantic segmentation is to train segmentation models without using any ground truth segmentation masks. Our work addresses the case where only image-level categorical labels, indicating the presence or absence of a particular region of interest (such as tumours or lesions), are available. Most existing methods rely on class activation mapping (CAM). We propose a novel approach, ToNNO, which is based on the Tomographic reconstruction of a Neural Network's Output. Our technique extracts stacks of slices with different angles from the input 3D volume, feeds these slices to a 2D encoder, and applies the inverse Radon transform in order to reconstruct a 3D heatmap of the encoder's predictions. This generic method allows to perform dense prediction tasks on 3D volumes using any 2D image encoder. We apply it to weakly supervised medical image segmentation by training the 2D encoder to output high values for slices containing the regions of interest. We test it on four large scale medical image datasets and outperform 2D CAM methods. We then extend ToNNO by combining tomographic reconstruction with CAM methods, proposing Averaged CAM and Tomographic CAM, which obtain even better results.</p>

Earth System Data Cubes (ESDCs) have been introduced to efficiently handle this influx of high-dimensional data. ESDCs offer a structured, intuitive framework for data analysis, organising information within spatio-temporal grids. The structured nature of ESDCs unlocks significant opportunities for Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. By providing well-organised data, ESDCs are ideally suited for a wide range of sophisticated AI-driven tasks. An automated framework for creating AI-focused ESDCs with minimal user input could significantly accelerate the generation of task-specific training data. Here we introduce cubo, an open-source Python tool designed for easy generation of AI-focused ESDCs. Utilising collections in SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC) that are stored as Cloud Optimised GeoTIFFs (COGs), cubo efficiently creates ESDCs, requiring only central coordinates, spatial resolution, edge size, and time range.</p>

Utilizing the proposed Malicious Discriminative Score within the MIL framework, RT-HMD effectively identifies localized malware behaviors, thereby improving the predictive accuracy. Empirical analysis, using a hardware telemetry dataset collected from a mobile platform across 723 benign and 1033 malware samples, shows a 5% precision boost while maintaining recall, outperforming baselines affected by mislabeled benign segments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianqi Kou</p>
<p>Abstract: Two goals - improving replicability and accountability of Machine Learning research respectively, have accrued much attention from the AI ethics and the Machine Learning community. Despite sharing the measures of improving transparency, the two goals are discussed in different registers - replicability registers with scientific reasoning whereas accountability registers with ethical reasoning. Given the existing challenge of the Responsibility Gap - holding Machine Learning scientists accountable for Machine Learning harms due to them being far from sites of application, this paper posits that reconceptualizing replicability can help bridge the gap. Through a shift from model performance replicability to claim replicability, Machine Learning scientists can be held accountable for producing non-replicable claims that are prone to eliciting harm due to misuse and misinterpretation. In this paper, I make the following contributions. First, I define and distinguish two forms of replicability for ML research that can aid constructive conversations around replicability. Second, I formulate an argument for claim-replicability's advantage over model performance replicability in justifying assigning accountability to Machine Learning scientists for producing non-replicable claims and show how it enacts a sense of responsibility that is actionable. In addition, I characterize the implementation of claim replicability as more of a social project than a technical one by discussing its competing epistemological principles, practical implications on Circulating Reference, Interpretative Labor, and research communication.</p>

The proposed method represents the first application of deep learning in text-in-image watermarking that improves adaptivity, allowing the model to intelligently adjust to specific image characteristics and emerging threats. Through testing and evaluation, our method has demonstrated superior robustness compared to traditional watermarking techniques, achieving enhanced imperceptibility that ensures the watermark remains undetectable across various image contents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel May, Matthew Taylor, Petr Musilek</p>
<p>Abstract: As the energy landscape evolves toward sustainability, the accelerating integration of distributed energy resources poses challenges to the operability and reliability of the electricity grid. One significant aspect of this issue is the notable increase in net load variability at the grid edge. Transactive energy, implemented through local energy markets, has recently garnered attention as a promising solution to address the grid challenges in the form of decentralized, indirect demand response on a community level. Given the nature of these challenges, model-free control approaches, such as deep reinforcement learning, show promise for the decentralized automation of participation within this context. Existing studies at the intersection of transactive energy and model-free control primarily focus on socioeconomic and self-consumption metrics, overlooking the crucial goal of reducing community-level net load variability. This study addresses this gap by training a set of deep reinforcement learning agents to automate end-user participation in ALEX, an economy-driven local energy market. In this setting, agents do not share information and only prioritize individual bill optimization. The study unveils a clear correlation between bill reduction and reduced net load variability in this setup. The impact on net load variability is assessed over various time horizons using metrics such as ramping rate, daily and monthly load factor, as well as daily average and total peak export and import on an open-source dataset. Agents are then benchmarked against several baselines, with their performance levels showing promising results, approaching those of a near-optimal dynamic programming benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: Model evaluation is of crucial importance in modern statistics application. The construction of ROC and calculation of AUC have been widely used for binary classification evaluation. Recent research generalizing the ROC/AUC analysis to multi-class classification has problems in at least one of the four areas: 1. failure to provide sensible plots 2. being sensitive to imbalanced data 3. unable to specify mis-classification cost and 4. unable to provide evaluation uncertainty quantification. Borrowing from a binomial matrix factorization model, we provide an evaluation metric summarizing the pair-wise multi-class True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) with one-dimensional vector representation. Visualization on the representation vector measures the relative speed of increment between TPR and FPR across all the classes pairs, which in turns provides a ROC plot for the multi-class counterpart. An integration over those factorized vector provides a binary AUC-equivalent summary on the classifier performance. Mis-clasification weights specification and bootstrapped confidence interval are also enabled to accommodate a variety of of evaluation criteria. To support our findings, we conducted extensive simulation studies and compared our method to the pair-wise averaged AUC statistics on benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional search algorithms have issues when applied to games of imperfect information where the number of possible underlying states and trajectories are very large. This challenge is particularly evident in trick-taking card games. While state sampling techniques such as Perfect Information Monte Carlo (PIMC) search has shown success in these contexts, they still have major limitations.
  We present Generative Observation Monte Carlo Tree Search (GO-MCTS), which utilizes MCTS on observation sequences generated by a game specific model. This method performs the search within the observation space and advances the search using a model that depends solely on the agent's observations. Additionally, we demonstrate that transformers are well-suited as the generative model in this context, and we demonstrate a process for iteratively training the transformer via population-based self-play.
  The efficacy of GO-MCTS is demonstrated in various games of imperfect information, such as Hearts, Skat, and "The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine," with promising results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a key technology for earth observation, surveillance, medical imaging and diagnostics, astronomy and space exploration. The conventional technology for HSI in remote sensing applications is based on the push-broom scanning approach in which the camera records the spectral image of a stripe of the scene at a time, while the image is generated by the aggregation of measurements through time. In real-world airborne and spaceborne HSI instruments, some empty stripes would appear at certain locations, because platforms do not always maintain a constant programmed attitude, or have access to accurate digital elevation maps (DEM), and the travelling track is not necessarily aligned with the hyperspectral cameras at all times. This makes the enhancement of the acquired HS images from incomplete or corrupted observations an essential task. We introduce a novel HSI inpainting algorithm here, called Hyperspectral Equivariant Imaging (Hyper-EI). Hyper-EI is a self-supervised learning-based method which does not require training on extensive datasets or access to a pre-trained model. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art inpainting performance compared to the existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) introduce new security risks, but there are few comprehensive evaluation suites to measure and reduce these risks. We present BenchmarkName, a novel benchmark to quantify LLM security risks and capabilities. We introduce two new areas for testing: prompt injection and code interpreter abuse. We evaluated multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs, including GPT-4, Mistral, Meta Llama 3 70B-Instruct, and Code Llama. Our results show that conditioning away risk of attack remains an unsolved problem; for example, all tested models showed between 26% and 41% successful prompt injection tests. We further introduce the safety-utility tradeoff: conditioning an LLM to reject unsafe prompts can cause the LLM to falsely reject answering benign prompts, which lowers utility. We propose quantifying this tradeoff using False Refusal Rate (FRR). As an illustration, we introduce a novel test set to quantify FRR for cyberattack helpfulness risk. We find many LLMs able to successfully comply with "borderline" benign requests while still rejecting most unsafe requests. Finally, we quantify the utility of LLMs for automating a core cybersecurity task, that of exploiting software vulnerabilities. This is important because the offensive capabilities of LLMs are of intense interest; we quantify this by creating novel test sets for four representative problems. We find that models with coding capabilities perform better than those without, but that further work is needed for LLMs to become proficient at exploit generation. Our code is open source and can be used to evaluate other LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jose Ignacio Hernandez, Niek Mouter, Sander van Cranenburgh</p>
<p>Abstract: Random utility maximisation (RUM) models are one of the cornerstones of discrete choice modelling. However, specifying the utility function of RUM models is not straightforward and has a considerable impact on the resulting interpretable outcomes and welfare measures. In this paper, we propose a new discrete choice model based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) named "Alternative-Specific and Shared weights Neural Network (ASS-NN)", which provides a further balance between flexible utility approximation from the data and consistency with two assumptions: RUM theory and fungibility of money (i.e., "one euro is one euro"). Therefore, the ASS-NN can derive economically-consistent outcomes, such as marginal utilities or willingness to pay, without explicitly specifying the utility functional form. Using a Monte Carlo experiment and empirical data from the Swissmetro dataset, we show that ASS-NN outperforms (in terms of goodness of fit) conventional multinomial logit (MNL) models under different utility specifications. Furthermore, we show how the ASS-NN is used to derive marginal utilities and willingness to pay measures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Answering real-world user queries, such as product search, often requires accurate retrieval of information from semi-structured knowledge bases or databases that involve blend of unstructured (e.g., textual descriptions of products) and structured (e.g., entity relations of products) information. However, previous works have mostly studied textual and relational retrieval tasks as separate topics. To address the gap, we develop STARK, a large-scale Semi-structure retrieval benchmark on Textual and Relational Knowledge Bases. We design a novel pipeline to synthesize natural and realistic user queries that integrate diverse relational information and complex textual properties, as well as their ground-truth answers. Moreover, we rigorously conduct human evaluation to validate the quality of our benchmark, which covers a variety of practical applications, including product recommendations, academic paper searches, and precision medicine inquiries. Our benchmark serves as a comprehensive testbed for evaluating the performance of retrieval systems, with an emphasis on retrieval approaches driven by large language models (LLMs). Our experiments suggest that the STARK datasets present significant challenges to the current retrieval and LLM systems, indicating the demand for building more capable retrieval systems that can handle both textual and relational aspects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Wallace, Kai Xiao, Reimar Leike, Lilian Weng, Johannes Heidecke, Alex Beutel</p>
<p>Abstract: Today's LLMs are susceptible to prompt injections, jailbreaks, and other attacks that allow adversaries to overwrite a model's original instructions with their own malicious prompts. In this work, we argue that one of the primary vulnerabilities underlying these attacks is that LLMs often consider system prompts (e.g., text from an application developer) to be the same priority as text from untrusted users and third parties. To address this, we propose an instruction hierarchy that explicitly defines how models should behave when instructions of different priorities conflict. We then propose a data generation method to demonstrate this hierarchical instruction following behavior, which teaches LLMs to selectively ignore lower-privileged instructions. We apply this method to GPT-3.5, showing that it drastically increases robustness -- even for attack types not seen during training -- while imposing minimal degradations on standard capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingxiao Yuan, Emma Lejeune, Harold S. Park</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been significant recent interest in the mechanics community to design structures that can either violate reciprocity, or exhibit elastic asymmetry or odd elasticity. While these properties are highly desirable to enable mechanical metamaterials to exhibit novel wave propagation phenomena, it remains an open question as to how to design passive structures that exhibit both significant non-reciprocity and elastic asymmetry. In this paper, we first define several design spaces for chiral metamaterials leveraging specific design parameters, including the ligament contact angles, the ligament shape, and circle radius. Having defined the design spaces, we then leverage machine learning approaches, and specifically Bayesian optimization, to determine optimally performing designs within each design space satisfying maximal non-reciprocity or stiffness asymmetry. Finally, we perform multi-objective optimization by determining the Pareto optimum and find chiral metamaterials that simultaneously exhibit high non-reciprocity and stiffness asymmetry. Our analysis of the underlying mechanisms reveals that chiral metamaterials that can display multiple different contact states under loading in different directions are able to simultaneously exhibit both high non-reciprocity and stiffness asymmetry. Overall, this work demonstrates the effectiveness of employing ML to bring insights to a novel domain with limited prior information, and more generally will pave the way for metamaterials with unique properties and functionality in directing and guiding mechanical wave energy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shyam Varahagiri, Aryaman Sinha, Shiv Ram Dubey, Satish Kumar Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown promising classification performance over Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due to their self-attention mechanism. Many researchers have incorporated ViTs for Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification. HSIs are characterised by narrow contiguous spectral bands, providing rich spectral data. Although ViTs excel with sequential data, they cannot extract spectral-spatial information like CNNs. Furthermore, to have high classification performance, there should be a strong interaction between the HSI token and the class (CLS) token. To solve these issues, we propose a 3D-Convolution guided Spectral-Spatial Transformer (3D-ConvSST) for HSI classification that utilizes a 3D-Convolution Guided Residual Module (CGRM) in-between encoders to "fuse" the local spatial and spectral information and to enhance the feature propagation. Furthermore, we forego the class token and instead apply Global Average Pooling, which effectively encodes more discriminative and pertinent high-level features for classification. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three public HSI datasets to show the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art traditional, convolutional, and Transformer models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guohao Wang, Ting Liu, Hongqiang Lyu, Ze Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: As a prevalent and dynamically regulated epigenetic modification, 5-formylcytidine (f5C) is crucial in various biological processes. However, traditional experimental methods for f5C detection are often laborious and time-consuming, limiting their ability to map f5C sites across the transcriptome comprehensively. While computational approaches offer a cost-effective and high-throughput alternative, no recognition model for f5C has been developed to date. Drawing inspiration from language models in natural language processing, this study presents f5C-finder, an ensemble neural network-based model utilizing multi-head attention for the identification of f5C. Five distinct feature extraction methods were employed to construct five individual artificial neural networks, and these networks were subsequently integrated through ensemble learning to create f5C-finder. 10-fold cross-validation and independent tests demonstrate that f5C-finder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with AUC of 0.807 and 0.827, respectively. The result highlights the effectiveness of biological language model in capturing both the order (sequential) and functional meaning (semantics) within genomes. Furthermore, the built-in interpretability allows us to understand what the model is learning, creating a bridge between identifying key sequential elements and a deeper exploration of their biological functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takaya Kawakatsu</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting table contents from documents such as scientific papers and financial reports and converting them into a format that can be processed by large language models is an important task in knowledge information processing. End-to-end approaches, which recognize not only table structure but also cell contents, achieved performance comparable to state-of-the-art models using external character recognition systems, and have potential for further improvements. In addition, these models can now recognize long tables with hundreds of cells by introducing local attention. However, the models recognize table structure in one direction from the header to the footer, and cell content recognition is performed independently for each cell, so there is no opportunity to retrieve useful information from the neighbor cells. In this paper, we propose a multi-cell content decoder and bidirectional mutual learning mechanism to improve the end-to-end approach. The effectiveness is demonstrated on two large datasets, and the experimental results show comparable performance to state-of-the-art models, even for long tables with large numbers of cells.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advancements in deep learning are revolutionizing the classification of remote-sensing images. Transformer-based architectures, utilizing self-attention mechanisms, have emerged as alternatives to conventional convolution methods, enabling the capture of long-range dependencies along with global relationships in the image. Motivated by these advancements, this paper presents StrideNET, a novel dual-branch architecture designed for terrain recognition and implicit properties estimation. The terrain recognition branch utilizes the Swin Transformer, leveraging its hierarchical representation and low computational cost to efficiently capture both local and global features. The terrain properties branch focuses on the extraction of surface properties such as roughness and slipperiness using a statistical texture analysis method. By computing surface terrain properties, an enhanced environmental perception can be obtained. The StrideNET model is trained on a dataset comprising four target terrain classes: Grassy, Marshy, Sandy, and Rocky. StrideNET attains competitive performance compared to contemporary methods. The implications of this work extend to various applications, including environmental monitoring, land use and land cover (LULC) classification, disaster response, precision agriculture, and much more.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junpu Wang, Guili Xu, Chunlei Li, Guangshuai Gao, Yuehua Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection using only normal samples is of great significance for quality inspection in industrial manufacturing. Although existing reconstruction-based methods have achieved promising results, they still face two problems: poor distinguishable information in image reconstruction and well abnormal regeneration caused by model over-generalization ability. To overcome the above issues, we convert the image reconstruction into a combination of parallel feature restorations and propose a multi-feature reconstruction network, MFRNet, using crossed-mask restoration in this paper. Specifically, a multi-scale feature aggregator is first developed to generate more discriminative hierarchical representations of the input images from a pre-trained model. Subsequently, a crossed-mask generator is adopted to randomly cover the extracted feature map, followed by a restoration network based on the transformer structure for high-quality repair of the missing regions. Finally, a hybrid loss is equipped to guide model training and anomaly estimation, which gives consideration to both the pixel and structural similarity. Extensive experiments show that our method is highly competitive with or significantly outperforms other state-of-the-arts on four public available datasets and one self-made dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis of current diffusion models. We introduce a novel generative learning methodology utilizing the Schr{\"o}dinger bridge diffusion model in latent space as the framework for theoretical exploration in this domain. Our approach commences with the pre-training of an encoder-decoder architecture using data originating from a distribution that may diverge from the target distribution, thus facilitating the accommodation of a large sample size through the utilization of pre-existing large-scale models. Subsequently, we develop a diffusion model within the latent space utilizing the Schr{\"o}dinger bridge framework. Our theoretical analysis encompasses the establishment of end-to-end error analysis for learning distributions via the latent Schr{\"o}dinger bridge diffusion model. Specifically, we control the second-order Wasserstein distance between the generated distribution and the target distribution. Furthermore, our obtained convergence rates effectively mitigate the curse of dimensionality, offering robust theoretical support for prevailing diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yidan Liu, Weiying Xie, Kai Jiang, Jiaqing Zhang, Yunsong Li, Leyuan Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: The majority of existing hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) methods use the low-rank representation (LRR) model to separate the background and anomaly components, where the anomaly component is optimized by handcrafted sparse priors (e.g., $\ell_{2,1}$-norm). However, this may not be ideal since they overlook the spatial structure present in anomalies and make the detection result largely dependent on manually set sparsity. To tackle these problems, we redefine the optimization criterion for the anomaly component in the LRR model with a self-supervised network called self-supervised anomaly prior (SAP). This prior is obtained by the pretext task of self-supervised learning, which is customized to learn the characteristics of hyperspectral anomalies. Specifically, this pretext task is a classification task to distinguish the original hyperspectral image (HSI) and the pseudo-anomaly HSI, where the pseudo-anomaly is generated from the original HSI and designed as a prism with arbitrary polygon bases and arbitrary spectral bands. In addition, a dual-purified strategy is proposed to provide a more refined background representation with an enriched background dictionary, facilitating the separation of anomalies from complex backgrounds. Extensive experiments on various hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed SAP offers a more accurate and interpretable solution than other advanced HAD methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Amidst the robust impetus from artificial intelligence (AI) and big data, edge intelligence (EI) has emerged as a nascent computing paradigm, synthesizing AI with edge computing (EC) to become an exemplary solution for unleashing the full potential of AI services. Nonetheless, challenges in communication costs, resource allocation, privacy, and security continue to constrain its proficiency in supporting services with diverse requirements. In response to these issues, this paper introduces socialized learning (SL) as a promising solution, further propelling the advancement of EI. SL is a learning paradigm predicated on social principles and behaviors, aimed at amplifying the collaborative capacity and collective intelligence of agents within the EI system. SL not only enhances the system's adaptability but also optimizes communication, and networking processes, essential for distributed intelligence across diverse devices and platforms. Therefore, a combination of SL and EI may greatly facilitate the development of collaborative intelligence in the future network. This paper presents the findings of a literature review on the integration of EI and SL, summarizing the latest achievements in existing research on EI and SL. Subsequently, we delve comprehensively into the limitations of EI and how it could benefit from SL. Special emphasis is placed on the communication challenges and networking strategies and other aspects within these systems, underlining the role of optimized network solutions in improving system efficacy. Based on these discussions, we elaborate in detail on three integrated components: socialized architecture, socialized training, and socialized inference, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we identify some possible future applications of combining SL and EI, discuss open problems and suggest some future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yebo Wu, Li Li, Chunlin Tian, Chengzhong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents ProFL, a novel progressive FL framework to effectively break the memory wall. Specifically, ProFL divides the model into different blocks based on its original architecture. Instead of updating the full model in each training round, ProFL first trains the front blocks and safely freezes them after convergence. Training of the next block is then triggered. This process iterates until the training of the whole model is completed. In this way, the memory footprint is effectively reduced for feasible deployment on heterogeneous devices. In order to preserve the feature representation of each block, we decouple the whole training process into two stages: progressive model shrinking and progressive model growing. During the progressive model shrinking stage, we meticulously design corresponding output modules to assist each block in learning the expected feature representation and obtain the initialization parameters. Then, the obtained output modules are utilized in the corresponding progressive model growing stage. Additionally, to control the training pace for each block, a novel metric from the scalar perspective is proposed to assess the learning status of each block and determines when to trigger the training of the next one. Finally, we theoretically prove the convergence of ProFL and conduct extensive experiments on representative models and datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of ProFL. The results demonstrate that ProFL effectively reduces the peak memory footprint by up to 57.4% and improves model accuracy by up to 82.4%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuael Adnew, Paul Pu Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) can play a crucial role in enhancing the accessibility of spoken languages worldwide. In this paper, we build a set of ASR tools for Amharic, a language spoken by more than 50 million people primarily in eastern Africa. Amharic is written in the Ge'ez script, a sequence of graphemes with spacings denoting word boundaries. This makes computational processing of Amharic challenging since the location of spacings can significantly impact the meaning of formed sentences. We find that existing benchmarks for Amharic ASR do not account for these spacings and only measure individual grapheme error rates, leading to significantly inflated measurements of in-the-wild performance. In this paper, we first release corrected transcriptions of existing Amharic ASR test datasets, enabling the community to accurately evaluate progress. Furthermore, we introduce a post-processing approach using a transformer encoder-decoder architecture to organize raw ASR outputs into a grammatically complete and semantically meaningful Amharic sentence. Through experiments on the corrected test dataset, our model enhances the semantic correctness of Amharic speech recognition systems, achieving a Character Error Rate (CER) of 5.5\% and a Word Error Rate (WER) of 23.3\%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Question-answering systems have revolutionized information retrieval, but linguistic and cultural boundaries limit their widespread accessibility. This research endeavors to bridge the gap of the absence of efficient QnA datasets in low-resource languages by translating the English Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) using a robust data curation approach. We introduce MahaSQuAD, the first-ever full SQuAD dataset for the Indic language Marathi, consisting of 118,516 training, 11,873 validation, and 11,803 test samples. We also present a gold test set of manually verified 500 examples. Challenges in maintaining context and handling linguistic nuances are addressed, ensuring accurate translations. Moreover, as a QnA dataset cannot be simply converted into any low-resource language using translation, we need a robust method to map the answer translation to its span in the translated passage. Hence, to address this challenge, we also present a generic approach for translating SQuAD into any low-resource language. Thus, we offer a scalable approach to bridge linguistic and cultural gaps present in low-resource languages, in the realm of question-answering systems.

<p>Abstract: Machine learning-based fundus image diagnosis technologies trigger worldwide interest owing to their benefits such as reducing medical resource power and providing objective evaluation results. However, current methods are commonly based on supervised methods, bringing in a heavy workload to biomedical staff and hence suffering in expanding effective databases. To address this issue, in this article, we established a label-free method, name 'SSVT',which can automatically analyze un-labeled fundus images and generate high evaluation accuracy of 97.0% of four main eye diseases based on six public datasets and two datasets collected by Beijing Tongren Hospital. The promising results showcased the effectiveness of the proposed unsupervised learning method, and the strong application potential in biomedical resource shortage regions to improve global eye health.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fundus diseases are major causes of visual impairment and blindness worldwide, especially in underdeveloped regions, where the shortage of ophthalmologists hinders timely diagnosis. AI-assisted fundus image analysis has several advantages, such as high accuracy, reduced workload, and improved accessibility, but it requires a large amount of expert-annotated data to build reliable models. To address this dilemma, we propose a general self-supervised machine learning framework that can handle diverse fundus diseases from unlabeled fundus images. Our method's AUC surpasses existing supervised approaches by 15.7%, and even exceeds performance of a single human expert. Furthermore, our model adapts well to various datasets from different regions, races, and heterogeneous image sources or qualities from multiple cameras or devices. Our method offers a label-free general framework to diagnose fundus diseases, which could potentially benefit telehealth programs for early screening of people at risk of vision loss.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianyu Xu, Qiuzhuang Sun, Yang Yang, Huadong Mo, Daoyi Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: The 2019-20 Australia bushfire incurred numerous economic losses and significantly affected the operations of power systems. A power station or transmission line can be significantly affected due to bushfires, leading to an increase in operational costs. We study a fundamental but challenging problem of planning the optimal power flow (OPF) for power systems subject to bushfires. Considering the stochastic nature of bushfire spread, we develop a model to capture such dynamics based on Moore's neighborhood model. Under a periodic inspection scheme that reveals the in-situ bushfire status, we propose an online optimization modeling framework that sequentially plans the power flows in the electricity network. Our framework assumes that the spread of bushfires is non-stationary over time, and the spread and containment probabilities are unknown. To meet these challenges, we develop a contextual online learning algorithm that treats the in-situ geographical information of the bushfire as a 'spatial context'. The online learning algorithm learns the unknown probabilities sequentially based on the observed data and then makes the OPF decision accordingly. The sequential OPF decisions aim to minimize the regret function, which is defined as the cumulative loss against the clairvoyant strategy that knows the true model parameters. We provide a theoretical guarantee of our algorithm by deriving a bound on the regret function, which outperforms the regret bound achieved by other benchmark algorithms. Our model assumptions are verified by the real bushfire data from NSW, Australia, and we apply our model to two power systems to illustrate its applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sota Nishiyama, Masayuki Ohzeki</p>
<p>Abstract: The storage capacity of a binary classification model is the maximum number of random input-output pairs per parameter that the model can learn. It is one of the indicators of the expressive power of machine learning models and is important for comparing the performance of various models. In this study, we analyze the structure of the solution space and the storage capacity of fully connected two-layer neural networks with general activation functions using the replica method from statistical physics. Our results demonstrate that the storage capacity per parameter remains finite even with infinite width and that the weights of the network exhibit negative correlations, leading to a 'division of labor'. In addition, we find that increasing the dataset size triggers a phase transition at a certain transition point where the permutation symmetry of weights is broken, resulting in the solution space splitting into disjoint regions. We identify the dependence of this transition point and the storage capacity on the choice of activation function. These findings contribute to understanding the influence of activation functions and the number of parameters on the structure of the solution space, potentially offering insights for selecting appropriate architectures based on specific objectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenru Duan, Guan-Horng Liu, Yuanqi Du, Tianrong Chen, Qiyuan Zhao, Haojun Jia, Carla P. Gomes, Evangelos A. Theodorou, Heather J. Kulik</p>
<p>Abstract: Transition states (TSs) are transient structures that are key in understanding reaction mechanisms and designing catalysts but challenging to be captured in experiments. Alternatively, many optimization algorithms have been developed to search for TSs computationally. Yet the cost of these algorithms driven by quantum chemistry methods (usually density functional theory) is still high, posing challenges for their applications in building large reaction networks for reaction exploration. Here we developed React-OT, an optimal transport approach for generating unique TS structures from reactants and products. React-OT generates highly accurate TS structures with a median structural root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.053{\AA} and median barrier height error of 1.06 kcal/mol requiring only 0.4 second per reaction. The RMSD and barrier height error is further improved by roughly 25% through pretraining React-OT on a large reaction dataset obtained with a lower level of theory, GFN2-xTB. We envision the great accuracy and fast inference of React-OT useful in targeting TSs when exploring chemical reactions with unknown mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajian Luo, Jaeho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid emergence of System-on-Chip (SoC) technology introduces multiple dynamic hotspots with spatial and temporal evolution to the system, necessitating a more efficient, sophisticated, and intelligent approach to achieve on-demand thermal management. In this study, we present a novel machine learning-assisted optimization algorithm for thermoelectric coolers (TECs) that can achieve global optimal temperature by individually controlling TEC units based on real-time multi-hotspot conditions across the entire domain. A convolutional neural network (CNN) with inception module is trained to comprehend the coupled thermal-electrical physics underlying the system and attain accurate temperature predictions with and without TECs. Due to the intricate interaction among passive thermal gradient, Peltier effect and Joule effect, a local optimal TEC control experiences spatial temperature trade-off which may not lead to a global optimal solution. To address this issue, a backtracking-based optimization algorithm is developed using the designed machine learning model to iterate all possible TEC assignments for attaining global optimal solutions. For arbitrary m by n matrix with NHS hotspots (n, m less than 10 and NHS less than 20), our algorithm is capable of providing global optimal temperature and its corresponding TEC array control in an average of 1.07 second while iterating through tens of temperature predictions behind-the-scenes. This represents a speed increase of over four orders of magnitude compared to traditional FEM strategies which take approximately 18 minutes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy Speth, Nathan Vance, Patrick Flynn, Adam Czajka</p>
<p>Abstract: Subtle periodic signals, such as blood volume pulse and respiration, can be extracted from RGB video, enabling noncontact health monitoring at low cost. Advancements in remote pulse estimation -- or remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) -- are currently driven by deep learning solutions. However, modern approaches are trained and evaluated on benchmark datasets with ground truth from contact-PPG sensors. We present the first non-contrastive unsupervised learning framework for signal regression to mitigate the need for labelled video data. With minimal assumptions of periodicity and finite bandwidth, our approach discovers the blood volume pulse directly from unlabelled videos. We find that encouraging sparse power spectra within normal physiological bandlimits and variance over batches of power spectra is sufficient for learning visual features of periodic signals. We perform the first experiments utilizing unlabelled video data not specifically created for rPPG to train robust pulse rate estimators. Given the limited inductive biases, we successfully applied the same approach to camera-based respiration by changing the bandlimits of the target signal. This shows that the approach is general enough for unsupervised learning of bandlimited quasi-periodic signals from different domains. Furthermore, we show that the framework is effective for finetuning models on unlabelled video from a single subject, allowing for personalized and adaptive signal regressors.</p>

<p>Abstract: The vast majority of the popular English named entity recognition (NER) datasets contain American or British English data, despite the existence of many global varieties of English. As such, it is unclear whether they generalize for analyzing use of English globally. To test this, we build a newswire dataset, the Worldwide English NER Dataset, to analyze NER model performance on low-resource English variants from around the world. We test widely used NER toolkits and transformer models, including models using the pre-trained contextual models RoBERTa and ELECTRA, on three datasets: a commonly used British English newswire dataset, CoNLL 2003, a more American focused dataset OntoNotes, and our global dataset. All models trained on the CoNLL or OntoNotes datasets experienced significant performance drops-over 10 F1 in some cases-when tested on the Worldwide English dataset. Upon examination of region-specific errors, we observe the greatest performance drops for Oceania and Africa, while Asia and the Middle East had comparatively strong performance. Lastly, we find that a combined model trained on the Worldwide dataset and either CoNLL or OntoNotes lost only 1-2 F1 on both test sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyao Shi, Jianing Qian, Yecheng Jason Ma, Dinesh Jayaraman</p>
<p>Abstract: There have recently been large advances both in pre-training visual representations for robotic control and segmenting unknown category objects in general images. To leverage these for improved robot learning, we propose $\textbf{POCR}$, a new framework for building pre-trained object-centric representations for robotic control. Building on theories of "what-where" representations in psychology and computer vision, we use segmentations from a pre-trained model to stably locate across timesteps, various entities in the scene, capturing "where" information. To each such segmented entity, we apply other pre-trained models that build vector descriptions suitable for robotic control tasks, thus capturing "what" the entity is. Thus, our pre-trained object-centric representations for control are constructed by appropriately combining the outputs of off-the-shelf pre-trained models, with no new training. On various simulated and real robotic tasks, we show that imitation policies for robotic manipulators trained on POCR achieve better performance and systematic generalization than state of the art pre-trained representations for robotics, as well as prior object-centric representations that are typically trained from scratch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhepeng Wang, Yi Sheng, Nirajan Koirala, Kanad Basu, Taeho Jung, Cheng-Chang Lu, Weiwen Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Benefiting from cloud computing, today's early-stage quantum computers can be remotely accessed via the cloud services, known as Quantum-as-a-Service (QaaS). However, it poses a high risk of data leakage in quantum machine learning (QML). To run a QML model with QaaS, users need to locally compile their quantum circuits including the subcircuit of data encoding first and then send the compiled circuit to the QaaS provider for execution. If the QaaS provider is untrustworthy, the subcircuit to encode the raw data can be easily stolen. Therefore, we propose a co-design framework for preserving the data security of QML with the QaaS paradigm, namely PristiQ. By introducing an encryption subcircuit with extra secure qubits associated with a user-defined security key, the security of data can be greatly enhanced. And an automatic search algorithm is proposed to optimize the model to maintain its performance on the encrypted quantum data. Experimental results on simulation and the actual IBM quantum computer both prove the ability of PristiQ to provide high security for the quantum data while maintaining the model performance in QML.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Eisner, Yi Yang, Todor Davchev, Mel Vecerik, Jonathan Scholz, David Held</p>
<p>Abstract: Many robot manipulation tasks can be framed as geometric reasoning tasks, where an agent must be able to precisely manipulate an object into a position that satisfies the task from a set of initial conditions. Often, task success is defined based on the relationship between two objects - for instance, hanging a mug on a rack. In such cases, the solution should be equivariant to the initial position of the objects as well as the agent, and invariant to the pose of the camera. This poses a challenge for learning systems which attempt to solve this task by learning directly from high-dimensional demonstrations: the agent must learn to be both equivariant as well as precise, which can be challenging without any inductive biases about the problem. In this work, we propose a method for precise relative pose prediction which is provably SE(3)-equivariant, can be learned from only a few demonstrations, and can generalize across variations in a class of objects. We accomplish this by factoring the problem into learning an SE(3) invariant task-specific representation of the scene and then interpreting this representation with novel geometric reasoning layers which are provably SE(3) equivariant. We demonstrate that our method can yield substantially more precise placement predictions in simulated placement tasks than previous methods trained with the same amount of data, and can accurately represent relative placement relationships data collected from real-world demonstrations.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in fast sampling methods for diffusion models have demonstrated significant potential to accelerate generation on image modalities. We apply these methods to 3-dimensional molecular conformations by building on the recently introduced GeoLDM equivariant latent diffusion model (Xu et al., 2023). We evaluate trade-offs between speed gains and quality loss, as measured by molecular conformation structural stability. We introduce Equivariant Latent Progressive Distillation, a fast sampling algorithm that preserves geometric equivariance and accelerates generation from latent diffusion models. Our experiments demonstrate up to 7.5x gains in sampling speed with limited degradation in molecular stability. These results suggest this accelerated sampling method has strong potential for high-throughput in silico molecular conformations screening in computational biochemistry, drug discovery, and life sciences applications.</p>

They do not encapsulate both semantic and visuo-spatial relationships among elements. To seize machine learning's potential for GUIs more efficiently, Graph4GUI exploits graph neural networks to capture individual elements' properties and their semantic-visuo-spatial constraints in a layout. The learned representation demonstrated its effectiveness in multiple tasks, especially generating designs in a challenging GUI autocompletion task, which involved predicting the positions of remaining unplaced elements in a partially completed GUI. The new model's suggestions showed alignment and visual appeal superior to the baseline method and received higher subjective ratings for preference. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical benefits and efficiency advantages designers perceive when utilizing our model as an autocompletion plug-in.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ningsheng Zhao, Jia Yuan Yu, Krzysztof Dzieciolowski, Trang Bui</p>
<p>Abstract: Shapley value attribution is an increasingly popular explainable AI (XAI) method, which quantifies the contribution of each feature to the model's output. However, recent work has shown that most existing methods to implement Shapley value attributions have some drawbacks. Due to these drawbacks, the resulting Shapley value attributions may provide biased or unreliable explanations, which fail to correctly capture the true intrinsic relationships between features and model outputs. Moreover, it is difficult to evaluate these explanation errors because the true underlying dependencies between features and model outputs are typically unknown. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the explanation errors of Shapley value attributions by decomposing the explanation error into two components: observation bias and structural bias. We also clarify the underlying causes of these two biases and demonstrate that there is a trade-off between them. Based on this error analysis framework, we develop two novel concepts: over-informative and under-informative explanations. We theoretically analyze the potential over-informativeness and under-informativeness of existing Shapley value attribution methods. Particularly for the widely deployed assumption-based Shapley value attributions, we affirm that they can easily be under-informative due to the distribution drift caused by distributional assumptions. We also propose a measurement tool to quantify the distribution drift that causes such errors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video-based Question Answering (Video QA) is a challenging task and becomes even more intricate when addressing Socially Intelligent Question Answering (SIQA). SIQA requires context understanding, temporal reasoning, and the integration of multimodal information, but in addition, it requires processing nuanced human behavior. Furthermore, the complexities involved are exacerbated by the dominance of the primary modality (text) over the others. Thus, there is a need to help the task's secondary modalities to work in tandem with the primary modality. In this work, we introduce a cross-modal alignment and subsequent representation fusion approach that achieves state-of-the-art results (82.06\% accuracy) on the Social IQ 2.0 dataset for SIQA. Our approach exhibits an improved ability to leverage the video modality by using the audio modality as a bridge with the language modality. This leads to enhanced performance by reducing the prevalent issue of language overfitting and resultant video modality bypassing encountered by current existing techniques.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Wang, Ryan P. Kelly, David J. Warne, Christopher Drovandi</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulation based inference (SBI) methods enable the estimation of posterior distributions when the likelihood function is intractable, but where model simulation is feasible. Popular neural approaches to SBI are the neural posterior estimator (NPE) and its sequential version (SNPE). These methods can outperform statistical SBI approaches such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), particularly for relatively small numbers of model simulations. However, we show in this paper that the NPE methods are not guaranteed to be highly accurate, even on problems with low dimension. In such settings the posterior cannot be accurately trained over the prior predictive space, and even the sequential extension remains sub-optimal. To overcome this, we propose preconditioned NPE (PNPE) and its sequential version (PSNPE), which uses a short run of ABC to effectively eliminate regions of parameter space that produce large discrepancy between simulations and data and allow the posterior emulator to be more accurately trained. We present comprehensive empirical evidence that this melding of neural and statistical SBI methods improves performance over a range of examples, including a motivating example involving a complex agent-based model applied to real tumour growth data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songlin Dong, Yingjie Chen, Yuhang He, Yuhan Jin, Alex C. Kot, Yihong Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Online task-free continual learning (OTFCL) is a more challenging variant of continual learning which emphasizes the gradual shift of task boundaries and learns in an online mode. Existing methods rely on a memory buffer composed of old samples to prevent forgetting. However,the use of memory buffers not only raises privacy concerns but also hinders the efficient learning of new samples. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework called I2CANSAY that gets rid of the dependence on memory buffers and efficiently learns the knowledge of new data from one-shot samples. Concretely, our framework comprises two main modules. Firstly, the Inter-Class Analogical Augmentation (ICAN) module generates diverse pseudo-features for old classes based on the inter-class analogy of feature distributions for different new classes, serving as a substitute for the memory buffer. Secondly, the Intra-Class Significance Analysis (ISAY) module analyzes the significance of attributes for each class via its distribution standard deviation, and generates the importance vector as a correction bias for the linear classifier, thereby enhancing the capability of learning from new samples. We run our experiments on four popular image classification datasets: CoRe50, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CUB-200, our approach outperforms the prior state-of-the-art by a large margin.</p>

<p>Abstract: Arbitrary style transfer holds widespread attention in research and boasts numerous practical applications. The existing methods, which either employ cross-attention to incorporate deep style attributes into content attributes or use adaptive normalization to adjust content features, fail to generate high-quality stylized images. In this paper, we introduce an innovative technique to improve the quality of stylized images. Firstly, we propose Style Consistency Instance Normalization (SCIN), a method to refine the alignment between content and style features. In addition, we have developed an Instance-based Contrastive Learning (ICL) approach designed to understand the relationships among various styles, thereby enhancing the quality of the resulting stylized images. Recognizing that VGG networks are more adept at extracting classification features and need to be better suited for capturing style features, we have also introduced the Perception Encoder (PE) to capture style features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method generates high-quality stylized images and effectively prevents artifacts compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Jiang, Jiarui Zhang, Kexuan Sun, Zhivar Sourati, Kian Ahrabian, Kaixin Ma, Filip Ilievski, Jay Pujara</p>
<p>Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown significant progress on many popular visual reasoning benchmarks, whether they possess abstract visual reasoning abilities remains an open question. Similar to the Sudoku puzzles, abstract visual reasoning (AVR) problems require finding high-level patterns (e.g., repetition constraints) that control the input shapes (e.g., digits) in a specific task configuration (e.g., matrix). However, existing AVR benchmarks only considered a limited set of patterns (addition, conjunction), input shapes (rectangle, square), and task configurations (3 by 3 matrices). To evaluate MLLMs' reasoning abilities comprehensively, we introduce MARVEL, a multidimensional AVR benchmark with 770 puzzles composed of six core knowledge patterns, geometric and abstract shapes, and five different task configurations. To inspect whether the model accuracy is grounded in perception and reasoning, MARVEL complements the general AVR question with perception questions in a hierarchical evaluation framework. We conduct comprehensive experiments on MARVEL with nine representative MLLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our experiments reveal that all models show near-random performance on the AVR question, with significant performance gaps (40%) compared to humans across all patterns and task configurations. Further analysis of perception questions reveals that MLLMs struggle to comprehend the visual features (near-random performance) and even count the panels in the puzzle ( <45%), hindering their ability for abstract reasoning. We release our entire code and dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shai Meital, Lior Rokach, Roman Vainshtein, Nir Grinberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-participant discussions tend to unfold in a tree structure rather than a chain structure. Branching may occur for multiple reasons -- from the asynchronous nature of online platforms to a conscious decision by an interlocutor to disengage with part of the conversation. Predicting branching and understanding the reasons for creating new branches is important for many downstream tasks such as summarization and thread disentanglement and may help develop online spaces that encourage users to engage in online discussions in more meaningful ways. In this work, we define the novel task of branch prediction and propose GLOBS (Global Branching Score) -- a deep neural network model for predicting branching. GLOBS is evaluated on three large discussion forums from Reddit, achieving significant improvements over an array of competitive baselines and demonstrating better transferability. We affirm that structural, temporal, and linguistic features contribute to GLOBS success and find that branching is associated with a greater number of conversation participants and tends to occur in earlier levels of the conversation tree. We publicly release GLOBS and our implementation of all baseline models to allow reproducibility and promote further research on this important task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie, Mohammad-Shahram Moin, Shohreh Kasaei</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have made significant advancements in accurately estimating scene flow using point clouds, which is vital for many applications like video analysis, action recognition, and navigation. Robustness of these techniques, however, remains a concern, particularly in the face of adversarial attacks that have been proven to deceive state-of-the-art deep neural networks in many domains. Surprisingly, the robustness of scene flow networks against such attacks has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this problem, the proposed approach aims to bridge this gap by introducing adversarial white-box attacks specifically tailored for scene flow networks. Experimental results show that the generated adversarial examples obtain up to 33.7 relative degradation in average end-point error on the KITTI and FlyingThings3D datasets. The study also reveals the significant impact that attacks targeting point clouds in only one dimension or color channel have on average end-point error. Analyzing the success and failure of these attacks on the scene flow networks and their 2D optical flow network variants show a higher vulnerability for the optical flow networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xun Wu, Shaohan Huang, Furu Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: LoRA has gained widespread acceptance in the fine-tuning of large pre-trained models to cater to a diverse array of downstream tasks, showcasing notable effectiveness and efficiency, thereby solidifying its position as one of the most prevalent fine-tuning techniques. Due to the modular nature of LoRA's plug-and-play plugins, researchers have delved into the amalgamation of multiple LoRAs to empower models to excel across various downstream tasks. Nonetheless, extant approaches for LoRA fusion grapple with inherent challenges. Direct arithmetic merging may result in the loss of the original pre-trained model's generative capabilities or the distinct identity of LoRAs, thereby yielding suboptimal outcomes. On the other hand, Reference tuning-based fusion exhibits limitations concerning the requisite flexibility for the effective combination of multiple LoRAs. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces the Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLE) approach, which harnesses hierarchical control and unfettered branch selection. The MoLE approach not only achieves superior LoRA fusion performance in comparison to direct arithmetic merging but also retains the crucial flexibility for combining LoRAs effectively. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted in both the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Vision & Language (V&L) domains substantiate the efficacy of MoLE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiheng Zhong, Hadi Meidani</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving parametric Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) for a broad range of parameters is a critical challenge in scientific computing. To this end, neural operators, which learn mappings from parameters to solutions, have been successfully used. However, the training of neural operators typically demands large training datasets, the acquisition of which can be prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, physics-informed training can offer a cost-effective strategy. However, current physics-informed neural operators face limitations, either in handling irregular domain shapes or in generalization to various discretizations of PDE parameters with variable mesh sizes. In this research, we introduce a novel physics-informed model architecture which can generalize to parameter discretizations of variable size and irregular domain shapes. Particularly, inspired by deep operator neural networks, our model involves a discretization-independent learning of parameter embedding repeatedly, and this parameter embedding is integrated with the response embeddings through multiple compositional layers, for more expressivity. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang He, Joey Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical vision transformers (ViTs) have two advantages over conventional ViTs. First, hierarchical ViTs achieve linear computational complexity with respect to image size by local self-attention. Second, hierarchical ViTs create hierarchical feature maps by merging image patches in deeper layers for dense prediction. However, existing pruning methods ignore the unique properties of hierarchical ViTs and use the magnitude value as the weight importance. This approach leads to two main drawbacks. First, the "local" attention weights are compared at a "global" level, which may cause some "locally" important weights to be pruned due to their relatively small magnitude "globally". The second issue with magnitude pruning is that it fails to consider the distinct weight distributions of the network, which are essential for extracting coarse to fine-grained features at various hierarchical levels.
  To solve the aforementioned issues, we have developed a Data-independent Module-Aware Pruning method (DIMAP) to compress hierarchical ViTs. To ensure that "local" attention weights at different hierarchical levels are compared fairly in terms of their contribution, we treat them as a module and examine their contribution by analyzing their information distortion. Furthermore, we introduce a novel weight metric that is solely based on weights and does not require input images, thereby eliminating the dependence on the patch merging process. Our method validates its usefulness and strengths on Swin Transformers of different sizes on ImageNet-1k classification. Notably, the top-5 accuracy drop is only 0.07% when we remove 52.5% FLOPs and 52.7% parameters of Swin-B. When we reduce 33.2% FLOPs and 33.2% parameters of Swin-S, we can even achieve a 0.8% higher relative top-5 accuracy than the original model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinwei Shen, Nicolai Meinshausen</p>
<p>Abstract: Dimension reduction techniques usually lose information in the sense that reconstructed data are not identical to the original data. However, we argue that it is possible to have reconstructed data identically distributed as the original data, irrespective of the retained dimension or the specific mapping. This can be achieved by learning a distributional model that matches the conditional distribution of data given its low-dimensional latent variables. Motivated by this, we propose Distributional Principal Autoencoder (DPA) that consists of an encoder that maps high-dimensional data to low-dimensional latent variables and a decoder that maps the latent variables back to the data space. For reducing the dimension, the DPA encoder aims to minimise the unexplained variability of the data with an adaptive choice of the latent dimension. For reconstructing data, the DPA decoder aims to match the conditional distribution of all data that are mapped to a certain latent value, thus ensuring that the reconstructed data retains the original data distribution. Our numerical results on climate data, single-cell data, and image benchmarks demonstrate the practical feasibility and success of the approach in reconstructing the original distribution of the data. DPA embeddings are shown to preserve meaningful structures of data such as the seasonal cycle for precipitations and cell types for gene expression.</p>

This paper undertakes an analysis of this "AI adoption gap" from an industry practitioner's perspective. In response, we propose the BANSAI approach (Bridging the AI Adoption Gap via Neurosymbolic AI). It systematically leverages principles of neurosymbolic AI to establish data-driven, subsymbolic program synthesis and optimization in modern industrial robot programming workflow.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaqun Yang, Jinlong Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider an $n$ agents distributed optimization problem with imperfect information characterized in a parametric sense, where the unknown parameter can be solved by a distinct distributed parameter learning problem. Though each agent only has access to its local parameter learning and computational problem, they mean to collaboratively minimize the average of their local cost functions. To address the special optimization problem, we propose a coupled distributed stochastic approximation algorithm, in which every agent updates the current beliefs of its unknown parameter and decision variable by stochastic approximation method; and then averages the beliefs and decision variables of its neighbors over network in consensus protocol. Our interest lies in the convergence analysis of this algorithm. We quantitatively characterize the factors that affect the algorithm performance, and prove that the mean-squared error of the decision variable is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{nk})+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}(1-\rho_w)}\right)\frac{1}{k^{1.5}}+\mathcal{O}\big(\frac{1}{(1-\rho_w)^2} \big)\frac{1}{k^2}$, where $k$ is the iteration count and $(1-\rho_w)$ is the spectral gap of the network weighted adjacency matrix. It reveals that the network connectivity characterized by $(1-\rho_w)$ only influences the high order of convergence rate, while the domain rate still acts the same as the centralized algorithm. In addition, we analyze that the transient iteration needed for reaching its dominant rate $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{nk})$ is $\mathcal{O}(\frac{n}{(1-\rho_w)^2})$. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the theoretical results by taking different CPUs as agents, which is more applicable to real-world distributed scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaopeng Gu, Bingke Zhu, Guibo Zhu, Yingying Chen, Hao Li, Ming Tang, Jinqiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) methods entail detecting anomalies directly without access to any known normal or abnormal samples within the target item categories. Existing approaches typically rely on the robust generalization capabilities of multimodal pretrained models, computing similarities between manually crafted textual features representing "normal" or "abnormal" semantics and image features to detect anomalies and localize anomalous patches. However, the generic descriptions of "abnormal" often fail to precisely match diverse types of anomalies across different object categories. Additionally, computing feature similarities for single patches struggles to pinpoint specific locations of anomalies with various sizes and scales. To address these issues, we propose a novel ZSAD method called FiLo, comprising two components: adaptively learned Fine-Grained Description (FG-Des) and position-enhanced High-Quality Localization (HQ-Loc). FG-Des introduces fine-grained anomaly descriptions for each category using Large Language Models (LLMs) and employs adaptively learned textual templates to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of anomaly detection. HQ-Loc, utilizing Grounding DINO for preliminary localization, position-enhanced text prompts, and Multi-scale Multi-shape Cross-modal Interaction (MMCI) module, facilitates more accurate localization of anomalies of different sizes and shapes. Experimental results on datasets like MVTec and VisA demonstrate that FiLo significantly improves the performance of ZSAD in both detection and localization, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an image-level AUC of 83.9% and a pixel-level AUC of 95.9% on the VisA dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the Lakehouse architecture becomes more widespread, ensuring the reproducibility of data workloads over data lakes emerges as a crucial concern for data engineers. However, achieving reproducibility remains challenging. The size of data pipelines contributes to slow testing and iterations, while the intertwining of business logic and data management complicates debugging and increases error susceptibility. In this paper, we highlight recent advancements made at Bauplan in addressing this challenge. We introduce a system designed to decouple compute from data management, by leveraging a cloud runtime alongside Nessie, an open-source catalog with Git semantics. Demonstrating the system's capabilities, we showcase its ability to offer time-travel and branching semantics on top of object storage, and offer full pipeline reproducibility with a few CLI commands.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Mainuddin, Zhenhai Duan, Yingfei Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: IoT devices fundamentally lack built-in security mechanisms to protect themselves from security attacks. Existing works on improving IoT security mostly focus on detecting anomalous behaviors of IoT devices. However, these existing anomaly detection schemes may trigger an overwhelmingly large number of false alerts, rendering them unusable in detecting compromised IoT devices. In this paper we develop an effective and efficient framework, named CUMAD, to detect compromised IoT devices. Instead of directly relying on individual anomalous events, CUMAD aims to accumulate sufficient evidence in detecting compromised IoT devices, by integrating an autoencoder-based anomaly detection subsystem with a sequential probability ratio test (SPRT)-based sequential hypothesis testing subsystem. CUMAD can effectively reduce the number of false alerts in detecting compromised IoT devices, and moreover, it can detect compromised IoT devices quickly. Our evaluation studies based on the public-domain N-BaIoT dataset show that CUMAD can on average reduce the false positive rate from about 3.57% using only the autoencoder-based anomaly detection scheme to about 0.5%; in addition, CUMAD can detect compromised IoT devices quickly, with less than 5 observations on average.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akhilan Boopathy, Aneesh Muppidi, Peggy Yang, Abhiram Iyer, William Yue, Ila Fiete</p>
<p>Abstract: State estimation is crucial for the performance and safety of numerous robotic applications. Among the suite of estimation techniques, particle filters have been identified as a powerful solution due to their non-parametric nature. Yet, in high-dimensional state spaces, these filters face challenges such as 'particle deprivation' which hinders accurate representation of the true posterior distribution. This paper introduces a novel resampling-free particle filter designed to mitigate particle deprivation by forgoing the traditional resampling step. This ensures a broader and more diverse particle set, especially vital in high-dimensional scenarios. Theoretically, our proposed filter is shown to offer a near-accurate representation of the desired posterior distribution in high-dimensional contexts. Empirically, the effectiveness of our approach is underscored through a high-dimensional synthetic state estimation task and a 6D pose estimation derived from videos. We posit that as robotic systems evolve with greater degrees of freedom, particle filters tailored for high-dimensional state spaces will be indispensable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanlong Jiao, Chenyangguang Zhang, Haonan Yin, Yu Mo, Biqing Huang, Hui Pan, Yi Luo, Jingxian Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain generalized semantic segmentation is an essential computer vision task, for which models only leverage source data to learn the capability of generalized semantic segmentation towards the unseen target domains. Previous works typically address this challenge by global style randomization or feature regularization. In this paper, we argue that given the observation that different local semantic regions perform different visual characteristics from the source domain to the target domain, methods focusing on global operations are hard to capture such regional discrepancies, thus failing to construct domain-invariant representations with the consistency from local to global level. Therefore, we propose the Semantic-Rearrangement-based Multi-Level Alignment (SRMA) to overcome this problem. SRMA first incorporates a Semantic Rearrangement Module (SRM), which conducts semantic region randomization to enhance the diversity of the source domain sufficiently. A Multi-Level Alignment module (MLA) is subsequently proposed with the help of such diversity to establish the global-regional-local consistent domain-invariant representations. By aligning features across randomized samples with domain-neutral knowledge at multiple levels, SRMA provides a more robust way to handle the source-target domain gap. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SRMA over the current state-of-the-art works on various benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies, regarded as a contaminant in weak lensing analyses, represents the correlation of galaxy shapes due to gravitational tidal interactions and galaxy formation processes. As such, understanding IA is paramount for accurate cosmological inferences from weak lensing surveys; however, one limitation to our understanding and mitigation of IA is expensive simulation-based modeling. In this work, we present a deep learning approach to emulate galaxy position-position ($\xi$), position-orientation ($\omega$), and orientation-orientation ($\eta$) correlation function measurements and uncertainties from halo occupation distribution-based mock galaxy catalogs. We find strong Pearson correlation values with the model across all three correlation functions and further predict aleatoric uncertainties through a mean-variance estimation training procedure. $\xi(r)$ predictions are generally accurate to $\leq10\%$. Our model also successfully captures the underlying signal of the noisier correlations $\omega(r)$ and $\eta(r)$, although with a lower average accuracy. We find that the model performance is inhibited by the stochasticity of the data, and will benefit from correlations averaged over multiple data realizations. Our code will be made open source upon journal publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nada Saadi, Numan Saeed, Mohammad Yaqub, Karthik Nandakumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Imaging modalities such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are key in cancer detection, inspiring Deep Neural Networks (DNN) models that merge these scans for tumor segmentation. When both CT and PET scans are available, it is common to combine them as two channels of the input to the segmentation model. However, this method requires both scan types during training and inference, posing a challenge due to the limited availability of PET scans, thereby sometimes limiting the process to CT scans only. Hence, there is a need to develop a flexible DNN architecture that can be trained/updated using only CT scans but can effectively utilize PET scans when they become available. In this work, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-modal adaptation (PEMMA) framework for lightweight upgrading of a transformer-based segmentation model trained only on CT scans to also incorporate PET scans. The benefits of the proposed approach are two-fold. Firstly, we leverage the inherent modularity of the transformer architecture and perform low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of the attention weights to achieve parameter-efficient adaptation. Secondly, since the PEMMA framework attempts to minimize cross modal entanglement, it is possible to subsequently update the combined model using only one modality, without causing catastrophic forgetting of the other modality. Our proposed method achieves comparable results with the performance of early fusion techniques with just 8% of the trainable parameters, especially with a remarkable +28% improvement on the average dice score on PET scans when trained on a single modality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Motivated by ethical and legal concerns, the scientific community is actively developing methods to limit the misuse of Text-to-Image diffusion models for reproducing copyrighted, violent, explicit, or personal information in the generated images. Simultaneously, researchers put these newly developed safety measures to the test by assuming the role of an adversary to find vulnerabilities and backdoors in them. We use compositional property of diffusion models, which allows to leverage multiple prompts in a single image generation. This property allows us to combine other concepts, that should not have been affected by the inhibition, to reconstruct the vector, responsible for target concept generation, even though the direct computation of this vector is no longer accessible. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence why the proposed attacks are possible and discuss the implications of these findings for safe model deployment. We argue that it is essential to consider all possible approaches to image generation with diffusion models that can be employed by an adversary. Our work opens up the discussion about the implications of concept arithmetics and compositional inference for safety mechanisms in diffusion models.

<p>Abstract: The training-conditional coverage performance of the conformal prediction is known to be empirically sound. Recently, there have been efforts to support this observation with theoretical guarantees. The training-conditional coverage bounds for jackknife+ and full-conformal prediction regions have been established via the notion of $(m,n)$-stability by Liang and Barber~[2023]. Although this notion is weaker than uniform stability, it is not clear how to evaluate it for practical models. In this paper, we study the training-conditional coverage bounds of full-conformal, jackknife+, and CV+ prediction regions from a uniform stability perspective which is known to hold for empirical risk minimization over reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces with convex regularization. We derive coverage bounds for finite-dimensional models by a concentration argument for the (estimated) predictor function, and compare the bounds with existing ones under ridge regression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hasanul Mahmud, Kevin Desai, Palden Lama, Sushil K. Prasad</p>
<p>Abstract: Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, and the quest to enhance DNN accuracy without inflating model size or latency remains a pressing concern. We make a couple of advances in this regard, leading to a novel EncodeNet design and training framework. The first advancement involves Converting Autoencoders, a novel approach that transforms images into an easy-to-classify image of its class. Our prior work that applied the Converting Autoencoder and a simple classifier in tandem achieved moderate accuracy over simple datasets, such as MNIST and FMNIST. However, on more complex datasets like CIFAR-10, the Converting Autoencoder has a large reconstruction loss, making it unsuitable for enhancing DNN accuracy. To address these limitations, we generalize the design of Converting Autoencoders by leveraging a larger class of DNNs, those with architectures comprising feature extraction layers followed by classification layers. We incorporate a generalized algorithmic design of the Converting Autoencoder and intraclass clustering to identify representative images, leading to optimized image feature learning. Next, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our EncodeNet design and training framework, improving the accuracy of well-trained baseline DNNs while maintaining the overall model size. EncodeNet's building blocks comprise the trained encoder from our generalized Converting Autoencoders transferring knowledge to a lightweight classifier network - also extracted from the baseline DNN. Our experimental results demonstrate that EncodeNet improves the accuracy of VGG16 from 92.64% to 94.05% on CIFAR-10 and RestNet20 from 74.56% to 76.04% on CIFAR-100.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqing Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Biomedical literature is a rapidly expanding field of science and technology. Classification of biomedical texts is an essential part of biomedicine research, especially in the field of biology. This work proposes the fine-tuned DistilBERT, a methodology-specific, pre-trained generative classification language model for mining biomedicine texts. The model has proven its effectiveness in linguistic understanding capabilities and has reduced the size of BERT models by 40\% but by 60\% faster. The main objective of this project is to improve the model and assess the performance of the model compared to the non-fine-tuned model. We used DistilBert as a support model and pre-trained on a corpus of 32,000 abstracts and complete text articles; our results were impressive and surpassed those of traditional literature classification methods by using RNN or LSTM. Our aim is to integrate this highly specialised and specific model into different research industries.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently,smart roadside infrastructure (SRI) has demonstrated the potential of achieving fully autonomous driving systems. To explore the potential of infrastructure-assisted autonomous driving, this paper presents the design and deployment of Soar, the first end-to-end SRI system specifically designed to support autonomous driving systems. Soar consists of both software and hardware components carefully designed to overcome various system and physical challenges. Soar can leverage the existing operational infrastructure like street lampposts for a lower barrier of adoption. Soar adopts a new communication architecture that comprises a bi-directional multi-hop I2I network and a downlink I2V broadcast service, which are designed based on off-the-shelf 802.11ac interfaces in an integrated manner. Soar also features a hierarchical DL task management framework to achieve desirable load balancing among nodes and enable them to collaborate efficiently to run multiple data-intensive autonomous driving applications. We deployed a total of 18 Soar nodes on existing lampposts on campus, which have been operational for over two years. Our real-world evaluation shows that Soar can support a diverse set of autonomous driving applications and achieve desirable real-time performance and high communication reliability. Our findings and experiences in this work offer key insights into the development and deployment of next-generation smart roadside infrastructure and autonomous driving systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bing Luo, Wenli Xiao, Shiqiang Wang, Jianwei Huang, Leandros Tassiulas</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) algorithms usually sample a fraction of clients in each round (partial participation) when the number of participants is large and the server's communication bandwidth is limited. Recent works on the convergence analysis of FL have focused on unbiased client sampling, e.g., sampling uniformly at random, which suffers from slow wall-clock time for convergence due to high degrees of system heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity. This paper aims to design an adaptive client sampling algorithm for FL over wireless networks that tackles both system and statistical heterogeneity to minimize the wall-clock convergence time. We obtain a new tractable convergence bound for FL algorithms with arbitrary client sampling probability. Based on the bound, we analytically establish the relationship between the total learning time and sampling probability with an adaptive bandwidth allocation scheme, which results in a non-convex optimization problem. We design an efficient algorithm for learning the unknown parameters in the convergence bound and develop a low-complexity algorithm to approximately solve the non-convex problem. Our solution reveals the impact of system and statistical heterogeneity parameters on the optimal client sampling design. Moreover, our solution shows that as the number of sampled clients increases, the total convergence time first decreases and then increases because a larger sampling number reduces the number of rounds for convergence but results in a longer expected time per-round due to limited wireless bandwidth. Experimental results from both hardware prototype and simulation demonstrate that our proposed sampling scheme significantly reduces the convergence time compared to several baseline sampling schemes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cold-start item recommendation is a long-standing challenge in recommendation systems. A common remedy is to use a content-based approach, but rich information from raw contents in various forms has not been fully utilized. In this paper, we propose a domain/data-agnostic item representation learning framework for cold-start recommendations, naturally equipped with multimodal alignment among various features by adopting a Transformer-based architecture. Our proposed model is end-to-end trainable completely free from classification labels, not just costly to collect but suboptimal for recommendation-purpose representation learning. From extensive experiments on real-world movie and news recommendation benchmarks, we verify that our approach better preserves fine-grained user taste than state-of-the-art baselines, universally applicable to multiple domains at large scale.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a data-driven approach to analyze the performance of continuous optimization algorithms using generalization guarantees from statistical learning theory. We study classical and learned optimizers to solve families of parametric optimization problems. We build generalization guarantees for classical optimizers, using a sample convergence bound, and for learned optimizers, using the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-Bayes framework. To train learned optimizers, we use a gradient-based algorithm to directly minimize the PAC-Bayes upper bound. Numerical experiments in signal processing, control, and meta-learning showcase the ability of our framework to provide strong generalization guarantees for both classical and learned optimizers given a fixed budget of iterations. For classical optimizers, our bounds are much tighter than those that worst-case guarantees provide. For learned optimizers, our bounds outperform the empirical outcomes observed in their non-learned counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyang Wu, Ying Xu, Tingsong Xiao, Yunze Xiao, Yitong Li, Tianyang Wang, Yichi Zhang, Shanghai Zhong, Yuwei Zhang, Wei Lu, Yifan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as potent tools for advancing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the attitudinal disparities between LLMs and humans towards these goals can pose significant challenges. This study conducts a comprehensive review and analysis of the existing literature on the attitudes of LLMs towards the 17 SDGs, emphasizing the comparison between their attitudes and support for each goal and those of humans. We examine the potential disparities, primarily focusing on aspects such as understanding and emotions, cultural and regional differences, task objective variations, and factors considered in the decision-making process. These disparities arise from the underrepresentation and imbalance in LLM training data, historical biases, quality issues, lack of contextual understanding, and skewed ethical values reflected. The study also investigates the risks and harms that may arise from neglecting the attitudes of LLMs towards the SDGs, including the exacerbation of social inequalities, racial discrimination, environmental destruction, and resource wastage. To address these challenges, we propose strategies and recommendations to guide and regulate the application of LLMs, ensuring their alignment with the principles and goals of the SDGs, and therefore creating a more just, inclusive, and sustainable future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingxuan Gao, Min Wang, Maoyin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has shown the great power in the field of fault detection. However, for incipient faults with tiny amplitude, the detection performance of the current deep learning networks (DLNs) is not satisfactory. Even if prior information about the faults is utilized, DLNs can't successfully detect faults 3, 9 and 15 in Tennessee Eastman process (TEP). These faults are notoriously difficult to detect, lacking effective detection technologies in the field of fault detection. In this work, we propose Autoencoder-assisted Feature Ensemble Net (AE-FENet): a deep feature ensemble framework that uses the unsupervised autoencoder to conduct the feature transformation. Compared with the principle component analysis (PCA) technique adopted in the original Feature Ensemble Net (FENet), autoencoder can mine more exact features on incipient faults, which results in the better detection performance of AE-FENet. With same kinds of basic detectors, AE-FENet achieves a state-of-the-art average accuracy over 96% on faults 3, 9 and 15 in TEP, which represents a significant enhancement in performance compared to other methods. Plenty of experiments have been done to extend our framework, proving that DLNs can be utilized efficiently within this architecture.</p>

With OccFeat, we pretrain a BEV network via occupancy prediction and feature distillation tasks. Occupancy prediction provides a 3D geometric understanding of the scene to the model. However, the geometry learned is class-agnostic. Hence, we add semantic information to the model in the 3D space through distillation from a self-supervised pretrained image foundation model. Models pretrained with our method exhibit improved BEV semantic segmentation performance, particularly in low-data scenarios. Moreover, empirical results affirm the efficacy of integrating feature distillation with 3D occupancy prediction in our pretraining approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohak Chadha, Alexander Jensen, Jianfeng Gu, Osama Abboud, Michael Gerndt</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning paradigm that enables the collaborative training of a shared global model across distributed clients while keeping the data decentralized. Recent works on designing systems for efficient FL have shown that utilizing serverless computing technologies, particularly Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) for FL, can enhance resource efficiency, reduce training costs, and alleviate the complex infrastructure management burden on data holders. However, current serverless FL systems still suffer from the presence of stragglers, i.e., slow clients that impede the collaborative training process. While strategies aimed at mitigating stragglers in these systems have been proposed, they overlook the diverse hardware resource configurations among FL clients. To this end, we present Apodotiko, a novel asynchronous training strategy designed for serverless FL. Our strategy incorporates a scoring mechanism that evaluates each client's hardware capacity and dataset size to intelligently prioritize and select clients for each training round, thereby minimizing the effects of stragglers on system performance. We comprehensively evaluate Apodotiko across diverse datasets, considering a mix of CPU and GPU clients, and compare its performance against five other FL training strategies. Results from our experiments demonstrate that Apodotiko outperforms other FL training strategies, achieving an average speedup of 2.75x and a maximum speedup of 7.03x. Furthermore, our strategy significantly reduces cold starts by a factor of four on average, demonstrating suitability in serverless environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lalita Kumari, Sukhdeep Singh, Vaibhav Varish Singh Rathore, Anuj Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: The Handwritten Text Recognition problem has been a challenge for researchers for the last few decades, especially in the domain of computer vision, a subdomain of pattern recognition. Variability of texts amongst writers, cursiveness, and different font styles of handwritten texts with degradation of historical text images make it a challenging problem. Recognizing scanned document images in neural network-based systems typically involves a two-step approach: segmentation and recognition. However, this method has several drawbacks. These shortcomings encompass challenges in identifying text regions, analyzing layout diversity within pages, and establishing accurate ground truth segmentation. Consequently, these processes are prone to errors, leading to bottlenecks in achieving high recognition accuracies. Thus, in this study, we present an end-to-end paragraph recognition system that incorporates internal line segmentation and gated convolutional layers based encoder. The gating is a mechanism that controls the flow of information and allows to adaptively selection of the more relevant features in handwritten text recognition models. The attention module plays an important role in performing internal line segmentation, allowing the page to be processed line-by-line. During the decoding step, we have integrated a connectionist temporal classification-based word beam search decoder as a post-processing step. In this work, we have extended existing LexiconNet by carefully applying and utilizing gated convolutional layers in the existing deep neural network. Our results at line and page levels also favour our new GatedLexiconNet. This study reported character error rates of 2.27% on IAM, 0.9% on RIMES, and 2.13% on READ-16, and word error rates of 5.73% on IAM, 2.76% on RIMES, and 6.52% on READ-2016 datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms and Generative Deep Learning have been two of the most powerful tools for sound generation tasks. However, they have limitations: Evolutionary Algorithms require complicated designs, posing challenges in control and achieving realistic sound generation. Generative Deep Learning models often copy from the dataset and lack creativity. In this paper, we propose LVNS-RAVE, a method to combine Evolutionary Algorithms and Generative Deep Learning to produce realistic and novel sounds. We use the RAVE model as the sound generator and the VGGish model as a novelty evaluator in the Latent Vector Novelty Search (LVNS) algorithm. The reported experiments show that the method can successfully generate diversified, novel audio samples under different mutation setups using different pre-trained RAVE models. The characteristics of the generation process can be easily controlled with the mutation parameters. The proposed algorithm can be a creative tool for sound artists and musicians.</p>

<p>Abstract: Safety and responsibility evaluations of advanced AI models are a critical but developing field of research and practice. In the development of Google DeepMind's advanced AI models, we innovated on and applied a broad set of approaches to safety evaluation. In this report, we summarise and share elements of our evolving approach as well as lessons learned for a broad audience. Key lessons learned include: First, theoretical underpinnings and frameworks are invaluable to organise the breadth of risk domains, modalities, forms, metrics, and goals. Second, theory and practice of safety evaluation development each benefit from collaboration to clarify goals, methods and challenges, and facilitate the transfer of insights between different stakeholders and disciplines. Third, similar key methods, lessons, and institutions apply across the range of concerns in responsibility and safety - including established and emerging harms. For this reason it is important that a wide range of actors working on safety evaluation and safety research communities work together to develop, refine and implement novel evaluation approaches and best practices, rather than operating in silos. The report concludes with outlining the clear need to rapidly advance the science of evaluations, to integrate new evaluations into the development and governance of AI, to establish scientifically-grounded norms and standards, and to promote a robust evaluation ecosystem.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of electron microscopy has expanded our ability to acquire nanometer and atomically resolved images of complex materials. The resulting vast datasets are typically analyzed by human operators, an intrinsically challenging process due to the multiple possible analysis steps and the corresponding need to build and optimize complex analysis workflows. We present a methodology based on the concept of a Reward Function coupled with Bayesian Optimization, to optimize image analysis workflows dynamically. The Reward Function is engineered to closely align with the experimental objectives and broader context and is quantifiable upon completion of the analysis. Here, cross-section, high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) images of ion-irradiated (Y, \text{Dy})\text{Ba}_2\text{Cu}_3\text{O}_{7-\delta} thin-films were used as a model system. The reward functions were formed based on the expected materials density and atomic spacings and used to drive multi-objective optimization of the classical Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) method. These results can be benchmarked against the DCNN segmentation. This optimized LoG* compares favorably against DCNN in the presence of the additional noise. We further extend the reward function approach towards the identification of partially-disordered regions, creating a physics-driven reward function and action space of high-dimensional clustering. We pose that with correct definition, the reward function approach allows real-time optimization of complex analysis workflows at much higher speeds and lower computational costs than classical DCNN-based inference, ensuring the attainment of results that are both precise and aligned with the human-defined objectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan A. L. Schoop, Gijs Hendriks, Tristan van Leeuwen, Chris L. de Korte, Felix Lucka</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultrafast ultrasound imaging insonifies a medium with one or a combination of a few plane waves at different beam-steered angles instead of many focused waves. It can achieve much higher frame rates, but often at the cost of reduced image quality. Deep learning approaches have been proposed to mitigate this disadvantage, in particular for single plane wave imaging. Predominantly, image-to-image post-processing networks or fully learned data-to-image neural networks are used. Both construct their mapping purely data-driven and require expressive networks and large amounts of training data to perform well. In contrast, we consider data-to-image networks which incorporate a conventional image formation techniques as differentiable layers in the network architecture. This allows for end-to-end training with small amounts of training data. In this work, using f-k migration as an image formation layer is evaluated in-depth with experimental data. We acquired a data collection designed for benchmarking data-driven plane wave imaging approaches using a realistic breast mimicking phantom and an ultrasound calibration phantom. The evaluation considers global and local image similarity measures and contrast, resolution and lesion detectability analysis. The results show that the proposed network architecture is capable of improving the image quality of single plane wave images on all evaluation metrics. Furthermore, these image quality improvements can be achieved with surprisingly little amounts of training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mauricio Lima, Katherine Deck, Oliver R. A. Dunbar, Tapio Schneider</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning is playing an increasing role in hydrology, supplementing or replacing physics-based models. One notable example is the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for forecasting streamflow given observed precipitation and geographic characteristics. Training of such a model over the continental United States has demonstrated that a single set of model parameters can be used across independent catchments, and that RNNs can outperform physics-based models. In this work, we take a next step and study the performance of RNNs for river routing in land surface models (LSMs). Instead of observed precipitation, the LSM-RNN uses instantaneous runoff calculated from physics-based models as an input. We train the model with data from river basins spanning the globe and test it in streamflow hindcasts. The model demonstrates skill at generalization across basins (predicting streamflow in unseen catchments) and across time (predicting streamflow during years not used in training). We compare the predictions from the LSM-RNN to an existing physics-based model calibrated with a similar dataset and find that the LSM-RNN outperforms the physics-based model. Our results give further evidence that RNNs are effective for global streamflow prediction from runoff inputs and motivate the development of complete routing models that can capture nested sub-basis connections.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapidly developing Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have shown notable capabilities on a range of multi-modal tasks, but still face the hallucination phenomena where the generated texts do not align with the given contexts, significantly restricting the usages of LVLMs. Most previous work detects and mitigates hallucination at the coarse-grained level or requires expensive annotation (e.g., labeling by proprietary models or human experts). To address these issues, we propose detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs via fine-grained AI feedback. The basic idea is that we generate a small-size sentence-level hallucination annotation dataset by proprietary models, whereby we train a hallucination detection model which can perform sentence-level hallucination detection, covering primary hallucination types (i.e., object, attribute, and relationship). Then, we propose a detect-then-rewrite pipeline to automatically construct preference dataset for training hallucination mitigating model. Furthermore, we propose differentiating the severity of hallucinations, and introducing a Hallucination Severity-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (HSA-DPO) for mitigating hallucination in LVLMs by incorporating the severity of hallucinations into preference learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Hou, Jin-Duk Park, Won-Yong Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: A recent study has shown that diffusion models are well-suited for modeling the generative process of user-item interactions in recommender systems due to their denoising nature. However, existing diffusion model-based recommender systems do not explicitly leverage high-order connectivities that contain crucial collaborative signals for accurate recommendations. Addressing this gap, we propose CF-Diff, a new diffusion model-based collaborative filtering (CF) method, which is capable of making full use of collaborative signals along with multi-hop neighbors. Specifically, the forward-diffusion process adds random noise to user-item interactions, while the reverse-denoising process accommodates our own learning model, named cross-attention-guided multi-hop autoencoder (CAM-AE), to gradually recover the original user-item interactions. CAM-AE consists of two core modules: 1) the attention-aided AE module, responsible for precisely learning latent representations of user-item interactions while preserving the model's complexity at manageable levels, and 2) the multi-hop cross-attention module, which judiciously harnesses high-order connectivity information to capture enhanced collaborative signals. Through comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that CF-Diff is (a) Superior: outperforming benchmark recommendation methods, achieving remarkable gains up to 7.29% compared to the best competitor, (b) Theoretically-validated: reducing computations while ensuring that the embeddings generated by our model closely approximate those from the original cross-attention, and (c) Scalable: proving the computational efficiency that scales linearly with the number of users or items.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin-Duk Park, Yong-Min Shin, Won-Yong Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: A series of graph filtering (GF)-based collaborative filtering (CF) showcases state-of-the-art performance on the recommendation accuracy by using a low-pass filter (LPF) without a training process. However, conventional GF-based CF approaches mostly perform matrix decomposition on the item-item similarity graph to realize the ideal LPF, which results in a non-trivial computational cost and thus makes them less practical in scenarios where rapid recommendations are essential. In this paper, we propose Turbo-CF, a GF-based CF method that is both training-free and matrix decomposition-free. Turbo-CF employs a polynomial graph filter to circumvent the issue of expensive matrix decompositions, enabling us to make full use of modern computer hardware components (i.e., GPU). Specifically, Turbo-CF first constructs an item-item similarity graph whose edge weights are effectively regulated. Then, our own polynomial LPFs are designed to retain only low-frequency signals without explicit matrix decompositions. We demonstrate that Turbo-CF is extremely fast yet accurate, achieving a runtime of less than 1 second on real-world benchmark datasets while achieving recommendation accuracies comparable to best competitors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) have blurred the lines between authentic and machine-generated content, making it almost impossible for humans to distinguish between such media. One notable consequence is the use of AI-generated images for fake profiles on social media. While several types of disinformation campaigns and similar incidents have been reported in the past, a systematic analysis has been lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of the prevalence of AI-generated profile pictures on Twitter. We tackle the challenges of a real-world measurement study by carefully integrating various data sources and designing a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our analysis of nearly 15 million Twitter profile pictures shows that 0.052% were artificially generated, confirming their notable presence on the platform. We comprehensively examine the characteristics of these accounts and their tweet content, and uncover patterns of coordinated inauthentic behavior.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jue Hou, Anisia Katinskaia, Lari Kotilainen, Sathianpong Trangcasanchai, Anh-Duc Vu, Roman Yangarber</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates what insights about linguistic features and what knowledge about the structure of natural language can be obtained from the encodings in transformer language models.In particular, we explore how BERT encodes the government relation between constituents in a sentence. We use several probing classifiers, and data from two morphologically rich languages. Our experiments show that information about government is encoded across all transformer layers, but predominantly in the early layers of the model. We find that, for both languages, a small number of attention heads encode enough information about the government relations to enable us to train a classifier capable of discovering new, previously unknown types of government, never seen in the training data. Currently, data is lacking for the research community working on grammatical constructions, and government in particular. We release the Government Bank -- a dataset defining the government relations for thousands of lemmas in the languages in our experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark McLeod, Bernardo Perez-Orozco, Nika Lee, Davide Zilli</p>
<p>Abstract: Automotive insurers increasingly have access to telematic information via black-box recorders installed in the insured vehicle, and wish to identify undesirable behaviour which may signify increased risk or uninsured activities. However, identification of such behaviour with machine learning is non-trivial, and results are far from perfect, requiring human investigation to verify suspected cases. An appropriately formed priority score, generated by automated analysis of GPS data, allows underwriters to make more efficient use of their time, improving detection of the behaviour under investigation.
  An example of such behaviour is the use of a privately insured vehicle for commercial purposes, such as delivering meals and parcels. We first make use of trip GPS and accelerometer data, augmented by geospatial information, to train an imperfect classifier for delivery driving on a per-trip basis. We make use of a mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions to model the propensity of a policyholder to undertake trips which result in a positive classification as being drawn from either a rare high-scoring or common low-scoring group, and learn the parameters of this model using MCMC. This model provides us with a posterior probability that any policyholder will be a regular generator of automated alerts given any number of trips and alerts. This posterior probability is converted to a priority score, which was used to select the most valuable candidates for manual investigation.
  Testing over a 1-year period ranked policyholders by likelihood of commercial driving activity on a weekly basis. The top 0.9% have been reviewed at least once by the underwriters at the time of writing, and of those 99.4% have been confirmed as correctly identified, showing the approach has achieved a significant improvement in efficiency of human resource allocation compared to manual searching.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steffen Schotth\"ofer, M. Paul Laiu, Martin Frank, Cory D. Hauck</p>
<p>Abstract: The main challenge of large-scale numerical simulation of radiation transport is the high memory and computation time requirements of discretization methods for kinetic equations. In this work, we derive and investigate a neural network-based approximation to the entropy closure method to accurately compute the solution of the multi-dimensional moment system with a low memory footprint and competitive computational time. We extend methods developed for the standard entropy-based closure to the context of regularized entropy-based closures. The main idea is to interpret structure-preserving neural network approximations of the regularized entropy closure as a two-stage approximation to the original entropy closure. We conduct a numerical analysis of this approximation and investigate optimal parameter choices. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the method has a much lower memory footprint than traditional methods with competitive computation times and simulation accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> David R. Nickel, Anindya Bijoy Das, David J. Love, Christopher G. Brinton</p>
<p>Abstract: Opportunistic spectrum access has the potential to increase the efficiency of spectrum utilization in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). In CRNs, both spectrum sensing and resource allocation (SSRA) are critical to maximizing system throughput while minimizing collisions of secondary users with the primary network. However, many works in dynamic spectrum access do not consider the impact of imperfect sensing information such as mis-detected channels, which the additional information available in joint SSRA can help remediate. In this work, we examine joint SSRA as an optimization which seeks to maximize a CRN's net communication rate subject to constraints on channel sensing, channel access, and transmit power. Given the non-trivial nature of the problem, we leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning to enable a network of secondary users to dynamically access unoccupied spectrum via only local test statistics, formulated under the energy detection paradigm of spectrum sensing. In doing so, we develop a novel multi-agent implementation of hybrid soft actor critic, MHSAC, based on the QMIX mixing scheme. Through experiments, we find that our SSRA algorithm, HySSRA, is successful in maximizing the CRN's utilization of spectrum resources while also limiting its interference with the primary network, and outperforms the current state-of-the-art by a wide margin. We also explore the impact of wireless variations such as coherence time on the efficacy of the system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Ali Labbaf Khaniki, Mohammad Manthouri</p>
<p>Abstract: Lung segmentation in chest X-ray images is of paramount importance as it plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of various lung diseases. This paper presents a novel approach for lung segmentation in chest X-ray images by integrating U-net with attention mechanisms. The proposed method enhances the U-net architecture by incorporating a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), which unifies three distinct attention mechanisms: channel attention, spatial attention, and pixel attention. The channel attention mechanism enables the model to concentrate on the most informative features across various channels. The spatial attention mechanism enhances the model's precision in localization by focusing on significant spatial locations. Lastly, the pixel attention mechanism empowers the model to focus on individual pixels, further refining the model's focus and thereby improving the accuracy of segmentation. The adoption of the proposed CBAM in conjunction with the U-net architecture marks a significant advancement in the field of medical imaging, with potential implications for improving diagnostic precision and patient outcomes. The efficacy of this method is validated against contemporary state-of-the-art techniques, showcasing its superiority in segmentation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Shmakov, Kevin Greif, Michael James Fenton, Aishik Ghosh, Pierre Baldi, Daniel Whiteson</p>
<p>Abstract: The measurements performed by particle physics experiments must account for the imperfect response of the detectors used to observe the interactions. One approach, unfolding, statistically adjusts the experimental data for detector effects. Recently, generative machine learning models have shown promise for performing unbinned unfolding in a high number of dimensions. However, all current generative approaches are limited to unfolding a fixed set of observables, making them unable to perform full-event unfolding in the variable dimensional environment of collider data. A novel modification to the variational latent diffusion model (VLD) approach to generative unfolding is presented, which allows for unfolding of high- and variable-dimensional feature spaces. The performance of this method is evaluated in the context of semi-leptonic top quark pair production at the Large Hadron Collider.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stochastic versions of the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) and its variants play a key role in many modern large-scale machine learning problems. In this work, we introduce a unified algorithmic framework called generalized stochastic ADMM and investigate their continuous-time analysis. The generalized framework widely includes many stochastic ADMM variants such as standard, linearized and gradient-based ADMM. Our continuous-time analysis provides us with new insights into stochastic ADMM and variants, and we rigorously prove that under some proper scaling, the trajectory of stochastic ADMM weakly converges to the solution of a stochastic differential equation with small noise. Our analysis also provides a theoretical explanation of why the relaxation parameter should be chosen between 0 and 2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zifan Zhang, Minghong Fang, Jiayuan Huang, Yuchen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a distributed framework to train a global control model across multiple base stations without compromising the privacy of their local network data. This makes it ideal for applications like wireless traffic prediction (WTP), which plays a crucial role in optimizing network resources, enabling proactive traffic flow management, and enhancing the reliability of downstream communication-aided applications, such as IoT devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation systems. Despite its promise, the security aspects of FL-based distributed wireless systems, particularly in regression-based WTP problems, remain inadequately investigated. In this paper, we introduce a novel fake traffic injection (FTI) attack, designed to undermine the FL-based WTP system by injecting fabricated traffic distributions with minimal knowledge. We further propose a defense mechanism, termed global-local inconsistency detection (GLID), which strategically removes abnormal model parameters that deviate beyond a specific percentile range estimated through statistical methods in each dimension. Extensive experimental evaluations, performed on real-world wireless traffic datasets, demonstrate that both our attack and defense strategies significantly outperform existing baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present Paramanu-Ganita, a 208 million parameter novel Auto Regressive (AR) decoder based language model on mathematics. The model is pretrained from scratch at context size of 4096 on our curated mixed mathematical corpus. We evaluate our model on both perplexity metric and GSM8k mathematical benchmark. Paramanu-Ganita despite being 35 times smaller than 7B LLMs, outperformed generalist LLMs such as LLaMa-1 7B by 28.4% points, LLaMa-2 7B by 27.6% points, Falcon 7B by 32.6% points, PaLM 8B by 35.3% points, and math specialised LLMs such as Minerva 8B by 23.2% points, and LLEMMA-7B by 3.0% points in GSM8k test accuracy metric respectively. Paramanu-Ganita also outperformed giant LLMs like PaLM 62B by 6.4% points, Falcon 40B by 19.8% points, LLaMa-1 33B by 3.8% points and Vicuna 13B by 11.8% points respectively. The large significant margin improvement in performance of our math model over the existing LLMs signifies that reasoning capabilities of language model are just not restricted to LLMs with humongous number of parameters. Paramanu-Ganita took 146 hours of A100 training whereas math specialised LLM, LLEMMA 7B, was trained for 23,000 A100 hours of training equivalent. Thus, our approach of pretraining powerful domain specialised language models from scratch for domain adaptation is much more cost-effective than performing continual training of LLMs for domain adaptation. Hence, we conclude that for strong mathematical reasoning abilities of language model, we do not need giant LLMs and immense computing power to our end. In the end, we want to point out that we have only trained Paramanu-Ganita only on a part of our entire mathematical corpus and yet to explore the full potential of our model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs) are being adopted at remarkable speed, although their safety still remains a serious concern. With the advent of multilingual S/LLMs, the question now becomes a matter of scale: can we expand multilingual safety evaluations of these models with the same velocity at which they are deployed? To this end we introduce RTP-LX, a human-transcreated and human-annotated corpus of toxic prompts and outputs in 28 languages. RTP-LX follows participatory design practices, and a portion of the corpus is especially designed to detect culturally-specific toxic language. We evaluate seven S/LLMs on their ability to detect toxic content in a culturally-sensitive, multilingual scenario. We find that, although they typically score acceptably in terms of accuracy, they have low agreement with human judges when judging holistically the toxicity of a prompt, and have difficulty discerning harm in context-dependent scenarios, particularly with subtle-yet-harmful content (e.g. microagressions, bias). We release of this dataset to contribute to further reduce harmful uses of these models and improve their safe deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: We connect adversarial training for binary classification to a geometric evolution equation for the decision boundary. Relying on a perspective that recasts adversarial training as a regularization problem, we introduce a modified training scheme that constitutes a minimizing movements scheme for a nonlocal perimeter functional. We prove that the scheme is monotone and consistent as the adversarial budget vanishes and the perimeter localizes, and as a consequence we rigorously show that the scheme approximates a weighted mean curvature flow. This highlights that the efficacy of adversarial training may be due to locally minimizing the length of the decision boundary. In our analysis, we introduce a variety of tools for working with the subdifferential of a supremal-type nonlocal total variation and its regularity properties.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tokenization is widely used in large language models because it significantly improves performance. However, tokenization imposes several disadvantages, such as performance biases, increased adversarial vulnerability, decreased character-level modeling performance, and increased modeling complexity. To address these disadvantages without sacrificing performance, we propose SpaceByte, a novel byte-level decoder architecture that closes the performance gap between byte-level and subword autoregressive language modeling. SpaceByte consists of a byte-level Transformer model, but with extra larger transformer blocks inserted in the middle of the layers. We find that performance is significantly improved by applying these larger blocks only after certain bytes, such as space characters, which typically denote word boundaries. Our experiments show that for a fixed training and inference compute budget, SpaceByte outperforms other byte-level architectures and roughly matches the performance of tokenized Transformer architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filippo Maria Bianchi, Daniele Grattarola, Lorenzo Livi, Cesare Alippi</p>
<p>Abstract: In graph neural networks (GNNs), pooling operators compute local summaries of input graphs to capture their global properties, and they are fundamental for building deep GNNs that learn hierarchical representations. In this work, we propose the Node Decimation Pooling (NDP), a pooling operator for GNNs that generates coarser graphs while preserving the overall graph topology. During training, the GNN learns new node representations and fits them to a pyramid of coarsened graphs, which is computed offline in a pre-processing stage. NDP consists of three steps. First, a node decimation procedure selects the nodes belonging to one side of the partition identified by a spectral algorithm that approximates the \maxcut{} solution. Afterwards, the selected nodes are connected with Kron reduction to form the coarsened graph. Finally, since the resulting graph is very dense, we apply a sparsification procedure that prunes the adjacency matrix of the coarsened graph to reduce the computational cost in the GNN. Notably, we show that it is possible to remove many edges without significantly altering the graph structure. Experimental results show that NDP is more efficient compared to state-of-the-art graph pooling operators while reaching, at the same time, competitive performance on a significant variety of graph classification tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider a variant of online binary classification where a learner sequentially assigns labels ($0$ or $1$) to items with unknown true class. If, but only if, the learner chooses label $1$ they immediately observe the true label of the item. The learner faces a trade-off between short-term classification accuracy and long-term information gain. This problem has previously been studied under the name of the `apple tasting' problem. We revisit this problem as a partial monitoring problem with side information, and focus on the case where item features are linked to true classes via a logistic regression model. Our principal contribution is a study of the performance of Thompson Sampling (TS) for this problem. Using recently developed information-theoretic tools, we show that TS achieves a Bayesian regret bound of an improved order to previous approaches. Further, we experimentally verify that efficient approximations to TS and Information Directed Sampling via P\'{o}lya-Gamma augmentation have superior empirical performance to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shachi Deshpande, Charles Marx, Volodymyr Kuleshov</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate uncertainty estimates are important in sequential model-based decision-making tasks such as Bayesian optimization. However, these estimates can be imperfect if the data violates assumptions made by the model (e.g., Gaussianity). This paper studies which uncertainties are needed in model-based decision-making and in Bayesian optimization, and argues that uncertainties can benefit from calibration -- i.e., an 80% predictive interval should contain the true outcome 80% of the time. Maintaining calibration, however, can be challenging when the data is non-stationary and depends on our actions. We propose using simple algorithms based on online learning to provably maintain calibration on non-i.i.d. data, and we show how to integrate these algorithms in Bayesian optimization with minimal overhead. Empirically, we find that calibrated Bayesian optimization converges to better optima in fewer steps, and we demonstrate improved performance on standard benchmark functions and hyperparameter optimization tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chandra Sekhar Mukherjee, Nikhil Doerkar, Jiapeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most fundamental tools in machine learning with broad use as a dimensionality reduction and denoising tool. In the later setting, while PCA is known to be effective at subspace recovery and is proven to aid clustering algorithms in some specific settings, its improvement of noisy data is still not well quantified in general.
  In this paper, we propose a novel metric called \emph{compression ratio} to capture the effect of PCA on high-dimensional noisy data. We show that, for data with \emph{underlying community structure}, PCA significantly reduces the distance of data points belonging to the same community while reducing inter-community distance relatively mildly. We explain this phenomenon through both theoretical proofs and experiments on real-world data.
  Building on this new metric, we design a straightforward algorithm that could be used to detect outliers. Roughly speaking, we argue that points that have a \emph{lower variance of compression ratio} do not share a \emph{common signal} with others (hence could be considered outliers).
  We provide theoretical justification for this simple outlier detection algorithm and use simulations to demonstrate that our method is competitive with popular outlier detection tools. Finally, we run experiments on real-world high-dimension noisy data (single-cell RNA-seq) to show that removing points from these datasets via our outlier detection method improves the accuracy of clustering algorithms. Our method is very competitive with popular outlier detection tools in this task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Zhao, Yantao Shen, Yuanjun Xiong, Shuo Yang, Wei Xia, Zhuowen Tu, Bernt Schiele, Stefano Soatto</p>
<p>Abstract: Negative flips are errors introduced in a classification system when a legacy model is updated. Existing methods to reduce the negative flip rate (NFR) either do so at the expense of overall accuracy by forcing a new model to imitate the old models, or use ensembles, which multiply inference cost prohibitively. We analyze the role of ensembles in reducing NFR and observe that they remove negative flips that are typically not close to the decision boundary, but often exhibit large deviations in the distance among their logits. Based on the observation, we present a method, called Ensemble Logit Difference Inhibition (ELODI), to train a classification system that achieves paragon performance in both error rate and NFR, at the inference cost of a single model. The method distills a homogeneous ensemble to a single student model which is used to update the classification system. ELODI also introduces a generalized distillation objective, Logit Difference Inhibition (LDI), which only penalizes the logit difference of a subset of classes with the highest logit values. On multiple image classification benchmarks, model updates with ELODI demonstrate superior accuracy retention and NFR reduction.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the decentralized online regularized linear regression algorithm over random time-varying graphs. At each time step, every node runs an online estimation algorithm consisting of an innovation term processing its own new measurement, a consensus term taking a weighted sum of estimations of its own and its neighbors with additive and multiplicative communication noises and a regularization term preventing over-fitting. It is not required that the regression matrices and graphs satisfy special statistical assumptions such as mutual independence, spatio-temporal independence or stationarity. We develop the nonnegative supermartingale inequality of the estimation error, and prove that the estimations of all nodes converge to the unknown true parameter vector almost surely if the algorithm gains, graphs and regression matrices jointly satisfy the sample path spatio-temporal persistence of excitation condition. Especially, this condition holds by choosing appropriate algorithm gains if the graphs are uniformly conditionally jointly connected and conditionally balanced, and the regression models of all nodes are uniformly conditionally spatio-temporally jointly observable, under which the algorithm converges in mean square and almost surely. In addition, we prove that the regret upper bound is $O(T^{1-\tau}\ln T)$, where $\tau\in (0.5,1)$ is a constant depending on the algorithm gains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Margarita Vinaroz, Mi Jung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Data distillation aims to generate a small data set that closely mimics the performance of a given learning algorithm on the original data set. The distilled dataset is hence useful to simplify the training process thanks to its small data size. However, distilled data samples are not necessarily privacy-preserving, even if they are generally humanly indiscernible. To address this limitation, we introduce differentially private kernel inducing points (DP-KIP) for privacy-preserving data distillation. Unlike our original intention to simply apply DP-SGD to the framework of KIP, we find that KIP using infinitely-wide convolutional neural tangent kernels (conv-NTKs) performs better compared to KIP using fully-connected NTKs. However, KIP with conv-NTKs, due to its convolutional and pooling operations, introduces an unbearable computational complexity, requiring hundreds of V100 GPUs in parallel to train, which is impractical and more importantly, such computational resources are inaccessible to many. To overcome this issue, we propose an alternative that does not require pre-training (to avoid a privacy loss) and can well capture complex information on images, as those features from conv-NKTs do, while the computational cost is manageable by a single V100 GPU. To this end, we propose DP-KIP-ScatterNet, which uses the wavelet features from Scattering networks (ScatterNet) instead of those from conv-NTKs, to perform DP-KIP at a reasonable computational cost. We implement DP-KIP-ScatterNet in -- computationally efficient -- JAX and test on several popular image datasets to show its efficacy and its superior performance compared to state-of-the art methods in image data distillation with differential privacy guarantees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yikun Bai, Ivan Medri, Rocio Diaz Martin, Rana Muhammad Shahroz Khan, Soheil Kolouri</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) has gained popularity due to its various applications in fields such as machine learning, statistics, and signal processing. However, the balanced mass requirement limits its performance in practical problems. To address these limitations, variants of the OT problem, including unbalanced OT, Optimal partial transport (OPT), and Hellinger Kantorovich (HK), have been proposed. In this paper, we propose the Linear optimal partial transport (LOPT) embedding, which extends the (local) linearization technique on OT and HK to the OPT problem. The proposed embedding allows for faster computation of OPT distance between pairs of positive measures. Besides our theoretical contributions, we demonstrate the LOPT embedding technique in point-cloud interpolation and PCA analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Utsav Singh, Vinay P. Namboodiri</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is a promising approach that uses temporal abstraction to solve complex long horizon problems. However, simultaneously learning a hierarchy of policies is unstable as it is challenging to train higher-level policy when the lower-level primitive is non-stationary. In this paper, we present CRISP, a novel HRL algorithm that effectively generates a curriculum of achievable subgoals for evolving lower-level primitives using reinforcement learning and imitation learning. CRISP uses the lower level primitive to periodically perform data relabeling on a handful of expert demonstrations, using a novel primitive informed parsing (PIP) approach, thereby mitigating non-stationarity. Since our approach only assumes access to a handful of expert demonstrations, it is suitable for most robotic control tasks. Experimental evaluations on complex robotic maze navigation and robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that inducing hierarchical curriculum learning significantly improves sample efficiency, and results in efficient goal conditioned policies for solving temporally extended tasks. Additionally, we perform real world robotic experiments on complex manipulation tasks and demonstrate that CRISP demonstrates impressive generalization in real world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arvindh Arun, Aakash Aanegola, Amul Agrawal, Ramasuri Narayanam, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Representation Learning on graphs is gaining traction due to the increasing abundance of unlabelled network data and the compactness, richness, and usefulness of the representations generated. In this context, the need to consider fairness and bias constraints while generating the representations has been well-motivated and studied to some extent in prior works. One major limitation of most of the prior works in this setting is that they do not aim to address the bias generated due to connectivity patterns in the graphs, such as varied node centrality, which leads to a disproportionate performance across nodes. In our work, we aim to address this issue of mitigating bias due to inherent graph structure in an unsupervised setting. To this end, we propose CAFIN, a centrality-aware fairness-inducing framework that leverages the structural information of graphs to tune the representations generated by existing frameworks. We deploy it on GraphSAGE (a popular framework in this domain) and showcase its efficacy on two downstream tasks - Node Classification and Link Prediction. Empirically, CAFIN consistently reduces the performance disparity across popular datasets (varying from 18 to 80% reduction in performance disparity) from various domains while incurring only a minimal cost of fairness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyuan Zhang, Yanan Zhu, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) suffer from severe inefficiency. It is mainly caused by the exponential growth of node dependency with the increase of layers. It extremely limits the application of stochastic optimization algorithms so that the training of GNN is usually time-consuming. To address this problem, we propose to decouple a multi-layer GNN as multiple simple modules for more efficient training, which is comprised of classical forward training (FT)and designed backward training (BT). Under the proposed framework, each module can be trained efficiently in FT by stochastic algorithms without distortion of graph information owing to its simplicity. To avoid the only unidirectional information delivery of FT and sufficiently train shallow modules with the deeper ones, we develop a backward training mechanism that makes the former modules perceive the latter modules. The backward training introduces the reversed information delivery into the decoupled modules as well as the forward information delivery. To investigate how the decoupling and greedy training affect the representational capacity, we theoretically prove that the error produced by linear modules will not accumulate on unsupervised tasks in most cases. The theoretical and experimental results show that the proposed framework is highly efficient with reasonable performance.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13804">OER: Offline Experience Replay for Continual Offline Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sibo Gai, Donglin Wang, Li He</p>
<p>Abstract: The capability of continuously learning new skills via a sequence of pre-collected offline datasets is desired for an agent. However, consecutively learning a sequence of offline tasks likely leads to the catastrophic forgetting issue under resource-limited scenarios. In this paper, we formulate a new setting, continual offline reinforcement learning (CORL), where an agent learns a sequence of offline reinforcement learning tasks and pursues good performance on all learned tasks with a small replay buffer without exploring any of the environments of all the sequential tasks. For consistently learning on all sequential tasks, an agent requires acquiring new knowledge and meanwhile preserving old knowledge in an offline manner. To this end, we introduced continual learning algorithms and experimentally found experience replay (ER) to be the most suitable algorithm for the CORL problem. However, we observe that introducing ER into CORL encounters a new distribution shift problem: the mismatch between the experiences in the replay buffer and trajectories from the learned policy. To address such an issue, we propose a new model-based experience selection (MBES) scheme to build the replay buffer, where a transition model is learned to approximate the state distribution. This model is used to bridge the distribution bias between the replay buffer and the learned model by filtering the data from offline data that most closely resembles the learned model for storage. Moreover, in order to enhance the ability on learning new tasks, we retrofit the experience replay method with a new dual behavior cloning (DBC) architecture to avoid the disturbance of behavior-cloning loss on the Q-learning process. In general, we call our algorithm offline experience replay (OER). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our OER method outperforms SOTA baselines in widely-used Mujoco environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengchao Chen, Guodong Long, Tao Shen, Jing Jiang, Chengqi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: On-device intelligence for weather forecasting uses local deep learning models to analyze weather patterns without centralized cloud computing, holds significance for supporting human activates. Federated Learning is a promising solution for such forecasting by enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw data. However, it faces three main challenges that hinder its reliability: (1) data heterogeneity among devices due to geographic differences; (2) data homogeneity within individual devices and (3) communication overload from sending large model parameters for collaboration. To address these challenges, this paper propose Federated Prompt Learning for Weather Foundation Models on Devices (FedPoD), which enables devices to obtain highly customized models while maintaining communication efficiency. Concretely, our Adaptive Prompt Tuning leverages lightweight prompts guide frozen foundation model to generate more precise predictions, also conducts prompt-based multi-level communication to encourage multi-source knowledge fusion and regulate optimization. Additionally, Dynamic Graph Modeling constructs graphs from prompts, prioritizing collaborative training among devices with similar data distributions to against heterogeneity. Extensive experiments demonstrates FedPoD leads the performance among state-of-the-art baselines across various setting in real-world on-device weather forecasting datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hussein Mozannar, Yuria Utsumi, Irene Y. Chen, Stephanie S. Gervasi, Michele Ewing, Aaron Smith-McLallen, David Sontag</p>
<p>Abstract: A high-risk pregnancy is a pregnancy complicated by factors that can adversely affect the outcomes of the mother or the infant. Health insurers use algorithms to identify members who would benefit from additional clinical support. This work presents the implementation of a real-world ML-based system to assist care managers in identifying pregnant patients at risk of complications. In this retrospective evaluation study, we developed a novel hybrid-ML classifier to predict whether patients are pregnant and trained a standard classifier using claims data from a health insurance company in the US to predict whether a patient will develop pregnancy complications. These models were developed in cooperation with the care management team and integrated into a user interface with explanations for the nurses. The proposed models outperformed commonly used claim codes for the identification of pregnant patients at the expense of a manageable false positive rate. Our risk complication classifier shows that we can accurately triage patients by risk of complication. Our approach and evaluation are guided by human-centric design. In user studies with the nurses, they preferred the proposed models over existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muyang He, Shuo Yang, Tiejun Huang, Bo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: The state of the art of many learning tasks, e.g., image classification, is advanced by collecting larger datasets and then training larger models on them. As the outcome, the increasing computational cost is becoming unaffordable. In this paper, we investigate how to prune the large-scale datasets, and thus produce an informative subset for training sophisticated deep models with negligible performance drop. We propose a simple yet effective dataset pruning method by exploring both the prediction uncertainty and training dynamics. We study dataset pruning by measuring the variation of predictions during the whole training process on large-scale datasets, i.e., ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K, and advanced models, i.e., Swin Transformer and ConvNeXt. Extensive experimental results indicate that our method outperforms the state of the art and achieves 25% lossless pruning ratio on both ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K.

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel modeling approach for time series imputation and forecasting, tailored to address the challenges often encountered in real-world data, such as irregular samples, missing data, or unaligned measurements from multiple sensors. Our method relies on a continuous-time-dependent model of the series' evolution dynamics. It leverages adaptations of conditional, implicit neural representations for sequential data. A modulation mechanism, driven by a meta-learning algorithm, allows adaptation to unseen samples and extrapolation beyond observed time-windows for long-term predictions. The model provides a highly flexible and unified framework for imputation and forecasting tasks across a wide range of challenging scenarios. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on classical benchmarks and outperforms alternative time-continuous models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Utsav Singh, Vinay P. Namboodiri</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) has the potential to solve complex long horizon tasks using temporal abstraction and increased exploration. However, hierarchical agents are difficult to train due to inherent non-stationarity. We present primitive enabled adaptive relabeling (PEAR), a two-phase approach where we first perform adaptive relabeling on a few expert demonstrations to generate efficient subgoal supervision, and then jointly optimize HRL agents by employing reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL). We perform theoretical analysis to $(i)$ bound the sub-optimality of our approach, and $(ii)$ derive a generalized plug-and-play framework for joint optimization using RL and IL. Since PEAR utilizes only a handful of expert demonstrations and considers minimal limiting assumptions on the task structure, it can be easily integrated with typical off-policy RL algorithms to produce a practical HRL approach. We perform extensive experiments on challenging environments and show that PEAR is able to outperform various hierarchical and non-hierarchical baselines on complex tasks that require long term decision making. We also perform ablations to thoroughly analyse the importance of our various design choices. Finally, we perform real world robotic experiments on complex tasks and demonstrate that PEAR consistently outperforms the baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berivan Isik, Francesco Pase, Deniz Gunduz, Sanmi Koyejo, Tsachy Weissman, Michele Zorzi</p>
<p>Abstract: The high communication cost of sending model updates from the clients to the server is a significant bottleneck for scalable federated learning (FL). Among existing approaches, state-of-the-art bitrate-accuracy tradeoffs have been achieved using stochastic compression methods -- in which the client $n$ sends a sample from a client-only probability distribution $q_{\phi^{(n)}}$, and the server estimates the mean of the clients' distributions using these samples. However, such methods do not take full advantage of the FL setup where the server, throughout the training process, has side information in the form of a global distribution $p_{\theta}$ that is close to the clients' distribution $q_{\phi^{(n)}}$ in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. In this work, we exploit this closeness between the clients' distributions $q_{\phi^{(n)}}$'s and the side information $p_{\theta}$ at the server, and propose a framework that requires approximately $D_{KL}(q_{\phi^{(n)}}|| p_{\theta})$ bits of communication. We show that our method can be integrated into many existing stochastic compression frameworks to attain the same (and often higher) test accuracy with up to $82$ times smaller bitrate than the prior work -- corresponding to 2,650 times overall compression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaocheng Li, Shang Liu, Chunlin Sun, Hanzhao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning with rejection has been a prototypical model for studying the human-AI interaction on prediction tasks. Upon the arrival of a sample instance, the model first uses a rejector to decide whether to accept and use the AI predictor to make a prediction or reject and defer the sample to humans. Learning such a model changes the structure of the original loss function and often results in undesirable non-convexity and inconsistency issues. For the classification with rejection problem, several works develop consistent surrogate losses for the joint learning of the predictor and the rejector, while there have been fewer works for the regression counterpart. This paper studies the regression with rejection (RwR) problem and investigates a no-rejection learning strategy that uses all the data to learn the predictor. We first establish the consistency for such a strategy under the weak realizability condition. Then for the case without the weak realizability, we show that the excessive risk can also be upper bounded with the sum of two parts: prediction error and calibration error. Lastly, we demonstrate the advantage of such a proposed learning strategy with empirical evidence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abraham Gale, Am\'elie Marian</p>
<p>Abstract: Ranking functions that are used in decision systems often produce disparate results for different populations because of bias in the underlying data. Addressing, and compensating for, these disparate outcomes is a critical problem for fair decision-making. Recent compensatory measures have mostly focused on opaque transformations of the ranking functions to satisfy fairness guarantees or on the use of quotas or set-asides to guarantee a minimum number of positive outcomes to members of underrepresented groups. In this paper we propose easily explainable data-driven compensatory measures for ranking functions. Our measures rely on the generation of bonus points given to members of underrepresented groups to address disparity in the ranking function. The bonus points can be set in advance, and can be combined, allowing for considering the intersections of representations and giving better transparency to stakeholders. We propose efficient sampling-based algorithms to calculate the number of bonus points to minimize disparity. We validate our algorithms using real-world school admissions and recidivism datasets, and compare our results with that of existing fair ranking algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huy Mai, Xintao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Under missing-not-at-random (MNAR) sample selection bias, the performance of a prediction model is often degraded. This paper focuses on one classic instance of MNAR sample selection bias where a subset of samples have non-randomly missing outcomes. The Heckman selection model and its variants have commonly been used to handle this type of sample selection bias. The Heckman model uses two separate equations to model the prediction and selection of samples, where the selection features include all prediction features. When using the Heckman model, the prediction features must be properly chosen from the set of selection features. However, choosing the proper prediction features is a challenging task for the Heckman model. This is especially the case when the number of selection features is large. Existing approaches that use the Heckman model often provide a manually chosen set of prediction features. In this paper, we propose Heckman-FA as a novel data-driven framework for obtaining prediction features for the Heckman model. Heckman-FA first trains an assignment function that determines whether or not a selection feature is assigned as a prediction feature. Using the parameters of the trained function, the framework extracts a suitable set of prediction features based on the goodness-of-fit of the prediction model given the chosen prediction features and the correlation between noise terms of the prediction and selection equations. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that Heckman-FA produces a robust regression model under MNAR sample selection bias.</p>

Our proposed unified framework categorizes the extensive GDA literature, revealing gaps such as the lack of universal benchmarks. The thesis summarises promising research directions, including , effective data selection, theoretical development for large-scale models' application in GDA and establishing a benchmark for GDA.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Da Long, Wei W. Xing, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan, Robert M. Kirby, Shandian Zhe, Michael W. Mahoney</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering governing equations from data is important to many scientific and engineering applications. Despite promising successes, existing methods are still challenged by data sparsity and noise issues, both of which are ubiquitous in practice. Moreover, state-of-the-art methods lack uncertainty quantification and/or are costly in training. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel equation discovery method based on Kernel learning and BAyesian Spike-and-Slab priors (KBASS). We use kernel regression to estimate the target function, which is flexible, expressive, and more robust to data sparsity and noises. We combine it with a Bayesian spike-and-slab prior -- an ideal Bayesian sparse distribution -- for effective operator selection and uncertainty quantification. We develop an expectation-propagation expectation-maximization (EP-EM) algorithm for efficient posterior inference and function estimation. To overcome the computational challenge of kernel regression, we place the function values on a mesh and induce a Kronecker product construction, and we use tensor algebra to enable efficient computation and optimization. We show the advantages of KBASS on a list of benchmark ODE and PDE discovery tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fusion is a technique for merging multiple independently-trained neural networks in order to combine their capabilities. Past attempts have been restricted to the case of fully-connected, convolutional, and residual networks. This paper presents a systematic approach for fusing two or more transformer-based networks exploiting Optimal Transport to (soft-)align the various architectural components. We flesh out an abstraction for layer alignment, that can generalize to arbitrary architectures - in principle - and we apply this to the key ingredients of Transformers such as multi-head self-attention, layer-normalization, and residual connections, and we discuss how to handle them via various ablation studies. Furthermore, our method allows the fusion of models of different sizes (heterogeneous fusion), providing a new and efficient way to compress Transformers. The proposed approach is evaluated on both image classification tasks via Vision Transformer and natural language modeling tasks using BERT. Our approach consistently outperforms vanilla fusion, and, after a surprisingly short finetuning, also outperforms the individual converged parent models. In our analysis, we uncover intriguing insights about the significant role of soft alignment in the case of Transformers. Our results showcase the potential of fusing multiple Transformers, thus compounding their expertise, in the budding paradigm of model fusion and recombination.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulan Hu, Zhirui Yang, Sheng Ouyang, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown significant potential and has garnered increasing interest in graph learning. However, particularly for generative SSL methods, its potential in Heterogeneous Graph Learning (HGL) remains relatively underexplored. Generative SSL utilizes an encoder to map the input graph into a latent representation and a decoder to recover the input graph from the latent representation. Previous HGL SSL methods generally design complex strategies to capture graph heterogeneity, which heavily rely on contrastive view construction strategies that are often non-trivial. Yet, refining the latent representation in generative SSL can effectively improve graph learning results. In this study, we propose HGVAE, a generative SSL method specially designed for HGL. Instead of focusing on designing complex strategies to capture heterogeneity, HGVAE centers on refining the latent representation. Specifically, HGVAE innovatively develops a contrastive task based on the latent representation. To ensure the hardness of negative samples, we develop a progressive negative sample generation (PNSG) mechanism that leverages the ability of Variational Inference (VI) to generate high-quality negative samples. As a pioneer in applying generative SSL for HGL, HGVAE refines the latent representation, thereby compelling the model to learn high-quality representations. Compared with various state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, HGVAE achieves impressive results, thus validating its superiority.</p>

<p>Abstract: The intersection of physics and machine learning has given rise to the physics-enhanced machine learning (PEML) paradigm, aiming to improve the capabilities and reduce the individual shortcomings of data- or physics-only methods. In this paper, the spectrum of physics-enhanced machine learning methods, expressed across the defining axes of physics and data, is discussed by engaging in a comprehensive exploration of its characteristics, usage, and motivations. In doing so, we present a survey of recent applications and developments of PEML techniques, revealing the potency of PEML in addressing complex challenges. We further demonstrate application of select such schemes on the simple working example of a single degree-of-freedom Duffing oscillator, which allows to highlight the individual characteristics and motivations of different `genres' of PEML approaches. To promote collaboration and transparency, and to provide practical examples for the reader, the code generating these working examples is provided alongside this paper. As a foundational contribution, this paper underscores the significance of PEML in pushing the boundaries of scientific and engineering research, underpinned by the synergy of physical insights and machine learning capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Leveraging Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNNs), ICNN-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) successfully attains globally optimal solutions by upholding convexity within the MPC framework. However, current ICNN architectures encounter the issue of exploding gradients, which limits their ability to serve as deep neural networks for complex tasks. Additionally, the current neural network-based MPC, including conventional neural network-based MPC and ICNN-based MPC, faces slower convergence speed when compared to MPC based on first-principles models. In this study, we leverage the principles of ICNNs to propose a novel Input Convex LSTM for MPC, with the specific goals of mitigating the exploding gradient problems in current ICNNs and reducing convergence time for NN-based MPC. From a simulation study of a nonlinear chemical reactor, we observed a reduction in convergence time, with a percentage decrease of 46.7%, 31.3%, and 20.2% compared to baseline plain RNN, plain LSTM, and Input Convex RNN, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bijan Mazaheri, Spencer Gordon, Yuval Rabani, Leonard Schulman</p>
<p>Abstract: An acyclic causal structure can be described using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with arrows indicating causation. The task of learning these structures from data is known as ``causal discovery''. Diverse populations or changing environments can sometimes give rise to heterogeneous data. This heterogeneity can be thought of as a mixture model with multiple ``sources'', each exerting their own distinct signature on the observed variables. From this perspective, the source is a latent common cause for every observed variable. While some methods for causal discovery are able to work around unobserved confounding in special cases, the only known ways to deal with a global confounder (such as a latent class) involve parametric assumptions. These assumptions are restrictive, especially for discrete variables. By focusing on discrete observables, we demonstrate that globally confounded causal structures can still be identifiable without parametric assumptions, so long as the number of latent classes remains small relative to the size and sparsity of the underlying DAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyuan Luo, Juntong Ni, Shengyu Chen, Runlong Yu, Yiqun Xie, Licheng Liu, Zhenong Jin, Huaxiu Yao, Xiaowei Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling environmental ecosystems is critical for the sustainability of our planet, but is extremely challenging due to the complex underlying processes driven by interactions amongst a large number of physical variables. As many variables are difficult to measure at large scales, existing works often utilize a combination of observable features and locally available measurements or modeled values as input to build models for a specific study region and time period. This raises a fundamental question in advancing the modeling of environmental ecosystems: how to build a general framework for modeling the complex relationships amongst various environmental data over space and time? In this paper, we introduce a new framework, FREE, which maps available environmental data into a text space and then converts the traditional predictive modeling task in environmental science to the semantic recognition problem. The proposed FREE framework leverages recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to supplement the original input features with natural language descriptions. This facilitates capturing the data semantics and also allows harnessing the irregularities of input features. When used for long-term prediction, FREE has the flexibility to incorporate newly collected observations to enhance future prediction. The efficacy of FREE is evaluated in the context of two societally important real-world applications, predicting stream water temperature in the Delaware River Basin and predicting annual corn yield in Illinois and Iowa. Beyond the superior predictive performance over multiple baseline methods, FREE is shown to be more data- and computation-efficient as it can be pre-trained on simulated data generated by physics-based models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefano Bruno, Ying Zhang, Dong-Young Lim, \"Omer Deniz Akyildiz, Sotirios Sabanis</p>
<p>Abstract: We provide full theoretical guarantees for the convergence behaviour of diffusion-based generative models under the assumption of strongly log-concave data distributions while our approximating class of functions used for score estimation is made of Lipschitz continuous functions. We demonstrate via a motivating example, sampling from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean, the powerfulness of our approach. In this case, explicit estimates are provided for the associated optimization problem, i.e. score approximation, while these are combined with the corresponding sampling estimates. As a result, we obtain the best known upper bound estimates in terms of key quantities of interest, such as the dimension and rates of convergence, for the Wasserstein-2 distance between the data distribution (Gaussian with unknown mean) and our sampling algorithm.
  Beyond the motivating example and in order to allow for the use of a diverse range of stochastic optimizers, we present our results using an $L^2$-accurate score estimation assumption, which crucially is formed under an expectation with respect to the stochastic optimizer and our novel auxiliary process that uses only known information. This approach yields the best known convergence rate for our sampling algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haojian Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: As an important clean and renewable kind of energy, wind power plays an important role in coping with energy crisis and environmental pollution. However, the volatility and intermittency of wind speed restrict the development of wind power. To improve the utilization of wind power, this study proposes a new wind speed prediction model based on data noise reduction technology, temporal convolutional network (TCN), and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Firstly, an adaptive data noise reduction algorithm P-SSA is proposed based on singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and Pearson correlation coefficient. The original wind speed is decomposed into multiple subsequences by SSA and then reconstructed. When the Pearson correlation coefficient between the reconstructed sequence and the original sequence is greater than 0.99, other noise subsequences are deleted to complete the data denoising. Then, the receptive field of the samples is expanded through the causal convolution and dilated convolution of TCN, and the characteristics of wind speed change are extracted. Then, the time feature information of the sequence is extracted by GRU, and then the wind speed is predicted to form the wind speed sequence prediction model of P-SSA-TCN-GRU. The proposed model was validated on three wind farms in Shandong Province. The experimental results show that the prediction performance of the proposed model is better than that of the traditional model and other models based on TCN, and the wind speed prediction of wind farms with high precision and strong stability is realized. The wind speed predictions of this model have the potential to become the data that support the operation and management of wind farms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qipan Xu, Youlong Ding, Xinxi Zhang, Jie Gao, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data privacy protection is garnering increased attention among researchers. Diffusion models (DMs), particularly with strict differential privacy, can potentially produce images with both high privacy and visual quality. However, challenges arise such as in ensuring robust protection in privatizing specific data attributes, areas where current models often fall short. To address these challenges, we introduce the PAC Privacy Preserving Diffusion Model, a model leverages diffusion principles and ensure Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) privacy. We enhance privacy protection by integrating a private classifier guidance into the Langevin Sampling Process. Additionally, recognizing the gap in measuring the privacy of models, we have developed a novel metric to gauge privacy levels. Our model, assessed with this new metric and supported by Gaussian matrix computations for the PAC bound, has shown superior performance in privacy protection over existing leading private generative models according to benchmark tests.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sidhika Balachandar, Nikhil Garg, Emma Pierson</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models are often trained to predict the outcome resulting from a human decision. For example, if a doctor decides to test a patient for disease, will the patient test positive? A challenge is that historical decision-making determines whether the outcome is observed: we only observe test outcomes for patients doctors historically tested. Untested patients, for whom outcomes are unobserved, may differ from tested patients along observed and unobserved dimensions. We propose a Bayesian model class which captures this setting. The purpose of the model is to accurately estimate risk for both tested and untested patients. Estimating this model is challenging due to the wide range of possibilities for untested patients. To address this, we propose two domain constraints which are plausible in health settings: a prevalence constraint, where the overall disease prevalence is known, and an expertise constraint, where the human decision-maker deviates from purely risk-based decision-making only along a constrained feature set. We show theoretically and on synthetic data that domain constraints improve parameter inference. We apply our model to a case study of cancer risk prediction, showing that the model's inferred risk predicts cancer diagnoses, its inferred testing policy captures known public health policies, and it can identify suboptimalities in test allocation. Though our case study is in healthcare, our analysis reveals a general class of domain constraints which can improve model estimation in many settings.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04865">StructComp: Substituting propagation with Structural Compression in Training Graph Contrastive Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengzhong Zhang, Wenjie Yang, Xinyuan Cao, Hongwei Zhang, Zengfeng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has become a powerful tool for learning graph data, but its scalability remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective training framework called Structural Compression (StructComp) to address this issue. Inspired by a sparse low-rank approximation on the diffusion matrix, StructComp trains the encoder with the compressed nodes. This allows the encoder not to perform any message passing during the training stage, and significantly reduces the number of sample pairs in the contrastive loss. We theoretically prove that the original GCL loss can be approximated with the contrastive loss computed by StructComp. Moreover, StructComp can be regarded as an additional regularization term for GCL models, resulting in a more robust encoder. Empirical studies on various datasets show that StructComp greatly reduces the time and memory consumption while improving model performance compared to the vanilla GCL models and scalable training methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many neural network architectures are known to be Turing Complete, and can thus, in principle implement arbitrary algorithms. However, Transformers are unique in that they can implement gradient-based learning algorithms under simple parameter configurations. This paper provides theoretical and empirical evidence that (non-linear) Transformers naturally learn to implement gradient descent in function space, which in turn enable them to learn non-linear functions in context. Our results apply to a broad class of combinations of non-linear architectures and non-linear in-context learning tasks. Additionally, we show that the optimal choice of non-linear activation depends in a natural way on the class of functions that need to be learned.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierfrancesco Beneventano</p>
<p>Abstract: This article examines the implicit regularization effect of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We consider the case of SGD without replacement, the variant typically used to optimize large-scale neural networks. We analyze this algorithm in a more realistic regime than typically considered in theoretical works on SGD, as, e.g., we allow the product of the learning rate and Hessian to be $O(1)$ and we do not specify any model architecture, learning task, or loss (objective) function. Our core theoretical result is that optimizing with SGD without replacement is locally equivalent to making an additional step on a novel regularizer. This implies that the expected trajectories of SGD without replacement can be decoupled in (i) following SGD with replacement (in which batches are sampled i.i.d.) along the directions of high curvature, and (ii) regularizing the trace of the noise covariance along the flat ones. As a consequence, SGD without replacement travels flat areas and may escape saddles significantly faster than SGD with replacement. On several vision tasks, the novel regularizer penalizes a weighted trace of the Fisher Matrix, thus encouraging sparsity in the spectrum of the Hessian of the loss in line with empirical observations from prior work. We also propose an explanation for why SGD does not train at the edge of stability (as opposed to GD).</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16313">Unraveling the Key Components of OOD Generalization via Diversification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Harold Benoit, Liangze Jiang, Andrei Atanov, O\u{g}uzhan Fatih Kar, Mattia Rigotti, Amir Zamir</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised learning datasets may contain multiple cues that explain the training set equally well, i.e., learning any of them would lead to the correct predictions on the training data. However, many of them can be spurious, i.e., lose their predictive power under a distribution shift and consequently fail to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Recently developed "diversification" methods (Lee et al., 2023; Pagliardini et al., 2023) approach this problem by finding multiple diverse hypotheses that rely on different features. This paper aims to study this class of methods and identify the key components contributing to their OOD generalization abilities.
  We show that (1) diversification methods are highly sensitive to the distribution of the unlabeled data used for diversification and can underperform significantly when away from a method-specific sweet spot. (2) Diversification alone is insufficient for OOD generalization. The choice of the used learning algorithm, e.g., the model's architecture and pretraining, is crucial. In standard experiments (classification on Waterbirds and Office-Home datasets), using the second-best choice leads to an up to 20\% absolute drop in accuracy. (3) The optimal choice of learning algorithm depends on the unlabeled data and vice versa i.e. they are co-dependent. (4) Finally, we show that, in practice, the above pitfalls cannot be alleviated by increasing the number of diverse hypotheses, the major feature of diversification methods.
  These findings provide a clearer understanding of the critical design factors influencing the OOD generalization abilities of diversification methods. They can guide practitioners in how to use the existing methods best and guide researchers in developing new, better ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Can Xu, Haosen Wang, Weigang Wang, Pengfei Zheng, Hongyang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Denoising diffusion models have shown great potential in multiple research areas. Existing diffusion-based generative methods on de novo 3D molecule generation face two major challenges. Since majority heavy atoms in molecules allow connections to multiple atoms through single bonds, solely using pair-wise distance to model molecule geometries is insufficient. Therefore, the first one involves proposing an effective neural network as the denoising kernel that is capable to capture complex multi-body interatomic relationships and learn high-quality features. Due to the discrete nature of graphs, mainstream diffusion-based methods for molecules heavily rely on predefined rules and generate edges in an indirect manner. The second challenge involves accommodating molecule generation to diffusion and accurately predicting the existence of bonds. In our research, we view the iterative way of updating molecule conformations in diffusion process is consistent with molecular dynamics and introduce a novel molecule generation method named Geometric-Facilitated Molecular Diffusion (GFMDiff). For the first challenge, we introduce a Dual-Track Transformer Network (DTN) to fully excevate global spatial relationships and learn high quality representations which contribute to accurate predictions of features and geometries. As for the second challenge, we design Geometric-Facilitated Loss (GFLoss) which intervenes the formation of bonds during the training period, instead of directly embedding edges into the latent space. Comprehensive experiments on current benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of GFMDiff.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a nonparametric method for outlier detection that takes full account of local variations in intrinsic dimensionality within the dataset. Using the theory of Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID), our 'dimensionality-aware' outlier detection method, DAO, is derived as an estimator of an asymptotic local expected density ratio involving the query point and a close neighbor drawn at random. The dimensionality-aware behavior of DAO is due to its use of local estimation of LID values in a theoretically-justified way. Through comprehensive experimentation on more than 800 synthetic and real datasets, we show that DAO significantly outperforms three popular and important benchmark outlier detection methods: Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Simplified LOF, and kNN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianwei Ni, Benjamin Eysenbach, Erfan Seyedsalehi, Michel Ma, Clement Gehring, Aditya Mahajan, Pierre-Luc Bacon</p>
<p>Abstract: Representations are at the core of all deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods for both Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Many representation learning methods and theoretical frameworks have been developed to understand what constitutes an effective representation. However, the relationships between these methods and the shared properties among them remain unclear. In this paper, we show that many of these seemingly distinct methods and frameworks for state and history abstractions are, in fact, based on a common idea of self-predictive abstraction. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights into the widely adopted objectives and optimization, such as the stop-gradient technique, in learning self-predictive representations. These findings together yield a minimalist algorithm to learn self-predictive representations for states and histories. We validate our theories by applying our algorithm to standard MDPs, MDPs with distractors, and POMDPs with sparse rewards. These findings culminate in a set of preliminary guidelines for RL practitioners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neharika Jali, Guannan Qu, Weina Wang, Gauri Joshi</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of efficiently routing jobs that arrive into a central queue to a system of heterogeneous servers. Unlike homogeneous systems, a threshold policy, that routes jobs to the slow server(s) when the queue length exceeds a certain threshold, is known to be optimal for the one-fast-one-slow two-server system. But an optimal policy for the multi-server system is unknown and non-trivial to find. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been recognized to have great potential for learning policies in such cases, our problem has an exponentially large state space size, rendering standard RL inefficient. In this work, we propose ACHQ, an efficient policy gradient based algorithm with a low dimensional soft threshold policy parameterization that leverages the underlying queueing structure. We provide stationary-point convergence guarantees for the general case and despite the low-dimensional parameterization prove that ACHQ converges to an approximate global optimum for the special case of two servers. Simulations demonstrate an improvement in expected response time of up to ~30% over the greedy policy that routes to the fastest available server.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents the first systematic study of Deep Neural Network (DNN) evaluation under stochastic assumptions, focusing on wildfire prediction. We note that current evaluation strategies emphasize a DNN's replication of observed ground truths rather than its ability to learn the underlying stochastic processes, crucial for capturing wildfire evolution's complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel evaluation criterion: Has the DNN learned the stochastic process? Using a synthetic dataset, we introduce a framework to characterize the stochastic process (generated by randomness in fire evolution rules). Through this framework, we assess an evaluation metric's capability to test if the DNN has learned the stochastic process. Our findings show that conventional metrics, including classification-based metrics and proper scoring rules, are inadequate. We identify the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) as a robust metric that tests the proposed evaluation criteria, offering asymptotic guarantees of proper scoring rules and improved interpretability through calibration curves. We extend our analysis to real-world wildfire data, highlighting the limitations of traditional evaluation methods and demonstrating the utility of ECE as a stochasticity-compatible metric alongside existing ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thiago H Silva, Daniel Silver</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban research has long recognized that neighbourhoods are dynamic and relational. However, lack of data, methodologies, and computer processing power have hampered a formal quantitative examination of neighbourhood relational dynamics. To make progress on this issue, this study proposes a graph neural network (GNN) approach that permits combining and evaluating multiple sources of information about internal characteristics of neighbourhoods, their past characteristics, and flows of groups among them, potentially providing greater expressive power in predictive models. By exploring a public large-scale dataset from Yelp, we show the potential of our approach for considering structural connectedness in predicting neighbourhood attributes, specifically to predict local culture. Results are promising from a substantive and methodologically point of view. Substantively, we find that either local area information (e.g. area demographics) or group profiles (tastes of Yelp reviewers) give the best results in predicting local culture, and they are nearly equivalent in all studied cases. Methodologically, exploring group profiles could be a helpful alternative where finding local information for specific areas is challenging, since they can be extracted automatically from many forms of online data. Thus, our approach could empower researchers and policy-makers to use a range of data sources when other local area information is lacking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghan Huang, Qiufeng Chen, Yijun Bian, Pengli Zhu, Nanguang Chen, Moo K. Chung, Anqi Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have proven effective in capturing relationships among nodes in a graph. This study introduces a novel perspective by considering a graph as a simplicial complex, encompassing nodes, edges, triangles, and $k$-simplices, enabling the definition of graph-structured data on any $k$-simplices. Our contribution is the Hodge-Laplacian heterogeneous graph attention network (HL-HGAT), designed to learn heterogeneous signal representations across $k$-simplices. The HL-HGAT incorporates three key components: HL convolutional filters (HL-filters), simplicial projection (SP), and simplicial attention pooling (SAP) operators, applied to $k$-simplices. HL-filters leverage the unique topology of $k$-simplices encoded by the Hodge-Laplacian (HL) operator, operating within the spectral domain of the $k$-th HL operator. To address computation challenges, we introduce a polynomial approximation for HL-filters, exhibiting spatial localization properties. Additionally, we propose a pooling operator to coarsen $k$-simplices, combining features through simplicial attention mechanisms of self-attention and cross-attention via transformers and SP operators, capturing topological interconnections across multiple dimensions of simplices. The HL-HGAT is comprehensively evaluated across diverse graph applications, including NP-hard problems, graph multi-label and classification challenges, and graph regression tasks in logistics, computer vision, biology, chemistry, and neuroscience. The results demonstrate the model's efficacy and versatility in handling a wide range of graph-based scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangheng Li, Junyuan Hong, Bo Li, Zhangyang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: While diffusion models have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in generating realistic images, privacy risks also arise: published models or APIs could generate training images and thus leak privacy-sensitive training information. In this paper, we reveal a new risk, Shake-to-Leak (S2L), that fine-tuning the pre-trained models with manipulated data can amplify the existing privacy risks. We demonstrate that S2L could occur in various standard fine-tuning strategies for diffusion models, including concept-injection methods (DreamBooth and Textual Inversion) and parameter-efficient methods (LoRA and Hypernetwork), as well as their combinations. In the worst case, S2L can amplify the state-of-the-art membership inference attack (MIA) on diffusion models by $5.4\%$ (absolute difference) AUC and can increase extracted private samples from almost $0$ samples to $15.8$ samples on average per target domain. This discovery underscores that the privacy risk with diffusion models is even more severe than previously recognized. Codes are available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/Shake-to-Leak.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshat Gupta, Dev Sajnani, Gopala Anumanchipalli</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a unifying framework that brings two leading "locate-and-edit" model editing techniques -- ROME and MEMIT -- under a single conceptual umbrella, optimizing for the same goal, which we call the preservation-memorization objective. ROME uses an equality constraint to perform one edit at a time, whereas MEMIT employs a more flexible least-square constraint that allows for batched edits. Following the preservation-memorization objective, we present Equality-constrained Mass Model Editing algorithm for Transformers or EMMET, a new batched memory-editing algorithm that uses a closed-form solution for the equality-constrained version of the preservation-memorization objective. EMMET is a batched-version of ROME and is able to perform batched-edits up to a batch-size of 10,000 with very similar performance to MEMIT across multiple dimensions. With EMMET, we unify and achieve symmetry within the "locate-and-edit" algorithms, allowing batched-editing using both objectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangchun Zhang, Yirui Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) stands as a cornerstone approach in imitation learning, yet it frequently faces criticisms from prior studies. In this paper, we rethink AIRL and respond to these criticisms. Criticism 1 lies in Inadequate Policy Imitation. We show that substituting the built-in algorithm with soft actor-critic (SAC) during policy updating (requires multi-iterations) significantly enhances the efficiency of policy imitation. Criticism 2 lies in Limited Performance in Transferable Reward Recovery Despite SAC Integration. While we find that SAC indeed exhibits a significant improvement in policy imitation, it introduces drawbacks to transferable reward recovery. We prove that the SAC algorithm itself is not feasible to disentangle the reward function comprehensively during the AIRL training process, and propose a hybrid framework, PPO-AIRL + SAC, for a satisfactory transfer effect. Criticism 3 lies in Unsatisfactory Proof from the Perspective of Potential Equilibrium. We reanalyze it from an algebraic theory perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Gomes, Thomas Brunschwiler</p>
<p>Abstract: As repositories of large scale data in earth observation (EO) have grown, so have transfer and storage costs for model training and inference, expending significant resources. We introduce Neural Embedding Compression (NEC), based on the transfer of compressed embeddings to data consumers instead of raw data. We adapt foundation models (FM) through learned neural compression to generate multi-task embeddings while navigating the tradeoff between compression rate and embedding utility. We update only a small fraction of the FM parameters (10%) for a short training period (1% of the iterations of pre-training). We evaluate NEC on two EO tasks: scene classification and semantic segmentation. Compared with applying traditional compression to the raw data, NEC achieves similar accuracy with a 75% to 90% reduction in data. Even at 99.7% compression, performance drops by only 5% on the scene classification task. Overall, NEC is a data-efficient yet performant approach for multi-task EO modelling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zewen Liu, Guancheng Wan, B. Aditya Prakash, Max S. Y. Lau, Wei Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in studying epidemiological models. Traditional mechanistic models mathematically describe the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases. However, they often suffer from limitations of oversimplified or fixed assumptions, which could cause sub-optimal predictive power and inefficiency in capturing complex relation information. Consequently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a progressively popular tool in epidemic research. In this paper, we endeavor to furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective, we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology, we categorize existing work into Neural Models and Hybrid Models. Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examination of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their technical details. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing methods from diverse perspectives and systematically propose future research directions. This survey aims to bridge literature gaps and promote the progression of this promising field, with a list of relevant papers at https://github.com/Emory-Melody/awesome-epidemic-modelingpapers. We hope that it will facilitate synergies between the communities of GNNs and epidemiology, and contribute to their collective progress.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Houssem Ben Braiek, Foutse Khomh</p>
<p>Abstract: This chapter explores the foundational concept of robustness in Machine Learning (ML) and its integral role in establishing trustworthiness in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. The discussion begins with a detailed definition of robustness, portraying it as the ability of ML models to maintain stable performance across varied and unexpected environmental conditions. ML robustness is dissected through several lenses: its complementarity with generalizability; its status as a requirement for trustworthy AI; its adversarial vs non-adversarial aspects; its quantitative metrics; and its indicators such as reproducibility and explainability. The chapter delves into the factors that impede robustness, such as data bias, model complexity, and the pitfalls of underspecified ML pipelines. It surveys key techniques for robustness assessment from a broad perspective, including adversarial attacks, encompassing both digital and physical realms. It covers non-adversarial data shifts and nuances of Deep Learning (DL) software testing methodologies. The discussion progresses to explore amelioration strategies for bolstering robustness, starting with data-centric approaches like debiasing and augmentation. Further examination includes a variety of model-centric methods such as transfer learning, adversarial training, and randomized smoothing. Lastly, post-training methods are discussed, including ensemble techniques, pruning, and model repairs, emerging as cost-effective strategies to make models more resilient against the unpredictable. This chapter underscores the ongoing challenges and limitations in estimating and achieving ML robustness by existing approaches. It offers insights and directions for future research on this crucial concept, as a prerequisite for trustworthy AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xusen Guo (Frank), Qiming Zhang (Frank), Junyue Jiang (Frank), Mingxing Peng (Frank),  Hao (Frank),  Yang, Meixin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. It has experienced significant advancements thanks to the power of deep learning in capturing latent patterns of traffic data. However, recent deep-learning architectures require intricate model designs and lack an intuitive understanding of the mapping from input data to predicted results. Achieving both accuracy and responsibility in traffic prediction models remains a challenge due to the complexity of traffic data and the inherent opacity of deep learning models. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Responsible and Reliable Traffic flow forecasting model with Large Language Models (R2T-LLM), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate responsible traffic predictions. By transferring multi-modal traffic data into natural language descriptions, R2T-LLM captures complex spatial-temporal patterns and external factors from comprehensive traffic data. The LLM framework is fine-tuned using language-based instructions to align with spatial-temporal traffic flow data. Empirically, R2T-LLM shows competitive accuracy compared with deep learning baselines, while providing an intuitive and reliable explanation for predictions. We discuss the spatial-temporal and input dependencies for conditional future flow forecasting, showcasing R2T-LLM's potential for diverse city prediction tasks. This paper contributes to advancing accountable traffic prediction models and lays a foundation for future exploration of LLM applications in transportation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use LLM for accountable and reliable prediction of traffic flows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihan Wang, Lujun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Obtaining reliable precipitation estimation with high resolutions in time and space is of great importance to hydrological studies. However, accurately estimating precipitation is a challenging task over high mountainous complex terrain. The three widely used precipitation measurement approaches, namely rainfall gauge, precipitation radars, and satellite-based precipitation sensors, have their own pros and cons in producing reliable precipitation products over complex areas. One way to decrease the detection error probability and improve data reliability is precipitation data merging. With the rapid advancements in computational capabilities and the escalating volume and diversity of earth observational data, Deep Learning (DL) models have gained considerable attention in geoscience. In this study, a deep learning technique, namely Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), was employed to merge a radar-based and a satellite-based Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation product Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) precipitation product at hourly scale. The merged results are compared with the widely used reanalysis precipitation product, Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS), and assessed against gauge observational data from the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC). The findings indicated that the LSTM-based merged precipitation notably underestimated gauge observations and, at times, failed to provide meaningful estimates, showing predominantly near-zero values. Relying solely on individual Quantitative Precipitation Estimates (QPEs) without additional meteorological input proved insufficient for generating reliable merged QPE. However, the merged results effectively captured the temporal trends of the observations, outperforming MRMS in this aspect. This suggested that incorporating bias correction techniques could potentially enhance the accuracy of the merged product.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chanwook Park, Sourav Saha, Jiachen Guo, Xiaoyu Xie, Satyajit Mojumder, Miguel A. Bessa, Dong Qian, Wei Chen, Gregory J. Wagner, Jian Cao, Wing Kam Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and neural network theories has revolutionized the way software is programmed, shifting from a hard-coded series of codes to a vast neural network. However, this transition in engineering software has faced challenges such as data scarcity, multi-modality of data, low model accuracy, and slow inference. Here, we propose a new network based on interpolation theories and tensor decomposition, the interpolating neural network (INN). Instead of interpolating training data, a common notion in computer science, INN interpolates interpolation points in the physical space whose coordinates and values are trainable. It can also extrapolate if the interpolation points reside outside of the range of training data and the interpolation functions have a larger support domain. INN features orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters, faster training, a smaller memory footprint, and higher model accuracy compared to feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) or physics-informed neural networks (PINN). INN is poised to usher in Engineering Software 2.0, a unified neural network that spans various domains of space, time, parameters, and initial/boundary conditions. This has previously been computationally prohibitive due to the exponentially growing number of trainable parameters, easily exceeding the parameter size of ChatGPT, which is over 1 trillion. INN addresses this challenge by leveraging tensor decomposition and tensor product, with adaptable network architecture.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional Federated Learning (FL) methods typically train a single global model collaboratively without exchanging raw data. In contrast, Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) techniques aim to create multiple models that are better tailored to individual clients' data. We present a novel personalization approach based on stacked generalization where clients directly send each other privacy-preserving models to be used as base models to train a meta-model on private data. Our approach is flexible, accommodating various privacy-preserving techniques and model types, and can be applied in horizontal, hybrid, and vertically partitioned federations. Additionally, it offers a natural mechanism for assessing each client's contribution to the federation. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse simulated data heterogeneity scenarios, we showcase the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Duan, Jie Lu, Junyu Xuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) necessitates seamless collaboration among agents, often represented by an underlying relation graph. Existing methods for learning this graph primarily focus on agent-pair relations, neglecting higher-order relationships. While several approaches attempt to extend cooperation modelling to encompass behaviour similarities within groups, they commonly fall short in concurrently learning the latent graph, thereby constraining the information exchange among partially observed agents. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel approach to infer the Group-Aware Coordination Graph (GACG), which is designed to capture both the cooperation between agent pairs based on current observations and group-level dependencies from behaviour patterns observed across trajectories. This graph is further used in graph convolution for information exchange between agents during decision-making. To further ensure behavioural consistency among agents within the same group, we introduce a group distance loss, which promotes group cohesion and encourages specialization between groups. Our evaluations, conducted on StarCraft II micromanagement tasks, demonstrate GACG's superior performance. An ablation study further provides experimental evidence of the effectiveness of each component of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated learning has been identified as an efficient decentralized training paradigm for scaling the machine learning model training on a large number of devices while guaranteeing the data privacy of the trainers. FedAvg has become a foundational parameter update strategy for federated learning, which has been promising to eliminate the effect of the heterogeneous data across clients and guarantee convergence. However, the synchronization parameter update barriers for each communication round during the training significant time on waiting, slowing down the training procedure. Therefore, recent state-of-the-art solutions propose using semi-asynchronous approaches to mitigate the waiting time cost with guaranteed convergence. Nevertheless, emerging semi-asynchronous approaches are unable to eliminate the waiting time completely.
  We propose a full asynchronous training paradigm, called FedFa, which can guarantee model convergence and eliminate the waiting time completely for federated learning by using a few buffered results on the server for parameter updating. Further, we provide theoretical proof of the convergence rate for our proposed FedFa. Extensive experimental results indicate our approach effectively improves the training performance of federated learning by up to 6x and 4x speedup compared to the state-of-the-art synchronous and semi-asynchronous strategies while retaining high accuracy in both IID and Non-IID scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haojian Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The accurate wind speed series forecast is very pivotal to security of grid dispatching and the application of wind power. Nevertheless, on account of their nonlinear and non-stationary nature, their short-term forecast is extremely challenging. Therefore, this dissertation raises one short-term wind speed forecast pattern on the foundation of attention with an improved gated recurrent neural network (AtGRU) and a tactic of error correction. That model uses the AtGRU model as the preliminary predictor and the GRU model as the error corrector. At the beginning, SSA (singular spectrum analysis) is employed in previous wind speed series for lessening the noise. Subsequently, historical wind speed series is going to be used for the predictor training. During this process, the prediction can have certain errors. The sequence of these errors processed by variational modal decomposition (VMD) is used to train the corrector of error. The eventual forecast consequence is just the sum of predictor forecast and error corrector. The proposed SSA-AtGRU-VMD-GRU model outperforms the compared models in three case studies on Woodburn, St. Thomas, and Santa Cruz. It is indicated that the model evidently enhances the correction of the wind speed forecast.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the progress of Semi-supervised Learning (SSL), existing methods fail to utilize unlabeled data effectively and efficiently. Many pseudo-label-based methods select unlabeled examples based on inaccurate confidence scores from the classifier. Most prior work also uses all available unlabeled data without pruning, making it difficult to handle large amounts of unlabeled data. To address these issues, we propose two methods: Variational Confidence Calibration (VCC) and Influence-Function-based Unlabeled Sample Elimination (INFUSE). VCC is an universal plugin for SSL confidence calibration, using a variational autoencoder to select more accurate pseudo labels based on three types of consistency scores. INFUSE is a data pruning method that constructs a core dataset of unlabeled examples under SSL. Our methods are effective in multiple datasets and settings, reducing classification errors rates and saving training time. Together, VCC-INFUSE reduces the error rate of FlexMatch on the CIFAR-100 dataset by 1.08% while saving nearly half of the training time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqiang Shi, Rujie Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion generative modelling (DGM) based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with score matching has achieved unprecedented results in data generation. In this paper, we propose a novel fast high-quality generative modelling method based on high-order Langevin dynamics (HOLD) with score matching. This motive is proved by third-order Langevin dynamics. By augmenting the previous SDEs, e.g. variance exploding or variance preserving SDEs for single-data variable processes, HOLD can simultaneously model position, velocity, and acceleration, thereby improving the quality and speed of the data generation at the same time. HOLD is composed of one Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and two Hamiltonians, which reduce the mixing time by two orders of magnitude. Empirical experiments for unconditional image generation on the public data set CIFAR-10 and CelebA-HQ show that the effect is significant in both Frechet inception distance (FID) and negative log-likelihood, and achieves the state-of-the-art FID of 1.85 on CIFAR-10.</p>

<p>Abstract: I give a short introduction to data ethics. I begin with some background information and societal context for data ethics. I then discuss data ethics in mathematical-science education and indicate some available course material. I briefly highlight a few efforts -- at my home institution and elsewhere -- on data ethics, society, and social good. I then discuss open data in research, research replicability and some other ethical issues in research, and the tension between privacy and open data and code, and a few controversial studies and reactions to studies. I then discuss ethical principles, institutional review boards, and a few other considerations in the scientific use of human data. Finally, I briefly survey a variety of research and lay articles that are relevant to data ethics and data privacy. I conclude with a brief summary.
  My focal audience is mathematicians, but I hope that this chapter will also be useful to others. I am not an expert about data ethics, and this chapter provides only a starting point on this wide-ranging topic. I encourage you to examine the resources that I discuss and to reflect carefully on data ethics, its role in mathematics education, and the societal implications of data and data analysis. As data and technology continue to evolve, I hope that such careful reflection will continue throughout your life.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tamara G. Grossmann, S\"oren Dittmer, Yury Korolev, Carola-Bibiane Sch\"onlieb</p>
<p>Abstract: The total variation (TV) flow generates a scale-space representation of an image based on the TV functional. This gradient flow observes desirable features for images, such as sharp edges and enables spectral, scale, and texture analysis. Solving the TV flow is challenging; one reason is the the non-uniqueness of the subgradients. The standard numerical approach for TV flow requires solving multiple non-smooth optimisation problems. Even with state-of-the-art convex optimisation techniques, this is often prohibitively expensive and strongly motivates the use of alternative, faster approaches. Inspired by and extending the framework of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), we propose the TVflowNET, an unsupervised neural network approach, to approximate the solution of the TV flow given an initial image and a time instance. The TVflowNET requires no ground truth data but rather makes use of the PDE for optimisation of the network parameters. We circumvent the challenges related to the non-uniqueness of the subgradients by additionally learning the related diffusivity term. Our approach significantly speeds up the computation time and we show that the TVflowNET approximates the TV flow solution with high fidelity for different image sizes and image types. Additionally, we give a full comparison of different network architecture designs as well as training regimes to underscore the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider an expected-value ranking and selection (R&S) problem where all k solutions' simulation outputs depend on a common parameter whose uncertainty can be modeled by a distribution. We define the most probable best (MPB) to be the solution that has the largest probability of being optimal with respect to the distribution and design an efficient sequential sampling algorithm to learn the MPB when the parameter has a finite support. We derive the large deviations rate of the probability of falsely selecting the MPB and formulate an optimal computing budget allocation problem to find the rate-maximizing static sampling ratios. The problem is then relaxed to obtain a set of optimality conditions that are interpretable and computationally efficient to verify. We devise a series of algorithms that replace the unknown means in the optimality conditions with their estimates and prove the algorithms' sampling ratios achieve the conditions as the simulation budget increases. Furthermore, we show that the empirical performances of the algorithms can be significantly improved by adopting the kernel ridge regression for mean estimation while achieving the same asymptotic convergence results. The algorithms are benchmarked against a state-of-the-art contextual R&S algorithm and demonstrated to have superior empirical performances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuqian Ren, Saihui Hou, Chunshui Cao, Xu Liu, Yongzhen Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Gait recognition is instrumental in crime prevention and social security, for it can be conducted at a long distance to figure out the identity of persons. However, existing datasets and methods cannot satisfactorily deal with the most challenging cloth-changing problem in practice. Specifically, the practical gait models are usually trained on automatically labeled data, in which the sequences' views and cloth conditions of each person have some restrictions. To be concrete, the cross-view sub-dataset only has normal walking condition without cloth-changing, while the cross-cloth sub-dataset has cloth-changing sequences but only in front views. As a result, the cloth-changing accuracy cannot meet practical requirements. In this work, we formulate the problem as Realistic Cloth-Changing Gait Recognition (abbreviated as RCC-GR) and we construct two benchmarks: CASIA-BN-RCC and OUMVLP-RCC, to simulate the above setting. Furthermore, we propose a new framework called Progressive Feature Learning that can be applied with off-the-shelf backbones to improve their performance in RCC-GR. Specifically, in our framework, we design Progressive Mapping and Progressive Uncertainty to extract cross-view features and then extract cross-cloth features on the basis. In this way, the feature from the cross-view sub-dataset can first dominate the feature space and relieve the uneven distribution caused by the adverse effect from the cross-cloth sub-dataset. The experiments on our benchmarks show that our framework can effectively improve recognition performance, especially in the cloth-changing conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiqun Chen, Hangyu Mao, Jiaxin Mao, Shiguang Wu, Tianle Zhang, Bin Zhang, Wei Yang, Hongxing Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has emerged as a widely adopted paradigm in multi-agent reinforcement learning, emphasizing the utilization of global information for learning an enhanced joint $Q$-function or centralized critic. In contrast, our investigation delves into harnessing global information to directly enhance individual $Q$-functions or individual actors. Notably, we discover that applying identical global information universally across all agents proves insufficient for optimal performance. Consequently, we advocate for the customization of global information tailored to each agent, creating agent-personalized global information to bolster overall performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel paradigm named Personalized Training with Distilled Execution (PTDE), wherein agent-personalized global information is distilled into the agent's local information. This distilled information is then utilized during decentralized execution, resulting in minimal performance degradation. PTDE can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art algorithms, leading to notable performance enhancements across diverse benchmarks, including the SMAC benchmark, Google Research Football (GRF) benchmark, and Learning to Rank (LTR) task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hussein Mozannar, Gagan Bansal, Adam Fourney, Eric Horvitz</p>
<p>Abstract: Code-recommendation systems, such as Copilot and CodeWhisperer, have the potential to improve programmer productivity by suggesting and auto-completing code. However, to fully realize their potential, we must understand how programmers interact with these systems and identify ways to improve that interaction. To seek insights about human-AI collaboration with code recommendations systems, we studied GitHub Copilot, a code-recommendation system used by millions of programmers daily. We developed CUPS, a taxonomy of common programmer activities when interacting with Copilot. Our study of 21 programmers, who completed coding tasks and retrospectively labeled their sessions with CUPS, showed that CUPS can help us understand how programmers interact with code-recommendation systems, revealing inefficiencies and time costs. Our insights reveal how programmers interact with Copilot and motivate new interface designs and metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie, Farzan Farnia</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpreting neural network classifiers using gradient-based saliency maps has been extensively studied in the deep learning literature. While the existing algorithms manage to achieve satisfactory performance in application to standard image recognition datasets, recent works demonstrate the vulnerability of widely-used gradient-based interpretation schemes to norm-bounded perturbations adversarially designed for every individual input sample. However, such adversarial perturbations are commonly designed using the knowledge of an input sample, and hence perform sub-optimally in application to an unknown or constantly changing data point. In this paper, we show the existence of a Universal Perturbation for Interpretation (UPI) for standard image datasets, which can alter a gradient-based feature map of neural networks over a significant fraction of test samples. To design such a UPI, we propose a gradient-based optimization method as well as a principal component analysis (PCA)-based approach to compute a UPI which can effectively alter a neural network's gradient-based interpretation on different samples. We support the proposed UPI approaches by presenting several numerical results of their successful applications to standard image datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhujin Gao, Junliang Guo, Xu Tan, Yongxin Zhu, Fang Zhang, Jiang Bian, Linli Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art synthesis quality on both visual and audio tasks, and recent works further adapt them to textual data by diffusing on the embedding space. In this paper, we conduct systematic studies of the optimization challenges encountered with both the embedding space and the denoising model, which have not been carefully explored. Firstly, the data distribution is learnable for embeddings, which may lead to the collapse of the embedding space and unstable training. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new objective called the anchor loss which is more efficient than previous methods. Secondly, we find the noise levels of conventional schedules are insufficient for training a desirable denoising model while introducing varying degrees of degeneration in consequence. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called noise rescaling. Based on the above analysis, we propose Difformer, an embedding diffusion model based on Transformer. Experiments on varieties of seminal text generation tasks show the effectiveness of the proposed methods and the superiority of Difformer over previous state-of-the-art embedding diffusion baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guohao Shen, Yuling Jiao, Yuanyuan Lin, Jian Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the properties of differentiable neural networks activated by rectified power unit (RePU) functions. We show that the partial derivatives of RePU neural networks can be represented by RePUs mixed-activated networks and derive upper bounds for the complexity of the function class of derivatives of RePUs networks. We establish error bounds for simultaneously approximating $C^s$ smooth functions and their derivatives using RePU-activated deep neural networks. Furthermore, we derive improved approximation error bounds when data has an approximate low-dimensional support, demonstrating the ability of RePU networks to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. To illustrate the usefulness of our results, we consider a deep score matching estimator (DSME) and propose a penalized deep isotonic regression (PDIR) using RePU networks. We establish non-asymptotic excess risk bounds for DSME and PDIR under the assumption that the target functions belong to a class of $C^s$ smooth functions. We also show that PDIR achieves the minimax optimal convergence rate and has a robustness property in the sense it is consistent with vanishing penalty parameters even when the monotonicity assumption is not satisfied. Furthermore, if the data distribution is supported on an approximate low-dimensional manifold, we show that DSME and PDIR can mitigate the curse of dimensionality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sudarshan Adiga, Xin Xiao, Ravi Tandon, Bane Vasic, Tamal Bose</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning based approaches are being increasingly used for designing decoders for next generation communication systems. One widely used framework is neural belief propagation (NBP), which unfolds the belief propagation (BP) iterations into a deep neural network and the parameters are trained in a data-driven manner. NBP decoders have been shown to improve upon classical decoding algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the generalization capabilities of NBP decoders. Specifically, the generalization gap of a decoder is the difference between empirical and expected bit-error-rate(s). We present new theoretical results which bound this gap and show the dependence on the decoder complexity, in terms of code parameters (blocklength, message length, variable/check node degrees), decoding iterations, and the training dataset size. Results are presented for both regular and irregular parity-check matrices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first set of theoretical results on generalization performance of neural network based decoders. We present experimental results to show the dependence of generalization gap on the training dataset size, and decoding iterations for different codes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashish Sinha, Jeremy Kawahara, Arezou Pakzad, Kumar Abhishek, Matthieu Ruthven, Enjie Ghorbel, Anis Kacem, Djamila Aouada, Ghassan Hamarneh</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, deep learning (DL) has shown great potential in the field of dermatological image analysis. However, existing datasets in this domain have significant limitations, including a small number of image samples, limited disease conditions, insufficient annotations, and non-standardized image acquisitions. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel framework called DermSynth3D. DermSynth3D blends skin disease patterns onto 3D textured meshes of human subjects using a differentiable renderer and generates 2D images from various camera viewpoints under chosen lighting conditions in diverse background scenes. Our method adheres to top-down rules that constrain the blending and rendering process to create 2D images with skin conditions that mimic in-the-wild acquisitions, ensuring more meaningful results. The framework generates photo-realistic 2D dermoscopy images and the corresponding dense annotations for semantic segmentation of the skin, skin conditions, body parts, bounding boxes around lesions, depth maps, and other 3D scene parameters, such as camera position and lighting conditions. DermSynth3D allows for the creation of custom datasets for various dermatology tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of data generated using DermSynth3D by training DL models on synthetic data and evaluating them on various dermatology tasks using real 2D dermatological images. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/sfu-mial/DermSynth3D.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hussein Mozannar, Gagan Bansal, Adam Fourney, Eric Horvitz</p>
<p>Abstract: AI powered code-recommendation systems, such as Copilot and CodeWhisperer, provide code suggestions inside a programmer's environment (e.g., an IDE) with the aim of improving productivity. We pursue mechanisms for leveraging signals about programmers' acceptance and rejection of code suggestions to guide recommendations. We harness data drawn from interactions with GitHub Copilot, a system used by millions of programmers, to develop interventions that can save time for programmers. We introduce a utility-theoretic framework to drive decisions about suggestions to display versus withhold. The approach, conditional suggestion display from human feedback (CDHF), relies on a cascade of models that provide the likelihood that recommended code will be accepted. These likelihoods are used to selectively hide suggestions, reducing both latency and programmer verification time. Using data from 535 programmers, we perform a retrospective evaluation of CDHF and show that we can avoid displaying a significant fraction of suggestions that would have been rejected. We further demonstrate the importance of incorporating the programmer's latent unobserved state in decisions about when to display suggestions through an ablation study. Finally, we showcase how using suggestion acceptance as a reward signal for guiding the display of suggestions can lead to suggestions of reduced quality, indicating an unexpected pitfall.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces supervised learning techniques for real-time selection (triggering) of hadronically decaying tau leptons in proton-proton colliders. By implementing classic machine learning decision trees and advanced deep learning models, such as Multi-Layer Perceptron or residual neural networks, visible improvements in performance compared to standard threshold tau triggers are observed. We show how such an implementation may lower selection energy thresholds, thus contributing to increasing the sensitivity of searches for new phenomena in proton-proton collisions classified by low-energy tau leptons. Moreover, we analyze when it is better to use neural networks versus decision trees for tau triggers with conclusions relevant to other problems in physics.</p>

<p>Abstract: The autonomous driving community has witnessed a rapid growth in approaches that embrace an end-to-end algorithm framework, utilizing raw sensor input to generate vehicle motion plans, instead of concentrating on individual tasks such as detection and motion prediction. End-to-end systems, in comparison to modular pipelines, benefit from joint feature optimization for perception and planning. This field has flourished due to the availability of large-scale datasets, closed-loop evaluation, and the increasing need for autonomous driving algorithms to perform effectively in challenging scenarios. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of more than 270 papers, covering the motivation, roadmap, methodology, challenges, and future trends in end-to-end autonomous driving. We delve into several critical challenges, including multi-modality, interpretability, causal confusion, robustness, and world models, amongst others. Additionally, we discuss current advancements in foundation models and visual pre-training, as well as how to incorporate these techniques within the end-to-end driving framework. we maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date literature and open-source projects at https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/End-to-end-Autonomous-Driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadi Abdine, Michail Chatzianastasis, Costas Bouyioukos, Michalis Vazirgiannis</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of protein function prediction with the development of various machine-learning approaches. However, most existing methods formulate the task as a multi-classification problem, i.e. assigning predefined labels to proteins. In this work, we propose a novel approach, Prot2Text, which predicts a protein's function in a free text style, moving beyond the conventional binary or categorical classifications. By combining Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) and Large Language Models(LLMs), in an encoder-decoder framework, our model effectively integrates diverse data types including protein sequence, structure, and textual annotation and description. This multimodal approach allows for a holistic representation of proteins' functions, enabling the generation of detailed and accurate functional descriptions. To evaluate our model, we extracted a multimodal protein dataset from SwissProt, and demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of Prot2Text. These results highlight the transformative impact of multimodal models, specifically the fusion of GNNs and LLMs, empowering researchers with powerful tools for more accurate function prediction of existing as well as first-to-see proteins.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16792">Classification with Deep Neural Networks and Logistic Loss</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Zhang, Lei Shi, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with the logistic loss (i.e., the cross entropy loss) have made impressive advancements in various binary classification tasks. However, generalization analysis for binary classification with DNNs and logistic loss remains scarce. The unboundedness of the target function for the logistic loss is the main obstacle to deriving satisfactory generalization bounds. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by establishing a novel and elegant oracle-type inequality, which enables us to deal with the boundedness restriction of the target function, and using it to derive sharp convergence rates for fully connected ReLU DNN classifiers trained with logistic loss. In particular, we obtain optimal convergence rates (up to log factors) only requiring the H\"older smoothness of the conditional class probability $\eta$ of data. Moreover, we consider a compositional assumption that requires $\eta$ to be the composition of several vector-valued functions of which each component function is either a maximum value function or a H\"older smooth function only depending on a small number of its input variables. Under this assumption, we derive optimal convergence rates (up to log factors) which are independent of the input dimension of data. This result explains why DNN classifiers can perform well in practical high-dimensional classification problems. Besides the novel oracle-type inequality, the sharp convergence rates given in our paper also owe to a tight error bound for approximating the natural logarithm function near zero (where it is unbounded) by ReLU DNNs. In addition, we justify our claims for the optimality of rates by proving corresponding minimax lower bounds. All these results are new in the literature and will deepen our theoretical understanding of classification with DNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satoshi Yamamori, Jun Morimoto</p>
<p>Abstract: In dynamic motion generation tasks, including contact and collisions, small changes in policy parameters can lead to extremely different returns. For example, in soccer, the ball can fly in completely different directions with a similar heading motion by slightly changing the hitting position or the force applied to the ball or when the friction of the ball varies. However, it is difficult to imagine that completely different skills are needed for heading a ball in different directions. In this study, we proposed a multitask reinforcement learning algorithm for adapting a policy to implicit changes in goals or environments in a single motion category with different reward functions or physical parameters of the environment. We evaluated the proposed method on the ball heading task using a monopod robot model. The results showed that the proposed method can adapt to implicit changes in the goal positions or the coefficients of restitution of the ball, whereas the standard domain randomization approach cannot cope with different task settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Jaderberg, Antonio A. Gentile, Youssef Achari Berrada, Elvira Shishenina, Vincent E. Elfving</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits as machine learning models are typically well described by their representation as a partial Fourier series of the input features, with frequencies uniquely determined by the feature map's generator Hamiltonians. Ordinarily, these data-encoding generators are chosen in advance, fixing the space of functions that can be represented. In this work we consider a generalization of quantum models to include a set of trainable parameters in the generator, leading to a trainable frequency (TF) quantum model. We numerically demonstrate how TF models can learn generators with desirable properties for solving the task at hand, including non-regularly spaced frequencies in their spectra and flexible spectral richness. Finally, we showcase the real-world effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating an improved accuracy in solving the Navier-Stokes equations using a TF model with only a single parameter added to each encoding operation. Since TF models encompass conventional fixed frequency models, they may offer a sensible default choice for variational quantum machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ya Zhou, Xiaolin Diao, Yanni Huo, Yang Liu, Xiaohan Fan, Wei Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most important diagnostic tools in clinical applications. With the advent of advanced algorithms, various deep learning models have been adopted for ECG tasks. However, the potential of Transformers for ECG data is not yet realized, despite their widespread success in computer vision and natural language processing. In this work, we present a useful masked Transformer method for ECG classification referred to as MTECG, which expands the application of masked autoencoders to ECG time series. We construct a dataset comprising 220,251 ECG recordings with a broad range of diagnoses annoated by medical experts to explore the properties of MTECG. Under the proposed training strategies, a lightweight model with 5.7M parameters performs stably well on a broad range of masking ratios (5%-75%). The ablation studies highlight the importance of fluctuated reconstruction targets, training schedule length, layer-wise LR decay and DropPath rate. The experiments on both private and public ECG datasets demonstrate that MTECG-T significantly outperforms the recent state-of-the-art algorithms in ECG classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin-Hong Du, Larry Wasserman, Kathryn Roeder</p>
<p>Abstract: Tens of thousands of simultaneous hypothesis tests are routinely performed in genomic studies to identify differentially expressed genes. However, due to unmeasured confounders, many standard statistical approaches may be substantially biased. This paper investigates the large-scale hypothesis testing problem for multivariate generalized linear models in the presence of confounding effects. Under arbitrary confounding mechanisms, we propose a unified statistical estimation and inference framework that harnesses orthogonal structures and integrates linear projections into three key stages. It begins by disentangling marginal and uncorrelated confounding effects to recover the latent coefficients. Subsequently, latent factors and primary effects are jointly estimated through lasso-type optimization. Finally, we incorporate projected and weighted bias-correction steps for hypothesis testing. Theoretically, we establish the identification conditions of various effects and non-asymptotic error bounds. We show effective Type-I error control of asymptotic $z$-tests as sample and response sizes approach infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method controls the false discovery rate by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and is more powerful than alternative methods. By comparing single-cell RNA-seq counts from two groups of samples, we demonstrate the suitability of adjusting confounding effects when significant covariates are absent from the model.</p>

<p>Abstract: The agility of animals, particularly in complex activities such as running, turning, jumping, and backflipping, stands as an exemplar for robotic system design. Transferring this suite of behaviors to legged robotic systems introduces essential inquiries: How can a robot be trained to learn multiple locomotion behaviors simultaneously? How can the robot execute these tasks with a smooth transition? How to integrate these skills for wide-range applications? This paper introduces the Versatile Instructable Motion prior (VIM) - a Reinforcement Learning framework designed to incorporate a range of agile locomotion tasks suitable for advanced robotic applications. Our framework enables legged robots to learn diverse agile low-level skills by imitating animal motions and manually designed motions. Our Functionality reward guides the robot's ability to adopt varied skills, and our Stylization reward ensures that robot motions align with reference motions. Our evaluations of the VIM framework span both simulation environments and real-world deployment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that allows a robot to concurrently learn diverse agile locomotion skills using a single learning-based controller in the real world.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sachin Goyal, Ziwei Ji, Ankit Singh Rawat, Aditya Krishna Menon, Sanjiv Kumar, Vaishnavh Nagarajan</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models generate responses by producing a series of tokens in immediate succession: the $(K+1)^{th}$ token is an outcome of manipulating $K$ hidden vectors per layer, one vector per preceding token. What if instead we were to let the model manipulate say, $K+10$ hidden vectors, before it outputs the $(K+1)^{th}$ token? We operationalize this idea by performing training and inference on language models with a (learnable) $\textit{pause}$ token, a sequence of which is appended to the input prefix. We then delay extracting the model's outputs until the last pause token is seen, thereby allowing the model to process extra computation before committing to an answer. We empirically evaluate $\textit{pause-training}$ on decoder-only models of 1B and 130M parameters with causal pretraining on C4, and on downstream tasks covering reasoning, question-answering, general understanding and fact recall. Our main finding is that inference-time delays show gains when the model is both pre-trained and finetuned with delays. For the 1B model, we witness gains on 8 of 9 tasks, most prominently, a gain of $18\%$ EM score on the QA task of SQuAD, $8\%$ on CommonSenseQA and $1\%$ accuracy on the reasoning task of GSM8k. Our work raises a range of conceptual and practical future research questions on making delayed next-token prediction a widely applicable new paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Ott, Yannik Schaubelt, Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz, Wilhelm Haverkamp, Nils Strodthoff</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading global cause of mortality. Age is an important covariate whose effect is most easily investigated in a healthy cohort to properly distinguish the former from disease-related changes. Traditionally, most of such insights have been drawn from the analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) feature changes in individuals as they age. However, these features, while informative, may potentially obscure underlying data relationships. In this paper we present the following contributions: (1) We employ a deep-learning model and a tree-based model to analyze ECG data from a robust dataset of healthy individuals across varying ages in both raw signals and ECG feature format. (2) We use explainable AI methods to identify the most discriminative ECG features across age groups.(3) Our analysis with tree-based classifiers reveals age-related declines in inferred breathing rates and identifies notably high SDANN values as indicative of elderly individuals, distinguishing them from younger adults. (4) Furthermore, the deep-learning model underscores the pivotal role of the P-wave in age predictions across all age groups, suggesting potential changes in the distribution of different P-wave types with age. These findings shed new light on age-related ECG changes, offering insights that transcend traditional feature-based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raphael Tang, Xinyu Zhang, Xueguang Ma, Jimmy Lin, Ferhan Ture</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit positional bias in how they use context, which especially complicates listwise ranking. To address this, we propose permutation self-consistency, a form of self-consistency over ranking list outputs of black-box LLMs. Our key idea is to marginalize out different list orders in the prompt to produce an order-independent ranking with less positional bias. First, given some input prompt, we repeatedly shuffle the list in the prompt and pass it through the LLM while holding the instructions the same. Next, we aggregate the resulting sample of rankings by computing the central ranking closest in distance to all of them, marginalizing out prompt order biases in the process. Theoretically, we prove the robustness of our method, showing convergence to the true ranking in the presence of random perturbations. Empirically, on five list-ranking datasets in sorting and passage reranking, our approach improves scores from conventional inference by up to 7-18% for GPT-3.5 and 8-16% for LLaMA v2 (70B), surpassing the previous state of the art in passage reranking.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaolong Liu, Liangwei Yang, Zhiwei Liu, Mingdai Yang, Chen Wang, Hao Peng, Philip S. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of Recommender Systems (RecSys) has been extensively studied to enhance accuracy by leveraging users' historical interactions. Nonetheless, this persistent pursuit of accuracy frequently engenders diminished diversity, culminating in the well-recognized "echo chamber" phenomenon. Diversified RecSys has emerged as a countermeasure, placing diversity on par with accuracy and garnering noteworthy attention from academic circles and industry practitioners. This research explores the realm of diversified RecSys within the intricate context of knowledge graphs (KG). These KGs act as repositories of interconnected information concerning entities and items, offering a propitious avenue to amplify recommendation diversity through the incorporation of insightful contextual information. Our contributions include introducing an innovative metric, Entity Coverage, and Relation Coverage, which effectively quantifies diversity within the KG domain. Additionally, we introduce the Diversified Embedding Learning (DEL) module, meticulously designed to formulate user representations that possess an innate awareness of diversity. In tandem with this, we introduce a novel technique named Conditional Alignment and Uniformity (CAU). It adeptly encodes KG item embeddings while preserving contextual integrity. Collectively, our contributions signify a substantial stride towards augmenting the panorama of recommendation diversity within the realm of KG-informed RecSys paradigms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex D. Richardson, Tibor Antal, Richard A. Blythe, Linus J. Schumacher</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) are a powerful combination of machine learning and mechanistic modelling. We train NCA to learn complex dynamics from time series of images and PDE trajectories. Our method is designed to identify underlying local rules that govern large scale dynamic emergent behaviours. Previous work on NCA focuses on learning rules that give stationary emergent structures. We extend NCA to capture both transient and stable structures within the same system, as well as learning rules that capture the dynamics of Turing pattern formation in nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). We demonstrate that NCA can generalise very well beyond their PDE training data, we show how to constrain NCA to respect given symmetries, and we explore the effects of associated hyperparameters on model performance and stability. Being able to learn arbitrary dynamics gives NCA great potential as a data driven modelling framework, especially for modelling biological pattern formation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maryam Haghighat, Peyman Moghadam, Shaheer Mohamed, Piotr Koniusz</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) is a powerful self-supervised strategy for visual pre-training without the use of labels. MIM applies random crops to input images, processes them with an encoder, and then recovers the masked inputs with a decoder, which encourages the network to capture and learn structural information about objects and scenes. The intermediate feature representations obtained from MIM are suitable for fine-tuning on downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose an Image Modeling framework based on random orthogonal projection instead of binary masking as in MIM. Our proposed Random Orthogonal Projection Image Modeling (ROPIM) reduces spatially-wise token information under guaranteed bound on the noise variance and can be considered as masking entire spatial image area under locally varying masking degrees. Since ROPIM uses a random subspace for the projection that realizes the masking step, the readily available complement of the subspace can be used during unmasking to promote recovery of removed information. In this paper, we show that using random orthogonal projection leads to superior performance compared to crop-based masking. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on several popular benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yadong Zhang, Pranav M Karve, Sankaran Mahadevan</p>
<p>Abstract: A DC OPF surrogate modeling framework is developed for Monte Carlo (MC) sampling-based risk quantification in power grid operation. MC simulation necessitates solving a large number of DC OPF problems corresponding to the samples of stochastic grid variables (power demand and renewable generation), which is computationally prohibitive. Computationally inexpensive surrogates of OPF provide an attractive alternative for expedited MC simulation. Graph neural network (GNN) surrogates of DC OPF, which are especially suitable to graph-structured data, are employed in this work. Previously developed DC OPF surrogate models have focused on accurate operational decision-making and not on risk quantification. Here, risk quantification-specific aspects of DC OPF surrogate evaluation is the main focus. To this end, the proposed GNN surrogates are evaluated using realistic joint probability distributions, quantification of their risk estimation accuracy, and investigation of their generalizability. Four synthetic grids (Case118, Case300, Case1354pegase, and Case2848rte) are used for surrogate model performance evaluation. It is shown that the GNN surrogates are sufficiently accurate for predicting the (bus-level, branch-level and system-level) grid state and enable fast as well as accurate operational risk quantification for power grids. The article thus develops tools for fast reliability and risk quantification in real-world power grids using GNN-based surrogates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ammar Daskin</p>
<p>Abstract: Blockmodeling of a given problem represented by an $N\times N$ adjacency matrix can be found by swapping rows and columns of the matrix (i.e. multiplying matrix from left and right by a permutation matrix). Although classical matrix permutations can be efficiently done by swapping pointers for the permuted rows (or columns) of the matrix, by changing row-column order, a permutation changes the location of the matrix elements, which determines the membership of a group in the matrix based blockmodeling. Therefore, a brute force initial estimation of a fitness value for a candidate solution involving counting the memberships of the elements may require going through all the sum of the rows (or the columns).
  Similarly permutations can be also implemented efficiently on quantum computers, e.g. a NOT gate on a qubit. In this paper, using permutation matrices and qubit measurements, we show how to solve blockmodeling on quantum computers. In the model, the measurement outcomes of a small group of qubits are mapped to indicate the fitness value. However, if the number of qubits in the considered group is much less than $n=log(N)$, it is possible to find or update the fitness value based on the state tomography in $O(poly(log(N)))$. Therefore, when the number of iterations is less than $log(N)$ time and the size of the considered qubit group is small, we show that it may be possible to reach the solution very efficiently.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi-Hsi Kung, Shu-Wei Lu, Yi-Hsuan Tsai, Yi-Ting Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study multi-label atomic activity recognition. Despite the notable progress in action recognition, it is still challenging to recognize atomic activities due to a deficiency in a holistic understanding of both multiple road users' motions and their contextual information. In this paper, we introduce Action-slot, a slot attention-based approach that learns visual action-centric representations, capturing both motion and contextual information. Our key idea is to design action slots that are capable of paying attention to regions where atomic activities occur, without the need for explicit perception guidance. To further enhance slot attention, we introduce a background slot that competes with action slots, aiding the training process in avoiding unnecessary focus on background regions devoid of activities. Yet, the imbalanced class distribution in the existing dataset hampers the assessment of rare activities. To address the limitation, we collect a synthetic dataset called TACO, which is four times larger than OATS and features a balanced distribution of atomic activities. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation studies against various action recognition baselines. We also show that the performance of multi-label atomic activity recognition on real-world datasets can be improved by pretraining representations on TACO. We will release our source code and dataset. See the videos of visualization on the project page: https://hcis-lab.github.io/Action-slot/</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for video action recognition. Our approach, which we call UNITE, uses an image teacher model to adapt a video student model to the target domain. UNITE first employs self-supervised pre-training to promote discriminative feature learning on target domain videos using a teacher-guided masked distillation objective. We then perform self-training on masked target data, using the video student model and image teacher model together to generate improved pseudolabels for unlabeled target videos. Our self-training process successfully leverages the strengths of both models to achieve strong transfer performance across domains. We evaluate our approach on multiple video domain adaptation benchmarks and observe significant improvements upon previously reported results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern video generation models like Sora have achieved remarkable success in producing high-quality videos. However, a significant limitation is their inability to offer interactive control to users, a feature that promises to open up unprecedented applications and creativity. In this work, we introduce the first solution to equip diffusion-based video generation models with spatio-temporal control. We present Peekaboo, a novel masked attention module, which seamlessly integrates with current video generation models offering control without the need for additional training or inference overhead. To facilitate future research, we also introduce a comprehensive benchmark for interactive video generation. This benchmark offers a standardized framework for the community to assess the efficacy of emerging interactive video generation models. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative assessments reveal that Peekaboo achieves up to a 3.8x improvement in mIoU over baseline models, all while maintaining the same latency. Code and benchmark are available on the webpage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Luttner</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the "Uncertainty-aware Mixture of Experts" (uMoE), a novel solution aimed at addressing aleatoric uncertainty within Neural Network (NN) based predictive models. While existing methodologies primarily concentrate on managing uncertainty during inference, uMoE uniquely embeds uncertainty into the training phase. Employing a "Divide and Conquer" strategy, uMoE strategically partitions the uncertain input space into more manageable subspaces. It comprises Expert components, individually trained on their respective subspace uncertainties. Overarching the Experts, a Gating Unit, leveraging additional information regarding the distribution of uncertain in-puts across these subspaces, dynamically adjusts the weighting to minimize deviations from ground truth. Our findings demonstrate the superior performance of uMoE over baseline methods in effectively managing data uncertainty. Furthermore, through a comprehensive robustness analysis, we showcase its adaptability to varying uncertainty levels and propose optimal threshold parameters. This innovative approach boasts broad applicability across diverse da-ta-driven domains, including but not limited to biomedical signal processing, autonomous driving, and production quality control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vanessa Graber, Michele Ronchi, Celsa Pardo-Araujo, Nanda Rea</p>
<p>Abstract: We combine pulsar population synthesis with simulation-based inference (SBI) to constrain the magneto-rotational properties of isolated Galactic radio pulsars. We first develop a framework to model neutron-star birth properties and their dynamical and magneto-rotational evolution. We specifically sample initial magnetic-field strengths, $B$, and spin periods, $P$, from log-normal distributions and capture the late-time magnetic-field decay with a power law. Each log-normal is described by a mean, $\mu_{\log B}, \mu_{\log P}$, and standard deviation, $\sigma_{\log B}, \sigma_{\log P}$, while the power law is characterized by the index, $a_{\rm late}$. We subsequently model the stars' radio emission and observational biases to mimic detections with three radio surveys, and produce a large database of synthetic $P$-$\dot{P}$ diagrams by varying our five magneto-rotational input parameters. We then follow an SBI approach that focuses on neural posterior estimation and train deep neural networks to infer the parameters' posterior distributions. After successfully validating these individual neural density estimators on simulated data, we use an ensemble of networks to infer the posterior distributions for the observed pulsar population. We obtain $\mu_{\log B} = 13.10^{+0.08}_{-0.10}$, $\sigma_{\log B} = 0.45^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ and $\mu_{\log P} = -1.00^{+0.26}_{-0.21}$, $\sigma_{\log P} = 0.38^{+0.33}_{-0.18}$ for the log-normal distributions, and $a_{\rm late} = -1.80^{+0.65}_{-0.61}$ for the power law at $95\%$ credible interval. We contrast our results with previous studies and highlight uncertainties of the inferred $a_{\rm late}$ value. Our approach represents a crucial step towards robust statistical inference for complex population-synthesis frameworks and forms the basis for future multi-wavelength analyses of Galactic pulsars.</p>

<p>Abstract: Individuals with suspected rare genetic disorders often undergo multiple clinical evaluations, imaging studies, laboratory tests and genetic tests, to find a possible answer over a prolonged period of time. Addressing this "diagnostic odyssey" thus has substantial clinical, psychosocial, and economic benefits. Many rare genetic diseases have distinctive facial features, which can be used by artificial intelligence algorithms to facilitate clinical diagnosis, in prioritizing candidate diseases to be further examined by lab tests or genetic assays, or in helping the phenotype-driven reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data. Existing methods using frontal facial photos were built on conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), rely exclusively on facial images, and cannot capture non-facial phenotypic traits and demographic information essential for guiding accurate diagnoses. Here we introduce GestaltMML, a multimodal machine learning (MML) approach solely based on the Transformer architecture. It integrates facial images, demographic information (age, sex, ethnicity), and clinical notes (optionally, a list of Human Phenotype Ontology terms) to improve prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we also evaluated GestaltMML on a diverse range of datasets, including 528 diseases from the GestaltMatcher Database, several in-house datasets of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS, over-growth syndrome with distinct facial features), Sotos syndrome (overgrowth syndrome with overlapping features with BWS), NAA10-related neurodevelopmental syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome (multiple malformation syndrome), and KBG syndrome (multiple malformation syndrome). Our results suggest that GestaltMML effectively incorporates multiple modalities of data, greatly narrowing candidate genetic diagnoses of rare diseases and may facilitate the reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederick Iat-Hin Tam, Tom Beucler, James H. Ruppert Jr</p>
<p>Abstract: Cloud radiative feedback impacts early tropical cyclone (TC) intensification, but limitations in existing diagnostic frameworks make them unsuitable for studying asymmetric or transient radiative heating. We propose a linear Variational Encoder-Decoder (VED) to learn the hidden relationship between radiation and the surface intensification of realistic simulated TCs. Limiting VED model inputs enables using its uncertainty to identify periods when radiation has more importance for intensification. A close examination of the extracted 3D radiative structures suggests that longwave radiative forcing from inner core deep convection and shallow clouds both contribute to intensification, with the deep convection having the most impact overall. We find that deep convection downwind of the shallow clouds is critical to the intensification of Haiyan. Our work demonstrates that machine learning can discover thermodynamic-kinematic relationships without relying on axisymmetric or deterministic assumptions, paving the way towards the objective discovery of processes leading to TC intensification in realistic conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural style transfer (NST) generates new images by combining the style of one image with the content of another. However, unauthorized NST can exploit artwork, raising concerns about artists' rights and motivating the development of proactive protection methods. We propose Locally Adaptive Adversarial Color Attack (LAACA), empowering artists to protect their artwork from unauthorized style transfer by processing before public release. By delving into the intricacies of human visual perception and the role of different frequency components, our method strategically introduces frequency-adaptive perturbations in the image. These perturbations significantly degrade the generation quality of NST while maintaining an acceptable level of visual change in the original image, ensuring that potential infringers are discouraged from using the protected artworks, because of its bad NST generation quality. Additionally, existing metrics often overlook the importance of color fidelity in evaluating color-mattered tasks, such as the quality of NST-generated images, which is crucial in the context of artistic works. To comprehensively assess the color-mattered tasks, we propose the Adversarial Color Distance Metric (ACDM), designed to quantify the color difference of images pre- and post-manipulations. Experimental results confirm that attacking NST using LAACA results in visually inferior style transfer, and the ACDM can efficiently measure color-mattered tasks. By providing artists with a tool to safeguard their intellectual property, our work relieves the socio-technical challenges posed by the misuse of NST in the art community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chanyoung Chung, Georgios Georgakis, Patrick Spieler, Curtis Padgett, Ali Agha, Shehryar Khattak</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding terrain topology at long-range is crucial for the success of off-road robotic missions, especially when navigating at high-speeds. LiDAR sensors, which are currently heavily relied upon for geometric mapping, provide sparse measurements when mapping at greater distances. To address this challenge, we present a novel learning-based approach capable of predicting terrain elevation maps at long-range using only onboard egocentric images in real-time. Our proposed method is comprised of three main elements. First, a transformer-based encoder is introduced that learns cross-view associations between the egocentric views and prior bird-eye-view elevation map predictions. Second, an orientation-aware positional encoding is proposed to incorporate the 3D vehicle pose information over complex unstructured terrain with multi-view visual image features. Lastly, a history-augmented learn-able map embedding is proposed to achieve better temporal consistency between elevation map predictions to facilitate the downstream navigational tasks. We experimentally validate the applicability of our proposed approach for autonomous offroad robotic navigation in complex and unstructured terrain using real-world offroad driving data. Furthermore, the method is qualitatively and quantitatively compared against the current state-of-the-art methods. Extensive field experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses baseline models in accurately predicting terrain elevation while effectively capturing the overall terrain topology at long-ranges. Finally, ablation studies are conducted to highlight and understand the effect of key components of the proposed approach and validate their suitability to improve offroad robotic navigation capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a hierarchical architecture designed for scalable real-time Model Predictive Control (MPC) in complex, multi-modal traffic scenarios. This architecture comprises two key components: 1) RAID-Net, a novel attention-based Recurrent Neural Network that predicts relevant interactions along the MPC prediction horizon between the autonomous vehicle and the surrounding vehicles using Lagrangian duality, and 2) a reduced Stochastic MPC problem that eliminates irrelevant collision avoidance constraints, enhancing computational efficiency. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated traffic intersection with interactive surrounding vehicles, showcasing a 12x speed-up in solving the motion planning problem.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun-Peng Ning, Shuo Yang, Yu-Yang Liu, Jia-Yu Yao, Zhen-Hui Liu, Yu Wang, Ming Pang, Li Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) evaluation methods typically focus on testing the performance on some closed-environment and domain-specific benchmarks with human annotations. In this paper, we explore a novel unsupervised evaluation direction, utilizing peer-review mechanisms to measure LLMs automatically. In this setting, both open-source and closed-source LLMs lie in the same environment, capable of answering unlabeled questions and evaluating each other, where each LLM's response score is jointly determined by other anonymous ones. To obtain the ability hierarchy among these models, we assign each LLM a learnable capability parameter to adjust the final ranking. We formalize it as a constrained optimization problem, intending to maximize the consistency of each LLM's capabilities and scores. The key assumption behind is that high-level LLM can evaluate others' answers more accurately than low-level ones, while higher-level LLM can also achieve higher response scores. Moreover, we propose three metrics called PEN, CIN, and LIS to evaluate the gap in aligning human rankings. We perform experiments on multiple datasets with these metrics, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lars van der Laan, Ahmed M. Alaa</p>
<p>Abstract: In decision-making guided by machine learning, decision-makers may take identical actions in contexts with identical predicted outcomes. Conformal prediction helps decision-makers quantify uncertainty in point predictions of outcomes, allowing for better risk management for actions. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce \textit{Self-Consistent Conformal Prediction} for regression, which combines two post-hoc approaches -- Venn-Abers calibration and conformal prediction -- to provide calibrated point predictions and compatible prediction intervals that are valid conditional on model predictions. Our procedure can be applied post-hoc to any black-box model to provide predictions and inferences with finite-sample prediction-conditional guarantees. Numerical experiments show our approach strikes a balance between interval efficiency and conditional validity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Obai Bahwal, Oliver Kosut, Lalitha Sankar</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent machine learning approaches are finding active use for event detection and identification that allow real-time situational awareness. Yet, such machine learning algorithms have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks on the incoming telemetry data. This paper considers a physics-based modal decomposition method to extract features for event classification and focuses on interpretable classifiers including logistic regression and gradient boosting to distinguish two types of events: load loss and generation loss. The resulting classifiers are then tested against an adversarial algorithm to evaluate their robustness. The adversarial attack is tested in two settings: the white box setting, wherein the attacker knows exactly the classification model; and the gray box setting, wherein the attacker has access to historical data from the same network as was used to train the classifier, but does not know the classification model. Thorough experiments on the synthetic South Carolina 500-bus system highlight that a relatively simpler model such as logistic regression is more susceptible to adversarial attacks than gradient boosting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jhanvi Garg, Xianyang Zhang, Quan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger bridge can be viewed as a continuous-time stochastic control problem where the goal is to find an optimally controlled diffusion process whose terminal distribution coincides with a pre-specified target distribution. We propose to generalize this problem by allowing the terminal distribution to differ from the target but penalizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two distributions. We call this new control problem soft-constrained Schr\"{o}dinger bridge (SSB). The main contribution of this work is a theoretical derivation of the solution to SSB, which shows that the terminal distribution of the optimally controlled process is a geometric mixture of the target and some other distribution. This result is further extended to a time series setting. One application is the development of robust generative diffusion models. We propose a score matching-based algorithm for sampling from geometric mixtures and showcase its use via a numerical example for the MNIST data set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R. Gnana Praveen, Jahangir Alam</p>
<p>Abstract: Although person or identity verification has been predominantly explored using individual modalities such as face and voice, audio-visual fusion has recently shown immense potential to outperform unimodal approaches. Audio and visual modalities are often expected to pose strong complementary relationships, which plays a crucial role in effective audio-visual fusion. However, they may not always strongly complement each other, they may also exhibit weak complementary relationships, resulting in poor audio-visual feature representations. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Cross-Attention (DCA) model that can dynamically select the cross-attended or unattended features on the fly based on the strong or weak complementary relationships, respectively, across audio and visual modalities. In particular, a conditional gating layer is designed to evaluate the contribution of the cross-attention mechanism and choose cross-attended features only when they exhibit strong complementary relationships, otherwise unattended features. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Voxceleb1 dataset to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model. Results indicate that the proposed model consistently improves the performance on multiple variants of cross-attention while outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyang Xu, Yu Lei, Zeyuan Chen, Xiang Zhang, Yue Zhao, Yilin Wang, Zhuowen Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Bayesian Diffusion Models (BDM), a prediction algorithm that performs effective Bayesian inference by tightly coupling the top-down (prior) information with the bottom-up (data-driven) procedure via joint diffusion processes. We show the effectiveness of BDM on the 3D shape reconstruction task. Compared to prototypical deep learning data-driven approaches trained on paired (supervised) data-labels (e.g. image-point clouds) datasets, our BDM brings in rich prior information from standalone labels (e.g. point clouds) to improve the bottom-up 3D reconstruction. As opposed to the standard Bayesian frameworks where explicit prior and likelihood are required for the inference, BDM performs seamless information fusion via coupled diffusion processes with learned gradient computation networks. The specialty of our BDM lies in its capability to engage the active and effective information exchange and fusion of the top-down and bottom-up processes where each itself is a diffusion process. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks for 3D shape reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bryce Allen Bagley</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement in neurotechnology in recent years has created an emerging critical intersection between neurotechnology and security. Implantable devices, non-invasive monitoring, and non-invasive therapies all carry with them the prospect of violating the privacy and autonomy of individuals' cognition. A growing number of scientists and physicians have made calls to address this issue, but applied efforts have been relatively limited. A major barrier hampering scientific and engineering efforts to address Cognitive Security is the lack of a clear means of describing and analyzing relevant problems. In this paper we develop Cognitive Security, a mathematical framework which enables such description and analysis by drawing on methods and results from multiple fields. We demonstrate certain statistical properties which have significant implications for Cognitive Security, and then present descriptions of the algorithmic problems faced by attackers attempting to violate privacy and autonomy, and defenders attempting to obstruct such attempts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Waligora, Haseeb Aslam, Osama Zeeshan, Soufiane Belharbi, Alessandro Lameiras Koerich, Marco Pedersoli, Simon Bacon, Eric Granger</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MMER) systems typically outperform unimodal systems by leveraging the inter- and intra-modal relationships between, e.g., visual, textual, physiological, and auditory modalities. This paper proposes an MMER method that relies on a joint multimodal transformer (JMT) for fusion with key-based cross-attention. This framework can exploit the complementary nature of diverse modalities to improve predictive accuracy. Separate backbones capture intra-modal spatiotemporal dependencies within each modality over video sequences. Subsequently, our JMT fusion architecture integrates the individual modality embeddings, allowing the model to effectively capture inter- and intra-modal relationships. Extensive experiments on two challenging expression recognition tasks -- (1) dimensional emotion recognition on the Affwild2 dataset (with face and voice) and (2) pain estimation on the Biovid dataset (with face and biosensors) -- indicate that our JMT fusion can provide a cost-effective solution for MMER. Empirical results show that MMER systems with our proposed fusion allow us to outperform relevant baseline and state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lisang Zhou, Ziqian Luo, Xueting Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning-based reliability analysis methods have shown great advancements for their computational efficiency and accuracy. Recently, many efficient learning strategies have been proposed to enhance the computational performance. However, few of them explores the theoretical optimal learning strategy. In this article, we propose several theorems that facilitates such exploration. Specifically, cases that considering and neglecting the correlations among the candidate design samples are well elaborated. Moreover, we prove that the well-known U learning function can be reformulated to the optimal learning function for the case neglecting the Kriging correlation. In addition, the theoretical optimal learning strategy for sequential multiple training samples enrichment is also mathematically explored through the Bayesian estimate with the corresponding lost functions. Simulation results show that the optimal learning strategy considering the Kriging correlation works better than that neglecting the Kriging correlation and other state-of-the art learning functions from the literatures in terms of the reduction of number of evaluations of performance function. However, the implementation needs to investigate very large computational resource.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghuan Liu, Zixuan Chen, Xuxin Cheng, Yandong Ji, Rizhao Qiu, Ruihan Yang, Xiaolong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of mobile manipulation using legged robots equipped with an arm, namely legged loco-manipulation. The robot legs, while usually utilized for mobility, offer an opportunity to amplify the manipulation capabilities by conducting whole-body control. That is, the robot can control the legs and the arm at the same time to extend its workspace. We propose a framework that can conduct the whole-body control autonomously with visual observations. Our approach, namely Visual Whole-Body Control(VBC), is composed of a low-level policy using all degrees of freedom to track the end-effector manipulator position and a high-level policy proposing the end-effector position based on visual inputs. We train both levels of policies in simulation and perform Sim2Real transfer for real robot deployment. We perform extensive experiments and show significant improvements over baselines in picking up diverse objects in different configurations (heights, locations, orientations) and environments.

<p>Abstract: We introduce VoiceCraft, a token infilling neural codec language model, that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both speech editing and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) on audiobooks, internet videos, and podcasts. VoiceCraft employs a Transformer decoder architecture and introduces a token rearrangement procedure that combines causal masking and delayed stacking to enable generation within an existing sequence. On speech editing tasks, VoiceCraft produces edited speech that is nearly indistinguishable from unedited recordings in terms of naturalness, as evaluated by humans; for zero-shot TTS, our model outperforms prior SotA models including VALLE and the popular commercial model XTTS-v2. Crucially, the models are evaluated on challenging and realistic datasets, that consist of diverse accents, speaking styles, recording conditions, and background noise and music, and our model performs consistently well compared to other models and real recordings. In particular, for speech editing evaluation, we introduce a high quality, challenging, and realistic dataset named RealEdit.

<p>Abstract: Individuality and personalization comprise the distinctive characteristics that make each writer unique and influence their words in order to effectively engage readers while conveying authenticity. However, our growing reliance on LLM-based writing assistants risks compromising our creativity and individuality over time. We often overlook the negative impacts of this trend on our creativity and uniqueness, despite the possible consequences. This study investigates these concerns by performing a brief survey to explore different perspectives and concepts, as well as trying to understand people's viewpoints, in conjunction with past studies in the area. Addressing these issues is essential for improving human-computer interaction systems and enhancing writing assistants for personalization and individuality.</p>

However, using writing assistants introduces a mental dilemma, as some content isn't directly our creation. For instance, we tend to credit Large Language Models (LLMs) more in creative tasks, even though all tasks are equal for them. Additionally, while we may not claim complete ownership of LLM-generated content, we freely claim authorship. We conduct a short survey to examine these issues and understand underlying cognitive processes in order to gain a better knowledge of human-computer interaction in writing and improve writing aid systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Because of its use in practice, open-world object detection (OWOD) has gotten a lot of attention recently. The challenge is how can a model detect novel classes and then incrementally learn them without forgetting previously known classes. Previous approaches hinge on strongly-supervised or weakly-supervised novel-class data for novel-class detection, which may not apply to real applications. We construct a new benchmark that novel classes are only encountered at the inference stage. And we propose a new OWOD detector YOLOOC, based on the YOLO architecture yet for the Open-Class setup. We introduce label smoothing to prevent the detector from over-confidently mapping novel classes to known classes and to discover novel classes. Extensive experiments conducted on our more realistic setup demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for discovering novel classes in our new benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chih-Chung Hsu, Chia-Ming Lee, Yang Fan Chiang, Yi-Shiuan Chou, Chih-Yu Jiang, Shen-Chieh Tai, Chi-Han Tsai</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional Computed Tomography (CT) imaging recognition faces two significant challenges: (1) There is often considerable variability in the resolution and size of each CT scan, necessitating strict requirements for the input size and adaptability of models. (2) CT-scan contains large number of out-of-distribution (OOD) slices. The crucial features may only be present in specific spatial regions and slices of the entire CT scan. How can we effectively figure out where these are located? To deal with this, we introduce an enhanced Spatial-Slice Feature Learning (SSFL++) framework specifically designed for CT scan. It aim to filter out a OOD data within whole CT scan, enabling our to select crucial spatial-slice for analysis by reducing 70% redundancy totally. Meanwhile, we proposed Kernel-Density-based slice Sampling (KDS) method to improve the stability when training and inference stage, therefore speeding up the rate of convergence and boosting performance. As a result, the experiments demonstrate the promising performance of our model using a simple EfficientNet-2D (E2D) model, even with only 1% of the training data. The efficacy of our approach has been validated on the COVID-19-CT-DB datasets provided by the DEF-AI-MIA workshop, in conjunction with CVPR 2024.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunxiao Li, Charlie Liu, Jonathan Chung, Zhengyang Lu, Piyush Jha, Vijay Ganesh</p>
<p>Abstract: Restart policy is an important technique used in modern Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) solvers, wherein some parts of the solver state are erased at certain intervals during the run of the solver. In most solvers, variable activities are preserved across restart boundaries, resulting in solvers continuing to search parts of the assignment tree that are not far from the one immediately prior to a restart. To enable the solver to search possibly "distant" parts of the assignment tree, we study the effect of resets, a variant of restarts which not only erases the assignment trail, but also randomizes the activity scores of the variables of the input formula after reset, thus potentially enabling a better global exploration of the search space.
  In this paper, we model the problem of whether to trigger reset as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, and propose two reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive reset policies using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson sampling algorithms. These two algorithms balance the exploration-exploitation tradeoff by adaptively choosing arms (reset vs. no reset) based on their estimated rewards during the solver's run. We implement our reset policies in four baseline SOTA CDCL solvers and compare the baselines against the reset versions on Satcoin benchmarks and SAT Competition instances. Our results show that RL-based reset versions outperform the corresponding baseline solvers on both Satcoin and the SAT competition instances, suggesting that our RL policy helps to dynamically and profitably adapt the reset frequency for any given input instance. We also introduce the concept of a partial reset, where at least a constant number of variable activities are retained across reset boundaries. Building on previous results, we show that there is an exponential separation between O(1) vs. $\Omega(n)$-length partial resets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan C. Mej\'ia-Fragoso, Manuel A. Florez, Roc\'io Bernal-Olaya</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate determination of the geothermal gradient is critical for assessing the geothermal energy potential of a given region. Of particular interest is the case of Colombia, a country with abundant geothermal resources. A history of active oil and gas exploration and production has left drilled boreholes in different geological settings, providing direct measurements of the geothermal gradient. Unfortunately, large regions of the country where geothermal resources might exist lack such measurements. Indirect geophysical measurements are costly and difficult to perform at regional scales. Computational thermal models could be constructed, but they require very detailed knowledge of the underlying geology and uniform sampling of subsurface temperatures to be well-constrained. We present an alternative approach that leverages recent advances in supervised machine learning and available direct measurements to predict the geothermal gradient in regions where only global-scale geophysical datasets and course geological knowledge are available. We find that a Gradient Boosted Regression Tree algorithm yields optimal predictions and extensively validate the trained model. We show that predictions of our model are within 12\% accuracy and that independent measurements performed by other authors agree well with our model. Finnally, we present a geothermal gradient map for Colombia that highlights regions where futher exploration and data collection should be performed.</p>

<p>Abstract: Industry-wide nuclear power plant operating experience is a critical source of raw data for performing parameter estimations in reliability and risk models. Much operating experience information pertains to failure events and is stored as reports containing unstructured data, such as narratives. Event reports are essential for understanding how failures are initiated and propagated, including the numerous causal relations involved. Causal relation extraction using deep learning represents a significant frontier in the field of natural language processing (NLP), and is crucial since it enables the interpretation of intricate narratives and connections contained within vast amounts of written information. This paper proposed a hybrid framework for causality detection and extraction from nuclear licensee event reports. The main contributions include: (1) we compiled an LER corpus with 20,129 text samples for causality analysis, (2) developed an interactive tool for labeling cause effect pairs, (3) built a deep-learning-based approach for causal relation detection, and (4) developed a knowledge based cause-effect extraction approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: The burgeoning interest in developing Large Language Models (LLMs) with up to trillion parameters has been met with concerns regarding resource efficiency and practical expense, particularly given the immense cost of experimentation. This scenario underscores the importance of exploring the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) as a resource-efficient alternative. In this context, we introduce MiniCPM, specifically the 1.2B and 2.4B non-embedding parameter variants, not only excel in their respective categories but also demonstrate capabilities on par with 7B-13B LLMs. While focusing on SLMs, our approach exhibits scalability in both model and data dimensions for future LLM research. Regarding model scaling, we employ extensive model wind tunnel experiments for stable and optimal scaling. For data scaling, we introduce a Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler (LRS), conducive to continuous training and domain adaptation. We present an in-depth analysis of the intriguing training dynamics that occurred in the WSD LRS. With WSD LRS, we are now able to efficiently study data-model scaling law without extensive retraining experiments on both axes of model and data, from which we derive the much higher compute optimal data-model ratio than Chinchilla Optimal. Additionally, we introduce MiniCPM family, including MiniCPM-DPO, MiniCPM-MoE and MiniCPM-128K, whose excellent performance further cementing MiniCPM's foundation in diverse SLM applications.

<p>Abstract: Despite the widespread applications of machine learning force field (MLFF) on solids and small molecules, there is a notable gap in applying MLFF to complex liquid electrolytes. In this work, we introduce BAMBOO (ByteDance AI Molecular Simulation Booster), a novel framework for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with a demonstration of its capabilities in the context of liquid electrolytes for lithium batteries. We design a physics-inspired graph equivariant transformer architecture as the backbone of BAMBOO to learn from quantum mechanical simulations. Additionally, we pioneer an ensemble knowledge distillation approach and apply it on MLFFs to improve the stability of MD simulations. Finally, we propose the density alignment algorithm to align BAMBOO with experimental measurements. BAMBOO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting key electrolyte properties such as density, viscosity, and ionic conductivity across various solvents and salt combinations. Our current model, trained on more than 15 chemical species, achieves the average density error of 0.01 g/cm$^3$ on various compositions compared with experimental data. Moreover, our model demonstrates transferability to molecules not included in the quantum mechanical dataset. We envision this work as paving the way to a "universal MLFF" capable of simulating properties of common organic liquids.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Agiza, Mohamed Mostagir, Sherief Reda</p>
<p>Abstract: In an era where language models are increasingly integrated into decision-making and communication, understanding the biases within Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes imperative, especially when these models are applied in the economic and political domains. This work investigates the impact of fine-tuning and data selection on economic and political biases in LLM. We explore the methodological aspects of biasing LLMs towards specific ideologies, mindful of the biases that arise from their extensive training on diverse datasets. Our approach, distinct from earlier efforts that either focus on smaller models or entail resource-intensive pre-training, employs Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques. These techniques allow for the alignment of LLMs with targeted ideologies by modifying a small subset of parameters. We introduce a systematic method for dataset selection, annotation, and instruction tuning, and we assess its effectiveness through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our work analyzes the potential of embedding specific biases into LLMs and contributes to the dialogue on the ethical application of AI, highlighting the importance of deploying AI in a manner that aligns with societal values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tal Hakim</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of machine-learning solutions to movement assessment from skeleton videos has attracted significant research attention in recent years. This advancement has made rehabilitation at home more accessible, utilizing movement assessment algorithms that can operate on affordable equipment for human pose detection and analysis from 2D or 3D videos. While the primary objective of automatic assessment tasks is to score movements, the automatic generation of feedback highlighting key movement issues has the potential to significantly enhance and accelerate the rehabilitation process. While numerous research works exist in the field of automatic movement assessment, only a handful address feedback generation. In this study, we explain the types of feedback that can be generated, review existing solutions for automatic feedback generation, and discuss future research directions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review of feedback generation in skeletal movement assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujia Yan, Zhiyao Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: The neural semi-Markov Conditional Random Field (semi-CRF) framework has demonstrated promise for event-based piano transcription. In this framework, all events (notes or pedals) are represented as closed intervals tied to specific event types. The neural semi-CRF approach requires an interval scoring matrix that assigns a score for every candidate interval. However, designing an efficient and expressive architecture for scoring intervals is not trivial. In this paper, we introduce a simple method for scoring intervals using scaled inner product operations that resemble how attention scoring is done in transformers. We show theoretically that, due to the special structure from encoding the non-overlapping intervals, under a mild condition, the inner product operations are expressive enough to represent an ideal scoring matrix that can yield the correct transcription result. We then demonstrate that an encoder-only non-hierarchical transformer backbone, operating only on a low-time-resolution feature map, is capable of transcribing piano notes and pedals with high accuracy and time precision. The experiment shows that our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks in terms of the F1 measure on the Maestro dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ricard Puig-i-Valls, Marc Drudis, Supanut Thanasilp, Zo\"e Holmes</p>
<p>Abstract: The barren plateau phenomenon, characterized by loss gradients that vanish exponentially with system size, poses a challenge to scaling variational quantum algorithms. Here we explore the potential of warm starts, whereby one initializes closer to a solution in the hope of enjoying larger loss variances. Focusing on an iterative variational method for learning shorter-depth circuits for quantum real and imaginary time evolution we conduct a case study to elucidate the potential and limitations of warm starts. We start by proving that the iterative variational algorithm will exhibit substantial (at worst vanishing polynomially in system size) gradients in a small region around the initializations at each time-step. Convexity guarantees for these regions are then established, suggesting trainability for polynomial size time-steps. However, our study highlights scenarios where a good minimum shifts outside the region with trainability guarantees. Our analysis leaves open the question whether such minima jumps necessitate optimization across barren plateau landscapes or whether there exist gradient flows, i.e., fertile valleys away from the plateau with substantial gradients, that allow for training.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10108">GeoAI Reproducibility and Replicability: a computational and spatial perspective</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenwen Li, Chia-Yu Hsu, Sizhe Wang, Peter Kedron</p>
<p>Abstract: GeoAI has emerged as an exciting interdisciplinary research area that combines spatial theories and data with cutting-edge AI models to address geospatial problems in a novel, data-driven manner. While GeoAI research has flourished in the GIScience literature, its reproducibility and replicability (R&R), fundamental principles that determine the reusability, reliability, and scientific rigor of research findings, have rarely been discussed. This paper aims to provide an in-depth analysis of this topic from both computational and spatial perspectives. We first categorize the major goals for reproducing GeoAI research, namely, validation (repeatability), learning and adapting the method for solving a similar or new problem (reproducibility), and examining the generalizability of the research findings (replicability). Each of these goals requires different levels of understanding of GeoAI, as well as different methods to ensure its success. We then discuss the factors that may cause the lack of R&R in GeoAI research, with an emphasis on (1) the selection and use of training data; (2) the uncertainty that resides in the GeoAI model design, training, deployment, and inference processes; and more importantly (3) the inherent spatial heterogeneity of geospatial data and processes. We use a deep learning-based image analysis task as an example to demonstrate the results' uncertainty and spatial variance caused by different factors. The findings reiterate the importance of knowledge sharing, as well as the generation of a "replicability map" that incorporates spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity into consideration in quantifying the spatial replicability of GeoAI research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Jiang, Zixin Guo, Hamed Rezazadegan Tavakoli, Luis A. Leiva, Antti Oulasvirta</p>
<p>Abstract: From a visual perception perspective, modern graphical user interfaces (GUIs) comprise a complex graphics-rich two-dimensional visuospatial arrangement of text, images, and interactive objects such as buttons and menus. While existing models can accurately predict regions and objects that are likely to attract attention ``on average'', so far there is no scanpath model capable of predicting scanpaths for an individual. To close this gap, we introduce EyeFormer, which leverages a Transformer architecture as a policy network to guide a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that controls gaze locations. Our model has the unique capability of producing personalized predictions when given a few user scanpath samples. It can predict full scanpath information, including fixation positions and duration, across individuals and various stimulus types. Additionally, we demonstrate applications in GUI layout optimization driven by our model. Our software and models will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduardo Fernandes Montesuma, Fred Ngol\`e Mboula, Antoine Souloumiac</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), a task in transfer learning where one adapts multiple heterogeneous, labeled source probability measures towards a different, unlabeled target measure. We propose a novel framework for MSDA, based on Optimal Transport (OT) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Our framework has two key advantages. First, OT between GMMs can be solved efficiently via linear programming. Second, it provides a convenient model for supervised learning, especially classification, as components in the GMM can be associated with existing classes. Based on the GMM-OT problem, we propose a novel technique for calculating barycenters of GMMs. Based on this novel algorithm, we propose two new strategies for MSDA: GMM-WBT and GMM-DaDiL. We empirically evaluate our proposed methods on four benchmarks in image classification and fault diagnosis, showing that we improve over the prior art while being faster and involving fewer parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present two novel methods in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The first approach, Scattering Transform with E-GraphSAGE (STEG), utilizes the scattering transform to conduct multi-resolution analysis of edge feature vectors. This provides a detailed representation that is essential for identifying subtle anomalies in network traffic. The second approach improves node representation by initiating with Node2Vec, diverging from standard methods of using uniform values, thereby capturing a more accurate and holistic network picture. Our methods have shown significant improvements in performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in benchmark NIDS datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jose M. Munoz, Silviu M. Udrescu, Ronald F. Garcia Ruiz</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerous phenomenological nuclear models have been proposed to describe specific observables within different regions of the nuclear chart. However, developing a unified model that describes the complex behavior of all nuclei remains an open challenge. Here, we explore whether novel symbolic Machine Learning (ML) can rediscover traditional nuclear physics models or identify alternatives with improved simplicity, fidelity, and predictive power. To address this challenge, we developed a Multi-objective Iterated Symbolic Regression approach that handles symbolic regressions over multiple target observables, accounts for experimental uncertainties and is robust against high-dimensional problems. As a proof of principle, we applied this method to describe the nuclear binding energies and charge radii of light and medium mass nuclei. Our approach identified simple analytical relationships based on the number of protons and neutrons, providing interpretable models with precision comparable to state-of-the-art nuclear models. Additionally, we integrated this ML-discovered model with an existing complementary model to estimate the limits of nuclear stability. These results highlight the potential of symbolic ML to develop accurate nuclear models and guide our description of complex many-body problems.</p>
