<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Li, Xingke Yang, Wen Wu, Hao Wang, Tomoaki Ohtsuki, Xin Fu, Miao Pan, Xuemin Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) at mobile devices and its potential applications never fail to fascinate. However, on-device LLM fine-tuning poses great challenges due to extremely high memory requirements and slow training speeds. Even with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods that update only a small subset of parameters, resource-constrained mobile devices cannot afford them. In this paper, we propose MobiLLM to enable memory-efficient transformer LLM fine-tuning on a mobile device via server-assisted side-tuning. Particularly, MobiLLM allows the resource-constrained mobile device to retain merely a frozen backbone model, while offloading the memory and computation-intensive backpropagation of a trainable side-network to a high-performance server. Unlike existing fine-tuning methods that keep trainable parameters inside the frozen backbone, MobiLLM separates a set of parallel adapters from the backbone to create a backpropagation bypass, involving only one-way activation transfers from the mobile device to the server with low-width quantization during forward propagation. In this way, the data never leaves the mobile device while the device can remove backpropagation through the local backbone model and its forward propagation can be paralyzed with the server-side execution. Thus, MobiLLM preserves data privacy while significantly reducing the memory and computational burdens for LLM fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MobiLLM can enable a resource-constrained mobile device, even a CPU-only one, to fine-tune LLMs and significantly reduce convergence time and memory usage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yankai Li, Mo Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Diffusion Models have each demonstrated strong performance in trajectory optimization, decision-making, and motion planning. However, these approaches have traditionally been treated as distinct methodologies with separate optimization frameworks. In this work, we establish a unified perspective that connects MPPI, RL, and Diffusion Models through gradient-based optimization on the Gibbs measure. We first show that MPPI can be interpreted as performing gradient ascent on a smoothed energy function. We then demonstrate that Policy Gradient methods reduce to MPPI when treating policy parameters as control variables under a fixed initial state. Additionally, we establish that the reverse sampling process in diffusion models follows the same update rule as MPPI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vijay Srinivas Tida, Md Imran Hossen, Liqun Shan, Sai Venkatesh Chilukoti, Sonya Hsu, Xiali Hei</p>
<p>Abstract: The optimization of the transpose convolution layer for deep learning applications is achieved with the kernel segregation mechanism. However, kernel segregation has disadvantages, such as computing extra elements to obtain the output feature map with odd dimensions while launching a thread. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a unified kernel segregation approach that limits the usage of memory and computational resources by employing one unified kernel to execute four sub-kernels. The findings reveal that the suggested approach achieves an average computational speedup of 2.03x (3.89x) when tested on specific datasets with an RTX 2070 GPU (Intel Xeon CPU). The ablation study shows an average computational speedup of 3.5x when evaluating the transpose convolution layers from well-known Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The implementation of the proposed method for the transpose convolution layers in the EB-GAN model demonstrates significant memory savings of up to 35 MB.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20499">Data Distributional Properties As Inductive Bias for Systematic Generalization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Felipe del R\'io, Alain Raymond-S\'aez, Daniel Florea, Rodrigo Toro Icarte, Julio Hurtado, Cristi\'an Buc Calder\'on, \'Alvaro Soto</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) struggle at systematic generalization (SG). Several studies have evaluated the possibility to promote SG through the proposal of novel architectures, loss functions or training methodologies. Few studies, however, have focused on the role of training data properties in promoting SG. In this work, we investigate the impact of certain data distributional properties, as inductive biases for the SG ability of a multi-modal language model. To this end, we study three different properties. First, data diversity, instantiated as an increase in the possible values a latent property in the training distribution may take. Second, burstiness, where we probabilistically restrict the number of possible values of latent factors on particular inputs during training. Third, latent intervention, where a particular latent factor is altered randomly during training. We find that all three factors significantly enhance SG, with diversity contributing an 89\% absolute increase in accuracy in the most affected property. Through a series of experiments, we test various hypotheses to understand why these properties promote SG. Finally, we find that Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) between latent attributes in the training distribution is strongly predictive of out-of-distribution generalization. We find that a mechanism by which lower NMI induces SG is in the geometry of representations. In particular, we find that NMI induces more parallelism in neural representations (i.e., input features coded in parallel neural vectors) of the model, a property related to the capacity of reasoning by analogy.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20525">Revisiting Kernel Attention with Correlated Gaussian Process Representation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Minh Bui, Tho Tran Huu, Duy Dinh, Tan Minh Nguyen, Trong Nghia Hoang</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have increasingly become the de facto method to model sequential data with state-of-the-art performance. Due to its widespread use, being able to estimate and calibrate its modeling uncertainty is important to understand and design robust transformer models. To achieve this, previous works have used Gaussian processes (GPs) to perform uncertainty calibration for the attention units of transformers and attained notable successes. However, such approaches have to confine the transformers to the space of symmetric attention to ensure the necessary symmetric requirement of their GP's kernel specification, which reduces the representation capacity of the model. To mitigate this restriction, we propose the Correlated Gaussian Process Transformer (CGPT), a new class of transformers whose self-attention units are modeled as cross-covariance between two correlated GPs (CGPs). This allows asymmetries in attention and can enhance the representation capacity of GP-based transformers. We also derive a sparse approximation for CGP to make it scale better. Our empirical studies show that both CGP-based and sparse CGP-based transformers achieve better performance than state-of-the-art GP-based transformers on a variety of benchmark tasks. The code for our experiments is available at https://github.com/MinhLong210/CGP-Transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kechen Li, Wenqi Zhu, Coralia Cartis, Tianbo Ji, Shiwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved human-level proficiency across diverse tasks, but their ability to perform rigorous mathematical problem solving remains an open challenge. In this work, we investigate a fundamental yet computationally intractable problem: determining whether a given multivariate polynomial is nonnegative. This problem, closely related to Hilbert's Seventeenth Problem, plays a crucial role in global polynomial optimization and has applications in various fields. First, we introduce SoS-1K, a meticulously curated dataset of approximately 1,000 polynomials, along with expert-designed reasoning instructions based on five progressively challenging criteria. Evaluating multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that without structured guidance, all models perform only slightly above the random guess baseline 50%. However, high-quality reasoning instructions significantly improve accuracy, boosting performance up to 81%. Furthermore, our 7B model, SoS-7B, fine-tuned on SoS-1K for just 4 hours, outperforms the 671B DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o-mini in accuracy while only requiring 1.8% and 5% of the computation time needed for letters, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to push the boundaries of mathematical reasoning and tackle NP-hard problems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20548">$Q\sharp$: Provably Optimal Distributional RL for LLM Post-Training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Peng Zhou, Kaiwen Wang, Jonathan Chang, Zhaolin Gao, Nathan Kallus, Kilian Q. Weinberger, Kiant\'e Brantley, Wen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is crucial for LLM alignment and reasoning, but existing policy-based methods, such as PPO and DPO, can fall short of fixing shortcuts inherited from pre-training. In this work, we introduce $Q\sharp$, a value-based algorithm for KL-regularized RL that guides the reference policy using the optimal regularized $Q$ function. We propose to learn the optimal $Q$ function using distributional RL on an aggregated online dataset. Unlike prior value-based baselines that guide the model using unregularized $Q$-values, our method is theoretically principled and provably learns the optimal policy for the KL-regularized RL problem. Empirically, $Q\sharp$ outperforms prior baselines in math reasoning benchmarks while maintaining a smaller KL divergence to the reference policy. Theoretically, we establish a reduction from KL-regularized RL to no-regret online learning, providing the first bounds for deterministic MDPs under only realizability. Thanks to distributional RL, our bounds are also variance-dependent and converge faster when the reference policy has small variance. In sum, our results highlight $Q\sharp$ as an effective approach for post-training LLMs, offering both improved performance and theoretical guarantees.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20560">Towards Statistical Factuality Guarantee for Large Vision-Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuohang Li, Chao Yan, Nicholas J. Jackson, Wendi Cui, Bo Li, Jiaxin Zhang, Bradley A. Malin</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in a variety of vision-language tasks involving image-conditioned free-form text generation. However, growing concerns about hallucinations in LVLMs, where the generated text is inconsistent with the visual context, are becoming a major impediment to deploying these models in applications that demand guaranteed reliability. In this paper, we introduce a framework to address this challenge, ConfLVLM, which is grounded on conformal prediction to achieve finite-sample distribution-free statistical guarantees on the factuality of LVLM output. This framework treats an LVLM as a hypothesis generator, where each generated text detail (or claim) is considered an individual hypothesis. It then applies a statistical hypothesis testing procedure to verify each claim using efficient heuristic uncertainty measures to filter out unreliable claims before returning any responses to users. We conduct extensive experiments covering three representative application domains, including general scene understanding, medical radiology report generation, and document understanding. Remarkably, ConfLVLM reduces the error rate of claims generated by LLaVa-1.5 for scene descriptions from 87.8\% to 10.0\% by filtering out erroneous claims with a 95.3\% true positive rate. Our results further demonstrate that ConfLVLM is highly flexible, and can be applied to any black-box LVLMs paired with any uncertainty measure for any image-conditioned free-form text generation task while providing a rigorous guarantee on controlling the risk of hallucination.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20565">DPZV: Resource Efficient ZO Optimization For Differentially Private VFL</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianing Zhang, Evan Chen, Chaoyue Liu, Christopher G. Brinton</p>
<p>Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative model training across feature-partitioned data, yet faces significant privacy risks and inefficiencies when scaling to large models. We propose DPZV, a memory-efficient Zeroth-Order(ZO) optimization framework that integrates differential privacy (DP) with vertical federated learning, addressing three critical challenges: (1) privacy vulnerabilities from gradient leakage, (2) high computation/communication costs of first-order methods, and (3) excessive memory footprint in conventional zeroth-order approaches. Our framework eliminates backpropagation through two-point gradient estimation, reducing client memory usage by 90\% compared to first-order counterparts while enabling asynchronous communication. By strategically injecting Gaussian noise on the server, DPZV achieves rigorous $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees without third-party trust assumptions. Theoretical analysis establishes a convergence rate matching centralized case under non-convex objectives. Extensive experiments on image and NLP benchmarks demonstrate that DPZV outperforms all baselines in accuracy while providing strong privacy assurances ($\epsilon \leq 10$) and requiring far fewer computation resources, establishing new state-of-the-art privacy-utility tradeoffs for resource-constrained VFL deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaan Ozkara, Tao Yu, Youngsuk Park</p>
<p>Abstract: As the parameters of Large Language Models (LLMs) have scaled to hundreds of billions, the demand for efficient training methods -- balancing faster computation and reduced memory usage without sacrificing accuracy -- has become more critical than ever. In recent years, various mixed precision strategies, which involve different precision levels for optimization components, have been proposed to increase training speed with minimal accuracy degradation. However, these strategies often require manual adjustments and lack theoretical justification. In this work, we leverage stochastic rounding (SR) to address numerical errors of training with low-precision representation. We provide theoretical analyses of implicit regularization and convergence under the Adam optimizer when SR is utilized. With the insights from these analyses, we extend previous BF16 + SR strategy to be used in distributed settings, enhancing the stability and performance for large scale training. Empirical results from pre-training models with up to 6.7B parameters, for the first time, demonstrate that our BF16 with SR strategy outperforms (BF16, FP32) mixed precision strategies, achieving better validation perplexity, up to $1.54\times$ higher throughput, and $30\%$ less memory usage.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20571">PFformer: A Position-Free Transformer Variant for Extreme-Adaptive Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanhong Li, David C. Anastasiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is vital in fields like weather, energy, and finance. However, despite deep learning advancements, traditional Transformer-based models often diminish the effect of crucial inter-variable relationships by singular token embedding and struggle to effectively capture complex dependencies among variables, especially in datasets with rare or extreme events. These events create significant imbalances and lead to high skewness, complicating accurate prediction efforts. This study introduces PFformer, a position-free Transformer-based model designed for single-target MTS forecasting, specifically for challenging datasets characterized by extreme variability. PFformer integrates two novel embedding strategies: Enhanced Feature-based Embedding (EFE) and Auto-Encoder-based Embedding (AEE). EFE effectively encodes inter-variable dependencies by mapping related sequence subsets to high-dimensional spaces without positional constraints, enhancing the encoder's functionality. PFformer shows superior forecasting accuracy without the traditional limitations of positional encoding in MTS modeling. We evaluated PFformer across four challenging datasets, focusing on two key forecasting scenarios: long sequence prediction for 3 days ahead and rolling predictions every four hours to reflect real-time decision-making processes in water management. PFformer demonstrated remarkable improvements, from 20% to 60%, compared with state-of-the-art models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20580">Training Large Neural Networks With Low-Dimensional Error Feedback</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Maher Hanut, Jonathan Kadmon</p>
<p>Abstract: Training deep neural networks typically relies on backpropagating high dimensional error signals a computationally intensive process with little evidence supporting its implementation in the brain. However, since most tasks involve low-dimensional outputs, we propose that low-dimensional error signals may suffice for effective learning. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a novel local learning rule based on Feedback Alignment that leverages indirect, low-dimensional error feedback to train large networks. Our method decouples the backward pass from the forward pass, enabling precise control over error signal dimensionality while maintaining high-dimensional representations. We begin with a detailed theoretical derivation for linear networks, which forms the foundation of our learning framework, and extend our approach to nonlinear, convolutional, and transformer architectures. Remarkably, we demonstrate that even minimal error dimensionality on the order of the task dimensionality can achieve performance matching that of traditional backpropagation. Furthermore, our rule enables efficient training of convolutional networks, which have previously been resistant to Feedback Alignment methods, with minimal error. This breakthrough not only paves the way toward more biologically accurate models of learning but also challenges the conventional reliance on high-dimensional gradient signals in neural network training. Our findings suggest that low-dimensional error signals can be as effective as high-dimensional ones, prompting a reevaluation of gradient-based learning in high-dimensional systems. Ultimately, our work offers a fresh perspective on neural network optimization and contributes to understanding learning mechanisms in both artificial and biological systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keisuke Kamahori, Jungo Kasai, Noriyuki Kojima, Baris Kasikci</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, such as OpenAI's Whisper, rely on deep encoder-decoder architectures, and their encoders are a critical bottleneck for efficient deployment due to high computational intensity. We introduce LiteASR, a low-rank compression scheme for ASR encoders that significantly reduces inference costs while maintaining transcription accuracy. Our approach leverages the strong low-rank properties observed in intermediate activations: by applying principal component analysis (PCA) with a small calibration dataset, we approximate linear transformations with a chain of low-rank matrix multiplications, and further optimize self-attention to work in the reduced dimension. Evaluation results show that our method can compress Whisper large-v3's encoder size by over 50%, matching Whisper medium's size with better transcription accuracy, thereby establishing a new Pareto-optimal frontier of efficiency and performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Albert Tseng, Tao Yu, Youngsuk Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Low precision (LP) datatypes such as MXFP4 can accelerate matrix multiplications (GEMMs) and reduce training costs. However, directly using MXFP4 instead of BF16 during training significantly degrades model quality. In this work, we present the first near-lossless training recipe that uses MXFP4 GEMMs, which are $2\times$ faster than FP8 on supported hardware. Our key insight is to compute unbiased gradient estimates with stochastic rounding (SR), resulting in more accurate model updates. However, directly applying SR to MXFP4 can result in high variance from block-level outliers, harming convergence. To overcome this, we use the random Hadamard tranform to theoretically bound the variance of SR. We train GPT models up to 6.7B parameters and find that our method induces minimal degradation over mixed-precision BF16 training. Our recipe computes $>1/2$ the training FLOPs in MXFP4, enabling an estimated speedup of $>1.3\times$ over FP8 and $>1.7\times$ over BF16 during backpropagation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of vision applications of increasing complexity and scales, yet choosing the right VLM model size involves a trade-off between response quality and cost. While smaller VLMs are cheaper to run, they typically produce responses only marginally better than random guessing on benchmarks such as MMMU.
  In this paper, we propose Cache of Thought (CoT), a master apprentice framework for collaborative inference between large and small VLMs. CoT manages high quality query results from large VLMs (master) in a cache, which are then selected via a novel multi modal retrieval and in-context learning to aid the performance of small VLMs (apprentice). We extensively evaluate CoT on various widely recognized and challenging general VQA benchmarks, and show that CoT increases overall VQA performance by up to 7.7% under the same budget, and specifically boosts the performance of apprentice VLMs by up to 36.6%.</p>

Our empirical studies, adopting convolutional neural networks and transformers on multiple benchmark datasets, reveal that moderate temperatures generally introduce better overall performance. Through extensive experiments and rigorous theoretical analysis, we explore the role of temperature scaling in model training and unveil that temperature not only influences learning step size but also shapes the model's optimization direction. Moreover, for the first time, we discover a surprising benefit of elevated temperatures: enhanced model robustness against common corruption, natural perturbation, and non-targeted adversarial attacks like Projected Gradient Descent. We extend our discoveries to adversarial training, demonstrating that, compared to the standard softmax function with the default temperature value, higher temperatures have the potential to enhance adversarial training. The insights of this work open new avenues for improving model performance and security in deep learning applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vicente Balmaseda, Bokun Wang, Ching-Long Lin, Tianbao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In self-supervised contrastive learning, negative pairs are typically constructed using an anchor image and a sample drawn from the entire dataset, excluding the anchor. However, this approach can result in the creation of negative pairs with similar semantics, referred to as "false negatives", leading to their embeddings being falsely pushed apart. To address this issue, we introduce GloFND, an optimization-based approach that automatically learns on the fly the threshold for each anchor data to identify its false negatives during training. In contrast to previous methods for false negative discovery, our approach globally detects false negatives across the entire dataset rather than locally within the mini-batch. Moreover, its per-iteration computation cost remains independent of the dataset size. Experimental results on image and image-text data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/vibalcam/GloFND .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vaishnavi Pulavarthi, Deeksha Nandal, Soham Dan, Debjit Pal</p>
<p>Abstract: Assertions have been the de facto collateral for simulation-based and formal verification of hardware designs for over a decade. The quality of hardware verification, i.e., detection and diagnosis of corner-case design bugs, is critically dependent on the quality of the assertions. With the onset of generative AI such as Transformers and Large-Language Models (LLMs), there has been a renewed interest in developing novel, effective, and scalable techniques of generating functional and security assertions from design source code. While there have been recent works that use commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) LLMs for assertion generation, there is no comprehensive study in quantifying the effectiveness of LLMs in generating syntactically and semantically correct assertions. In this paper, we first discuss AssertionBench from our prior work, a comprehensive set of designs and assertions to quantify the goodness of a broad spectrum of COTS LLMs for the task of assertion generations from hardware design source code. Our key insight was that COTS LLMs are not yet ready for prime-time adoption for assertion generation as they generate a considerable fraction of syntactically and semantically incorrect assertions. Motivated by the insight, we propose AssertionLLM, a first of its kind LLM model, specifically fine-tuned for assertion generation. Our initial experimental results show that AssertionLLM considerably improves the semantic and syntactic correctness of the generated assertions over COTS LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal data, which commonly arise in real-world applications such as traffic monitoring, financial transactions, and ride-share demands, represent a special category of multivariate time series. They exhibit two distinct characteristics: high dimensionality and commensurability across spatial locations. These attributes call for computationally efficient modeling approaches and facilitate the use of univariate forecasting models in a channel-independent fashion. SparseTSF, a recently introduced competitive univariate forecasting model, harnesses periodicity to achieve compactness by concentrating on cross-period dynamics, thereby extending the Pareto frontier with respect to model size and predictive performance. Nonetheless, it underperforms on spatio-temporal data due to an inadequate capture of intra-period temporal dependencies. To address this shortcoming, we propose UltraSTF, which integrates a cross-period forecasting module with an ultra-compact shape bank component. Our model effectively detects recurring patterns in time series through the attention mechanism of the shape bank component, thereby strengthening its ability to learn intra-period dynamics. UltraSTF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LargeST benchmark while employing fewer than 0.2% of the parameters required by the second-best approaches, thus further extending the Pareto frontier of existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leming Shen, Qiang Yang, Kaiyan Cui, Yuanqing Zheng, Xiao-Yong Wei, Jianwei Liu, Jinsong Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates collaborative training of a shared global model without exposing clients' private data. In practical FL systems, clients (e.g., edge servers, smartphones, and wearables) typically have disparate system resources. Conventional FL, however, adopts a one-size-fits-all solution, where a homogeneous large global model is transmitted to and trained on each client, resulting in an overwhelming workload for less capable clients and starvation for other clients. To address this issue, we propose FedConv, a client-friendly FL framework, which minimizes the computation and memory burden on resource-constrained clients by providing heterogeneous customized sub-models. FedConv features a novel learning-on-model paradigm that learns the parameters of the heterogeneous sub-models via convolutional compression. Unlike traditional compression methods, the compressed models in FedConv can be directly trained on clients without decompression. To aggregate the heterogeneous sub-models, we propose transposed convolutional dilation to convert them back to large models with a unified size while retaining personalized information from clients. The compression and dilation processes, transparent to clients, are optimized on the server leveraging a small public dataset. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that FedConv outperforms state-of-the-art FL systems in terms of model accuracy (by more than 35% on average), computation and communication overhead (with 33% and 25% reduction, respectively).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyungi Lee, Chaeyun Jang, Dongbok Lee, Juho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Meta-learning aims to train models that can generalize to new tasks with limited labeled data by extracting shared features across diverse task datasets. Additionally, it accounts for prediction uncertainty during both training and evaluation, a concept known as uncertainty-aware meta-learning. Neural Process(NP) is a well-known uncertainty-aware meta-learning method that constructs implicit stochastic processes using parametric neural networks, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks. However, existing NP methods face challenges in accommodating diverse input dimensions and learned features, limiting their broad applicability across regression tasks. To address these limitations and advance the utility of NP models as general regressors, we introduce Dimension Agnostic Neural Processes(DANP). DANP incorporates Dimension Aggregator Block(DAB) to transform input features into a fixed-dimensional space, enhancing the model's ability to handle diverse datasets. Furthermore, leveraging the Transformer architecture and latent encoding layers, DANP learns a wider range of features that are generalizable across various tasks. Through comprehensive experimentation on various synthetic and practical regression tasks, we empirically show that DANP outperforms previous NP variations, showcasing its effectiveness in overcoming the limitations of traditional NP models and its potential for broader applicability in diverse regression scenarios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20677">FoCTTA: Low-Memory Continual Test-Time Adaptation with Focus</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Youbing Hu, Yun Cheng, Zimu Zhou, Anqi Lu, Zhiqiang Cao, Zhijun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual adaptation to domain shifts at test time (CTTA) is crucial for enhancing the intelligence of deep learning enabled IoT applications. However, prevailing TTA methods, which typically update all batch normalization (BN) layers, exhibit two memory inefficiencies. First, the reliance on BN layers for adaptation necessitates large batch sizes, leading to high memory usage. Second, updating all BN layers requires storing the activations of all BN layers for backpropagation, exacerbating the memory demand. Both factors lead to substantial memory costs, making existing solutions impractical for IoT devices. In this paper, we present FoCTTA, a low-memory CTTA strategy. The key is to automatically identify and adapt a few drift-sensitive representation layers, rather than blindly update all BN layers. The shift from BN to representation layers eliminates the need for large batch sizes. Also, by updating adaptation-critical layers only, FoCTTA avoids storing excessive activations. This focused adaptation approach ensures that FoCTTA is not only memory-efficient but also maintains effective adaptation. Evaluations show that FoCTTA improves the adaptation accuracy over the state-of-the-arts by 4.5%, 4.9%, and 14.8% on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C under the same memory constraints. Across various batch sizes, FoCTTA reduces the memory usage by 3-fold on average, while improving the accuracy by 8.1%, 3.6%, and 0.2%, respectively, on the three datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyi Zhong, Weidong Bao, Ji Wang, Shuai Zhang, Jingxuan Zhou, Lingjuan Lyu, Wei Yang Bryan Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning is a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving collaborative model training. In practice, it is essential not only to continuously train the model to acquire new knowledge but also to guarantee old knowledge the right to be forgotten (i.e., federated unlearning), especially for privacy-sensitive information or harmful knowledge. However, current federated unlearning methods face several challenges, including indiscriminate unlearning of cross-client knowledge, irreversibility of unlearning, and significant unlearning costs. To this end, we propose a method named FUSED, which first identifies critical layers by analyzing each layer's sensitivity to knowledge and constructs sparse unlearning adapters for sensitive ones. Then, the adapters are trained without altering the original parameters, overwriting the unlearning knowledge with the remaining knowledge. This knowledge overwriting process enables FUSED to mitigate the effects of indiscriminate unlearning. Moreover, the introduction of independent adapters makes unlearning reversible and significantly reduces the unlearning costs. Finally, extensive experiments on three datasets across various unlearning scenarios demonstrate that FUSED's effectiveness is comparable to Retraining, surpassing all other baselines while greatly reducing unlearning costs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20719">Generating Clinically Realistic EHR Data via a Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanglin Zhou, Sebastiano Barbieri</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating realistic synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) holds tremendous promise for accelerating healthcare research, facilitating AI model development and enhancing patient privacy. However, existing generative methods typically treat EHRs as flat sequences of discrete medical codes. This approach overlooks two critical aspects: the inherent hierarchical organization of clinical coding systems and the rich semantic context provided by code descriptions. Consequently, synthetic patient sequences often lack high clinical fidelity and have limited utility in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer (HiSGT), a novel framework that leverages both hierarchical and semantic information for the generative process. HiSGT constructs a hierarchical graph to encode parent-child and sibling relationships among clinical codes and employs a graph neural network to derive hierarchy-aware embeddings. These are then fused with semantic embeddings extracted from a pre-trained clinical language model (e.g., ClinicalBERT), enabling the Transformer-based generator to more accurately model the nuanced clinical patterns inherent in real EHRs. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that HiSGT significantly improves the statistical alignment of synthetic data with real patient records, as well as supports robust downstream applications such as chronic disease classification. By addressing the limitations of conventional raw code-based generative models, HiSGT represents a significant step toward clinically high-fidelity synthetic data generation and a general paradigm suitable for interpretable medical code representation, offering valuable applications in data augmentation and privacy-preserving healthcare analytics.</p>

<p>Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have emerged as an efficient alternative to transformer-based models, offering linear complexity that scales better than transformers. One of the latest advances in SSMs, Mamba, introduces a selective scan mechanism that assigns trainable weights to input tokens, effectively mimicking the attention mechanism. Mamba has also been successfully extended to the vision domain by decomposing 2D images into smaller patches and arranging them as 1D sequences. However, it remains unclear how these patches interact with (or attend to) each other in relation to their original 2D spatial location. Additionally, the order used to arrange the patches into a sequence also significantly impacts their attention distribution. To better understand the attention between patches and explore the attention patterns, we introduce a visual analytics tool specifically designed for vision-based Mamba models. This tool enables a deeper understanding of how attention is distributed across patches in different Mamba blocks and how it evolves throughout a Mamba model. Using the tool, we also investigate the impact of different patch-ordering strategies on the learned attention, offering further insights into the model's behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xunhao Lai, Jianqiao Lu, Yao Luo, Yiyuan Ma, Xun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encounter computational challenges during long-sequence inference, especially in the attention pre-filling phase, where the complexity grows quadratically with the prompt length. Previous efforts to mitigate these challenges have relied on fixed sparse attention patterns or identifying sparse attention patterns based on limited cases. However, these methods lacked the flexibility to efficiently adapt to varying input demands. In this paper, we introduce FlexPrefill, a Flexible sparse Pre-filling mechanism that dynamically adjusts sparse attention patterns and computational budget in real-time to meet the specific requirements of each input and attention head. The flexibility of our method is demonstrated through two key innovations: 1) Query-Aware Sparse Pattern Determination: By measuring Jensen-Shannon divergence, this component adaptively switches between query-specific diverse attention patterns and predefined attention patterns. 2) Cumulative-Attention Based Index Selection: This component dynamically selects query-key indexes to be computed based on different attention patterns, ensuring the sum of attention scores meets a predefined threshold. FlexPrefill adaptively optimizes the sparse pattern and sparse ratio of each attention head based on the prompt, enhancing efficiency in long-sequence inference tasks. Experimental results show significant improvements in both speed and accuracy over prior methods, providing a more flexible and efficient solution for LLM inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automating cloud configuration and deployment remains a critical challenge due to evolving infrastructures, heterogeneous hardware, and fluctuating workloads. Existing solutions lack adaptability and require extensive manual tuning, leading to inefficiencies and misconfigurations. We introduce LADs, the first LLM-driven framework designed to tackle these challenges by ensuring robustness, adaptability, and efficiency in automated cloud management. Instead of merely applying existing techniques, LADs provides a principled approach to configuration optimization through in-depth analysis of what optimization works under which conditions. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Few-Shot Learning, Chain-of-Thought, and Feedback-Based Prompt Chaining, LADs generates accurate configurations and learns from deployment failures to iteratively refine system settings. Our findings reveal key insights into the trade-offs between performance, cost, and scalability, helping practitioners determine the right strategies for different deployment scenarios. For instance, we demonstrate how prompt chaining-based adaptive feedback loops enhance fault tolerance in multi-tenant environments and how structured log analysis with example shots improves configuration accuracy. Through extensive evaluations, LADs reduces manual effort, optimizes resource utilization, and improves system reliability. By open-sourcing LADs, we aim to drive further innovation in AI-powered DevOps automation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sparse principal component analysis (PCA) is a well-established dimensionality reduction technique that is often used for unsupervised feature selection (UFS). However, determining the regularization parameters is rather challenging, and conventional approaches, including grid search and Bayesian optimization, not only bring great computational costs but also exhibit high sensitivity. To address these limitations, we first establish a structured sparse PCA formulation by integrating $\ell_1$-norm and $\ell_{2,1}$-norm to capture the local and global structures, respectively. Building upon the off-the-shelf alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimization framework, we then design an interpretable deep unfolding network that translates iterative optimization steps into trainable neural architectures. This innovation enables automatic learning of the regularization parameters, effectively bypassing the empirical tuning requirements of conventional methods. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets validate the advantages of our proposed method over the existing state-of-the-art methods.

These findings offer the first empirical insights into Galois group probabilities under height constraints and lay the groundwork for exploring solvability by radicals. Demonstrating AI's potential to reveal patterns beyond traditional symbolic techniques, this work paves the way for future research in computational algebra, with implications for probabilistic conjectures and higher degree classifications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as a promising alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, empirical evaluations consistently reveal suboptimal performance in DPO compared to common RLHF pipelines. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of DPO's training dynamics and identify gradient imbalance as a critical limitation. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that this imbalance perturbs optimization trajectories, destabilizes learning, and induces suboptimal convergence. To address this issue, we propose Balanced-DPO, a simple yet effective modification to the DPO objective that introduces a computationally efficient gradient reweighting mechanism. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Balanced-DPO, validating the theoretical findings and confirming that addressing gradient imbalance is key to improving DPO's performance, highlighting a promising direction for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pre-training Transformers in FP4 precision is becoming a promising approach to gain substantial speedup, but it comes with a considerable loss of accuracy. Microscaling (MX) data format provides a fine-grained per-group quantization method to improve the representation ability of the FP4 format and is supported by the next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture. However, training with MXFP4 data format still results in significant degradation and there is a lack of systematic research on the reason.
  In this work, we propose a novel training method TetraJet for a more accurate FP4 training. We comprehensively evaluate all of the quantizers involved in the training, and identify the weight oscillation problem in the forward pass as the main source of the degradation in MXFP4 training. Therefore, we introduce two novel methods, EMA Quantizer (Q-EMA) and Adaptive Ramping Optimizer (Q-Ramping), to resolve the oscillation problem. Extensive experiments on Vision Transformers demonstrate that TetraJet consistently outperforms the existing 4-bit training methods, and Q-EMA & Q-Ramping can provide additional enhancement by effectively reducing oscillation. We decreased the accuracy degradation by more than $50\%$ compared to the baseline, and can even achieve competitive performance compared to full precision training.

<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning has become a key method for training deep learning models when labeled data is scarce or unavailable. While graph machine learning holds great promise across various domains, the design of effective pretext tasks for self-supervised graph representation learning remains challenging. Contrastive learning, a popular approach in graph self-supervised learning, leverages positive and negative pairs to compute a contrastive loss function. However, current graph contrastive learning methods often struggle to fully use structural patterns and node similarities. To address these issues, we present a new method called Fused Gromov Wasserstein Subgraph Contrastive Learning (FOSSIL). Our model integrates node-level and subgraph-level contrastive learning, seamlessly combining a standard node-level contrastive loss with the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance. This combination helps our method capture both node features and graph structure together. Importantly, our approach works well with both homophilic and heterophilic graphs and can dynamically create views for generating positive and negative pairs. Through extensive experiments on benchmark graph datasets, we show that FOSSIL outperforms or achieves competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20914">Everything, Everywhere, All at Once: Is Mechanistic Interpretability Identifiable?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxime M\'eloux, Silviu Maniu, Fran\c{c}ois Portet, Maxime Peyrard</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI systems are used in high-stakes applications, ensuring interpretability is crucial. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to reverse-engineer neural networks by extracting human-understandable algorithms to explain their behavior. This work examines a key question: for a given behavior, and under MI's criteria, does a unique explanation exist? Drawing on identifiability in statistics, where parameters are uniquely inferred under specific assumptions, we explore the identifiability of MI explanations.
  We identify two main MI strategies: (1) "where-then-what," which isolates a circuit replicating model behavior before interpreting it, and (2) "what-then-where," which starts with candidate algorithms and searches for neural activation subspaces implementing them, using causal alignment.
  We test both strategies on Boolean functions and small multi-layer perceptrons, fully enumerating candidate explanations. Our experiments reveal systematic non-identifiability: multiple circuits can replicate behavior, a circuit can have multiple interpretations, several algorithms can align with the network, and one algorithm can align with different subspaces.
  Is uniqueness necessary? A pragmatic approach may require only predictive and manipulability standards. If uniqueness is essential for understanding, stricter criteria may be needed. We also reference the inner interpretability framework, which validates explanations through multiple criteria. This work contributes to defining explanation standards in AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Metod Jazbec, Eliot Wong-Toi, Guoxuan Xia, Dan Zhang, Eric Nalisnick, Stephan Mandt</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently driven significant breakthroughs in generative modeling. While state-of-the-art models produce high-quality samples on average, individual samples can still be low quality. Detecting such samples without human inspection remains a challenging task. To address this, we propose a Bayesian framework for estimating generative uncertainty of synthetic samples. We outline how to make Bayesian inference practical for large, modern generative models and introduce a new semantic likelihood (evaluated in the latent space of a feature extractor) to address the challenges posed by high-dimensional sample spaces. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed generative uncertainty effectively identifies poor-quality samples and significantly outperforms existing uncertainty-based methods. Notably, our Bayesian framework can be applied post-hoc to any pretrained diffusion or flow matching model (via the Laplace approximation), and we propose simple yet effective techniques to minimize its computational overhead during sampling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Petr Sokerin, Dmitry Anikin, Sofia Krehova, Alexey Zaytsev</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of deep learning led to the broad usage of neural networks in the time series domain for various applications, including finance and medicine. While powerful, these models are prone to adversarial attacks: a benign targeted perturbation of input data leads to significant changes in a classifier's output. However, formally small attacks in the time series domain become easily detected by the human eye or a simple detector model.
  We develop a concealed adversarial attack for different time-series models: it provides more realistic perturbations, being hard to detect by a human or model discriminator. To achieve this goal, the proposed adversarial attack maximizes an aggregation of a classifier and a trained discriminator loss. To make the attack stronger, we also propose a training procedure for a discriminator that provides broader coverage of possible attacks. Extensive benchmarking on six UCR time series datasets across four diverse architectures - including recurrent, convolutional, state-space, and transformer-based models - demonstrates the superiority of our attack for a concealability-efficiency trade-off. Our findings highlight the growing challenge of designing robust time series models, emphasizing the need for improved defenses against realistic and effective attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jindong Li, Tim Hamann, Jens Barth, Peter Kaempf, Dario Zanca, Bjoern Eskofier</p>
<p>Abstract: Online handwriting recognition (HWR) using data from inertial measurement units (IMUs) remains challenging due to variations in writing styles and the limited availability of high-quality annotated datasets. Traditional models often struggle to recognize handwriting from unseen writers, making writer-independent (WI) recognition a crucial but difficult problem. This paper presents an HWR model with an encoder-decoder structure for IMU data, featuring a CNN-based encoder for feature extraction and a BiLSTM decoder for sequence modeling, which supports inputs of varying lengths. Our approach demonstrates strong robustness and data efficiency, outperforming existing methods on WI datasets, including the WI split of the OnHW dataset and our own dataset. Extensive evaluations show that our model maintains high accuracy across different age groups and writing conditions while effectively learning from limited data. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze key design choices, achieving a balance between accuracy and efficiency. These findings contribute to the development of more adaptable and scalable HWR systems for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giseung Park, Youngchul Sung</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective reward dimension reduction method to tackle the scalability challenges of multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithms. While most existing approaches focus on optimizing two to four objectives, their abilities to scale to environments with more objectives remain uncertain. Our method uses a dimension reduction approach to enhance learning efficiency and policy performance in multi-objective settings. While most traditional dimension reduction methods are designed for static datasets, our approach is tailored for online learning and preserves Pareto-optimality after transformation. We propose a new training and evaluation framework for reward dimension reduction in multi-objective reinforcement learning and demonstrate the superiority of our method in environments including one with sixteen objectives, significantly outperforming existing online dimension reduction methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gerion Spielberger, Florian Artinger, Jochen Reb, Rudolf Kerschreiter</p>
<p>Abstract: Analyzing textual data is the cornerstone of qualitative research. While traditional methods such as grounded theory and content analysis are widely used, they are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Topic modeling offers an automated complement. Yet, existing approaches, including LLM-based topic modeling, still struggle with issues such as high data preprocessing requirements, interpretability, and reliability. This paper introduces Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) as a method for topic modeling with LLMs. It integrates three key components: (1) retrieval, enabling automatized access to external data beyond an LLM's pre-trained knowledge; (2) generation, leveraging LLM capabilities for text synthesis; and (3) agent-driven learning, iteratively refining retrieval and query formulation processes. To empirically validate Agentic RAG for topic modeling, we reanalyze a Twitter/X dataset, previously examined by Mu et al. (2024a). Our findings demonstrate that the approach is more efficient, interpretable and at the same time achieves higher reliability and validity in comparison to the standard machine learning approach but also in comparison to LLM prompting for topic modeling. These results highlight Agentic RAG's ability to generate semantically relevant and reproducible topics, positioning it as a robust, scalable, and transparent alternative for AI-driven qualitative research in leadership, managerial, and organizational research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20974">Improving Open-world Continual Learning under the Constraints of Scarce Labeled Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Li, Xiangkun Wang, Xin Yang, Marcello Bonsangue, Junbo Zhang, Tianrui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-world continual learning (OWCL) adapts to sequential tasks with open samples, learning knowledge incrementally while preventing forgetting. However, existing OWCL still requires a large amount of labeled data for training, which is often impractical in real-world applications. Given that new categories/entities typically come with limited annotations and are in small quantities, a more realistic situation is OWCL with scarce labeled data, i.e., few-shot training samples. Hence, this paper investigates the problem of open-world few-shot continual learning (OFCL), challenging in (i) learning unbounded tasks without forgetting previous knowledge and avoiding overfitting, (ii) constructing compact decision boundaries for open detection with limited labeled data, and (iii) transferring knowledge about knowns and unknowns and even update the unknowns to knowns once the labels of open samples are learned. In response, we propose a novel OFCL framework that integrates three key components: (1) an instance-wise token augmentation (ITA) that represents and enriches sample representations with additional knowledge, (2) a margin-based open boundary (MOB) that supports open detection with new tasks emerge over time, and (3) an adaptive knowledge space (AKS) that endows unknowns with knowledge for the updating from unknowns to knowns. Finally, extensive experiments show the proposed OFCL framework outperforms all baselines remarkably with practical importance and reproducibility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nesryne Mejri, Enjie Ghorbel, Anis Kacem, Pavel Chernakov, Niki Foteinopoulou, Djamila Aouada</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the first fully unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework for unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD). The performance of UAD techniques degrades significantly in the presence of a domain shift, difficult to avoid in a real-world setting. While UDA has contributed to solving this issue in binary and multi-class classification, such a strategy is ill-posed in UAD. This might be explained by the unsupervised nature of the two tasks, namely, domain adaptation and anomaly detection. Herein, we first formulate this problem that we call the two-fold unsupervised curse. Then, we propose a pioneering solution to this curse, considered intractable so far, by assuming that anomalies are rare. Specifically, we leverage clustering techniques to identify a dominant cluster in the target feature space. Posed as the normal cluster, the latter is aligned with the source normal features. Concretely, given a one-class source set and an unlabeled target set composed mostly of normal data and some anomalies, we fit the source features within a hypersphere while jointly aligning them with the features of the dominant cluster from the target set. The paper provides extensive experiments and analysis on common adaptation benchmarks for anomaly detection, demonstrating the relevance of both the newly introduced paradigm and the proposed approach. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youran Zhou, Jianzhong Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: As E-commerce platforms face surging transactions during major shopping events like Black Friday, stress testing with synthesized data is crucial for resource planning. Most recent studies use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate tabular data while ensuring privacy and machine learning utility. However, these methods overlook the computational demands of processing GAN-generated data, making them unsuitable for E-commerce stress testing.
  This thesis introduces a novel GAN-based approach incorporating query selectivity constraints, a key factor in database transaction processing. We integrate a pre-trained deep neural network to maintain selectivity consistency between real and synthetic data. Our method, tested on five real-world datasets, outperforms three state-of-the-art GANs and a VAE model, improving selectivity estimation accuracy by up to 20pct and machine learning utility by up to 6 pct.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melanie Schaller, Bodo Rosenhahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting energy consumption in smart buildings is challenging due to dependencies in sensor data and the variability of environmental conditions. We introduce S4ConvD, a novel convolutional variant of Deep State Space Models (Deep-SSMs), that minimizes reliance on extensive preprocessing steps. S4ConvD is designed to optimize runtime in resource-constrained environments. By implementing adaptive scaling and frequency adjustments, this model shows to capture complex temporal patterns in building energy dynamics. Experiments on the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III dataset reveal that S4ConvD outperforms current benchmarks. Additionally, S4ConvD benefits from significant improvements in GPU runtime through the use of Block Tiling optimization techniques. Thus, S4ConvD has the potential for practical deployment in real-time energy modeling. Furthermore, the complete codebase and dataset are accessible on GitHub, fostering open-source contributions and facilitating further research. Our method also promotes resource-efficient model execution, enhancing both energy forecasting and the potential integration of renewable energy sources into smart grid systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yannick Metz, Andr\'as Geiszl, Rapha\"el Baur, Mennatallah El-Assady</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning rewards from preference feedback has become an important tool in the alignment of agentic models. Preference-based feedback, often implemented as a binary comparison between multiple completions, is an established method to acquire large-scale human feedback. However, human feedback in other contexts is often much more diverse. Such diverse feedback can better support the goals of a human annotator, and the simultaneous use of multiple sources might be mutually informative for the learning process or carry type-dependent biases for the reward learning process. Despite these potential benefits, learning from different feedback types has yet to be explored extensively. In this paper, we bridge this gap by enabling experimentation and evaluating multi-type feedback in a broad set of environments. We present a process to generate high-quality simulated feedback of six different types. Then, we implement reward models and downstream RL training for all six feedback types. Based on the simulated feedback, we investigate the use of types of feedback across ten RL environments and compare them to pure preference-based baselines. We show empirically that diverse types of feedback can be utilized and lead to strong reward modeling performance. This work is the first strong indicator of the potential of multi-type feedback for RLHF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuyang Zhong, Yixiao Huang, Chen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies fast adversarial training against sparse adversarial perturbations bounded by $l_0$ norm. We demonstrate the challenges of employing $1$-step attacks on $l_0$ bounded perturbations for fast adversarial training, including degraded performance and the occurrence of catastrophic overfitting (CO). We highlight that CO in $l_0$ adversarial training is caused by sub-optimal perturbation locations of $1$-step attack. Theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that the loss landscape of $l_0$ adversarial training is more craggy compared to its $l_\infty$, $l_2$ and $l_1$ counterparts. Moreover, we corroborate that the craggy loss landscape can aggravate CO. To address these issues, we propose Fast-LS-$l_0$ that incorporates soft labels and the trade-off loss function to smooth the adversarial loss landscape. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method can overcome the challenge of catastrophic overfitting, achieve state-of-the-art performance, and narrow down the performance gap between $1$-step and multi-step adversarial training against sparse attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valentin Guien, Violaine Antoine, Romain Lardy, Isabelle Veissier, Luis E C Rocha</p>
<p>Abstract: In Precision Livestock Farming, detecting deviations from optimal or baseline values - i.e. anomalies in time series - is essential to allow undertaking corrective actions rapidly. Here we aim at detecting anomalies in 24h time series of cow activity, with a view to detect cases of disease or oestrus. Deviations must be distinguished from noise which can be very high in case of biological data. It is also important to detect the anomaly early, e.g. before a farmer would notice it visually. Here, we investigate the benefit of using wavelet transforms to denoise data and we assess the performance of an anomaly detection algorithm considering the timing of the detection. We developed features based on the comparisons between the wavelet transforms of the mean of the time series and the wavelet transforms of individual time series instances. We hypothesized that these features contribute to the detection of anomalies in periodic time series using a feature-based algorithm. We tested this hypothesis with two datasets representing cow activity, which typically follows a daily pattern but can deviate due to specific physiological or pathological conditions. We applied features derived from wavelet transform as well as statistical features in an Isolation Forest algorithm. We measured the distance of detection between the days annotated abnormal by animal caretakers days and the days predicted abnormal by the algorithm. The results show that wavelet-based features are among the features most contributing to anomaly detection. They also show that detections are close to the annotated days, and often precede it. In conclusion, using wavelet transforms on time series of cow activity data helps to detect anomalies related to specific cow states. The detection is often obtained on days that precede the day annotated by caretakers, which offer possibility to take corrective actions at an early stage.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, the rise of DNA data storage technology has brought significant attention to the challenge of correcting insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) errors. Among various coding methods for IDS correction, Varshamov-Tenengolts (VT) codes, primarily designed for single-error correction, have emerged as a central research focus. While existing decoding methods achieve high accuracy in correcting a single error, they often fail to correct multiple IDS errors. In this work, we observe that VT codes retain some capability for addressing multiple errors by introducing a transformer-based VT decoder (TVTD) along with symbol- and statistic-based codeword embedding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TVTD achieves perfect correction of a single error. Furthermore, when decoding multiple errors across various codeword lengths, the bit error rate and frame error rate are significantly improved compared to existing hard decision and soft-in soft-out algorithms. Additionally, through model architecture optimization, the proposed method reduces time consumption by an order of magnitude compared to other soft decoders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charles Dawson, Van Tran, Max Z. Li, Chuchu Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Increased deployment of autonomous systems in fields like transportation and robotics have seen a corresponding increase in safety-critical failures. These failures can be difficult to model and debug due to the relative lack of data: compared to tens of thousands of examples from normal operations, we may have only seconds of data leading up to the failure. This scarcity makes it challenging to train generative models of rare failure events, as existing methods risk either overfitting to noise in the limited failure dataset or underfitting due to an overly strong prior. We address this challenge with CalNF, or calibrated normalizing flows, a self-regularized framework for posterior learning from limited data. CalNF achieves state-of-the-art performance on data-limited failure modeling and inverse problems and enables a first-of-a-kind case study into the root causes of the 2022 Southwest Airlines scheduling crisis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring trustworthiness in machine learning (ML) systems is crucial as they become increasingly embedded in high-stakes domains. This paper advocates for the integration of causal methods into machine learning to navigate the trade-offs among key principles of trustworthy ML, including fairness, privacy, robustness, accuracy, and explainability. While these objectives should ideally be satisfied simultaneously, they are often addressed in isolation, leading to conflicts and suboptimal solutions. Drawing on existing applications of causality in ML that successfully align goals such as fairness and accuracy or privacy and robustness, this paper argues that a causal approach is essential for balancing multiple competing objectives in both trustworthy ML and foundation models. Beyond highlighting these trade-offs, we examine how causality can be practically integrated into ML and foundation models, offering solutions to enhance their reliability and interpretability. Finally, we discuss the challenges, limitations, and opportunities in adopting causal frameworks, paving the way for more accountable and ethically sound AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Wearable sensing devices, such as Electrocardiogram (ECG) heart-rate monitors, will play a crucial role in the future of digital health. This continuous monitoring leads to massive unlabeled data, incentivizing the development of unsupervised learning frameworks. While Masked Data Modelling (MDM) techniques have enjoyed wide use, their direct application to single-lead ECG data is suboptimal due to the decoder's difficulty handling irregular heartbeat intervals when no contextual information is provided. In this paper, we present Cueing the Predictor Increments the Detailing (CuPID), a novel MDM method tailored to single-lead ECGs. CuPID enhances existing MDM techniques by cueing spectrogram-derived context to the decoder, thus incentivizing the encoder to produce more detailed representations. This has a significant impact on the encoder's performance across a wide range of different configurations, leading CuPID to outperform state-of-the-art methods in a variety of downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background: With the increasing availability of healthcare data, predictive modeling finds many applications in the biomedical domain, such as the evaluation of the level of risk for various conditions, which in turn can guide clinical decision making. However, it is unclear how knowledge graph data representations and their embedding, which are competitive in some settings, could be of interest in biomedical predictive modeling. Method: We simulated synthetic but realistic data of patients with intracranial aneurysm and experimented on the task of predicting their clinical outcome. We compared the performance of various classification approaches on tabular data versus a graph-based representation of the same data. Next, we investigated how the adopted schema for representing first individual data and second temporal data impacts predictive performances. Results: Our study illustrates that in our case, a graph representation and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) embeddings reach the best performance for a predictive task from observational data. We emphasize the importance of the adopted schema and of the consideration of literal values in the representation of individual data. Our study also moderates the relative impact of various time encoding on GCN performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The success of deep learning requires large datasets and extensive training, which can create significant computational challenges. To address these challenges, pseudo-coresets, small learnable datasets that mimic the entire data, have been proposed. Bayesian Neural Networks, which offer predictive uncertainty and probabilistic interpretation for deep neural networks, also face issues with large-scale datasets due to their high-dimensional parameter space. Prior works on Bayesian Pseudo-Coresets (BPC) attempt to reduce the computational load for computing weight posterior distribution by a small number of pseudo-coresets but suffer from memory inefficiency during BPC training and sub-optimal results. To overcome these limitations, we propose Variational Bayesian Pseudo-Coreset (VBPC), a novel approach that utilizes variational inference to efficiently approximate the posterior distribution, reducing memory usage and computational costs while improving performance across benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eli Verwimp, Guy Hacohen, Tinne Tuytelaars</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable models to adapt to new datasets without losing performance on previously learned data, often assuming that prior data is no longer available. However, in many practical scenarios, both old and new data are accessible. In such cases, good performance on both datasets is typically achieved by abandoning the model trained on the previous data and re-training a new model from scratch on both datasets. This training from scratch is computationally expensive. In contrast, methods that leverage the previously trained model and old data are worthy of investigation, as they could significantly reduce computational costs. Our evaluation framework quantifies the computational savings of such methods while maintaining or exceeding the performance of training from scratch. We identify key optimization aspects -- initialization, regularization, data selection, and hyper-parameters -- that can each contribute to reducing computational costs. For each aspect, we propose effective first-step methods that already yield substantial computational savings. By combining these methods, we achieve up to 2.7x reductions in computation time across various computer vision tasks, highlighting the potential for further advancements in this area.</p>

<p>Abstract: Wearable sensing devices, such as Holter monitors, will play a crucial role in the future of digital health. Unsupervised learning frameworks such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) are essential to map these single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals with their anticipated clinical outcomes. These signals are characterized by a tempo-variant component whose patterns evolve through the recording and an invariant component with patterns that remain unchanged. However, existing SSL methods only drive the model to encode the invariant attributes, leading the model to neglect tempo-variant information which reflects subject-state changes through time. In this paper, we present Parallel-Learning of Invariant and Tempo-variant Attributes (PLITA), a novel SSL method designed for capturing both invariant and tempo-variant ECG attributes. The latter are captured by mandating closer representations in space for closer inputs on time. We evaluate both the capability of the method to learn the attributes of these two distinct kinds, as well as PLITA's performance compared to existing SSL methods for ECG analysis. PLITA performs significantly better in the set-ups where tempo-variant attributes play a major role.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammed Yusuf Satici, Jianxun Wang, David L. Roberts</p>
<p>Abstract: Curriculum learning is a training method in which an agent is first trained on a curriculum of relatively simple tasks related to a target task in an effort to shorten the time required to train on the target task. Autonomous curriculum design involves the design of such curriculum with no reliance on human knowledge and/or expertise. Finding an efficient and effective way of autonomously designing curricula remains an open problem. We propose a novel approach for automatically designing curricula by leveraging the learner's uncertainty to select curricula tasks. Our approach measures the uncertainty in the learner's policy using relative entropy, and guides the agent to states of high uncertainty to facilitate learning. Our algorithm supports the generation of autonomous curricula in a self-assessed manner by leveraging the learner's past and current policies but it also allows the use of teacher guided design in an instructive setting. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of our algorithm using two time-scale optimization processes. Results show that our algorithm outperforms randomly generated curriculum, and learning directly on the target task as well as the curriculum-learning criteria existing in literature. We also present two additional heuristic distance measures that could be combined with our relative-entropy approach for further performance improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Walid El Maouaki, Nouhaila Innan, Alberto Marchisio, Taoufik Said, Mohamed Bennai, Muhammad Shafique</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) merges the privacy advantages of federated systems with the computational potential of quantum neural networks (QNNs), yet its vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains poorly understood. This work pioneers the integration of adversarial training into QFL, proposing a robust framework, quantum federated adversarial learning (QFAL), where clients collaboratively defend against perturbations by combining local adversarial example generation with federated averaging (FedAvg). We systematically evaluate the interplay between three critical factors: client count (5, 10, 15), adversarial training coverage (0-100%), and adversarial attack perturbation strength (epsilon = 0.01-0.5), using the MNIST dataset. Our experimental results show that while fewer clients often yield higher clean-data accuracy, larger federations can more effectively balance accuracy and robustness when partially adversarially trained. Notably, even limited adversarial coverage (e.g., 20%-50%) can significantly improve resilience to moderate perturbations, though at the cost of reduced baseline performance. Conversely, full adversarial training (100%) may regain high clean accuracy but is vulnerable under stronger attacks. These findings underscore an inherent trade-off between robust and standard objectives, which is further complicated by quantum-specific factors. We conclude that a carefully chosen combination of client count and adversarial coverage is critical for mitigating adversarial vulnerabilities in QFL. Moreover, we highlight opportunities for future research, including adaptive adversarial training schedules, more diverse quantum encoding schemes, and personalized defense strategies to further enhance the robustness-accuracy trade-off in real-world quantum federated environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammed Yusuf Satici, David L. Roberts</p>
<p>Abstract: In human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning or environments where calculating a reward is expensive, the costly rewards can make learning efficiency challenging to achieve. The cost of obtaining feedback from humans or calculating expensive rewards means algorithms receiving feedback at every step of long training sessions may be infeasible, which may limit agents' abilities to efficiently improve performance. Our aim is to reduce the reliance of learning agents on humans or expensive rewards, improving the efficiency of learning while maintaining the quality of the learned policy. We offer a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that requests a reward only when its knowledge of the value of actions in an environment state is low. Our approach uses a reward function model as a proxy for human-delivered or expensive rewards when confidence is high, and asks for those explicit rewards only when there is low confidence in the model's predicted rewards and/or action selection. By reducing dependence on the expensive-to-obtain rewards, we are able to learn efficiently in settings where the logistics or expense of obtaining rewards may otherwise prohibit it. In our experiments our approach obtains comparable performance to a baseline in terms of return and number of episodes required to learn, but achieves that performance with as few as 20% of the rewards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baiting Luo, Ava Pettet, Aron Laszka, Abhishek Dubey, Ayan Mukhopadhyay</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential decision-making in high-dimensional continuous action spaces, particularly in stochastic environments, faces significant computational challenges. We explore this challenge in the traditional offline RL setting, where an agent must learn how to make decisions based on data collected through a stochastic behavior policy. We present \textit{Latent Macro Action Planner} (L-MAP), which addresses this challenge by learning a set of temporally extended macro-actions through a state-conditional Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), effectively reducing action dimensionality. L-MAP employs a (separate) learned prior model that acts as a latent transition model and allows efficient sampling of plausible actions. During planning, our approach accounts for stochasticity in both the environment and the behavior policy by using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). In offline RL settings, including stochastic continuous control tasks, L-MAP efficiently searches over discrete latent actions to yield high expected returns. Empirical results demonstrate that L-MAP maintains low decision latency despite increased action dimensionality. Notably, across tasks ranging from continuous control with inherently stochastic dynamics to high-dimensional robotic hand manipulation, L-MAP significantly outperforms existing model-based methods and performs on-par with strong model-free actor-critic baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach in planning in complex and stochastic environments with high-dimensional action spaces.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI models for lung cancer screening are limited by data scarcity, impacting generalizability and clinical applicability. Generative models address this issue but are constrained by training data variability. We introduce SYN-LUNGS, a framework for generating high-quality 3D CT images with detailed annotations. SYN-LUNGS integrates XCAT3 phantoms for digital twin generation, X-Lesions for nodule simulation (varying size, location, and appearance), and DukeSim for CT image formation with vendor and parameter variability. The dataset includes 3,072 nodule images from 1,044 simulated CT scans, with 512 lesions and 174 digital twins. Models trained on clinical + simulated data outperform clinical only models, achieving 10% improvement in detection, 2-9% in segmentation and classification, and enhanced synthesis.By incorporating anatomy-informed simulations, SYN-LUNGS provides a scalable approach for AI model development, particularly in rare disease representation and improving model reliability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling methods often struggle with sharp curvatures, intricate geometries, and multimodal distributions. Slice sampling can resolve local exploration inefficiency issues and Riemannian geometries help with sharp curvatures. Recent extensions enable slice sampling on Riemannian manifolds, but they are restricted to cases where geodesics are available in closed form. We propose a method that generalizes Hit-and-Run slice sampling to more general geometries tailored to the target distribution, by approximating geodesics as solutions to differential equations. Our approach enables exploration of regions with strong curvature and rapid transitions between modes in multimodal distributions. We demonstrate the advantages of the approach over challenging sampling problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianhao Huang, Zixuan Wang, Jason D. Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to significantly improve the performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly in arithmetic and reasoning tasks, by instructing the model to produce intermediate reasoning steps. Despite the remarkable empirical success of CoT and its theoretical advantages in enhancing expressivity, the mechanisms underlying CoT training remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we study the training dynamics of transformers over a CoT objective on an in-context weight prediction task for linear regression. We prove that while a one-layer linear transformer without CoT can only implement a single step of gradient descent (GD) and fails to recover the ground-truth weight vector, a transformer with CoT prompting can learn to perform multi-step GD autoregressively, achieving near-exact recovery. Furthermore, we show that the trained transformer effectively generalizes on the unseen data. With our technique, we also show that looped transformers significantly improve final performance compared to transformers without looping in the in-context learning of linear regression. Empirically, we demonstrate that CoT prompting yields substantial performance improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin McKee</p>
<p>Abstract: Training of deep reinforcement learning agents is slowed considerably by the presence of input dimensions that do not usefully condition the reward function. Existing modules such as layer normalization can be trained with weight decay to act as a form of selective attention, i.e. an input mask, that shrinks the scale of unnecessary inputs, which in turn accelerates training of the policy. However, we find a surprising result that adding numerous parameters to the computation of the input mask results in much faster training. A simple, high dimensional masking module is compared with layer normalization and a model without any input suppression. The high dimensional mask resulted in a four-fold speedup in training over the null hypothesis and a two-fold speedup in training over the layer normalization method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series analysis is crucial in diverse scenarios. Beyond forecasting, considerable real-world tasks are categorized into classification, imputation, and anomaly detection, underscoring different capabilities termed time series understanding in this paper. While GPT-style models have been positioned as foundation models for time series forecasting, the BERT-style architecture, which has made significant advances in natural language understanding, has not been fully unlocked for time series understanding, possibly attributed to the undesirable dropout of essential elements of BERT. In this paper, inspired by the shared multi-granularity structure between multivariate time series and multisentence documents, we design TimesBERT to learn generic representations of time series including temporal patterns and variate-centric characteristics. In addition to a natural adaptation of masked modeling, we propose a parallel task of functional token prediction to embody vital multi-granularity structures. Our model is pre-trained on 260 billion time points across diverse domains. Leveraging multi-granularity representations, TimesBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across four typical downstream understanding tasks, outperforming task-specific models and language pre-trained backbones, positioning it as a versatile foundation model for time series understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roman Klypa, Alberto Bietti, Sergei Grudinin</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing RNA molecules that interact with specific proteins is a critical challenge in experimental and computational biology. Existing computational approaches require a substantial amount of experimentally determined RNA sequences for each specific protein or a detailed knowledge of RNA structure, restricting their utility in practice. To address this limitation, we develop RNA-BAnG, a deep learning-based model designed to generate RNA sequences for protein interactions without these requirements. Central to our approach is a novel generative method, Bidirectional Anchored Generation (BAnG), which leverages the observation that protein-binding RNA sequences often contain functional binding motifs embedded within broader sequence contexts. We first validate our method on generic synthetic tasks involving similar localized motifs to those appearing in RNAs, demonstrating its benefits over existing generative approaches. We then evaluate our model on biological sequences, showing its effectiveness for conditional RNA sequence design given a binding protein.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kulin Shah, Alkis Kalavasis, Adam R. Klivans, Giannis Daras</p>
<p>Abstract: There is strong empirical evidence that the state-of-the-art diffusion modeling paradigm leads to models that memorize the training set, especially when the training set is small. Prior methods to mitigate the memorization problem often lead to a decrease in image quality. Is it possible to obtain strong and creative generative models, i.e., models that achieve high generation quality and low memorization? Despite the current pessimistic landscape of results, we make significant progress in pushing the trade-off between fidelity and memorization. We first provide theoretical evidence that memorization in diffusion models is only necessary for denoising problems at low noise scales (usually used in generating high-frequency details). Using this theoretical insight, we propose a simple, principled method to train the diffusion models using noisy data at large noise scales. We show that our method significantly reduces memorization without decreasing the image quality, for both text-conditional and unconditional models and for a variety of data availability settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marius F. R. Juston, William R. Norris, Dustin Nottage, Ahmet Soylemezoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep residual networks (ResNets) have demonstrated outstanding success in computer vision tasks, attributed to their ability to maintain gradient flow through deep architectures. Simultaneously, controlling the Lipschitz bound in neural networks has emerged as an essential area of research for enhancing adversarial robustness and network certifiability. This paper uses a rigorous approach to design $\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz deep residual networks using a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) framework. The ResNet architecture was reformulated as a pseudo-tri-diagonal LMI with off-diagonal elements and derived closed-form constraints on network parameters to ensure $\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz continuity. To address the lack of explicit eigenvalue computations for such matrix structures, the Gershgorin circle theorem was employed to approximate eigenvalue locations, guaranteeing the LMI's negative semi-definiteness. Our contributions include a provable parameterization methodology for constructing Lipschitz-constrained networks and a compositional framework for managing recursive systems within hierarchical architectures. These findings enable robust network designs applicable to adversarial robustness, certified training, and control systems. However, a limitation was identified in the Gershgorin-based approximations, which over-constrain the system, suppressing non-linear dynamics and diminishing the network's expressive capacity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Di Gennaro, Thibault Laugel, Vincent Grari, Marcin Detyniecki</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional approaches to learning fair machine learning models often require rebuilding models from scratch, generally without accounting for potentially existing previous models. In a context where models need to be retrained frequently, this can lead to inconsistent model updates, as well as redundant and costly validation testing. To address this limitation, we introduce the notion of controlled model debiasing, a novel supervised learning task relying on two desiderata: that the differences between new fair model and the existing one should be (i) interpretable and (ii) minimal. After providing theoretical guarantees to this new problem, we introduce a novel algorithm for algorithmic fairness, COMMOD, that is both model-agnostic and does not require the sensitive attribute at test time. In addition, our algorithm is explicitly designed to enforce minimal and interpretable changes between biased and debiased predictions -a property that, while highly desirable in high-stakes applications, is rarely prioritized as an explicit objective in fairness literature. Our approach combines a concept-based architecture and adversarial learning and we demonstrate through empirical results that it achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art debiasing methods while performing minimal and interpretable prediction changes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Off-policy evaluation can leverage logged data to estimate the effectiveness of new policies in e-commerce, search engines, media streaming services, or automatic diagnostic tools in healthcare. However, the performance of baseline off-policy estimators like IPS deteriorates when the logging policy significantly differs from the evaluation policy. Recent work proposes sharing information across similar actions to mitigate this problem. In this work, we propose an alternative estimator that shares information across similar contexts using clustering. We study the theoretical properties of the proposed estimator, characterizing its bias and variance under different conditions. We also compare the performance of the proposed estimator and existing approaches in various synthetic problems, as well as a real-world recommendation dataset. Our experimental results confirm that clustering contexts improves estimation accuracy, especially in deficient information settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ebenezer Tarubinga, Jenifer Kalafatovich Espinoza</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) aims to improve segmentation performance by utilising unlabeled data alongside limited labeled samples. Existing SSSS methods often face challenges such as coupling, where over-reliance on initial labeled data leads to suboptimal learning; confirmation bias, where incorrect predictions reinforce themselves repeatedly; and boundary blur caused by insufficient boundary-awareness and ambiguous edge information. To address these issues, we propose CW-BASS, a novel framework for SSSS. In order to mitigate the impact of incorrect predictions, we assign confidence weights to pseudo-labels. Additionally, we leverage boundary-delineation techniques, which, despite being extensively explored in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) remain under-explored in SSSS. Specifically, our approach: (1) reduces coupling through a confidence-weighted loss function that adjusts the influence of pseudo-labels based on their predicted confidence scores, (2) mitigates confirmation bias with a dynamic thresholding mechanism that learns to filter out pseudo-labels based on model performance, (3) resolves boundary blur with a boundary-aware module that enhances segmentation accuracy near object boundaries, and (4) reduces label noise with a confidence decay strategy that progressively refines pseudo-labels during training. Extensive experiments on the Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, using only 1/8 or 12.5\% of labeled data, our method achieves a mIoU of 75.81 on Pascal VOC 2012, highlighting its effectiveness in limited-label settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehua Xia, Yuyang Wu, Yiyun Xia, Cam-Tu Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (QA) often requires sequential retrieval (multi-hop retrieval), where each hop retrieves missing knowledge based on information from previous hops. To facilitate more effective retrieval, we aim to distill knowledge from a posterior retrieval, which has access to posterior information like an answer, into a prior retrieval used during inference when such information is unavailable. Unfortunately, current methods for knowledge distillation in one-time retrieval are ineffective for multi-hop QA due to two issues: 1) Posterior information is often defined as the response (i.e. the answer), which may not clearly connect to the query without intermediate retrieval; and 2) The large knowledge gap between prior and posterior retrievals makes existing distillation methods unstable, even resulting in performance loss. As such, we propose MoPo (Momentum Posterior Regularization) with two key innovations: 1) Posterior information of one hop is defined as a query-focus summary from the golden knowledge of the previous and current hops; 2) We develop an effective training strategy where the posterior retrieval is updated along with the prior retrieval via momentum moving average method, allowing smoother and effective distillation. Experiments on HotpotQA and StrategyQA demonstrate that MoPo outperforms existing baselines in both retrieval and downstream QA tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing has sparked significant interest among researchers to understand their mechanisms and functional characteristics. Although existing studies have attempted to explain LLM functionalities by identifying and interpreting specific neurons, these efforts mostly focus on individual neuron contributions, neglecting the fact that human brain functions are realized through intricate interaction networks. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience research on functional brain networks (FBNs), this study introduces a novel approach to investigate whether similar functional networks exist within LLMs. We use methods similar to those in the field of functional neuroimaging analysis to locate and identify functional networks in LLM. Experimental results show that, similar to the human brain, LLMs contain functional networks that frequently recur during operation. Further analysis shows that these functional networks are crucial for LLM performance. Masking key functional networks significantly impairs the model's performance, while retaining just a subset of these networks is adequate to maintain effective operation. This research provides novel insights into the interpretation of LLMs and the lightweighting of LLMs for certain downstream tasks.

<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired computational paradigm that emulates neuronal activity through discrete spike-based processing. Despite their advantages, training SNNs with traditional backpropagation (BP) remains challenging due to computational inefficiencies and a lack of biological plausibility. This study explores the Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm as an alternative learning framework for SNNs. Unlike backpropagation, which relies on forward and backward passes, the FF algorithm employs two forward passes, enabling localized learning, enhanced computational efficiency, and improved compatibility with neuromorphic hardware. We introduce an FF-based SNN training framework and evaluate its performance across both non-spiking (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10) and spiking (Neuro-MNIST, SHD) datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses existing FF-based SNNs by over 5% on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST while achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art backpropagation-trained SNNs. On more complex tasks such as CIFAR-10 and SHD, our approach outperforms other SNN models by up to 6% and remains competitive with leading backpropagation-trained SNNs. These findings highlight the FF algorithm's potential to advance SNN training methodologies and neuromorphic computing by addressing key limitations of backpropagation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeheng Ge, Xueyu Zhou, Jian Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Transfer learning is an important approach for addressing the challenges posed by limited data availability in various applications. It accomplishes this by transferring knowledge from well-established source domains to a less familiar target domain. However, traditional transfer learning methods often face difficulties due to rigid model assumptions and the need for a high degree of similarity between source and target domain models. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for transfer learning called Transfer learning through Enhanced Sufficient Representation (TESR). Our approach begins by estimating a sufficient and invariant representation from the source domains. This representation is then enhanced with an independent component derived from the target data, ensuring that it is sufficient for the target domain and adaptable to its specific characteristics. A notable advantage of TESR is that it does not rely on assuming similar model structures across different tasks. For example, the source domain models can be regression models, while the target domain task can be classification. This flexibility makes TESR applicable to a wide range of supervised learning problems. We explore the theoretical properties of TESR and validate its performance through simulation studies and real-world data applications, demonstrating its effectiveness in finite sample settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandre Marthe (ENS de Lyon, UMPA-ENSL), Samuel Bounan (UMPA-ENSL, MC2), Aur\'elien Garivier (UMPA-ENSL, MC2), Claire Vernade</p>
<p>Abstract: Risk-sensitive planning aims to identify policies maximizing some tail-focused metrics in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Such an optimization task can be very costly for the most widely used and interpretable metrics such as threshold probabilities or (Conditional) Values at Risk. Indeed, previous work showed that only Entropic Risk Measures (EntRM) can be efficiently optimized  through dynamic programming, leaving a hard-to-interpret parameter to choose.     We show that the computation of the full set of optimal policies for EntRM across parameter values leads to tight approximations for the metrics of interest. We prove that this optimality front can be computed effectively thanks to a novel structural analysis and smoothness properties of entropic risks.     Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance in a variety of decision-making scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingru Jia, Zehua Yuan, Junhao Pan, Paul E. McNamara, Deming Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves interactive reasoning where agents adapt their choices in response to others, yet existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often emphasize Nash Equilibrium (NE) approximation, overlooking the mechanisms driving their strategic choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce an evaluation framework grounded in behavioral game theory, disentangling reasoning capability from contextual effects. Testing 22 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that GPT-o3-mini, GPT-o1, and DeepSeek-R1 dominate most games yet also demonstrate that the model scale alone does not determine performance. In terms of prompting enhancement, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is not universally effective, as it increases strategic reasoning only for models at certain levels while providing limited gains elsewhere. Additionally, we investigate the impact of encoded demographic features on the models, observing that certain assignments impact the decision-making pattern. For instance, GPT-4o shows stronger strategic reasoning with female traits than males, while Gemma assigns higher reasoning levels to heterosexual identities compared to other sexual orientations, indicating inherent biases. These findings underscore the need for ethical standards and contextual alignment to balance improved reasoning with fairness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Lorena Yan, Robin Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: To answer one-to-many factual queries (e.g., listing cities of a country), a language model (LM) must simultaneously recall knowledge and avoid repeating previous answers. How are these two subtasks implemented and integrated internally? Across multiple datasets and models, we identify a promote-then-suppress mechanism: the model first recalls all answers, and then suppresses previously generated ones. Specifically, LMs use both the subject and previous answer tokens to perform knowledge recall, with attention propagating subject information and MLPs promoting the answers. Then, attention attends to and suppresses previous answer tokens, while MLPs amplify the suppression signal. Our mechanism is corroborated by extensive experimental evidence: in addition to using early decoding and causal tracing, we analyze how components use different tokens by introducing both \emph{Token Lens}, which decodes aggregated attention updates from specified tokens, and a knockout method that analyzes changes in MLP outputs after removing attention to specified tokens. Overall, we provide new insights into how LMs' internal components interact with different input tokens to support complex factual recall.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoshuang Chen, Yibo Wang, Yao Wang, Husheng Liu, Kaiqiao Zhan, Ben Wang, Kun Gai</p>
<p>Abstract: Users and creators are two crucial components of recommender systems. Typical recommender systems focus on the user side, providing the most suitable items based on each user's request. In such scenarios, a few items receive a majority of exposures, while many items receive very few. This imbalance leads to poorer experiences and decreased activity among the creators receiving less feedback, harming the recommender system in the long term. To this end, we develop a creator-side recommender system, called DualRec, to answer the following question: how to find the most suitable users for each item to enhance the creators' experience? We show that typical user-side recommendation algorithms, such as retrieval and ranking algorithms, can be adapted into the creator-side versions with just a few modifications. This greatly simplifies algorithm design in DualRec. Moreover, we discuss a unique challenge in DualRec: the user availability issue, which is not present in user-side recommender systems. To tackle this issue, we incorporate a user availability calculation (UAC) module to effectively enhance DualRec's performance. DualRec has already been implemented in Kwai, a short video recommendation system with over 100 millions user and over 10 million creators, significantly improving the experience for creators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Smit Desai, Mateusz Dubiel, Nima Zargham, Thomas Mildner, Laura Spillner</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs), enabling more dynamic, context-aware, and human-like interactions across diverse domains, from social sciences to healthcare. However, the rapid adoption of LLM-based personas raises critical ethical and practical concerns, including bias, manipulation, and unforeseen social consequences. Unlike traditional CUIs, where personas are carefully designed with clear intent, LLM-based personas generate responses dynamically from vast datasets, making their behavior less predictable and harder to govern. This workshop aims to bridge the gap between CUI and broader AI communities by fostering a cross-disciplinary dialogue on the responsible design and evaluation of LLM-based personas. Bringing together researchers, designers, and practitioners, we will explore best practices, develop ethical guidelines, and promote frameworks that ensure transparency, inclusivity, and user-centered interactions. By addressing these challenges collaboratively, we seek to shape the future of LLM-driven CUIs in ways that align with societal values and expectations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avrajit Ghosh, Soo Min Kwon, Rongrong Wang, Saiprasad Ravishankar, Qing Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks trained using gradient descent with a fixed learning rate $\eta$ often operate in the regime of "edge of stability" (EOS), where the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian equilibrates about the stability threshold $2/\eta$. In this work, we present a fine-grained analysis of the learning dynamics of (deep) linear networks (DLNs) within the deep matrix factorization loss beyond EOS. For DLNs, loss oscillations beyond EOS follow a period-doubling route to chaos. We theoretically analyze the regime of the 2-period orbit and show that the loss oscillations occur within a small subspace, with the dimension of the subspace precisely characterized by the learning rate. The crux of our analysis lies in showing that the symmetry-induced conservation law for gradient flow, defined as the balancing gap among the singular values across layers, breaks at EOS and decays monotonically to zero. Overall, our results contribute to explaining two key phenomena in deep networks: (i) shallow models and simple tasks do not always exhibit EOS; and (ii) oscillations occur within top features. We present experiments to support our theory, along with examples demonstrating how these phenomena occur in nonlinear networks and how they differ from those which have benign landscape such as in DLNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joana C. Costa, Tiago Roxo, Hugo Proen\c{c}a, Pedro R. M. In\'acio</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art defense mechanisms are typically evaluated in the context of white-box attacks, which is not realistic, as it assumes the attacker can access the gradients of the target network. To protect against this scenario, Adversarial Training (AT) and Adversarial Distillation (AD) include adversarial examples during the training phase, and Adversarial Purification uses a generative model to reconstruct all the images given to the classifier. This paper considers an even more realistic evaluation scenario: gray-box attacks, which assume that the attacker knows the architecture and the dataset used to train the target network, but cannot access its gradients. We provide empirical evidence that models are vulnerable to gray-box attacks and propose LISArD, a defense mechanism that does not increase computational and temporal costs but provides robustness against gray-box and white-box attacks without including AT. Our method approximates a cross-correlation matrix, created with the embeddings of perturbed and clean images, to a diagonal matrix while simultaneously conducting classification learning. Our results show that LISArD can effectively protect against gray-box attacks, can be used in multiple architectures, and carries over its resilience to the white-box scenario. Also, state-of-the-art AD models underperform greatly when removing AT and/or moving to gray-box settings, highlighting the lack of robustness from existing approaches to perform in various conditions (aside from white-box settings).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sajjad Saleem, Muhammad Imran Sharif</p>
<p>Abstract: The lungs are the essential organs of respiration, and this system is significant in the carbon dioxide and exchange between oxygen that occurs in human life. However, several lung diseases, which include pneumonia, tuberculosis, COVID-19, and lung cancer, are serious healthiness challenges and demand early and precise diagnostics. The methodological study has proposed a new deep learning framework called NASNet-ViT, which effectively incorporates the convolution capability of NASNet with the global attention mechanism capability of Vision Transformer ViT. The proposed model will classify the lung conditions into five classes: Lung cancer, COVID-19, pneumonia, TB, and normal. A sophisticated multi-faceted preprocessing strategy called MixProcessing has been used to improve diagnostic accuracy. This preprocessing combines wavelet transform, adaptive histogram equalization, and morphological filtering techniques. The NASNet-ViT model performs at state of the art, achieving an accuracy of 98.9%, sensitivity of 0.99, an F1-score of 0.989, and specificity of 0.987, outperforming other state of the art architectures such as MixNet-LD, D-ResNet, MobileNet, and ResNet50. The model's efficiency is further emphasized by its compact size, 25.6 MB, and a low computational time of 12.4 seconds, hence suitable for real-time, clinically constrained environments. These results reflect the high-quality capability of NASNet-ViT in extracting meaningful features and recognizing various types of lung diseases with very high accuracy. This work contributes to medical image analysis by providing a robust and scalable solution for diagnostics in lung diseases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vladimir Zaigrajew, Hubert Baniecki, Przemyslaw Biecek</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are useful for detecting and steering interpretable features in neural networks, with particular potential for understanding complex multimodal representations. Given their ability to uncover interpretable features, SAEs are particularly valuable for analyzing large-scale vision-language models (e.g., CLIP and SigLIP), which are fundamental building blocks in modern systems yet remain challenging to interpret and control. However, current SAE methods are limited by optimizing both reconstruction quality and sparsity simultaneously, as they rely on either activation suppression or rigid sparsity constraints. To this end, we introduce Matryoshka SAE (MSAE), a new architecture that learns hierarchical representations at multiple granularities simultaneously, enabling a direct optimization of both metrics without compromise. MSAE establishes a new state-of-the-art Pareto frontier between reconstruction quality and sparsity for CLIP, achieving 0.99 cosine similarity and less than 0.1 fraction of variance unexplained while maintaining ~80% sparsity. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of MSAE as a tool for interpreting and controlling CLIP by extracting over 120 semantic concepts from its representation to perform concept-based similarity search and bias analysis in downstream tasks like CelebA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saeif Alhazbi, Ahmed Mohamed Hussain, Gabriele Oligeri, Panos Papadimitratos</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into many technological ecosystems across various domains and industries, identifying which model is deployed or being interacted with is critical for the security and trustworthiness of the systems. Current verification methods typically rely on analyzing the generated output to determine the source model. However, these techniques are susceptible to adversarial attacks, operate in a post-hoc manner, and may require access to the model weights to inject a verifiable fingerprint. In this paper, we propose a novel passive and non-invasive fingerprinting technique that operates in real-time and remains effective even under encrypted network traffic conditions. Our method leverages the intrinsic autoregressive generation nature of language models, which generate text one token at a time based on all previously generated tokens, creating a unique temporal pattern like a rhythm or heartbeat that persists even when the output is streamed over a network. We find that measuring the Inter-Token Times (ITTs)-time intervals between consecutive tokens-can identify different language models with high accuracy. We develop a Deep Learning (DL) pipeline to capture these timing patterns using network traffic analysis and evaluate it on 16 Small Language Models (SLMs) and 10 proprietary LLMs across different deployment scenarios, including local host machine (GPU/CPU), Local Area Network (LAN), Remote Network, and Virtual Private Network (VPN). The experimental results confirm that our proposed technique is effective and maintains high accuracy even when tested in different network conditions. This work opens a new avenue for model identification in real-world scenarios and contributes to more secure and trustworthy language model deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saman Khamesian, Asiful Arefeen, Stephanie M. Carpenter, Hassan Ghasemzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Maintaining a balanced diet is essential for overall health, yet many individuals struggle with meal planning due to nutritional complexity, time constraints, and lack of dietary knowledge. Personalized food recommendations can help address these challenges by tailoring meal plans to individual preferences, habits, and dietary restrictions. However, existing dietary recommendation systems often lack adaptability, fail to consider real-world constraints such as food ingredient availability, and require extensive user input, making them impractical for sustainable and scalable daily use. To address these limitations, we introduce NutriGen, a framework based on large language models (LLM) designed to generate personalized meal plans that align with user-defined dietary preferences and constraints. By building a personalized nutrition database and leveraging prompt engineering, our approach enables LLMs to incorporate reliable nutritional references like the USDA nutrition database while maintaining flexibility and ease-of-use. We demonstrate that LLMs have strong potential in generating accurate and user-friendly food recommendations, addressing key limitations in existing dietary recommendation systems by providing structured, practical, and scalable meal plans. Our evaluation shows that Llama 3.1 8B and GPT-3.5 Turbo achieve the lowest percentage errors of 1.55\% and 3.68\%, respectively, producing meal plans that closely align with user-defined caloric targets while minimizing deviation and improving precision. Additionally, we compared the performance of DeepSeek V3 against several established models to evaluate its potential in personalized nutrition planning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Searching for objects in cluttered environments requires selecting efficient viewpoints and manipulation actions to remove occlusions and reduce uncertainty in object locations, shapes, and categories. In this work, we address the problem of manipulation-enhanced semantic mapping, where a robot has to efficiently identify all objects in a cluttered shelf. Although Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes~(POMDPs) are standard for decision-making under uncertainty, representing unstructured interactive worlds remains challenging in this formalism. To tackle this, we define a POMDP whose belief is summarized by a metric-semantic grid map and propose a novel framework that uses neural networks to perform map-space belief updates to reason efficiently and simultaneously about object geometries, locations, categories, occlusions, and manipulation physics. Further, to enable accurate information gain analysis, the learned belief updates should maintain calibrated estimates of uncertainty. Therefore, we propose Calibrated Neural-Accelerated Belief Updates (CNABUs) to learn a belief propagation model that generalizes to novel scenarios and provides confidence-calibrated predictions for unknown areas. Our experiments show that our novel POMDP planner improves map completeness and accuracy over existing methods in challenging simulations and successfully transfers to real-world cluttered shelves in zero-shot fashion.</p>

<p>Abstract: The transition from 5G to 6G mobile networks necessitates network automation to meet the escalating demands for high data rates, ultra-low latency, and integrated technology. Recently, Zero-Touch Networks (ZTNs), driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), are designed to automate the entire lifecycle of network operations with minimal human intervention, presenting a promising solution for enhancing automation in 5G/6G networks. However, the implementation of ZTNs brings forth the need for autonomous and robust cybersecurity solutions, as ZTNs rely heavily on automation. AI/ML algorithms are widely used to develop cybersecurity mechanisms, but require substantial specialized expertise and encounter model drift issues, posing significant challenges in developing autonomous cybersecurity measures. Therefore, this paper proposes an automated security framework targeting Physical Layer Authentication (PLA) and Cross-Layer Intrusion Detection Systems (CLIDS) to address security concerns at multiple Internet protocol layers. The proposed framework employs drift-adaptive online learning techniques and a novel enhanced Successive Halving (SH)-based Automated ML (AutoML) method to automatically generate optimized ML models for dynamic networking environments. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed framework achieves high performance on the public Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting and the Canadian Institute for CICIDS2017 datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing PLA and CLIDS tasks within dynamic and complex networking environments. Furthermore, the paper explores open challenges and research directions in the 5G/6G cybersecurity domain. This framework represents a significant advancement towards fully autonomous and secure 6G networks, paving the way for future innovations in network automation and cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have demonstrated their potential across various robotic tasks. However, they still heavily rely on human-engineered reward functions, requiring extensive trial-and-error and access to target behavior information, often unavailable in real-world settings. This paper introduces REDS: REward learning from Demonstration with Segmentations, a novel reward learning framework that leverages action-free videos with minimal supervision. Specifically, REDS employs video demonstrations segmented into subtasks from diverse sources and treats these segments as ground-truth rewards. We train a dense reward function conditioned on video segments and their corresponding subtasks to ensure alignment with ground-truth reward signals by minimizing the Equivalent-Policy Invariant Comparison distance. Additionally, we employ contrastive learning objectives to align video representations with subtasks, ensuring precise subtask inference during online interactions. Our experiments show that REDS significantly outperforms baseline methods on complex robotic manipulation tasks in Meta-World and more challenging real-world tasks, such as furniture assembly in FurnitureBench, with minimal human intervention. Moreover, REDS facilitates generalization to unseen tasks and robot embodiments, highlighting its potential for scalable deployment in diverse environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the principles of protein folding is a cornerstone of computational biology, with implications for drug design, bioengineering, and the understanding of fundamental biological processes. Lattice protein folding models offer a simplified yet powerful framework for studying the complexities of protein folding, enabling the exploration of energetically optimal folds under constrained conditions. However, finding these optimal folds is a computationally challenging combinatorial optimization problem. In this work, we introduce a novel upper-bound training scheme that employs masking to identify the lowest-energy folds in two-dimensional Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) lattice protein folding. By leveraging Dilated Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) integrated with an annealing process driven by temperature-like fluctuations, our method accurately predicts optimal folds for benchmark systems of up to 60 beads. Our approach also effectively masks invalid folds from being sampled without compromising the autoregressive sampling properties of RNNs. This scheme is generalizable to three spatial dimensions and can be extended to lattice protein models with larger alphabets. Our findings emphasize the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in tackling complex protein folding problems and a broader class of constrained combinatorial optimization challenges.</p>

<p>Abstract: EXplainable machine learning (XML) has recently emerged to address the mystery mechanisms of machine learning (ML) systems by interpreting their 'black box' results. Despite the development of various explanation methods, determining the most suitable XML method for specific ML contexts remains unclear, highlighting the need for effective evaluation of explanations. The evaluating capabilities of the Transformer-based large language model (LLM) present an opportunity to adopt LLM-as-a-Judge for assessing explanations. In this paper, we propose a workflow that integrates both LLM-based and human judges for evaluating explanations. We examine how LLM-based judges evaluate the quality of various explanation methods and compare their evaluation capabilities to those of human judges within an iris classification scenario, employing both subjective and objective metrics. We conclude that while LLM-based judges effectively assess the quality of explanations using subjective metrics, they are not yet sufficiently developed to replace human judges in this role.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text summarizing is a critical Natural Language Processing (NLP) task with applications ranging from information retrieval to content generation. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable promise in generating fluent abstractive summaries but they can produce hallucinated details not grounded in the source text. Regardless of the method of generating a summary, high quality automated evaluations remain an open area of investigation. This paper embarks on an exploration of text summarization with a diverse set of techniques, including TextRank, BART, Mistral-7B-Instruct, and OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo. The generated summaries are evaluated using traditional metrics such as the Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) Score and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) Score, as well as LLM-powered evaluation methods that directly assess a generated summary's consistency with the source text. We introduce a meta evaluation score which directly assesses the performance of the LLM evaluation system (prompt + model). We find that that all summarization models produce consistent summaries when tested on the XL-Sum dataset, exceeding the consistency of the reference summaries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaobo Wang, Yicun Yang, Zhiyuan Liu, Chenghao Sun, Xuming Hu, Conghui He, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a powerful approach for reducing data requirements in deep learning. Among various methods, distribution matching-based approaches stand out for their balance of computational efficiency and strong performance. However, existing distance metrics used in distribution matching often fail to accurately capture distributional differences, leading to unreliable measures of discrepancy. In this paper, we reformulate dataset distillation as a minmax optimization problem and introduce Neural Characteristic Function Discrepancy (NCFD), a comprehensive and theoretically grounded metric for measuring distributional differences. NCFD leverages the Characteristic Function (CF) to encapsulate full distributional information, employing a neural network to optimize the sampling strategy for the CF's frequency arguments, thereby maximizing the discrepancy to enhance distance estimation. Simultaneously, we minimize the difference between real and synthetic data under this optimized NCFD measure. Our approach, termed Neural Characteristic Function Matching (\mymethod{}), inherently aligns the phase and amplitude of neural features in the complex plane for both real and synthetic data, achieving a balance between realism and diversity in synthetic samples. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on both low- and high-resolution datasets. Notably, we achieve a 20.5\% accuracy boost on ImageSquawk. Our method also reduces GPU memory usage by over 300$\times$ and achieves 20$\times$ faster processing speeds compared to state-of-the-art methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve lossless compression of CIFAR-100 on a single NVIDIA 2080 Ti GPU using only 2.3 GB of memory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ojonugwa Oluwafemi Ejiga Peter, Md Mahmudur Rahman, Fahmi Khalifa</p>
<p>Abstract: The MEDVQA-GI challenge addresses the integration of AI-driven text-to-image generative models in medical diagnostics, aiming to enhance diagnostic capabilities through synthetic image generation. Existing methods primarily focus on static image analysis and lack the dynamic generation of medical imagery from textual descriptions. This study intends to partially close this gap by introducing a novel approach based on fine-tuned generative models to generate dynamic, scalable, and precise images from textual descriptions. Particularly, our system integrates fine-tuned Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth models, as well as Low-Rank Adaptation (LORA), to generate high-fidelity medical images. The problem is around two sub-tasks namely: image synthesis (IS) and optimal prompt production (OPG). The former creates medical images via verbal prompts, whereas the latter provides prompts that produce high-quality images in specified categories. The study emphasizes the limitations of traditional medical image generation methods, such as hand sketching, constrained datasets, static procedures, and generic models. Our evaluation measures showed that Stable Diffusion surpasses CLIP and DreamBooth + LORA in terms of producing high-quality, diversified images. Specifically, Stable Diffusion had the lowest Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores (0.099 for single center, 0.064 for multi-center, and 0.067 for combined), indicating higher image quality. Furthermore, it had the highest average Inception Score (2.327 across all datasets), indicating exceptional diversity and quality. This advances the field of AI-powered medical diagnosis. Future research will concentrate on model refining, dataset augmentation, and ethical considerations for efficiently implementing these advances into clinical practice</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Xiang, Zhuo Xu, Yao Deng, Qinhao Zhou, Yifan Liang, Ke Chen, Qingfang Zheng, Yaowei Wang, Xilin Chen, Wen Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: In open-world remote sensing, deployed models must continuously adapt to a steady influx of new data, which often exhibits various shifts compared to what the model encountered during the training phase. To effectively handle the new data, models are required to detect semantic shifts, adapt to covariate shifts, and continuously update themselves. These challenges give rise to a variety of open-world tasks. However, existing open-world remote sensing studies typically train and test within a single dataset to simulate open-world conditions. Currently, there is a lack of large-scale benchmarks capable of evaluating multiple open-world tasks. In this paper, we introduce OpenEarthSensing, a large-scale fine-grained benchmark for open-world remote sensing. OpenEarthSensing includes 189 scene and objects categories, covering the vast majority of potential semantic shifts that may occur in the real world. Additionally, OpenEarthSensing encompasses five data domains with significant covariate shifts, including two RGB satellite domians, one RGB aerial domian, one MS RGB domian, and one infrared domian. The various domains provide a more comprehensive testbed for evaluating the generalization performance of open-world models. We conduct the baseline evaluation of current mainstream open-world tasks and methods on OpenEarthSensing, demonstrating that it serves as a challenging benchmark for open-world remote sensing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixuan Gong, Jiaye Teng, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers may exhibit two-stage training dynamics during the real-world training process. For instance, when training GPT-2 on the Counterfact dataset, the answers progress from syntactically incorrect to syntactically correct to semantically correct. However, existing theoretical analyses hardly account for this two-stage phenomenon. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate how such two-stage training dynamics occur in transformers. Specifically, we analyze the dynamics of transformers using feature learning techniques under in-context learning regimes, based on a disentangled two-type feature structure. Such disentanglement of feature structure is general in practice, e.g., natural languages contain syntax and semantics, and proteins contain primary and secondary structures. To our best known, this is the first rigorous result regarding a two-stage optimization process in transformers. Additionally, a corollary indicates that such a two-stage process is closely related to the spectral properties of the attention weights, which accords well with empirical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingbing Huang, Deming Chen, Abhishek K. Umrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in generating coherent and contextually relevant text, they often function as opaque black boxes, trained on vast unlabeled datasets with statistical objectives, lacking an interpretable framework for responsible control. In this paper, we introduce JAM (Just A Move), a novel framework that interprets and controls text generation by integrating cause-effect analysis within the latent space of LLMs. Based on our observations, we uncover the inherent causality in LLM generation, which is critical for producing responsible and realistic outputs. Moreover, we explore latent vectors as fundamental components in LLM architectures, aiming to understand and manipulate them for more effective and efficient controllable text generation. We evaluate our framework using a range of tools, including the HHH criteria, toxicity reduction benchmarks, and GPT-4 alignment measures. Our results show that JAM achieves up to a 22% improvement over previous Controllable Text Generation (CTG) methods across multiple quantitative metrics and human-centric evaluations. Furthermore, JAM demonstrates greater computational efficiency compared to other CTG methods. These results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of JAM for responsible and realistic text generation, paving the way for more interpretable and controllable models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han-Byul Kim, Duc Hoang, Arnav Kundu, Mohammad Samragh, Minsik Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid expansion in the scale of large language models (LLMs), enabling efficient distributed inference across multiple computing units has become increasingly critical. However, communication overheads from popular distributed inference techniques such as Tensor Parallelism pose a significant challenge to achieve scalability and low latency. Therefore, we introduce a novel optimization technique, Sync-Point Drop (SPD), to reduce communication overheads in tensor parallelism by selectively dropping synchronization on attention outputs. In detail, we first propose a block design that allows execution to proceed without communication through SPD. Second, we apply different SPD strategies to attention blocks based on their sensitivity to the model accuracy. The proposed methods effectively alleviate communication bottlenecks while minimizing accuracy degradation during LLM inference, offering a scalable solution for diverse distributed environments: SPD offered about 20% overall inference latency reduction with < 1% accuracy regression for LLaMA2-70B inference over 8 GPUs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Indoor positioning systems (IPSs) have gained attention as outdoor navigation becomes prevalent in everyday life. Research is being actively conducted on how indoor smartphone navigation can be accomplished and improved using received signal strength indication (RSSI) and machine learning (ML). IPSs have more use cases that need further exploration, and we aim to explore using IPSs for the indoor navigation of an autonomous robot. We collected a dataset and trained models to test on a robot. We also developed an A* path-planning algorithm so that our robot could navigate itself using predicted directions. After testing different network structures, our robot was able to successfully navigate corners around 50 percent of the time. The findings of this paper indicate that using IPSs for autonomous robots is a promising area of future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumya Mukherjee, Bharath K. Sriperumbudur</p>
<p>Abstract: Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) embedding of probability distributions has proved to be an effective approach, via MMD (maximum mean discrepancy) for nonparametric hypothesis testing problems involving distributions defined over general (non-Euclidean) domains. While a substantial amount of work has been done on this topic, only recently, minimax optimal two-sample tests have been constructed that incorporate, unlike MMD, both the mean element and a regularized version of the covariance operator. However, as with most kernel algorithms, the computational complexity of the optimal test scales cubically in the sample size, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we propose a spectral regularized two-sample test based on random Fourier feature (RFF) approximation and investigate the trade-offs between statistical optimality and computational efficiency. We show the proposed test to be minimax optimal if the approximation order of RFF (which depends on the smoothness of the likelihood ratio and the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the integral operator) is sufficiently large. We develop a practically implementable permutation-based version of the proposed test with a data-adaptive strategy for selecting the regularization parameter and the kernel. Finally, through numerical experiments on simulated and benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed RFF-based test is computationally efficient and performs almost similar (with a small drop in power) to the exact test.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhou Zhang, Yi-An Ma, Eric Mazumdar</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning to exploit learning algorithms through repeated interactions in games. Specifically, we focus on the case of repeated two player, finite-action games, in which an optimizer aims to steer a no-regret learner to a Stackelberg equilibrium without knowledge of its payoffs. We first show that this is impossible if the optimizer only knows that the learner is using an algorithm from the general class of no-regret algorithms. This suggests that the optimizer requires more information about the learner's objectives or algorithm to successfully exploit them. Building on this intuition, we reduce the problem for the optimizer to that of recovering the learner's payoff structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach if the learner's algorithm is drawn from a smaller class by analyzing two examples: one where the learner uses an ascent algorithm, and another where the learner uses stochastic mirror ascent with known regularizer and step sizes.</p>

<p>Abstract: State estimation for Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) systems with noise, such as vehicle chassis systems, presents a significant challenge due to the imperfect and complex relationship between inputs and outputs. To solve this problem, we design a Damper characteristics-based Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (Damper-B-PINN). First, we introduce a neuron forward process inspired by the mechanical properties of dampers, which limits abrupt jumps in neuron values between epochs while maintaining search capability. Additionally, we apply an optimized Bayesian dropout layer to the MIMO system to enhance robustness against noise and prevent non-convergence issues. Physical information is incorporated into the loss function to serve as a physical prior for the neural network. The effectiveness of our Damper-B-PINN architecture is then validated across ten datasets and fourteen vehicle types, demonstrating superior accuracy, computational efficiency, and convergence in vehicle state estimation (i.e., dynamic wheel load) compared to other state-of-the-art benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuko Nakagi, Keigo Tada, Sota Yoshino, Shinji Nishimoto, Yu Takagi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit abrupt emergent behavior, whereby new abilities arise at certain points during their training. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as a ''phase transition'', remains poorly understood. In this study, we conduct an integrative analysis of such phase transitions by examining three interconnected perspectives: the similarity between LLMs and the human brain, the internal states of LLMs, and downstream task performance. We propose a novel interpretation for the learning dynamics of LLMs that vary in both training data and architecture, revealing that three phase transitions commonly emerge across these models during training: (1) alignment with the entire brain surges as LLMs begin adhering to task instructions Brain Alignment and Instruction Following, (2) unexpectedly, LLMs diverge from the brain during a period in which downstream task accuracy temporarily stagnates Brain Detachment and Stagnation, and (3) alignment with the brain reoccurs as LLMs become capable of solving the downstream tasks Brain Realignment and Consolidation. These findings illuminate the underlying mechanisms of phase transitions in LLMs, while opening new avenues for interdisciplinary research bridging AI and neuroscience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Jahangiri, Tatiana Agback, Ulrika Brath, Vladislav Orekhov</p>
<p>Abstract: In multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, practical resolution is defined as the ability to distinguish and accurately determine signal positions against a background of overlapping peaks, thermal noise, and spectral artifacts. In the pursuit of ultimate resolution, we introduce Peak Probability Presentations ($P^3$)- a statistical spectral representation that assigns a probability to each spectral point, indicating the likelihood of a peak maximum occurring at that location. The mapping between the spectrum and $P^3$ is achieved using MR-Ai, a physics-inspired deep learning neural network architecture, designed to handle multidimensional NMR spectra. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MR-Ai enables coprocessing of multiple spectra, facilitating direct information exchange between datasets. This feature significantly enhances spectral quality, particularly in cases of highly sparse sampling. Performance of MR-Ai and high value of the $P^3$ are demonstrated on the synthetic data and spectra of Tau, MATL1, Calmodulin, and several other proteins.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guo Liang, Guangwu Liu, Kun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient-based methods are well-suited for derivative-free optimization (DFO), where finite-difference (FD) estimates are commonly used as gradient surrogates. Traditional stochastic approximation methods, such as Kiefer-Wolfowitz (KW) and simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA), typically utilize only two samples per iteration, resulting in imprecise gradient estimates and necessitating diminishing step sizes for convergence. In this paper, we first explore an efficient FD estimate, referred to as correlation-induced FD estimate, which is a batch-based estimate. Then, we propose an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically determines the batch size at each iteration. By combining these two components, we develop an algorithm designed to enhance DFO in terms of both gradient estimation efficiency and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we establish the consistency of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate that, despite using a batch of samples per iteration, it achieves the same convergence rate as the KW and SPSA methods. Additionally, we propose a novel stochastic line search technique to adaptively tune the step size in practice. Finally, comprehensive numerical experiments confirm the superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoonyoung Cho, Junhyek Han, Jisu Han, Beomjoon Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: For robots to operate in general environments like households, they must be able to perform non-prehensile manipulation actions such as toppling and rolling to manipulate ungraspable objects. However, prior works on non-prehensile manipulation cannot yet generalize across environments with diverse geometries. The main challenge lies in adapting to varying environmental constraints: within a cabinet, the robot must avoid walls and ceilings; to lift objects to the top of a step, the robot must account for the step's pose and extent. While deep reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated impressive success in non-prehensile manipulation, accounting for such variability presents a challenge for the generalist policy, as it must learn diverse strategies for each new combination of constraints. To address this, we propose a modular and reconfigurable architecture that adaptively reconfigures network modules based on task requirements. To capture the geometric variability in environments, we extend the contact-based object representation (CORN) to environment geometries, and propose a procedural algorithm for generating diverse environments to train our agent. Taken together, the resulting policy can zero-shot transfer to novel real-world environments and objects despite training entirely within a simulator. We additionally release a simulation-based benchmark featuring nine digital twins of real-world scenes with 353 objects to facilitate non-prehensile manipulation research in realistic domains.</p>

However, the application of ML methods to solve differential equations capable of describing even complex physical systems is not yet fully widespread in theoretical high-energy physics. Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) are tools that minimize a loss function defined to solve Hamilton equations of motion. In this work, we implement several HNNs trained to solve, with high accuracy, the Hamilton equations for a massless probe moving inside a smooth and horizonless geometry known as D1-D5 circular fuzzball. We study both planar (equatorial) and non-planar geodesics in different regimes according to the impact parameter, some of which are unstable. Our findings suggest that HNNs could eventually replace standard numerical integrators, as they are equally accurate but more reliable in critical situations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Testing for the conditional independence structure in data is a fundamental and critical task in statistics and machine learning, which finds natural applications in causal discovery - a highly relevant problem to many scientific disciplines. Existing methods seek to design explicit test statistics that quantify the degree of conditional dependence, which is highly challenging yet cannot capture nor utilize prior knowledge in a data-driven manner. In this study, an entirely new approach is introduced, where we instead propose to amortize conditional independence testing and devise ACID - a novel transformer-based neural network architecture that learns to test for conditional independence. ACID can be trained on synthetic data in a supervised learning fashion, and the learned model can then be applied to any dataset of similar natures or adapted to new domains by fine-tuning with a negligible computational cost. Our extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real data reveal that ACID consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance against existing baselines under multiple metrics, and is able to generalize robustly to unseen sample sizes, dimensionalities, as well as non-linearities with a remarkably low inference time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Crystal structure generation is fundamental to materials discovery, enabling the prediction of novel materials with desired properties. While existing approaches leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) through extensive fine-tuning on materials databases, we show that pre-trained LLMs can inherently generate stable crystal structures without additional training. Our novel framework MatLLMSearch integrates pre-trained LLMs with evolutionary search algorithms, achieving a 78.38% metastable rate validated by machine learning interatomic potentials and 31.7% DFT-verified stability via quantum mechanical calculations, outperforming specialized models such as CrystalTextLLM. Beyond crystal structure generation, we further demonstrate that our framework can be readily adapted to diverse materials design tasks, including crystal structure prediction and multi-objective optimization of properties such as deformation energy and bulk modulus, all without fine-tuning. These results establish pre-trained LLMs as versatile and effective tools for materials discovery, opening up new venues for crystal structure generation with reduced computational overhead and broader accessibility.</p>

Further analysis involves calculating statistical metrics for each layer, followed by the computation of a Comprehensive Sensitivity Score based on these metrics, which identifies the lower layers as being particularly sensitive to the generation of harmful content. Based on this finding, we employ a Freeze training strategy, selectively performing Supervised Fine-Tuning only on the lower layers. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly reduces training duration and GPU memory consumption while maintaining a high jailbreak success rate and a high harm score, outperforming the results achieved by applying the LoRA method for SFT across all layers. Additionally, the method has been successfully extended to other open-source large models, validating its generality and effectiveness across different model architectures. Furthermore, we compare our method with ohter jailbreak method, demonstrating the superior performance of our approach. By innovatively proposing a method to statistically analyze and compare large model parameters layer by layer, this study provides new insights into the interpretability of large models. These discoveries emphasize the necessity of continuous research and the implementation of adaptive security measures in the rapidly evolving field of LLMs to prevent potential jailbreak attack risks, thereby promoting the development of more robust and secure LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Richard Bergna, Stefan Depeweg, Sergio Calvo Ordonez, Jonathan Plenk, Alvaro Cartea, Jose Miguel Hernandez-Lobato</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in neural networks through methods such as Dropout, Bayesian neural networks and Laplace approximations is either prone to underfitting or computationally demanding, rendering these approaches impractical for large-scale datasets. In this work, we address these shortcomings by shifting the focus from uncertainty in the weight space to uncertainty at the activation level, via Gaussian processes. More specifically, we introduce the Gaussian Process Activation function (GAPA) to capture neuron-level uncertainties. Our approach operates in a post-hoc manner, preserving the original mean predictions of the pre-trained neural network and thereby avoiding the underfitting issues commonly encountered in previous methods. We propose two methods. The first, GAPA-Free, employs empirical kernel learning from the training data for the hyperparameters and is highly efficient during training. The second, GAPA-Variational, learns the hyperparameters via gradient descent on the kernels, thus affording greater flexibility. Empirical results demonstrate that GAPA-Variational outperforms the Laplace approximation on most datasets in at least one of the uncertainty quantification metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs) with external data sources to enhance factual correctness and domain coverage. Modern RAG pipelines rely on large datastores, leading to system challenges in latency-sensitive deployments, especially when limited GPU memory is available. To address these challenges, we propose TeleRAG, an efficient inference system that reduces RAG latency with minimal GPU memory requirements. The core innovation of TeleRAG is lookahead retrieval, a prefetching mechanism that anticipates required data and transfers it from CPU to GPU in parallel with LLM generation. By leveraging the modularity of RAG pipelines, the inverted file index (IVF) search algorithm and similarities between queries, TeleRAG optimally overlaps data movement and computation. Experimental results show that TeleRAG reduces end-to-end RAG inference latency by up to 1.72x on average compared to state-of-the-art systems, enabling faster, more memory-efficient deployments of advanced RAG applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoonsoo Nam, Seok Hyeong Lee, Clementine Domine, Yea Chan Park, Charles London, Wonyl Choi, Niclas Goring, Seungjai Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In physics, complex systems are often simplified into minimal, solvable models that retain only the core principles. In machine learning, layerwise linear models (e.g., linear neural networks) act as simplified representations of neural network dynamics. These models follow the dynamical feedback principle, which describes how layers mutually govern and amplify each other's evolution. This principle extends beyond the simplified models, successfully explaining a wide range of dynamical phenomena in deep neural networks, including neural collapse, emergence, lazy and rich regimes, and grokking. In this position paper, we call for the use of layerwise linear models retaining the core principles of neural dynamical phenomena to accelerate the science of deep learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has significantly advanced the efficiency of ML-focused software development by automating hyperparameter optimization and pipeline construction, reducing the need for manual intervention. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers the potential to surpass classical machine learning (ML) capabilities by utilizing quantum computing. However, the complexity of QML presents substantial entry barriers. We introduce \emph{AutoQML}, a novel framework that adapts the AutoML approach to QML, providing a modular and unified programming interface to facilitate the development of QML pipelines. AutoQML leverages the QML library sQUlearn to support a variety of QML algorithms. The framework is capable of constructing end-to-end pipelines for supervised learning tasks, ensuring accessibility and efficacy. We evaluate AutoQML across four industrial use cases, demonstrating its ability to generate high-performing QML pipelines that are competitive with both classical ML models and manually crafted quantum solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simone Arreghini, Nicholas Carlotti, Mirko Nava, Antonio Paolillo, Alessandro Giusti</p>
<p>Abstract: Localizing humans is a key prerequisite for any service robot operating in proximity to people. In these scenarios, robots rely on a multitude of state-of-the-art detectors usually designed to operate with RGB-D cameras or expensive 3D LiDARs. However, most commercially available service robots are equipped with cameras with a narrow field of view, making them blind when a user is approaching from other directions, or inexpensive 1D LiDARs whose readings are difficult to interpret. To address these limitations, we propose a self-supervised approach to detect humans and estimate their 2D pose from 1D LiDAR data, using detections from an RGB-D camera as a supervision source. Our approach aims to provide service robots with spatial awareness of nearby humans. After training on 70 minutes of data autonomously collected in two environments, our model is capable of detecting humans omnidirectionally from 1D LiDAR data in a novel environment, with 71% precision and 80% recall, while retaining an average absolute error of 13 cm in distance and 44{\deg} in orientation.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we integrate the predictive capabilities of compartmental disease dynamics models with machine learning ability to analyze complex, high-dimensional data and uncover patterns that conventional models may overlook. Specifically, we present a proof of concept demonstrating the application of data-driven methods and deep neural networks to a recently introduced SIR-type model with social features, including a saturated incidence rate, to improve epidemic prediction and forecasting. Our results show that a robust data augmentation strategy trough suitable data-driven models can improve the reliability of Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNNs) and Nonlinear Autoregressive Networks (NARs), making them viable alternatives to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This approach enhances the ability to handle nonlinear dynamics and offers scalable, data-driven solutions for epidemic forecasting, prioritizing predictive accuracy over the constraints of physics-based models.

<p>Abstract: Entanglement is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, playing a crucial role in quantum information processing. However, classifying entangled states, particularly in the mixed-state regime, remains a challenging problem, especially as system dimensions increase. In this work, we focus on bipartite quantum states and present a data-driven approach to entanglement classification using transformer-based neural networks. Our dataset consists of a diverse set of bipartite states, including pure separable states, Werner entangled states, general entangled states, and maximally entangled states. We pretrain the transformer in an unsupervised fashion by masking elements of vectorized Hermitian matrix representations of quantum states, allowing the model to learn structural properties of quantum density matrices. This approach enables the model to generalize entanglement characteristics across different classes of states. Once trained, our method achieves near-perfect classification accuracy, effectively distinguishing between separable and entangled states. Compared to previous Machine Learning, our method successfully adapts transformers for quantum state analysis, demonstrating their ability to systematically identify entanglement in bipartite systems. These results highlight the potential of modern machine learning techniques in automating entanglement detection and classification, bridging the gap between quantum information theory and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyi Zhang, Zhen Sun, Zongmin Zhang, Jihui Guo, Xinlei He</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have become powerful and widely adopted in some practical applications. However, recent research has revealed their vulnerability to multimodal jailbreak attacks, whereby the model can be induced to generate harmful content, leading to safety risks. Although most LVLMs have undergone safety alignment, recent research shows that the visual modality is still vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In our work, we discover that by using flowcharts with partially harmful information, LVLMs can be induced to provide additional harmful details. Based on this, we propose a jailbreak attack method based on auto-generated flowcharts, FC-Attack. Specifically, FC-Attack first fine-tunes a pre-trained LLM to create a step-description generator based on benign datasets. The generator is then used to produce step descriptions corresponding to a harmful query, which are transformed into flowcharts in 3 different shapes (vertical, horizontal, and S-shaped) as visual prompts. These flowcharts are then combined with a benign textual prompt to execute a jailbreak attack on LVLMs. Our evaluations using the Advbench dataset show that FC-Attack achieves over 90% attack success rates on Gemini-1.5, Llaval-Next, Qwen2-VL, and InternVL-2.5 models, outperforming existing LVLM jailbreak methods. Additionally, we investigate factors affecting the attack performance, including the number of steps and the font styles in the flowcharts. Our evaluation shows that FC-Attack can improve the jailbreak performance from 4% to 28% in Claude-3.5 by changing the font style. To mitigate the attack, we explore several defenses and find that AdaShield can largely reduce the jailbreak performance but with the cost of utility drop.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Wewer, Bart Pogodzinski, Bernt Schiele, Jan Eric Lenssen</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Spatial Reasoning Models (SRMs), a framework to perform reasoning over sets of continuous variables via denoising generative models. SRMs infer continuous representations on a set of unobserved variables, given observations on observed variables. Current generative models on spatial domains, such as diffusion and flow matching models, often collapse to hallucination in case of complex distributions. To measure this, we introduce a set of benchmark tasks that test the quality of complex reasoning in generative models and can quantify hallucination. The SRM framework allows to report key findings about importance of sequentialization in generation, the associated order, as well as the sampling strategies during training. It demonstrates, for the first time, that order of generation can successfully be predicted by the denoising network itself. Using these findings, we can increase the accuracy of specific reasoning tasks from <1% to >50%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \"Ozg\"un Turgut, Felix S. Bott, Markus Ploner, Daniel Rueckert</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of foundation models in natural language processing and computer vision has motivated similar approaches for general time series analysis. While these models are effective for a variety of tasks, their applicability in medical domains with limited data remains largely unexplored. To address this, we investigate the effectiveness of foundation models in medical time series analysis involving electroencephalography (EEG). Through extensive experiments on tasks such as age prediction, seizure detection, and the classification of clinically relevant EEG events, we compare their diagnostic accuracy with that of specialised EEG models. Our analysis shows that foundation models extract meaningful EEG features, outperform specialised models even without domain adaptation, and localise task-specific biomarkers. Moreover, we demonstrate that diagnostic accuracy is substantially influenced by architectural choices such as context length. Overall, our study reveals that foundation models with general time series understanding eliminate the dependency on large domain-specific datasets, making them valuable tools for clinical practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filip Tronarp</p>
<p>Abstract: In this article, the two filter formula is re-examined in the setting of partially observed Gauss--Markov models. It is traditionally formulated as a filter running backward in time, where the Gaussian density is parametrized in ``information form''. However, the quantity in the backward recursion is strictly speaking not a distribution, but a likelihood. Taking this observation seriously, a recursion over log-quadratic likelihoods is formulated instead, which obviates the need for ``information'' parametrization. In particular, it greatly simplifies the square-root formulation of the algorithm. Furthermore, formulae are given for producing the forward Markov representation of the a posteriori distribution over paths from the proposed likelihood representation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Microscopic Propagator Imaging (MPI) as a novel method to retrieve the indices of the microscopic propagator which is the probability density function of water displacements due to diffusion within the nervous tissue microstructures. Unlike the Ensemble Average Propagator indices or the Diffusion Tensor Imaging metrics, MPI indices are independent from the mesoscopic organization of the tissue such as the presence of multiple axonal bundle directions and orientation dispersion. As a consequence, MPI indices are more specific to the volumes, sizes, and types of microstructures, like axons and cells, that are present in the tissue. Thus, changes in MPI indices can be more directly linked to alterations in the presence and integrity of microstructures themselves. The methodology behind MPI is rooted on zonal modeling of spherical harmonics, signal simulation, and machine learning regression, and is demonstrated on both synthetic and Human Diffusion MRI data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> L\'eopold Mayti\'e, Roland Bertin Johannet, Rufin VanRullen</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans leverage rich internal models of the world to reason about the future, imagine counterfactuals, and adapt flexibly to new situations. In Reinforcement Learning (RL), world models aim to capture how the environment evolves in response to the agent's actions, facilitating planning and generalization. However, typical world models directly operate on the environment variables (e.g. pixels, physical attributes), which can make their training slow and cumbersome; instead, it may be advantageous to rely on high-level latent dimensions that capture relevant multimodal variables. Global Workspace (GW) Theory offers a cognitive framework for multimodal integration and information broadcasting in the brain, and recent studies have begun to introduce efficient deep learning implementations of GW. Here, we evaluate the capabilities of an RL system combining GW with a world model. We compare our GW-Dreamer with various versions of the standard PPO and the original Dreamer algorithms. We show that performing the dreaming process (i.e., mental simulation) inside the GW latent space allows for training with fewer environment steps. As an additional emergent property, the resulting model (but not its comparison baselines) displays strong robustness to the absence of one of its observation modalities (images or simulation attributes). We conclude that the combination of GW with World Models holds great potential for improving decision-making in RL agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-resolution colon segmentation is crucial for clinical and research applications, such as digital twins and personalized medicine. However, the leading open-source abdominal segmentation tool, TotalSegmentator, struggles with accuracy for the colon, which has a complex and variable shape, requiring time-intensive labeling. Here, we present the first fully automatic high-resolution colon segmentation method. To develop it, we first created a high resolution colon dataset using a pipeline that combines region growing with interactive machine learning to efficiently and accurately label the colon on CT colonography (CTC) images. Based on the generated dataset consisting of 435 labeled CTC images we trained an nnU-Net model for fully automatic colon segmentation. Our fully automatic model achieved an average symmetric surface distance of 0.2 mm (vs. 4.0 mm from TotalSegmentator) and a 95th percentile Hausdorff distance of 1.0 mm (vs. 18 mm from TotalSegmentator). Our segmentation accuracy substantially surpasses TotalSegmentator. We share our trained model and pipeline code, providing the first and only open-source tool for high-resolution colon segmentation. Additionally, we created a large-scale dataset of publicly available high-resolution colon labels.</p>

We establish its asymptotic consistency as well as a non-asymptotic bound on its deviation from the unknown prior, which is calculable in practice. We study finite sample behaviour for synthetic and real data and show that the proposal, together with a suitably modified version for large values of source prior, works on par or better than its competitors.</p>

The use of custom hardware architectures proves particularly beneficial for GNNs due to their irregular memory access patterns, resulting from the sparse structure of graphs. However, existing FPGA accelerators are limited by their double buffering mechanism, which doesn't account for the irregular node distribution in typical graph datasets. To address this, we introduce \textbf{AMPLE} (Accelerated Message Passing Logic Engine), an FPGA accelerator leveraging a new event-driven programming flow. We develop a mixed-arithmetic architecture, enabling GNN inference to be quantized at a node-level granularity. Finally, prefetcher for data and instructions is implemented to optimize off-chip memory access and maximize node parallelism. Evaluation on citation and social media graph datasets ranging from $2$K to $700$K nodes showed a mean speedup of $243\times$ and $7.2\times$ against CPU and GPU counterparts, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro Gimenes, Zeyu Cao, Jeffrey Wong, Yiren Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has shown that LLM performance on reasoning tasks can be enhanced by scaling test-time compute. One promising approach, particularly with decomposable problems, involves arranging intermediate solutions as a graph on which transformations are performed to explore the solution space. However, prior works rely on pre-determined, task-specific transformation schedules which are subject to a set of searched hyperparameters. In this work, we view thought graph transformations as actions in a Markov decision process, and implement policy agents to drive effective action policies for the underlying reasoning LLM agent. In particular, we investigate the ability for another LLM to act as a policy agent on thought graph environments and introduce ARIES, a multi-agent architecture for reasoning with LLMs. In ARIES, reasoning LLM agents solve decomposed subproblems, while policy LLM agents maintain visibility of the thought graph states, and dynamically adapt the problem-solving strategy. Through extensive experiments, we observe that using off-the-shelf LLMs as policy agents with no supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can yield up to $29\%$ higher accuracy on HumanEval relative to static transformation schedules, as well as reducing inference costs by $35\%$ and avoid any search requirements. We also conduct a thorough analysis of observed failure modes, highlighting that limitations on LLM sizes and the depth of problem decomposition can be seen as challenges to scaling LLM-guided reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Ge, Junda Feng, Qi Huang, Fangcheng Fu, Xiaonan Nie, Lei Zuo, Haibin Lin, Bin Cui, Xin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling long-context ability is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs). To amortize the memory consumption across multiple devices in long-context training, inter-data partitioning (a.k.a. Data Parallelism) and intra-data partitioning (a.k.a. Context Parallelism) are commonly used. Current training frameworks predominantly treat the two techniques as orthogonal, and establish static communication groups to organize the devices as a static mesh (e.g., a 2D mesh). However, the sequences for LLM training typically vary in lengths, no matter for texts, multi-modalities or reinforcement learning. The mismatch between data heterogeneity and static mesh causes redundant communication and imbalanced computation, degrading the training efficiency.
  In this work, we introduce ByteScale, an efficient, flexible, and scalable LLM training framework for large-scale mixed training of long and short sequences. The core of ByteScale is a novel parallelism strategy, namely Hybrid Data Parallelism (HDP), which unifies the inter- and intra-data partitioning with a dynamic mesh design. In particular, we build a communication optimizer, which eliminates the redundant communication for short sequences by data-aware sharding and dynamic communication, and further compresses the communication cost for long sequences by selective offloading. Besides, we also develop a balance scheduler to mitigate the imbalanced computation by parallelism-aware data assignment. We evaluate ByteScale with the model sizes ranging from 7B to 141B, context lengths from 256K to 2048K, on a production cluster with more than 12,000 GPUs. Experiment results show that ByteScale outperforms the state-of-the-art training system by up to 7.89x.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emile Anand, Jan van den Brand, Rose McCarty</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of preprocessing an $n\times n$ matrix M, and supporting queries that, for any vector v, returns the matrix-vector product Mv. This problem has been extensively studied in both theory and practice: on one side, practitioners have developed algorithms that are highly efficient in practice, whereas theoreticians have proven that the problem cannot be solved faster than naive multiplication in the worst-case. This lower bound holds even in the average-case, implying that existing average-case analyses cannot explain this gap between theory and practice. Therefore, we study the problem for structured matrices. We show that for $n\times n$ matrices of VC-dimension d, the matrix-vector multiplication problem can be solved with $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ preprocessing and $\tilde O(n^{2-1/d})$ query time. Given the low constant VC-dimensions observed in most real-world data, our results posit an explanation for why the problem can be solved so much faster in practice. Moreover, our bounds hold even if the matrix does not have a low VC-dimension, but is obtained by (possibly adversarially) corrupting at most a subquadratic number of entries of any unknown low VC-dimension matrix. Our results yield the first non-trivial upper bounds for many applications. In previous works, the online matrix-vector hypothesis (conjecturing that quadratic time is needed per query) was used to prove many conditional lower bounds, showing that it is impossible to compute and maintain high-accuracy estimates for shortest paths, Laplacian solvers, effective resistance, and triangle detection in graphs subject to node insertions and deletions in subquadratic time. Yet, via a reduction to our matrix-vector-multiplication result, we show we can maintain the aforementioned problems efficiently if the input is structured, providing the first subquadratic upper bounds in the high-accuracy regime.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leon Lang, Patrick Forr\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Contemporary work in AI alignment often relies on human feedback to teach AI systems human preferences and values. Yet as AI systems grow more capable, human feedback becomes increasingly unreliable. This raises the problem of scalable oversight: How can we supervise AI systems that exceed human capabilities? In this work, we propose to model the human evaluator's beliefs about the AI system's behavior to better interpret the human's feedback. We formalize human belief models and theoretically analyze their role in inferring human values. We then characterize the remaining ambiguity in this inference and conditions for which the ambiguity disappears. To mitigate reliance on exact belief models, we then introduce the relaxation of human belief model covering. Finally, we propose using foundation models to construct covering belief models, providing a new potential approach to scalable oversight.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Montanari, Pierfrancesco Urbani</p>
<p>Abstract: The inductive bias and generalization properties of large machine learning models are -- to a substantial extent -- a byproduct of the optimization algorithm used for training. Among others, the scale of the random initialization, the learning rate, and early stopping all have crucial impact on the quality of the model learnt by stochastic gradient descent or related algorithms. In order to understand these phenomena, we study the training dynamics of large two-layer neural networks. We use a well-established technique from non-equilibrium statistical physics (dynamical mean field theory) to obtain an asymptotic high-dimensional characterization of this dynamics. This characterization applies to a Gaussian approximation of the hidden neurons non-linearity, and empirically captures well the behavior of actual neural network models.
  Our analysis uncovers several interesting new phenomena in the training dynamics: $(i)$ The emergence of a slow time scale associated with the growth in Gaussian/Rademacher complexity; $(ii)$ As a consequence, algorithmic inductive bias towards small complexity, but only if the initialization has small enough complexity; $(iii)$ A separation of time scales between feature learning and overfitting; $(iv)$ A non-monotone behavior of the test error and, correspondingly, a `feature unlearning' phase at large times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Tang, Jihao Qiu, Lingxi Xie, Yunjie Tian, Jianbin Jiao, Qixiang Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled open-world visual understanding by injecting visual input as extra tokens into large language models (LLMs) as contexts. However, when the visual input changes from a single image to a long video, the above paradigm encounters difficulty because the vast amount of video tokens has significantly exceeded the maximal capacity of MLLMs. Therefore, existing video-based MLLMs are mostly established upon sampling a small portion of tokens from input data, which can cause key information to be lost and thus produce incorrect answers. This paper presents a simple yet effective algorithm named Adaptive Keyframe Sampling (AKS). It inserts a plug-and-play module known as keyframe selection, which aims to maximize the useful information with a fixed number of video tokens. We formulate keyframe selection as an optimization involving (1) the relevance between the keyframes and the prompt, and (2) the coverage of the keyframes over the video, and present an adaptive algorithm to approximate the best solution. Experiments on two long video understanding benchmarks validate that Adaptive Keyframe Sampling improves video QA accuracy (beyond strong baselines) upon selecting informative keyframes. Our study reveals the importance of information pre-filtering in video-based MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/ncTimTang/AKS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Yang, Mirna El Rajab, Abdallah Shami, Sami Muhaidat</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-Touch Networks (ZTNs) represent a state-of-the-art paradigm shift towards fully automated and intelligent network management, enabling the automation and intelligence required to manage the complexity, scale, and dynamic nature of next-generation (6G) networks. ZTNs leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to enhance operational efficiency, support intelligent decision-making, and ensure effective resource allocation. However, the implementation of ZTNs is subject to security challenges that need to be resolved to achieve their full potential. In particular, two critical challenges arise: the need for human expertise in developing AI/ML-based security mechanisms, and the threat of adversarial attacks targeting AI/ML models. In this survey paper, we provide a comprehensive review of current security issues in ZTNs, emphasizing the need for advanced AI/ML-based security mechanisms that require minimal human intervention and protect AI/ML models themselves. Furthermore, we explore the potential of Automated ML (AutoML) technologies in developing robust security solutions for ZTNs. Through case studies, we illustrate practical approaches to securing ZTNs against both conventional and AI/ML-specific threats, including the development of autonomous intrusion detection systems and strategies to combat Adversarial ML (AML) attacks. The paper concludes with a discussion of the future research directions for the development of ZTN security approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Menghua Wu, Russell Littman, Jacob Levine, Lin Qiu, Tommaso Biancalani, David Richmond, Jan-Christian Huetter</p>
<p>Abstract: High-content perturbation experiments allow scientists to probe biomolecular systems at unprecedented resolution, but experimental and analysis costs pose significant barriers to widespread adoption. Machine learning has the potential to guide efficient exploration of the perturbation space and extract novel insights from these data. However, current approaches neglect the semantic richness of the relevant biology, and their objectives are misaligned with downstream biological analyses. In this paper, we hypothesize that large language models (LLMs) present a natural medium for representing complex biological relationships and rationalizing experimental outcomes. We propose PerturbQA, a benchmark for structured reasoning over perturbation experiments. Unlike current benchmarks that primarily interrogate existing knowledge, PerturbQA is inspired by open problems in perturbation modeling: prediction of differential expression and change of direction for unseen perturbations, and gene set enrichment. We evaluate state-of-the-art machine learning and statistical approaches for modeling perturbations, as well as standard LLM reasoning strategies, and we find that current methods perform poorly on PerturbQA. As a proof of feasibility, we introduce Summer (SUMMarize, retrievE, and answeR, a simple, domain-informed LLM framework that matches or exceeds the current state-of-the-art.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Dong, Ge Li, Xue Jiang, Yongding Tao, Kechi Zhang, Hao Zhu, Huanyu Liu, Jiazheng Ding, Jia Li, Jinliang Deng, Hong Mei</p>
<p>Abstract: Periodicity, as one of the most important basic characteristics, lays the foundation for facilitating structured knowledge acquisition and systematic cognitive processes within human learning paradigms. However, the potential flaws of periodicity modeling in Transformer affect the learning efficiency and establishment of underlying principles from data for large language models (LLMs) built upon it. In this paper, we demonstrate that integrating effective periodicity modeling can improve the learning efficiency and performance of LLMs. We introduce FANformer, which integrates Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) into attention mechanism to achieve efficient periodicity modeling, by modifying the feature projection process of attention mechanism. Extensive experimental results on language modeling show that FANformer consistently outperforms Transformer when scaling up model size and training tokens, underscoring its superior learning efficiency. To further validate the effectiveness of FANformer, we pretrain a FANformer-1B on 1 trillion tokens. FANformer-1B exhibits marked improvements on downstream tasks compared to open-source LLMs with similar model parameters or training tokens. The results position FANformer as an effective and promising architecture for advancing LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Jha, Tinne Tuytelaars, Yuki M. Asano</p>
<p>Abstract: Following the success in NLP, the best vision models are now in the billion parameter ranges. Adapting these large models to a target distribution has become computationally and economically prohibitive. Addressing this challenge, we introduce UpStep, an Unsupervised Parameter-efficient Source-free post-pretraining approach, designed to efficiently adapt a base model from a source domain to a target domain: i) we design a self-supervised training scheme to adapt a pretrained model on an unlabeled target domain in a setting where source domain data is unavailable. Such source-free setting comes with the risk of catastrophic forgetting, hence, ii) we propose center vector regularization (CVR), a set of auxiliary operations that minimize catastrophic forgetting and additionally reduces the computational cost by skipping backpropagation in 50\% of the training iterations. Finally iii) we perform this adaptation process in a parameter-efficient way by adapting the pretrained model through low-rank adaptation methods, resulting in a fraction of parameters to optimize. We utilize various general backbone architectures, both supervised and unsupervised, trained on Imagenet as our base model and adapt them to a diverse set of eight target domains demonstrating the adaptability and generalizability of our proposed approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel non-parametric learning paradigm for the identification of drift and diffusion coefficients of multi-dimensional non-linear stochastic differential equations, which relies upon discrete-time observations of the state. The key idea essentially consists of fitting a RKHS-based approximation of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation to such observations, yielding theoretical estimates of non-asymptotic learning rates which, unlike previous works, become increasingly tighter when the regularity of the unknown drift and diffusion coefficients becomes higher. Our method being kernel-based, offline pre-processing may be profitably leveraged to enable efficient numerical implementation, offering excellent balance between precision and computational complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaochi Qian, Shangtong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Off-policy learning enables a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to reason counterfactually about policies that are not executed and is one of the most important ideas in RL. It, however, can lead to instability when combined with function approximation and bootstrapping, two arguably indispensable ingredients for large-scale reinforcement learning. This is the notorious deadly triad. The seminal work Sutton et al. (2008) pioneers Gradient Temporal Difference learning (GTD) as the first solution to the deadly triad, which has enjoyed massive success thereafter. During the derivation of GTD, some intermediate algorithm, called $A^\top$TD, was invented but soon deemed inferior. In this paper, we revisit this $A^\top$TD and prove that a variant of $A^\top$TD, called $A_t^\top$TD, is also an effective solution to the deadly triad. Furthermore, this $A_t^\top$TD only needs one set of parameters and one learning rate. By contrast, GTD has two sets of parameters and two learning rates, making it hard to tune in practice. We provide asymptotic analysis for $A^\top_t$TD and finite sample analysis for a variant of $A^\top_t$TD that additionally involves a projection operator. The convergence rate of this variant is on par with the canonical on-policy temporal difference learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haitian Jiang, Renjie Liu, Zengfeng Huang, Yichuan Wang, Xiao Yan, Zhenkun Cai, Minjie Wang, David Wipf</p>
<p>Abstract: Among the many variants of graph neural network (GNN) architectures capable of modeling data with cross-instance relations, an important subclass involves layers designed such that the forward pass iteratively reduces a graph-regularized energy function of interest. In this way, node embeddings produced at the output layer dually serve as both predictive features for solving downstream tasks (e.g., node classification) and energy function minimizers that inherit transparent, exploitable inductive biases and interpretability. However, scaling GNN architectures constructed in this way remains challenging, in part because the convergence of the forward pass may involve models with considerable depth. To tackle this limitation, we propose a sampling-based energy function and scalable GNN layers that iteratively reduce it, guided by convergence guarantees in certain settings. We also instantiate a full GNN architecture based on these designs, and the model achieves competitive accuracy and scalability when applied to the largest publicly-available node classification benchmark exceeding 1TB in size.

<p>Abstract: We present the OGAN algorithm for automatic requirement falsification of cyber-physical systems. System inputs and outputs are represented as piecewise constant signals over time while requirements are expressed in signal temporal logic. OGAN can find inputs that are counterexamples for the correctness of a system revealing design, software, or hardware defects before the system is taken into operation. The OGAN algorithm works by training a generative machine learning model to produce such counterexamples. It executes tests offline and does not require any previous model of the system under test. We evaluate OGAN using the ARCH-COMP benchmark problems, and the experimental results show that generative models are a viable method for requirement falsification. OGAN can be applied to new systems with little effort, has few requirements for the system under test, and exhibits state-of-the-art CPS falsification efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyuan Cheng, Yiming Yang, Xiaohang Tang, Wei Jiang, Yukun Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: An efficient way to control systems with unknown nonlinear dynamics is to find an appropriate embedding or representation for simplified approximation (e.g. linearization), which facilitates system identification and control synthesis. Nevertheless, there has been a lack of embedding methods that can guarantee (i) embedding the dynamical system comprehensively, including the vector fields (ODE form) of the dynamics, and (ii) preserving the consistency of control effect between the original and latent space. To address these challenges, we propose Koopman Embedded Equivariant Control (KEEC) to learn an embedding of the states and vector fields such that a Koopman operator is approximated as the latent dynamics. Due to the Koopman operator's linearity, learning the latent vector fields of the dynamics becomes simply solving linear equations. Thus in KEEC, the analytical form of the greedy control policy, which is dependent on the learned differential information of the dynamics and value function, is also simplified. Meanwhile, KEEC preserves the effectiveness of the control policy in the latent space by preserving the metric in two spaces. Our algorithm achieves superior performances in the experiments conducted on various control domains, including the image-based Pendulum, Lorenz-63 and the wave equation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Abrar Jahin, Saleh Akram Naife, Anik Kumar Saha, M. F. Mridha</p>
<p>Abstract: Supply chain risk assessment (SCRA) is pivotal for ensuring resilience in increasingly complex global supply networks. While existing reviews have explored traditional methodologies, they often neglect emerging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications and mostly lack combined systematic and bibliometric analyses. This study addresses these gaps by integrating a systematic literature review with bibliometric analysis, examining 1,903 articles (2015-2025) from Google Scholar and Web of Science, with 54 studies selected through PRISMA guidelines. Our findings reveal that ML models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and hybrid approaches, significantly enhance risk prediction accuracy and adaptability in post-pandemic contexts. The bibliometric analysis identifies key trends, influential authors, and institutional contributions, highlighting China and the United States as leading research hubs. Practical insights emphasize the integration of explainable AI (XAI) for transparent decision-making, real-time data utilization, and blockchain for traceability. The study underscores the necessity of dynamic strategies, interdisciplinary collaboration, and continuous model evaluation to address challenges such as data quality and interpretability. By synthesizing AI-driven methodologies with resilience frameworks, this review provides actionable guidance for optimizing supply chain risk management, fostering adaptability, and informing future research in evolving risk landscapes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna L. Trella, Walter Dempsey, Asim H. Gazi, Ziping Xu, Finale Doshi-Velez, Susan A. Murphy</p>
<p>Abstract: For the non-stationary multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, many existing methods allow a general mechanism for the non-stationarity, but rely on a budget for the non-stationarity that is sub-linear to the total number of time steps $T$. In many real-world settings, however, the mechanism for the non-stationarity can be modeled, but there is no budget for the non-stationarity. We instead consider the non-stationary bandit problem where the reward means change due to a latent, auto-regressive (AR) state. We develop Latent AR LinUCB (LARL), an online linear contextual bandit algorithm that does not rely on the non-stationary budget, but instead forms good predictions of reward means by implicitly predicting the latent state. The key idea is to reduce the problem to a linear dynamical system which can be solved as a linear contextual bandit. In fact, LARL approximates a steady-state Kalman filter and efficiently learns system parameters online. We provide an interpretable regret bound for LARL with respect to the level of non-stationarity in the environment. LARL achieves sub-linear regret in this setting if the noise variance of the latent state process is sufficiently small with respect to $T$. Empirically, LARL outperforms various baseline methods in this non-stationary bandit problem.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have shown promising performance on various tasks. However, due to the huge model sizes, running them in resource-constrained environments where the GPU memory is not abundant is challenging. Some existing systems propose to use CPU resources to solve that, but they either suffer from the significant overhead of frequently moving data between CPU and GPU, or fail to consider distinct characteristics of CPUs and GPUs. This paper proposes Fiddler, a resource-efficient inference system for MoE models with limited GPU resources. Fiddler strategically utilizes CPU and GPU resources by determining the optimal execution strategy. Our evaluation shows that, unlike state-of-the-art systems that optimize for specific scenarios such as single batch inference or long prefill, Fiddler performs better in all scenarios. Compared against different baselines, Fiddler achieves 1.26 times speed up in single batch inference, 1.30 times in long prefill processing, and 11.57 times in beam search inference.

<p>Abstract: Dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) serve as models for a vast number of natural and social phenomena. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on the classical problem of imputing missing time series data, whose underlying dynamics are assumed to be determined by ODEs. Specifically, we revisit ideas from amortized inference and neural operators, and propose a novel supervised learning framework for zero-shot time series imputation, through parametric functions satisfying some (hidden) ODEs. Our proposal consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over the space of ODE solutions, observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we generate a large, synthetic dataset of (hidden) ODE solutions, along with their noisy and sparse observations. Second, a neural recognition model that is trained offline, to map the generated time series onto the spaces of initial conditions and time derivatives of the (hidden) ODE solutions, which we then integrate to impute the missing data. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) recognition model can perform zero-shot imputation across 63 distinct time series with missing values, each sampled from widely different dynamical systems. Likewise, we demonstrate that it can perform zero-shot imputation of missing high-dimensional data in 10 vastly different settings, spanning human motion, air quality, traffic and electricity studies, as well as Navier-Stokes simulations -- without requiring any fine-tuning. What is more, our proposal often outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which are trained on the target datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunghyeon Woo, Baeseong Park, Byeongwook Kim, Minjung Jo, Se Jung Kwon, Dongsuk Jeon, Dongsoo Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various domains. However, training these LLMs typically involves substantial memory and computational costs during both forward and backward propagation. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) considerably reduces the training memory associated with parameters, it does not address the significant computational costs and activation memory. In this paper, we propose Dropping Backward Propagation (DropBP), a novel approach designed to reduce computational costs and activation memory while maintaining accuracy. DropBP randomly drops layers during backward propagation, which is essentially equivalent to training shallow submodules generated by undropped layers and residual connections. Additionally, DropBP calculates the sensitivity of each layer to assign an appropriate drop rate, thereby stabilizing the training process. DropBP is not only applicable to full fine-tuning but can also be orthogonally integrated with all types of PEFT by dropping layers during backward propagation. Specifically, DropBP can reduce training time by 44% with comparable accuracy to the baseline, accelerate convergence to the same perplexity by 1.5x, and enable training with a sequence length 6.2x larger on a single NVIDIA-A100 GPU. Furthermore, our DropBP enabled a throughput increase of 79% on a NVIDIA A100 GPU and 117% on an Intel Gaudi2 HPU. The code is available at https://github.com/WooSunghyeon/dropbp.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianyu Zhang, L\'eon Bottou</p>
<p>Abstract: It is impossible today to pretend that the practice of machine learning is always compatible with the idea that training and testing data follow the same distribution. Several authors have recently used ensemble techniques to show how scenarios involving multiple data distributions are best served by representations that are both richer than those obtained by regularizing for the best in-distribution performance, and richer than those obtained under the influence of the implicit sparsity bias of common stochastic gradient procedures.
  This contribution investigates the use of very high dropout rates instead of ensembles to obtain such rich representations. Although training a deep network from scratch using such dropout rates is virtually impossible, fine-tuning a large pre-trained model under such conditions is not only possible but also achieves out-of-distribution performances that exceed those of both ensembles and weight averaging methods such as model soups.
  This result has practical significance because the importance of the fine-tuning scenario has considerably grown in recent years. This result also provides interesting insights on the nature of rich representations and on the intrinsically linear nature of fine-tuning a large network using a comparatively small dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Wang, Dawen Liang, Nathan Kallus, Wen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: We study risk-sensitive RL where the goal is learn a history-dependent policy that optimizes some risk measure of cumulative rewards. We consider a family of risks called the optimized certainty equivalents (OCE), which captures important risk measures such as conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), entropic risk and Markowitz's mean-variance. In this setting, we propose two meta-algorithms: one grounded in optimism and another based on policy gradients, both of which can leverage the broad suite of risk-neutral RL algorithms in an augmented Markov Decision Process (MDP). Via a reductions approach, we leverage theory for risk-neutral RL to establish novel OCE bounds in complex, rich-observation MDPs. For the optimism-based algorithm, we prove bounds that generalize prior results in CVaR RL and that provide the first risk-sensitive bounds for exogenous block MDPs. For the gradient-based algorithm, we establish both monotone improvement and global convergence guarantees under a discrete reward assumption. Finally, we empirically show that our algorithms learn the optimal history-dependent policy in a proof-of-concept MDP, where all Markovian policies provably fail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minsu Kim, Sanghyeok Choi, Hyeonah Kim, Jiwoo Son, Jinkyoo Park, Yoshua Bengio</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the Generative Flow Ant Colony Sampler (GFACS), a novel meta-heuristic method that hierarchically combines amortized inference and parallel stochastic search. Our method first leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to amortize a \emph{multi-modal} prior distribution over combinatorial solution space that encompasses both high-reward and diversified solutions. This prior is iteratively updated via parallel stochastic search in the spirit of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), leading to the posterior distribution that generates near-optimal solutions. Extensive experiments across seven combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate GFACS's promising performances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Letzgus, Klaus-Robert M\"uller, Gr\'egoire Montavon</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Explainable AI (XAI) methods have facilitated profound validation and knowledge extraction from ML models. While extensively studied for classification, few XAI solutions have addressed the challenges specific to regression models. In regression, explanations need to be precisely formulated to address specific user queries (e.g.\ distinguishing between `Why is the output above 0?' and `Why is the output above 50?'). They should furthermore reflect the model's behavior on the relevant data sub-manifold. In this paper, we introduce XpertAI, a framework that disentangles the prediction strategy into multiple range-specific sub-strategies and allows the formulation of precise queries about the model (the `explanandum') as a linear combination of those sub-strategies. XpertAI is formulated generally to work alongside popular XAI attribution techniques, based on occlusion, gradient integration, or reverse propagation. Qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrate the benefits of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuai Dai, Xutao Li, Junying Fang, Yunming Ye, Demin Yu, Hui Su, Di Xian, Danyu Qin, Jingsong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Convection (thunderstorm) develops rapidly within hours and is highly destructive, posing a significant challenge for nowcasting and resulting in substantial losses to nature and society. After the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods, convection nowcasting has experienced rapid advancements, with its performance surpassing that of physics-based numerical weather prediction and other conventional approaches. However, the lead time and coverage of it still leave much to be desired and hardly meet the needs of disaster emergency response. Here, we propose deep diffusion models of satellite (DDMS) to establish an AI-based convection nowcasting system. On one hand, it employs diffusion processes to effectively simulate complicated spatiotemporal evolution patterns of convective clouds, significantly improving the forecast lead time. On the other hand, it utilizes geostationary satellite brightness temperature data, thereby achieving planetary-scale forecast coverage. During long-term tests and objective validation based on the FengYun-4A satellite, our system achieves, for the first time, effective convection nowcasting up to 4 hours, with broad coverage (about 20,000,000 km2), remarkable accuracy, and high resolution (15 minutes; 4 km). Its performance reaches a new height in convection nowcasting compared to the existing models. In terms of application, our system operates efficiently (forecasting 4 hours of convection in 8 minutes), and is highly transferable with the potential to collaborate with multiple satellites for global convection nowcasting. Furthermore, our results highlight the remarkable capabilities of diffusion models in convective clouds forecasting, as well as the significant value of geostationary satellite data when empowered by AI technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiwei Di, Jiafan He, Quanquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from human feedback plays an important role in aligning generative models, such as large language models (LLM). However, the effectiveness of this approach can be influenced by adversaries, who may intentionally provide misleading preferences to manipulate the output in an undesirable or harmful direction. To tackle this challenge, we study a specific model within this problem domain--contextual dueling bandits with adversarial feedback, where the true preference label can be flipped by an adversary. We propose an algorithm namely robust contextual dueling bandits (RCDB), which is based on uncertainty-weighted maximum likelihood estimation. Our algorithm achieves an $\tilde O(d\sqrt{T}/\kappa+dC/\kappa)$ regret bound, where $T$ is the number of rounds, $d$ is the dimension of the context, $\kappa$ is the lower bound of the derivative of the link function, and $ 0 \le C \le T$ is the total number of adversarial feedback. We also prove a lower bound to show that our regret bound is nearly optimal, both in scenarios with and without ($C=0$) adversarial feedback. Our work is the first to achieve nearly minimax optimal regret for dueling bandits in the presence of adversarial preference feedback. Additionally, for the sigmoid link function, we develop a novel algorithm that takes into account the effect of local derivatives into maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) analysis through a refined method for estimating the link function's derivative. This method helps us to eliminate the $\kappa$ dependence in the leading term with respect to $T$, which reduces the exponential dependence on the parameter radius $B$ to a polynomial dependence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huai-an Su, Jiaxiang Geng, Liang Li, Xiaoqi Qin, Yanzhao Hou, Hao Wang, Xin Fu, Miao Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: As a popular distributed learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) over mobile devices fosters numerous applications, while their practical deployment is hindered by participating devices' computing and communication heterogeneity. Some pioneering research efforts proposed to extract subnetworks from the global model, and assign as large a subnetwork as possible to the device for local training based on its full computing and communications capacity. Although such fixed size subnetwork assignment enables FL training over heterogeneous mobile devices, it is unaware of (i) the dynamic changes of devices' communication and computing conditions and (ii) FL training progress and its dynamic requirements of local training contributions, both of which may cause very long FL training delay. Motivated by those dynamics, in this paper, we develop a wireless and heterogeneity aware latency efficient FL (WHALE-FL) approach to accelerate FL training through adaptive subnetwork scheduling. Instead of sticking to the fixed size subnetwork, WHALE-FL introduces a novel subnetwork selection utility function to capture device and FL training dynamics, and guides the mobile device to adaptively select the subnetwork size for local training based on (a) its computing and communication capacity, (b) its dynamic computing and/or communication conditions, and (c) FL training status and its corresponding requirements for local training contributions. Our evaluation shows that, compared with peer designs, WHALE-FL effectively accelerates FL training without sacrificing learning accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessio Gravina, Moshe Eliasof, Claudio Gallicchio, Davide Bacciu, Carola-Bibiane Sch\"onlieb</p>
<p>Abstract: A common problem in Message-Passing Neural Networks is oversquashing -- the limited ability to facilitate effective information flow between distant nodes. Oversquashing is attributed to the exponential decay in information transmission as node distances increase. This paper introduces a novel perspective to address oversquashing, leveraging dynamical systems properties of global and local non-dissipativity, that enable the maintenance of a constant information flow rate. We present SWAN, a uniquely parameterized GNN model with antisymmetry both in space and weight domains, as a means to obtain non-dissipativity. Our theoretical analysis asserts that by implementing these properties, SWAN offers an enhanced ability to transmit information over extended distances. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world benchmarks that emphasize long-range interactions validate the theoretical understanding of SWAN, and its ability to mitigate oversquashing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roussel Desmond Nzoyem, David A. W. Barton, Tom Deakin</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) often struggle to adapt to new dynamic behaviors caused by parameter changes in the underlying physical system, even when these dynamics are similar to previously observed behaviors. This problem becomes more challenging when the changing parameters are unobserved, meaning their value or influence cannot be directly measured when collecting data. To address this issue, we introduce Neural Context Flow (NCF), a robust and interpretable Meta-Learning framework that includes uncertainty estimation. NCF uses Taylor expansion to enable contextual self-modulation, allowing context vectors to influence dynamics from other domains while also modulating themselves. After establishing theoretical guarantees, we empirically test NCF and compare it to related adaptation methods. Our results show that NCF achieves state-of-the-art Out-of-Distribution performance on 5 out of 6 linear and non-linear benchmark problems. Through extensive experiments, we explore the flexible model architecture of NCF and the encoded representations within the learned context vectors. Our findings highlight the potential implications of NCF for foundational models in the physical sciences, offering a promising approach to improving the adaptability and generalization of NODEs in various scientific applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanath Kumar Krishnamurthy, Anan Lyubarskaja, Emma Brunskill, Susan Athey</p>
<p>Abstract: Constructing confidence intervals that are simultaneously valid across a class of estimates is central for tasks such as multiple mean estimation, bounding generalization error in machine learning, and adaptive experimental design. We frame this as an "error estimation problem," where the goal is to determine a high-probability upper bound on the maximum error for a class of estimates. We propose an entirely data-driven approach that derives such bounds for both finite and infinite class settings, naturally adapting to a potentially unknown correlation structure of random errors. Notably, our method does not require class complexity as an input, overcoming a major limitation of existing approaches such as union bounding and bounds based on Talagrand's inequality. In this paper, we present our simple yet general solution and demonstrate its flexibility through applications ranging from constructing multiple simultaneously valid confidence intervals to optimizing exploration in contextual bandit algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: While message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have convincing success in a range of applications, they exhibit limitations such as the oversquashing problem and their inability to capture long-range interactions. Augmenting MPNNs with a virtual node (VN) removes the locality constraint of the layer aggregation and has been found to improve performance on a range of benchmarks. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the role of VNs and benefits thereof, through the lenses of oversquashing and sensitivity analysis. First, we characterize, precisely, how the improvement afforded by VNs on the mixing abilities of the network and hence in mitigating oversquashing, depends on the underlying topology. We then highlight that, unlike Graph-Transformers (GTs), classical instantiations of the VN are often constrained to assign uniform importance to different nodes. Consequently, we propose a variant of VN with the same computational complexity, which can have different sensitivity to nodes based on the graph structure. We show that this is an extremely effective and computationally efficient baseline for graph-level tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianan Zhao, Zhaocheng Zhu, Mikhail Galkin, Hesham Mostafa, Michael Bronstein, Jian Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: One fundamental challenge in graph machine learning is generalizing to new graphs. Many existing methods following the inductive setup can generalize to test graphs with new structures, but assuming the feature and label spaces remain the same as the training ones. This paper introduces a fully-inductive setup, where models should perform inference on arbitrary test graphs with new structures, feature and label spaces. We propose GraphAny as the first attempt at this challenging setup. GraphAny models inference on a new graph as an analytical solution to a LinearGNN, which can be naturally applied to graphs with any feature and label spaces. To further build a stronger model with learning capacity, we fuse multiple LinearGNN predictions with learned inductive attention scores. Specifically, the attention module is carefully parameterized as a function of the entropy-normalized distance features between pairs of LinearGNN predictions to ensure generalization to new graphs. Empirically, GraphAny trained on a single Wisconsin dataset with only 120 labeled nodes can generalize to 30 new graphs with an average accuracy of 67.26\%, surpassing not only all inductive baselines, but also strong transductive methods trained separately on each of the 30 test graphs.</p>

In the centralized setting, sparse training addresses resource constraints, while in the distributed setting, local training addresses communication costs. Recent work has shown that local training provably improves communication complexity through acceleration. In this work we show that in FL, naive integration of sparse training and acceleration fails, and we provide theoretical and empirical explanations of this phenomenon. We introduce Sparse-ProxSkip, addressing the issue and implementing the efficient technique of Straight-Through Estimator pruning into sparse training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byoungwoo Park, Jungwon Choi, Sungbin Lim, Juho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models and diffusion bridges primarily focus on finite-dimensional spaces, yet many real-world problems necessitate operations in infinite-dimensional function spaces for more natural and interpretable formulations. In this paper, we present a theory of stochastic optimal control (SOC) tailored to infinite-dimensional spaces, aiming to extend diffusion-based algorithms to function spaces. Specifically, we demonstrate how Doob's $h$-transform, the fundamental tool for constructing diffusion bridges, can be derived from the SOC perspective and expanded to infinite dimensions. This expansion presents a challenge, as infinite-dimensional spaces typically lack closed-form densities. Leveraging our theory, we establish that solving the optimal control problem with a specific objective function choice is equivalent to learning diffusion-based generative models. We propose two applications: (1) learning bridges between two infinite-dimensional distributions and (2) generative models for sampling from an infinite-dimensional distribution. Our approach proves effective for diverse problems involving continuous function space representations, such as resolution-free images, time-series data, and probability density functions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Methods for jointly generating molecular graphs along with their 3D conformations have gained prominence recently due to their potential impact on structure-based drug design. Current approaches, however, often suffer from very slow sampling times or generate molecules with poor chemical validity. Addressing these limitations, we propose Semla, a scalable E(3)-equivariant message passing architecture. We further introduce an unconditional 3D molecular generation model, SemlaFlow, which is trained using equivariant flow matching to generate a joint distribution over atom types, coordinates, bond types and formal charges. Our model produces state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets with as few as 20 sampling steps, corresponding to a two order-of-magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we highlight limitations of current evaluation methods for 3D generation and propose new benchmark metrics for unconditional molecular generators. Finally, using these new metrics, we compare our model's ability to generate high quality samples against current approaches and further demonstrate SemlaFlow's strong performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) has long been a challenge in time series analysis. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers are now developing Large Time Series Models (LTSMs)-universal transformer-based models that use autoregressive prediction-to improve TSF. However, training LTSMs on heterogeneous time series data poses unique challenges, including diverse frequencies, dimensions, and patterns across datasets. Recent endeavors have studied and evaluated various design choices aimed at enhancing LTSM training and generalization capabilities. However, these design choices are typically studied and evaluated in isolation and are not benchmarked collectively. In this work, we introduce LTSM-Bundle, a comprehensive toolbox, and benchmark for training LTSMs, spanning pre-processing techniques, model configurations, and dataset configuration. It modularized and benchmarked LTSMs from multiple dimensions, encompassing prompting strategies, tokenization approaches, training paradigms, base model selection, data quantity, and dataset diversity. Furthermore, we combine the most effective design choices identified in our study. Empirical results demonstrate that this combination achieves superior zero-shot and few-shot performances compared to state-of-the-art LTSMs and traditional TSF methods on benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Science and technology have a growing need for effective mechanisms that ensure reliable, controlled performance from black-box machine learning algorithms. These performance guarantees should ideally hold conditionally on the input-that is the performance guarantees should hold, at least approximately, no matter what the input. However, beyond stylized discrete groupings such as ethnicity and gender, the right notion of conditioning can be difficult to define. For example, in problems such as image segmentation, we want the uncertainty to reflect the intrinsic difficulty of the test sample, but this may be difficult to capture via a conditioning event. Building on the recent work of Gibbs et al. [2023], we propose a methodology for achieving approximate conditional control of statistical risks-the expected value of loss functions-by adapting to the difficulty of test samples. Our framework goes beyond traditional conditional risk control based on user-provided conditioning events to the algorithmic, data-driven determination of appropriate function classes for conditioning. We apply this framework to various regression and segmentation tasks, enabling finer-grained control over model performance and demonstrating that by continuously monitoring and adjusting these parameters, we can achieve superior precision compared to conventional risk-control methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aliz\'ee Pace, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf, Gunnar R\"atsch, Giorgia Ramponi</p>
<p>Abstract: Applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world problems is often made challenging by the inability to interact with the environment and the difficulty of designing reward functions. Offline RL addresses the first challenge by considering access to an offline dataset of environment interactions labeled by the reward function. In contrast, Preference-based RL does not assume access to the reward function and learns it from preferences, but typically requires an online interaction with the environment. We bridge the gap between these frameworks by exploring efficient methods for acquiring preference feedback in a fully offline setup. We propose Sim-OPRL, an offline preference-based reinforcement learning algorithm, which leverages a learned environment model to elicit preference feedback on simulated rollouts. Drawing on insights from both the offline RL and the preference-based RL literature, our algorithm employs a pessimistic approach for out-of-distribution data, and an optimistic approach for acquiring informative preferences about the optimal policy. We provide theoretical guarantees regarding the sample complexity of our approach, dependent on how well the offline data covers the optimal policy. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical performance of Sim-OPRL in various environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anshul Nasery, Jonathan Hayase, Pang Wei Koh, Sewoong Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: The democratization of machine learning systems has made the process of fine-tuning accessible to practitioners, leading to a wide range of open-source models fine-tuned on specialized tasks and datasets. Recent work has proposed to merge such models to combine their functionalities. However, prior approaches are usually restricted to models that are fine-tuned from the same base model. Furthermore, the final merged model is typically required to be of the same size as the original models. In this work, we propose a new two-step algorithm to merge models -- termed PLeaS -- which relaxes these constraints. First, leveraging the Permutation symmetries inherent in the two models, PLeaS partially matches nodes in each layer by maximizing alignment. Next, PLeaS computes the weights of the merged model as a layer-wise Least Squares solution to minimize the approximation error between the features of the merged model and the permuted features of the original models. PLeaS allows a practitioner to merge two models sharing the same architecture into a single performant model of a desired size, even when the two original models are fine-tuned from different base models. We also demonstrate how our method can be extended to address a challenging scenario where no data is available from the fine-tuning domains. We demonstrate our method to merge ResNet and ViT models trained with shared and different label spaces, and show improvement over the state-of-the-art merging methods of up to 15 percentage points for the same target compute while merging models trained on DomainNet and fine-grained classification tasks.

<p>Abstract: Symbolic regression plays a crucial role in modern scientific research thanks to its capability of discovering concise and interpretable mathematical expressions from data. A grand challenge lies in the arduous search for parsimonious and generalizable mathematical formulas, in an infinite search space, while intending to fit the training data. Existing algorithms have faced a critical bottleneck of accuracy and efficiency over a decade when handling problems of complexity, which essentially hinders the pace of applying symbolic regression for scientific exploration across interdisciplinary domains. To this end, we introduce a parallel combinatorial tree search (PCTS) model to efficiently distill generic mathematical expressions from limited data. Through a series of extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior accuracy and efficiency of PCTS for equation discovery, which greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline models on over 200 synthetic and experimental datasets (e.g., lifting its performance by up to 99% accuracy improvement and one-order of magnitude speed up). PCTS represents a key advance in accurate and efficient data-driven discovery of symbolic, interpretable models (e.g., underlying physical laws) and marks a pivotal transition towards scalable symbolic learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rosie Zhao, Depen Morwani, David Brandfonbrener, Nikhil Vyas, Sham Kakade</p>
<p>Abstract: Training language models becomes increasingly expensive with scale, prompting numerous attempts to improve optimization efficiency. Despite these efforts, the Adam optimizer remains the most widely used, due to a prevailing view that it is the most effective approach. We aim to compare several optimization algorithms, including SGD, Adafactor, Adam, Lion, and Sophia in the context of autoregressive language modeling across a range of model sizes, hyperparameters, and architecture variants. Our findings indicate that, except for SGD, these algorithms all perform comparably both in their optimal performance and also in terms of how they fare across a wide range of hyperparameter choices. Our results suggest to practitioners that the choice of optimizer can be guided by practical considerations like memory constraints and ease of implementation, as no single algorithm emerged as a clear winner in terms of performance or stability to hyperparameter misspecification. Given our findings, we further dissect these approaches, examining two simplified versions of Adam: a) signed momentum (Signum) which we see recovers both the performance and hyperparameter stability of Adam and b) Adalayer, a layerwise variant of Adam which we introduce to study the impact on Adam's preconditioning for different layers of the network. Examining Adalayer leads us to the conclusion that, perhaps surprisingly, adaptivity on both the last layer and LayerNorm parameters in particular are necessary for retaining performance and stability to learning rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozhe Ma, Zhengding Luo, Thanh Vinh Vo, Kuankuan Sima, Tze-Yun Leong</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward shaping is a technique in reinforcement learning that addresses the sparse-reward problem by providing more frequent and informative rewards. We introduce a self-adaptive and highly efficient reward shaping mechanism that incorporates success rates derived from historical experiences as shaped rewards. The success rates are sampled from Beta distributions, which dynamically evolve from uncertain to reliable values as data accumulates. Initially, the shaped rewards exhibit more randomness to encourage exploration, while over time, the increasing certainty enhances exploitation, naturally balancing exploration and exploitation. Our approach employs Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) combined with Random Fourier Features (RFF) to derive the Beta distributions, providing a computationally efficient, non-parametric, and learning-free solution for high-dimensional continuous state spaces. Our method is validated on various tasks with extremely sparse rewards, demonstrating notable improvements in sample efficiency and convergence stability over relevant baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Yuan, Zhihao Zhan, Zuobai Zhang, Manqi Zhou, Jianan Zhao, Boyu Han, Yue Li, Jian Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Transcriptome foundation models TFMs hold great promises of deciphering the transcriptomic language that dictate diverse cell functions by self-supervised learning on large-scale single-cell gene expression data, and ultimately unraveling the complex mechanisms of human diseases. However, current TFMs treat cells as independent samples and ignore the taxonomic relationships between cell types, which are available in cell ontology graphs. We argue that effectively leveraging this ontology information during the TFM pre-training can improve learning biologically meaningful gene co-expression patterns while preserving TFM as a general purpose foundation model for downstream zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. To this end, we present single cell, Cell-ontology guided TFM scCello. We introduce cell-type coherence loss and ontology alignment loss, which are minimized along with the masked gene expression prediction loss during the pre-training. The novel loss component guide scCello to learn the cell-type-specific representation and the structural relation between cell types from the cell ontology graph, respectively. We pre-trained scCello on 22 million cells from CellxGene database leveraging their cell-type labels mapped to the cell ontology graph from Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology Foundry. Our TFM demonstrates competitive generalization and transferability performance over the existing TFMs on biologically important tasks including identifying novel cell types of unseen cells, prediction of cell-type-specific marker genes, and cancer drug responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Zhou, Xiaoxue Wang, Tianshu Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating physically feasible dynamics in a data-driven context is challenging, especially when adhering to physical priors expressed in specific equations or formulas. Existing methodologies often overlook the integration of physical priors, resulting in violation of basic physical laws and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that seamlessly incorporates physical priors into diffusion-based generative models to address this limitation. Our approach leverages two categories of priors: 1) distributional priors, such as roto-translational invariance, and 2) physical feasibility priors, including energy and momentum conservation laws and PDE constraints. By embedding these priors into the generative process, our method can efficiently generate physically realistic dynamics, encompassing trajectories and flows. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method produces high-quality dynamics across a diverse array of physical phenomena with remarkable robustness, underscoring its potential to advance data-driven studies in AI4Physics. Our contributions signify a substantial advancement in the field of generative modeling, offering a robust solution to generate accurate and physically consistent dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Xiong, Chengshuai Shi, Jiaming Shen, Aviv Rosenberg, Zhen Qin, Daniele Calandriello, Misha Khalman, Rishabh Joshi, Bilal Piot, Mohammad Saleh, Chi Jin, Tong Zhang, Tianqi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that large language models' (LLMs) mathematical problem-solving capabilities can be enhanced by integrating external tools, such as code interpreters, and employing multi-turn Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. While current methods focus on synthetic data generation and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), this paper studies the complementary direct preference learning approach to further improve model performance. However, existing direct preference learning algorithms are originally designed for the single-turn chat task, and do not fully address the complexities of multi-turn reasoning and external tool integration required for tool-integrated mathematical reasoning tasks. To fill in this gap, we introduce a multi-turn direct preference learning framework, tailored for this context, that leverages feedback from code interpreters and optimizes trajectory-level preferences. This framework includes multi-turn DPO and multi-turn KTO as specific implementations. The effectiveness of our framework is validated through training of various language models using an augmented prompt set from the GSM8K and MATH datasets. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements: a supervised fine-tuned Gemma-1.1-it-7B model's performance increased from 77.5% to 83.9% on GSM8K and from 46.1% to 51.2% on MATH. Similarly, a Gemma-2-it-9B model improved from 84.1% to 86.3% on GSM8K and from 51.0% to 54.5% on MATH.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boris Knyazev, Abhinav Moudgil, Guillaume Lajoie, Eugene Belilovsky, Simon Lacoste-Julien</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural network training can be accelerated when a learnable update rule is used in lieu of classic adaptive optimizers (e.g. Adam). However, learnable update rules can be costly and unstable to train and use. Recently, Jang et al. (2023) proposed a simpler approach to accelerate training based on weight nowcaster networks (WNNs). In their approach, Adam is used for most of the optimization steps and periodically, only every few steps, a WNN nowcasts (predicts near future) parameters. We improve WNNs by proposing neuron interaction and nowcasting (NiNo) networks. In contrast to WNNs, NiNo leverages neuron connectivity and graph neural networks to more accurately nowcast parameters. We further show that in some networks, such as Transformers, modeling neuron connectivity accurately is challenging. We address this and other limitations, which allows NiNo to accelerate Adam training by up to 50% in vision and language tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Song, Zhiquan Tan, Bochao Zou, Jiansheng Chen, Huimin Ma, Weiran Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce matrix entropy as an analytical tool for studying supervised learning, investigating the information content of data representations and classification head vectors, as well as the dynamic interactions between them during the supervised learning process. Our experimental results reveal that matrix entropy effectively captures the variations in information content of data representations and classification head vectors as neural networks approach Neural Collapse during supervised training, while also serving as a robust metric for measuring similarity among data samples. Leveraging this property, we propose Cross-Model Alignment (CMA) loss to optimize the fine-tuning of pretrained models. To characterize the dynamics of neural networks nearing the Neural Collapse state, we introduce two novel metrics: the Matrix Mutual Information Ratio (MIR) and the Matrix Entropy Difference Ratio (HDR), which quantitatively assess the interactions between data representations and classification heads in supervised learning, with theoretical optimal values derived under the Neural Collapse state. Our experiments demonstrate that MIR and HDR effectively explain various phenomena in neural networks, including the dynamics of standard supervised training, linear mode connectivity. Moreover, we use MIR and HDR to analyze the dynamics of grokking, which is a fascinating phenomenon in supervised learning where a model unexpectedly exhibits generalization long after achieving training data fit.</p>

<p>Abstract: Forecasts of future events are essential inputs into informed decision-making. Machine learning (ML) systems have the potential to deliver forecasts at scale, but there is no framework for evaluating the accuracy of ML systems on a standardized set of forecasting questions. To address this gap, we introduce ForecastBench: a dynamic benchmark that evaluates the accuracy of ML systems on an automatically generated and regularly updated set of 1,000 forecasting questions. To avoid any possibility of data leakage, ForecastBench is comprised solely of questions about future events that have no known answer at the time of submission. We quantify the capabilities of current ML systems by collecting forecasts from expert (human) forecasters, the general public, and LLMs on a random subset of questions from the benchmark ($N=200$). While LLMs have achieved super-human performance on many benchmarks, they perform less well here: expert forecasters outperform the top-performing LLM ($p$-value $<0.001$). We display system and human scores in a public leaderboard at www.forecastbench.org.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Hyeong Kim, Seonghwan Kim, Seokhyun Moon, Hyeongwoo Kim, Jeheon Woo, Woo Youn Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Transporting between arbitrary distributions is a fundamental goal in generative modeling. Recently proposed diffusion bridge models provide a potential solution, but they rely on a joint distribution that is difficult to obtain in practice. Furthermore, formulations based on continuous domains limit their applicability to discrete domains such as graphs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Discrete Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (DDSBM), a novel framework that utilizes continuous-time Markov chains to solve the SB problem in a high-dimensional discrete state space. Our approach extends Iterative Markovian Fitting to discrete domains, and we have proved its convergence to the SB. Furthermore, we adapt our framework for the graph transformation, and show that our design choice of underlying dynamics characterized by independent modifications of nodes and edges can be interpreted as the entropy-regularized version of optimal transport with a cost function described by the graph edit distance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we have applied DDSBM to molecular optimization in the field of chemistry. Experimental results demonstrate that DDSBM effectively optimizes molecules' property-of-interest with minimal graph transformation, successfully retaining other features.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Santiago Cortes-Gomez, Carlos Pati\~no, Yewon Byun, Steven Wu, Eric Horvitz, Bryan Wilder</p>
<p>Abstract: Interest has been growing in decision-focused machine learning methods which train models to account for how their predictions are used in downstream optimization problems. Doing so can often improve performance on subsequent decision problems. However, current methods for uncertainty quantification do not incorporate any information about downstream decisions. We develop a methodology based on conformal prediction to identify prediction sets that account for a downstream cost function, making them more appropriate to inform high-stakes decision-making. Our approach harnesses the strengths of conformal methods -- modularity, model-agnosticism, and statistical coverage guarantees -- while incorporating downstream decisions and user-specified utility functions. We prove that our methods retain standard coverage guarantees. Empirical evaluation across a range of datasets and utility metrics demonstrates that our methods achieve significantly lower costs than standard conformal methods. We present a real-world use case in healthcare diagnosis, where our method effectively incorporates the hierarchical structure of dermatological diseases. The method successfully generates sets with coherent diagnostic meaning, potentially aiding triage for dermatology diagnosis and illustrating how our method can ground high-stakes decision-making employing domain knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soyeon Kim, Yuji Roh, Geon Heo, Steven Euijong Whang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models must ensure both privacy and fairness for Trustworthy AI. While these goals have been pursued separately, recent studies propose to combine existing privacy and fairness techniques to achieve both goals. However, naively combining these techniques can be insufficient due to privacy-fairness conflicts, where a sample in a minority group may be represented in ways that support fairness, only to be suppressed for privacy. We demonstrate how these conflicts lead to adverse effects, such as privacy violations and unexpected fairness-utility tradeoffs. To mitigate these risks, we propose PFGuard, a generative framework with privacy and fairness safeguards, which simultaneously addresses privacy, fairness, and utility. By using an ensemble of multiple teacher models, PFGuard balances privacy-fairness conflicts between fair and private training stages and achieves high utility based on ensemble learning. Extensive experiments show that PFGuard successfully generates synthetic data on high-dimensional data while providing both DP guarantees and convergence in fair generative modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hoang Phuc Hau Luu, Hanlin Yu, Bernardo Williams, Marcelo Hartmann, Arto Klami</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization in the Bures-Wasserstein space has been gaining popularity in the machine learning community since it draws connections between variational inference and Wasserstein gradient flows. The variational inference objective function of Kullback-Leibler divergence can be written as the sum of the negative entropy and the potential energy, making forward-backward Euler the method of choice. Notably, the backward step admits a closed-form solution in this case, facilitating the practicality of the scheme. However, the forward step is not exact since the Bures-Wasserstein gradient of the potential energy involves "intractable" expectations. Recent approaches propose using the Monte Carlo method -- in practice a single-sample estimator -- to approximate these terms, resulting in high variance and poor performance. We propose a novel variance-reduced estimator based on the principle of control variates. We theoretically show that this estimator has a smaller variance than the Monte-Carlo estimator in scenarios of interest. We also prove that variance reduction helps improve the optimization bounds of the current analysis. We demonstrate that the proposed estimator gains order-of-magnitude improvements over the previous Bures-Wasserstein methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuehan Qin, Yichi Zhang, Yi Nian, Xueying Ding, Yue Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: How can we automatically select an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection model for various underlying tasks? This is crucial for maintaining the reliability of open-world applications by identifying data distribution shifts, particularly in critical domains such as online transactions, autonomous driving, and real-time patient diagnosis. Despite the availability of numerous OOD detection methods, the challenge of selecting an optimal model for diverse tasks remains largely underexplored, especially in scenarios lacking ground truth labels. In this work, we introduce MetaOOD, the first zero-shot, unsupervised framework that utilizes meta-learning to select an OOD detection model automatically. As a meta-learning approach, MetaOOD leverages historical performance data of existing methods across various benchmark OOD detection datasets, enabling the effective selection of a suitable model for new datasets without the need for labeled data at the test time. To quantify task similarities more accurately, we introduce language model-based embeddings that capture the distinctive OOD characteristics of both datasets and detection models. Through extensive experimentation with 24 unique test dataset pairs to choose from among 11 OOD detection models, we demonstrate that MetaOOD significantly outperforms existing methods and only brings marginal time overhead. Our results, validated by Wilcoxon statistical tests, show that MetaOOD surpasses a diverse group of 11 baselines, including established OOD detectors and advanced unsupervised selection methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongyi Su, Yushu Li, Nanqing Liu, Kui Jia, Xulei Yang, Chuan-Sheng Foo, Xun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) updates the model weights during the inference stage using testing data to enhance generalization. However, this practice exposes TTA to adversarial risks. Existing studies have shown that when TTA is updated with crafted adversarial test samples, also known as test-time poisoned data, the performance on benign samples can deteriorate. Nonetheless, the perceived adversarial risk may be overstated if the poisoned data is generated under overly strong assumptions. In this work, we first review realistic assumptions for test-time data poisoning, including white-box versus grey-box attacks, access to benign data, attack order, and more. We then propose an effective and realistic attack method that better produces poisoned samples without access to benign samples, and derive an effective in-distribution attack objective. We also design two TTA-aware attack objectives. Our benchmarks of existing attack methods reveal that the TTA methods are more robust than previously believed. In addition, we analyze effective defense strategies to help develop adversarially robust TTA methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/RTTDP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taesun Yeom, Sangyoon Lee, Jaeho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural fields are an emerging paradigm that represent data as continuous functions parameterized by neural networks. Despite many advantages, neural fields often have a high training cost, which prevents a broader adoption. In this paper, we focus on a popular family of neural fields, called sinusoidal neural fields (SNFs), and study how it should be initialized to maximize the training speed. We find that the standard initialization scheme for SNFs -- designed based on the signal propagation principle -- is suboptimal. In particular, we show that by simply multiplying each weight (except for the last layer) by a constant, we can accelerate SNF training by 10$\times$. This method, coined $\textit{weight scaling}$, consistently provides a significant speedup over various data domains, allowing the SNFs to train faster than more recently proposed architectures. To understand why the weight scaling works well, we conduct extensive theoretical and empirical analyses which reveal that the weight scaling not only resolves the spectral bias quite effectively but also enjoys a well-conditioned optimization trajectory.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative AI has transformed the fields of Design and Manufacturing by providing efficient and automated methods for generating and modifying 3D objects. One approach involves using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate Computer- Aided Design (CAD) scripting code, which can then be executed to render a 3D object; however, the resulting 3D object may not meet the specified requirements. Testing the correctness of CAD generated code is challenging due to the complexity and structure of 3D objects (e.g., shapes, surfaces, and dimensions) that are not feasible in code. In this paper, we introduce CADCodeVerify, a novel approach to iteratively verify and improve 3D objects generated from CAD code. Our approach works by producing ameliorative feedback by prompting a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate and answer a set of validation questions to verify the generated object and prompt the VLM to correct deviations. To evaluate CADCodeVerify, we introduce, CADPrompt, the first benchmark for CAD code generation, consisting of 200 natural language prompts paired with expert-annotated scripting code for 3D objects to benchmark progress. Our findings show that CADCodeVerify improves VLM performance by providing visual feedback, enhancing the structure of the 3D objects, and increasing the success rate of the compiled program. When applied to GPT-4, CADCodeVerify achieved a 7.30% reduction in Point Cloud distance and a 5.0% improvement in success rate compared to prior work</p>

In the paper, we propose Graph Ensemble Temperature Scaling, a novel calibration framework that combines input and model ensemble strategies within a Graph Mixture of Experts archi SOTA calibration techniques, reducing expected calibration error by 25 percent across 10 GNN benchmark datasets. Additionally, GETS is computationally efficient, scalable, and capable of selecting effective input combinations for improved calibration performance. The implementation is available via Github.</p>

<p>Abstract: The well-known generalization problem hinders the application of artificial neural networks in continuous-time prediction tasks with varying latent dynamics. In sharp contrast, biological systems can neatly adapt to evolving environments benefiting from real-time feedback mechanisms. Inspired by the feedback philosophy, we present feedback neural networks, showing that a feedback loop can flexibly correct the learned latent dynamics of neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs), leading to a prominent generalization improvement. The feedback neural network is a novel two-DOF neural network, which possesses robust performance in unseen scenarios with no loss of accuracy performance on previous tasks.} A linear feedback form is presented to correct the learned latent dynamics firstly, with a convergence guarantee. Then, domain randomization is utilized to learn a nonlinear neural feedback form. Finally, extensive tests including trajectory prediction of a real irregular object and model predictive control of a quadrotor with various uncertainties, are implemented, indicating significant improvements over state-of-the-art model-based and learning-based methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Molecular generation and molecular property prediction are both crucial for drug discovery, but they are often developed independently. Inspired by recent studies, which demonstrate that diffusion model, a prominent generative approach, can learn meaningful data representations that enhance predictive tasks, we explore the potential for developing a unified generative model in the molecular domain that effectively addresses both molecular generation and property prediction tasks. However, the integration of these tasks is challenging due to inherent inconsistencies, making simple multi-task learning ineffective. To address this, we propose UniGEM, the first unified model to successfully integrate molecular generation and property prediction, delivering superior performance in both tasks. Our key innovation lies in a novel two-phase generative process, where predictive tasks are activated in the later stages, after the molecular scaffold is formed. We further enhance task balance through innovative training strategies. Rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments demonstrate our significant improvements in both tasks. The principles behind UniGEM hold promise for broader applications, including natural language processing and computer vision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaxin Du, Rui Ye, Fengting Yuchi, Wanru Zhao, Jingjing Qu, Yanfeng Wang, Siheng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs) by leveraging massively distributed data. However, the decentralized nature of FL exacerbates data quality challenges, as local clients lack global visibility to filter noisy or low-quality samples before training. To resolve this issue, we propose FedDQC, a novel federated instruction tuning framework with dynamic data quality control. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, we propose instruction-response alignment (IRA), an efficient client-side metric for quality evaluation requiring only low-cost inference. We validate that higher-IRA data corresponds to more relevant and easier-to-learn question-answer pairs. Second, mirroring the human easy-to-hard knowledge acquisition process, we design a quality-aware hierarchical FL training framework, where the LLM is progressively fine-tuned from high- to low-IRA data in a collaborative manner. The framework also supports adaptive data quality assessment at each hierarchy, enabling dynamic adjustments throughout the training process. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method significantly improves LLM performance on mixed-quality data in FL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Uttam Suman, Mariya Mamajiwala, Mukul Saxena, Ankit Tyagi, Debasish Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Our proposal is on a new stochastic optimizer for non-convex and possibly non-smooth objective functions typically defined over large dimensional design spaces. Towards this, we have tried to bridge noise-assisted global search and faster local convergence, the latter being the characteristic feature of a Newton-like search. Our specific scheme -- acronymed FINDER (Filtering Informed Newton-like and Derivative-free Evolutionary Recursion), exploits the nonlinear stochastic filtering equations to arrive at a derivative-free update that has resemblance with the Newton search employing the inverse Hessian of the objective function. Following certain simplifications of the update to enable a linear scaling with dimension and a few other enhancements, we apply FINDER to a range of problems, starting with some IEEE benchmark objective functions to a couple of archetypal data-driven problems in deep networks to certain cases of physics-informed deep networks. The performance of the new method vis-\'a-vis the well-known Adam and a few others bears evidence to its promise and potentialities for large dimensional optimization problems of practical interest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Wang, Nikolaos Dimitriadis, Alessandro Favero, Guillermo Ortiz-Jimenez, Francois Fleuret, Pascal Frossard</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained models has become the standard approach to endow them with specialized knowledge, but it poses fundamental challenges. In particular, \textit{(i)} fine-tuning often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where improvements on a target domain degrade generalization on other tasks, and \textit{(ii)} merging fine-tuned checkpoints from disparate tasks can lead to significant performance loss. To address these challenges, we introduce LiNeS, Layer-increasing Network Scaling, a post-training editing technique designed to preserve pre-trained generalization while enhancing fine-tuned task performance. LiNeS scales parameter updates linearly based on their layer depth within the network, maintaining shallow layers close to their pre-trained values to preserve general features while allowing deeper layers to retain task-specific representations. In multi-task model merging scenarios, layer-wise scaling of merged parameters reduces negative task interference. LiNeS demonstrates significant improvements in both single-task and multi-task settings across various benchmarks in vision and natural language processing. It mitigates forgetting, enhances out-of-distribution generalization, integrates seamlessly with existing multi-task model merging baselines improving their performance across benchmarks and model sizes, and can boost generalization when merging LLM policies aligned with different rewards via RLHF. Our method is simple to implement, computationally efficient and complementary to many existing techniques. Our source code is available at https://github.com/wang-kee/LiNeS</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nithin Somasekharan, Shaowu Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katharina Friedl, No\'emie Jaquier, Jens Lundell, Tamim Asfour, Danica Kragic</p>
<p>Abstract: By incorporating physical consistency as inductive bias, deep neural networks display increased generalization capabilities and data efficiency in learning nonlinear dynamic models. However, the complexity of these models generally increases with the system dimensionality, requiring larger datasets, more complex deep networks, and significant computational effort. We propose a novel geometric network architecture to learn physically-consistent reduced-order dynamic parameters that accurately describe the original high-dimensional system behavior. This is achieved by building on recent advances in model-order reduction and by adopting a Riemannian perspective to jointly learn a non-linear structure-preserving latent space and the associated low-dimensional dynamics. Our approach enables accurate long-term predictions of the high-dimensional dynamics of rigid and deformable systems with increased data efficiency by inferring interpretable and physically-plausible reduced Lagrangian models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arthur Pignet, Chiara Regniez, John Klein</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the increasing demand for safer machine learning practices, the use of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods in production remains limited. This limitation is exacerbated by the challenge of validating UQ methods in absence of UQ ground truth. In classification tasks, when only a usual set of test data is at hand, several authors suggested different metrics that can be computed from such test points while assessing the quality of quantified uncertainties. This paper investigates such metrics and proves that they are theoretically well-behaved and actually tied to some uncertainty ground truth which is easily interpretable in terms of model prediction trustworthiness ranking. Equipped with those new results, and given the applicability of those metrics in the usual supervised paradigm, we argue that our contributions will help promoting a broader use of UQ in deep learning.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03753">Symbolic regression via MDLformer-guided search: from minimizing prediction error to minimizing description length</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Yu, Jingtao Ding, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Symbolic regression, a task discovering the formula best fitting the given data, is typically based on the heuristical search. These methods usually update candidate formulas to obtain new ones with lower prediction errors iteratively.However, since formulas with similar function shapes may have completely different symbolic forms, the prediction error does not decrease monotonously as the search approaches the target formula, causing the low recovery rate of existing methods. To solve this problem, we propose a novel search objective based on the minimum description length, which reflects the distance from the target and decreases monotonically as the search approaches the correct form of the target formula. To estimate the minimum description length of any input data, we design a neural network, MDLformer, which enables robust and scalable estimation through large-scale training. With the MDLformer's output as the search objective, we implement a symbolic regression method, SR4MDL, that can effectively recover the correct mathematical form of the formula. Extensive experiments illustrate its excellent performance in recovering formulas from data. Our method successfully recovers around 50 formulas across two benchmark datasets comprising 133 problems, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 43.92%. Experiments on 122 unseen black-box problems further demonstrate its generalization performance. We release our code at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/SR4MDL .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Grazzi, Julien Siems, J\"org K. H. Franke, Arber Zela, Frank Hutter, Massimiliano Pontil</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (LRNNs) such as Mamba, RWKV, GLA, mLSTM, and DeltaNet have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers for long sequences. However, both Transformers and LRNNs struggle to perform state-tracking, which may impair performance in tasks such as code evaluation. In one forward pass, current architectures are unable to solve even parity, the simplest state-tracking task, which non-linear RNNs can handle effectively. Recently, Sarrof et al. (2024) demonstrated that the failure of LRNNs like Mamba to solve parity stems from restricting the value range of their diagonal state-transition matrices to $[0, 1]$ and that incorporating negative values can resolve this issue. We extend this result to non-diagonal LRNNs such as DeltaNet. We prove that finite precision LRNNs with state-transition matrices having only positive eigenvalues cannot solve parity, while non-triangular matrices are needed to count modulo $3$. Notably, we also prove that LRNNs can learn any regular language when their state-transition matrices are products of identity minus vector outer product matrices, each with eigenvalues in the range $[-1, 1]$. Our experiments confirm that extending the eigenvalue range of Mamba and DeltaNet to include negative values not only enables them to solve parity but consistently improves their performance on state-tracking tasks. We also show that state-tracking enabled LRNNs can be pretrained stably and efficiently at scale (1.3B parameters), achieving competitive performance on language modeling and showing promise on code and math tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Dai, Brian Sullivan, Axel Montout, Amy Dillon, Chris Waller, Peter Acs, Rachel Denholm, Philip Williams, Alastair D Hay, Raul Santos-Rodriguez, Andrew Dowsey</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of machine learning and AI on electronic health records (EHRs) holds substantial potential for clinical insight. However, this approach faces challenges due to data heterogeneity, sparsity, temporal misalignment, and limited labeled outcomes. In this context, we leverage a linked EHR dataset of approximately one million de-identified individuals from Bristol, North Somerset, and South Gloucestershire, UK, to characterize urinary tract infections (UTIs). We implemented a data pre-processing and curation pipeline that transforms the raw EHR data into a structured format suitable for developing predictive models focused on data fairness, accountability and transparency. Given the limited availability and biases of ground truth UTI outcomes, we introduce a UTI risk estimation framework informed by clinical expertise to estimate UTI risk across individual patient timelines. Pairwise XGBoost models are trained using this framework to differentiate UTI risk categories with explainable AI techniques applied to identify key predictors and support interpretability. Our findings reveal differences in clinical and demographic predictors across risk groups. While this study highlights the potential of AI-driven insights to support UTI clinical decision-making, further investigation of patient sub-strata and extensive validation are needed to ensure robustness and applicability in clinical practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: The BrowserGym ecosystem addresses the growing need for efficient evaluation and benchmarking of web agents, particularly those leveraging automation and Large Language Models (LLMs). Many existing benchmarks suffer from fragmentation and inconsistent evaluation methodologies, making it challenging to achieve reliable comparisons and reproducible results. In an earlier work, Drouin et al. (2024) introduced BrowserGym which aims to solve this by providing a unified, gym-like environment with well-defined observation and action spaces, facilitating standardized evaluation across diverse benchmarks. We propose an extended BrowserGym-based ecosystem for web agent research, which unifies existing benchmarks from the literature and includes AgentLab, a complementary framework that aids in agent creation, testing, and analysis. Our proposed ecosystem offers flexibility for integrating new benchmarks while ensuring consistent evaluation and comprehensive experiment management. As a supporting evidence, we conduct the first large-scale, multi-benchmark web agent experiment and compare the performance of 6 state-of-the-art LLMs across 6 popular web agent benchmarks made available in BrowserGym. Among other findings, our results highlight a large discrepancy between OpenAI and Anthropic's latests models, with Claude-3.5-Sonnet leading the way on almost all benchmarks, except on vision-related tasks where GPT-4o is superior. Despite these advancements, our results emphasize that building robust and efficient web agents remains a significant challenge, due to the inherent complexity of real-world web environments and the limitations of current models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eliot Xing, Vernon Luk, Jean Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in GPU-based parallel simulation have enabled practitioners to collect large amounts of data and train complex control policies using deep reinforcement learning (RL), on commodity GPUs. However, such successes for RL in robotics have been limited to tasks sufficiently simulated by fast rigid-body dynamics. Simulation techniques for soft bodies are comparatively several orders of magnitude slower, thereby limiting the use of RL due to sample complexity requirements. To address this challenge, this paper presents both a novel RL algorithm and a simulation platform to enable scaling RL on tasks involving rigid bodies and deformables. We introduce Soft Analytic Policy Optimization (SAPO), a maximum entropy first-order model-based actor-critic RL algorithm, which uses first-order analytic gradients from differentiable simulation to train a stochastic actor to maximize expected return and entropy. Alongside our approach, we develop Rewarped, a parallel differentiable multiphysics simulation platform that supports simulating various materials beyond rigid bodies. We re-implement challenging manipulation and locomotion tasks in Rewarped, and show that SAPO outperforms baselines over a range of tasks that involve interaction between rigid bodies, articulations, and deformables.

<p>Abstract: On-demand vibration mitigation in a mechanical system needs the suitable design of multiscale metastructures, involving complex unit cells. In this study, immersing in the world of patterns and examining the structural details of some interesting motifs are extracted from the mechanical metastructure perspective. Nine interlaced metastructures are fabricated using additive manufacturing, and corresponding vibration characteristics are studied experimentally and numerically. Further, the band-gap modulation with metallic inserts in the honeycomb interlaced metastructures is also studied. AI-driven inverse design of such complex metastructures with a desired vibration mitigation profile can pave the way for addressing engineering challenges in high-precision manufacturing. The current inverse design methodologies are limited to designing simple periodic structures based on limited variants of unit cells. Therefore, a novel forward analysis model with multi-head FEM-inspired spatial attention (FSA) is proposed to learn the complex geometry of the metastructures and predict corresponding transmissibility. Subsequently, a multiscale Gaussian self-attention (MGSA) based inverse design model with Gaussian function for 1D spectrum position encoding is developed to produce a suitable metastructure for the desired vibration transmittance. The proposed AI framework demonstrated outstanding performance corresponding to the expected locally resonant bandgaps in a targeted frequency range.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce $\mathbf{G}$radient Descent with $\mathbf{A}$daptive $\mathbf{M}$omentum $\mathbf{S}$caling ($\mathbf{Grams}$), a novel optimization algorithm that decouples the direction and magnitude of parameter updates in deep learning. Unlike traditional optimizers that directly integrate momentum into updates, Grams separates the update direction, derived from current gradients, from momentum, which is used solely for adaptive magnitude scaling. This approach enables Grams to achieve improved loss descent compared to state-of-the-art cautious and momentum-based optimizers. We theoretically demonstrate that Grams descents faster than other state-of-the-art optimizers and establish a global convergence guarantee for Grams. We also validate its effectiveness through extensive empirical evaluations. The results demonstrate Grams' superior performance, including faster convergence and better generalization, compared to widely-used optimizers such as Adam, Lion, and their cautious variants. Our results highlight Grams' potential as a transformative approach for efficiently training large language models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhuo Ding, Ke Fan, Yikai Wang, Xinwei Sun, Yanwei Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large transformers have demonstrated remarkable success, making it necessary to compress these models to reduce inference costs while preserving their perfor-mance. Current compression algorithms prune transformers at fixed compression ratios, requiring a unique pruning process for each ratio, which results in high computational costs. In contrast, we propose pruning of pretrained transformers at any desired ratio within a single pruning stage, based on a differential inclusion for a mask parameter. This dynamic can generate the whole regularization solution path of the mask parameter, whose support set identifies the network structure. Therefore, the solution path identifies a Transformer weight family with various sparsity levels, offering greater flexibility and customization. In this paper, we introduce such an effective pruning method, termed SPP (Solution Path Pruning). To achieve effective pruning, we segment the transformers into paired modules, including query-key pairs, value-projection pairs, and sequential linear layers, and apply low-rank compression to these pairs, maintaining the output structure while enabling structural compression within the inner states. Extensive experiments conducted on various well-known transformer backbones have demonstrated the efficacy of SPP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianjin Huang, Ziquan Zhu, Gaojie Jin, Lu Liu, Zhangyang Wang, Shiwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse tasks, yet their training remains highly resource-intensive and susceptible to critical challenges such as training instability. A predominant source of this instability stems from gradient and loss spikes, which disrupt the learning process, often leading to costly interventions like checkpoint recovery and experiment restarts, further amplifying inefficiencies. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into gradient spikes observed during LLM training, revealing their prevalence across multiple architectures and datasets. Our analysis shows that these spikes can be up to $1000\times$ larger than typical gradients, substantially deteriorating model performance. To address this issue, we propose Spike-Aware Adam with Momentum Reset SPAM, a novel optimizer designed to counteract gradient spikes through momentum reset and spike-aware gradient clipping. Extensive experiments, including both pre-training and fine-tuning, demonstrate that SPAM consistently surpasses Adam and its variants across various tasks, including (1) LLM pre-training from 60M to 1B, (2) 4-bit LLM pre-training,(3) reinforcement learning, and (4) Time Series Forecasting. Additionally, SPAM facilitates memory-efficient training by enabling sparse momentum, where only a subset of momentum terms are maintained and updated. When operating under memory constraints, SPAM outperforms state-of-the-art memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore and Adam-Mini. Our work underscores the importance of mitigating gradient spikes in LLM training and introduces an effective optimization strategy that enhances both training stability and resource efficiency at scale.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuki Takezawa, Sebastian U. Stich</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized SGD can run with low communication costs, but its sparse communication characteristics deteriorate the convergence rate, especially when the number of nodes is large. In decentralized learning settings, communication is assumed to occur on only a given topology, while in many practical cases, the topology merely represents a preferred communication pattern, and connecting to arbitrary nodes is still possible. Previous studies have tried to alleviate the convergence rate degradation in these cases by designing topologies with large spectral gaps. However, the degradation is still significant when the number of nodes is substantial. In this work, we propose TELEPORTATION. TELEPORTATION activates only a subset of nodes, and the active nodes fetch the parameters from previous active nodes. Then, the active nodes update their parameters by SGD and perform gossip averaging on a relatively small topology comprising only the active nodes. We show that by activating only a proper number of nodes, TELEPORTATION can completely alleviate the convergence rate degradation. Furthermore, we propose an efficient hyperparameter-tuning method to search for the appropriate number of nodes to be activated. Experimentally, we showed that TELEPORTATION can train neural networks more stably and achieve higher accuracy than Decentralized SGD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in graph machine learning (GML), with its applications spanning numerous domains. However, the focus of GML has predominantly been on developing powerful models, often overlooking a crucial initial step: constructing suitable graphs from common data formats, such as tabular data. This construction process is fundamental to applying graph-based models, yet it remains largely understudied and lacks formalization. Our research aims to address this gap by formalizing the graph construction problem and proposing an effective solution. We identify two critical challenges to achieve this goal: 1. The absence of dedicated datasets to formalize and evaluate the effectiveness of graph construction methods, and 2. Existing automatic construction methods can only be applied to some specific cases, while tedious human engineering is required to generate high-quality graphs. To tackle these challenges, we present a two-fold contribution. First, we introduce a set of datasets to formalize and evaluate graph construction methods. Second, we propose an LLM-based solution, AutoG, automatically generating high-quality graph schemas without human intervention. The experimental results demonstrate that the quality of constructed graphs is critical to downstream task performance, and AutoG can generate high-quality graphs that rival those produced by human experts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Errica, Henrik Christiansen, Viktor Zaverkin, Mathias Niepert, Francesco Alesiani</p>
<p>Abstract: For almost 70 years, researchers have mostly relied on hyper-parameter tuning to pick the width of neural networks' layers out of many possible choices. This paper challenges the status quo by introducing an easy-to-use technique to learn an unbounded width of a neural network's layer during training. The technique does not rely on alternate optimization nor hand-crafted gradient heuristics; rather, it jointly optimizes the width and the parameters of each layer via simple backpropagation. We apply the technique to a broad range of data domains such as tables, images, texts, and graphs, showing how the width adapts to the task's difficulty. By imposing a soft ordering of importance among neurons, it is possible to truncate the trained network at virtually zero cost, achieving a smooth trade-off between performance and compute resources in a structured way. Alternatively, one can dynamically compress the network with no performance degradation. In light of recent foundation models trained on large datasets, believed to require billions of parameters and where hyper-parameter tuning is unfeasible due to huge training costs, our approach stands as a viable alternative for width learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Makoto Shing, Kou Misaki, Han Bao, Sho Yokoi, Takuya Akiba</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their size poses significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation, a widely-used technique for transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a small student model, presents a promising approach for model compression. A significant remaining issue lies in the major differences between teacher and student models, namely the substantial capacity gap, mode averaging, and mode collapse, which pose barriers during distillation. To address these issues, we introduce $\textit{Temporally Adaptive Interpolated Distillation (TAID)}$, a novel knowledge distillation approach that dynamically interpolates student and teacher distributions through an adaptive intermediate distribution, gradually shifting from the student's initial distribution towards the teacher's distribution. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating TAID's ability to prevent mode collapse and empirically show its effectiveness in addressing the capacity gap while balancing mode averaging and mode collapse. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate TAID's superior performance across various model sizes and architectures in both instruction tuning and pre-training scenarios. Furthermore, we showcase TAID's practical impact by developing two state-of-the-art compact foundation models: $\texttt{TAID-LLM-1.5B}$ for language tasks and $\texttt{TAID-VLM-2B}$ for vision-language tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddharth Swaroop, Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan, Finale Doshi-Velez</p>
<p>Abstract: We provide new connections between two distinct federated learning approaches based on (i) ADMM and (ii) Variational Bayes (VB), and propose new variants by combining their complementary strengths. Specifically, we show that the dual variables in ADMM naturally emerge through the 'site' parameters used in VB with isotropic Gaussian covariances. Using this, we derive two versions of ADMM from VB that use flexible covariances and functional regularisation, respectively. Through numerical experiments, we validate the improvements obtained in performance. The work shows connection between two fields that are believed to be fundamentally different and combines them to improve federated learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anh Bui, Trang Vu, Long Vuong, Trung Le, Paul Montague, Tamas Abraham, Junae Kim, Dinh Phung</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept erasure has emerged as a promising technique for mitigating the risk of harmful content generation in diffusion models by selectively unlearning undesirable concepts. The common principle of previous works to remove a specific concept is to map it to a fixed generic concept, such as a neutral concept or just an empty text prompt. In this paper, we demonstrate that this fixed-target strategy is suboptimal, as it fails to account for the impact of erasing one concept on the others. To address this limitation, we model the concept space as a graph and empirically analyze the effects of erasing one concept on the remaining concepts. Our analysis uncovers intriguing geometric properties of the concept space, where the influence of erasing a concept is confined to a local region. Building on this insight, we propose the Adaptive Guided Erasure (AGE) method, which \emph{dynamically} selects optimal target concepts tailored to each undesirable concept, minimizing unintended side effects. Experimental results show that AGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art erasure methods on preserving unrelated concepts while maintaining effective erasure performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alina Shutova, Vladimir Malinovskii, Vage Egiazarian, Denis Kuznedelev, Denis Mazur, Nikita Surkov, Ivan Ermakov, Dan Alistarh</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient real-world deployments of large language models (LLMs) rely on Key-Value (KV) caching for processing and generating long outputs, reducing the need for repetitive computation. For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take up tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for each token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be compressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often compromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to improve Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent dependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2) high-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an adaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to exploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to "optimally" compress the information that cannot be predicted. AQUA-KV significantly improves compression rates, while maintaining high accuracy on state-of-the-art LLM families. On Llama 3.2 LLMs, we achieve near-lossless inference at 2-2.5 bits per value with under $1\%$ relative error in perplexity and LongBench scores. AQUA-KV is one-shot, simple, and efficient: it can be calibrated on a single GPU within 1-6 hours, even for 70B models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prakhar Kaushik, Ankit Vaidya, Shravan Chaudhari, Alan Yuille</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of large models has raised concerns about their environmental impact and equity in accessibility due to significant computational costs. Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) offer a lightweight solution for finetuning large models, resulting in an abundance of publicly available adapters tailored to diverse domains. We ask: Can these pretrained adapters be leveraged to further streamline adaptation to new tasks while addressing these challenges? We introduce EigenLoRAx, a parameter-efficient finetuning method that recycles existing adapters to create a principal subspace aligned with their shared domain knowledge which can be further augmented with orthogonal basis vectors in low-resource scenarios. This enables rapid adaptation to new tasks by learning only lightweight coefficients on the principal components of the subspace - eliminating the need to finetune entire adapters. EigenLoRAx requires significantly fewer parameters and memory, improving efficiency for both training and inference. Our method demonstrates strong performance across diverse domains and tasks, offering a scalable for edge-based applications, personalization, and equitable deployment of large models in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rucha Bhalchandra Joshi, Sagar Prakash Barad, Nidhi Tiwari, Subhankar Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning representations of graph-structured data. In addition to real-valued GNNs, quaternion GNNs also perform well on tasks on graph-structured data. With the aim of reducing the energy footprint, we reduce the model size while maintaining accuracy comparable to that of the original-sized GNNs. This paper introduces Quaternion Message Passing Neural Networks (QMPNNs), a framework that leverages quaternion space to compute node representations. Our approach offers a generalizable method for incorporating quaternion representations into GNN architectures at one-fourth of the original parameter count. Furthermore, we present a novel perspective on Graph Lottery Tickets, redefining their applicability within the context of GNNs and QMPNNs. We specifically aim to find the initialization lottery from the subnetwork of the GNNs that can achieve comparable performance to the original GNN upon training. Thereby reducing the trainable model parameters even further. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed QMPNN framework and LTH for both GNNs and QMPNNs, we evaluate their performance on real-world datasets across three fundamental graph-based tasks: node classification, link prediction, and graph classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Gao, Jian Pu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-View Representation Learning (MVRL) aims to derive a unified representation from multi-view data by leveraging shared and complementary information across views. However, when views are irregularly missing, the incomplete data can lead to representations that lack sufficiency and consistency. To address this, we propose Multi-View Permutation of Variational Auto-Encoders (MVP), which excavates invariant relationships between views in incomplete data. MVP establishes inter-view correspondences in the latent space of Variational Auto-Encoders, enabling the inference of missing views and the aggregation of more sufficient information. To derive a valid Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) for learning, we apply permutations to randomly reorder variables for cross-view generation and then partition them by views to maintain invariant meanings under permutations. Additionally, we enhance consistency by introducing an informational prior with cyclic permutations of posteriors, which turns the regularization term into a similarity measure across distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on seven diverse datasets with varying missing ratios, achieving superior performance in multi-view clustering and generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enea Monzio Compagnoni, Rustem Islamov, Frank Norbert Proske, Aurelien Lucchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed methods are essential for handling machine learning pipelines comprising large-scale models and datasets. However, their benefits often come at the cost of increased communication overhead between the central server and agents, which can become the main bottleneck, making training costly or even unfeasible in such systems. Compression methods such as quantization and sparsification can alleviate this issue. Still, their robustness to large and heavy-tailed gradient noise, a phenomenon sometimes observed in language modeling, remains poorly understood. This work addresses this gap by analyzing Distributed Compressed SGD (DCSGD) and Distributed SignSGD (DSignSGD) using stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Our results show that DCSGD with unbiased compression is more vulnerable to noise in stochastic gradients, while DSignSGD remains robust, even under large and heavy-tailed noise. Additionally, we propose new scaling rules for hyperparameter tuning to mitigate performance degradation due to compression. These findings are empirically validated across multiple deep learning architectures and datasets, providing practical recommendations for distributed optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo\~ao Pedro Matos-Carvalho, Stefano Frizzo Stefenon, Valderi Reis Quietinho Leithardt, Kin-Choong Yow</p>
<p>Abstract: Surface contamination on electrical grid insulators leads to an increase in leakage current until an electrical discharge occurs, which can result in a power system shutdown. To mitigate the possibility of disruptive faults resulting in a power outage, monitoring contamination and leakage current can help predict the progression of faults. Given this need, this paper proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) model for predicting the increase in leakage current in high-voltage insulators. The hybrid structure considers a multi-criteria optimization using tree-structured Parzen estimation, an input stage filter for signal noise attenuation combined with a large language model (LLM) applied for time series forecasting. The proposed optimized LLM outperforms state-of-the-art DL models with a root-mean-square error equal to 2.24$\times10^{-4}$ for a short-term horizon and 1.21$\times10^{-3}$ for a medium-term horizon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rosie Zhao, Tian Qin, David Alvarez-Melis, Sham Kakade, Naomi Saphra</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the nature of sudden breakthroughs in language model performance at scale, which stands in contrast to smooth improvements governed by scaling laws. While advocates of "emergence" view abrupt performance gains as capabilities unlocking at specific scales, others have suggested that they are produced by thresholding effects and alleviated by continuous metrics. We propose that breakthroughs are instead driven by continuous changes in the probability distribution of training outcomes, particularly when performance is bimodally distributed across random seeds. In synthetic length generalization tasks, we show that different random seeds can produce either highly linear or emergent scaling trends. We reveal that sharp breakthroughs in metrics are produced by underlying continuous changes in their distribution across seeds. Furthermore, we provide a case study of inverse scaling and show that even as the probability of a successful run declines, the average performance of a successful run continues to increase monotonically. We validate our distributional scaling framework on realistic settings by measuring MMLU performance in LLM populations. These insights emphasize the role of random variation in the effect of scale on LLM capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Liang, Wanrong Zhang, Xinlei He, Kaishun Wu, Hong Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to protect sensitive data during the training of machine learning models, but its privacy guarantees often come at the cost of model performance, largely due to the inherent challenge of accurately quantifying privacy loss. While recent efforts have strengthened privacy guarantees by focusing solely on the final output and bounded domain cases, they still impose restrictive assumptions, such as convexity and other parameter limitations, and often lack a thorough analysis of utility. In this paper, we provide rigorous privacy and utility characterization for DPSGD for smooth loss functions in both bounded and unbounded domains. We track the privacy loss over multiple iterations by exploiting the noisy smooth-reduction property and establish the utility analysis by leveraging the projection's non-expansiveness and clipped SGD properties. In particular, we show that for DPSGD with a bounded domain, (i) the privacy loss can still converge without the convexity assumption, and (ii) a smaller bounded diameter can improve both privacy and utility simultaneously under certain conditions. Numerical results validate our results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Chieh Chao, Yubei Chen, Weiwei Wang, Achintha Wijesinghe, Suchinthaka Wanninayaka, Songyang Zhang, Zhi Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic communication marks a new paradigm shift from bit-wise data transmission to semantic information delivery for the purpose of bandwidth reduction. To more effectively carry out specialized downstream tasks at the receiver end, it is crucial to define the most critical semantic message in the data based on the task or goal-oriented features. In this work, we propose a novel goal-oriented communication (GO-COM) framework, namely Goal-Oriented Semantic Variational Autoencoder (GOS-VAE), by focusing on the extraction of the semantics vital to the downstream tasks. Specifically, we adopt a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to compress media data at the transmitter side. Instead of targeting the pixel-wise image data reconstruction, we measure the quality-of-service at the receiver end based on a pre-defined task-incentivized model. Moreover, to capture the relevant semantic features in the data reconstruction, imitation learning is adopted to measure the data regeneration quality in terms of goal-oriented semantics. Our experimental results demonstrate the power of imitation learning in characterizing goal-oriented semantics and bandwidth efficiency of our proposed GOS-VAE.</p>

We introduce FFTNet, an adaptive spectral filtering framework that leverages the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to achieve global token mixing in $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ time. By transforming inputs into the frequency domain, FFTNet exploits the orthogonality and energy preservation guaranteed by Parseval's theorem to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. A learnable spectral filter and modReLU activation dynamically emphasize salient frequency components, providing a rigorous and adaptive alternative to traditional self-attention. Experiments on the Long Range Arena and ImageNet benchmarks validate our theoretical insights and demonstrate superior performance over fixed Fourier and standard attention models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiao Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: In combinatorial semi-bandits, a learner repeatedly selects from a combinatorial decision set of arms, receives the realized sum of rewards, and observes the rewards of the individual selected arms as feedback. In this paper, we extend this framework to include \emph{graph feedback}, where the learner observes the rewards of all neighboring arms of the selected arms in a feedback graph $G$. We establish that the optimal regret over a time horizon $T$ scales as $\widetilde{\Theta}(S\sqrt{T}+\sqrt{\alpha ST})$, where $S$ is the size of the combinatorial decisions and $\alpha$ is the independence number of $G$. This result interpolates between the known regrets $\widetilde\Theta(S\sqrt{T})$ under full information (i.e., $G$ is complete) and $\widetilde\Theta(\sqrt{KST})$ under the semi-bandit feedback (i.e., $G$ has only self-loops), where $K$ is the total number of arms. A key technical ingredient is to realize a convexified action using a random decision vector with negative correlations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Missing data is a pervasive challenge spanning diverse data types, including tabular, sensor data, time-series, images and so on. Its origins are multifaceted, resulting in various missing mechanisms. Prior research in this field has predominantly revolved around the assumption of the Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) mechanism. However, Missing At Random (MAR) and Missing Not At Random (MNAR) mechanisms, though equally prevalent, have often remained underexplored despite their significant influence. This PhD project presents a comprehensive research agenda designed to investigate the implications of diverse missing data mechanisms. The principal aim is to devise robust methodologies capable of effectively handling missing data while accommodating the unique characteristics of MCAR, MAR, and MNAR mechanisms. By addressing these gaps, this research contributes to an enriched understanding of the challenges posed by missing data across various industries and data modalities. It seeks to provide practical solutions that enable the effective management of missing data, empowering researchers and practitioners to leverage incomplete datasets confidently.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanchao Wang, Zhao-Rong Lai, Tianqi Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: Invariant risk minimization is an important general machine learning framework that has recently been interpreted as a total variation model (IRM-TV). However, how to improve out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in the IRM-TV setting remains unsolved. In this paper, we extend IRM-TV to a Lagrangian multiplier model named OOD-TV-IRM. We find that the autonomous TV penalty hyperparameter is exactly the Lagrangian multiplier. Thus OOD-TV-IRM is essentially a primal-dual optimization model, where the primal optimization minimizes the entire invariant risk and the dual optimization strengthens the TV penalty. The objective is to reach a semi-Nash equilibrium where the balance between the training loss and OOD generalization is maintained. We also develop a convergent primal-dual algorithm that facilitates an adversarial learning scheme. Experimental results show that OOD-TV-IRM outperforms IRM-TV in most situations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqian Lin, Shubham Kumar Bharti, Kangwook Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has investigated the underlying mechanisms of in-context learning (ICL) both theoretically and empirically, often using data generated from simple function classes. However, the existing work often focuses on the sequence consisting solely of labeled examples, while in practice, labeled examples are typically accompanied by an instruction, providing some side information about the task. In this work, we propose ICL with hypothesis-class guidance (ICL-HCG), a novel synthetic data model for ICL where the input context consists of the literal description of a (finite) hypothesis class H and $(x,y)$ pairs from a hypothesis chosen from H. Under our framework ICL-HCG, we conduct extensive experiments to explore: (i) a variety of generalization abilities to new hypothesis classes; (ii) different model architectures; (iii) sample complexity; (iv) in-context data imbalance; (v) the role of instruction; and (vi) the effect of pretraining hypothesis diversity. As a result, we show that (a) Transformers can successfully learn ICL-HCG and generalize to unseen hypotheses and unseen hypothesis classes, and (b) compared with ICL without instruction, ICL-HCG achieves significantly higher accuracy, demonstrating the role of instructions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reliable reservoir volume estimates are crucial for water resource management, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. The present study investigates applying three machine learning regression techniques - Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and ElasticNet to predict key dam performance characteristics of the Loskop Dam in South Africa. The models were trained and validated on a dataset comprising geospatial elevation measurements paired with corresponding reservoir supply capacity values. The best-performing approach was a threshold-based blended model that combined random forest for higher volumes with Ridge regression for lower volumes. This model achieved an RMSE of 4.88 MCM and an R2 of 0.99. These findings highlight the ability of ensemble learning techniques to capture complex relationships in dam datasets and underscore their practical utility for reliable dam performance modelling in real-world water resource management scenarios.</p>

We further propose an estimation algorithm based on recent advances in multi-view Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The proposed methodology is validated through simulations and application on real neuroimaging data, where it enables the estimation of causal graphs between brain regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parthiban Loganathan, Elias Zea, Ricardo Vinuesa, Evelyn Otero</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate regional climate forecast calls for high-resolution downscaling of Global Climate Models (GCMs). This work presents a deep-learning-based multi-model evaluation and downscaling framework ranking 32 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models using a Deep Learning-TOPSIS (DL-TOPSIS) mechanism and so refines outputs using advanced deep-learning models. Using nine performance criteria, five K\"oppen-Geiger climate zones -- Tropical, Arid, Temperate, Continental, and Polar -- are investigated over four seasons. While TaiESM1 and CMCC-CM2-SR5 show notable biases, ranking results show that NorESM2-LM, GISS-E2-1-G, and HadGEM3-GC31-LL outperform other models. Four models contribute to downscaling the top-ranked GCMs to 0.1$^{\circ}$ resolution: Vision Transformer (ViT), Geospatial Spatiotemporal Transformer with Attention and Imbalance-Aware Network (GeoSTANet), CNN-LSTM, and CNN-Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM). Effectively capturing temperature extremes (TXx, TNn), GeoSTANet achieves the highest accuracy (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 1.57$^{\circ}$C, Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) = 0.89, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) = 0.85, Correlation ($r$) = 0.92), so reducing RMSE by 20% over ConvLSTM. CNN-LSTM and ConvLSTM do well in Continental and Temperate zones; ViT finds fine-scale temperature fluctuations difficult. These results confirm that multi-criteria ranking improves GCM selection for regional climate studies and transformer-based downscaling exceeds conventional deep-learning methods. This framework offers a scalable method to enhance high-resolution climate projections, benefiting impact assessments and adaptation plans.</p>

<p>Abstract: We show that the Rademacher complexity-based framework can establish non-vacuous generalization bounds for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the context of classifying a small set of image classes. A key technical advancement is the formulation of novel contraction lemmas for high-dimensional mappings between vector spaces, specifically designed for general Lipschitz activation functions. These lemmas extend and refine the Talagrand contraction lemma across a broader range of scenarios. Our Rademacher complexity bound provides an enhancement over the results presented by Golowich et al. for ReLU-based Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Moreover, while previous works utilizing Rademacher complexity have primarily focused on ReLU DNNs, our results generalize to a wider class of activation functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Rafi Ur Rashid, Vishnu Asutosh Dasu, Kang Gu, Najrin Sultana, Shagufta Mehnaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has become a key component in various language modeling applications such as machine translation, next-word prediction, and medical record analysis. These applications are trained on datasets from many FL participants that often include privacy-sensitive data, such as healthcare records, phone/credit card numbers, login credentials, etc. Although FL enables computation without necessitating clients to share their raw data, determining the extent of privacy leakage in federated language models is challenging and not straightforward. Moreover, existing attacks aim to extract data regardless of how sensitive or naive it is. To fill this research gap, we introduce two novel findings with regard to leaking privacy-sensitive user data from federated large language models. Firstly, we make a key observation that model snapshots from the intermediate rounds in FL can cause greater privacy leakage than the final trained model. Secondly, we identify that privacy leakage can be aggravated by tampering with a model's selective weights that are specifically responsible for memorizing the sensitive training data. We show how a malicious client can leak the privacy-sensitive data of some other users in FL even without any cooperation from the server. Our best-performing method improves the membership inference recall by 29% and achieves up to 71% private data reconstruction, evidently outperforming existing attacks with stronger assumptions of adversary capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanvi Sharma, Mustafa Ali, Indranil Chakraborty, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Matrix multiplication is the dominant computation during Machine Learning (ML) inference. To efficiently perform such multiplication operations, Compute-in-memory (CiM) paradigms have emerged as a highly energy efficient solution. However, integrating compute in memory poses key questions, such as 1) What type of CiM to use: Given a multitude of CiM design characteristics, determining their suitability from architecture perspective is needed. 2) When to use CiM: ML inference includes workloads with a variety of memory and compute requirements, making it difficult to identify when CiM is more beneficial than standard processing cores. 3) Where to integrate CiM: Each memory level has different bandwidth and capacity, creating different data reuse opportunities for CiM integration.
  To answer such questions regarding on-chip CiM integration for accelerating ML workloads, we use an analytical architecture-evaluation methodology with tailored mapping algorithm. The mapping algorithm aims to achieve highest weight reuse and reduced data movements for a given CiM prototype and workload. Our analysis considers the integration of CiM prototypes into the cache levels of a tensor-core-like architecture, and shows that CiM integrated memory improves energy efficiency by up to 3.4x and throughput by up to 15.6x compared to established baseline with INT-8 precision. We believe the proposed work provides insights into what type of CiM to use, and when and where to optimally integrate it in the cache hierarchy for efficient matrix multiplication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreya Rajagopal, Jae Ho Sohn, Hari Subramonyam, Shiwali Mohan</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI systems such as ChatGPT and Claude are built upon language models that are typically evaluated for accuracy on curated benchmark datasets. Such evaluation paradigms measure predictive and reasoning capabilities of language models but do not assess if they can provide information that is useful to people. In this paper, we take some initial steps in developing an evaluation paradigm that centers human understanding and decision-making. We study the utility of generative AI systems in supporting people in a concrete task - making sense of clinical reports and imagery in order to make a clinical decision. We conducted a formative need-finding study in which participants discussed chest computed tomography (CT) scans and associated radiology reports of a fictitious close relative with a cardiothoracic radiologist. Using thematic analysis of the conversation between participants and medical experts, we identified commonly occurring themes across interactions, including clarifying medical terminology, locating the problems mentioned in the report in the scanned image, understanding disease prognosis, discussing the next diagnostic steps, and comparing treatment options. Based on these themes, we evaluated two state-of-the-art generative AI systems against the radiologist's responses. Our results reveal variability in the quality of responses generated by the models across various themes. We highlight the importance of patient-facing generative AI systems to accommodate a diverse range of conversational themes, catering to the real-world informational needs of patients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahuan Yan, Jintai Chen, Chaowen Hu, Bo Zheng, Yaojun Hu, Jimeng Sun, Jian Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent development in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated impressive domain proficiency on unstructured textual or multi-modal tasks. However, despite with intrinsic world knowledge, their application on structured tabular data prediction still lags behind, primarily due to the numerical insensitivity and modality discrepancy that brings a gap between LLM reasoning and statistical tabular learning. Unlike textual or vision data (e.g., electronic clinical notes or medical imaging data), tabular data is often presented in heterogeneous numerical values (e.g., CBC reports). This ubiquitous data format requires intensive expert annotation, and its numerical nature limits LLMs' capability to effectively transfer untapped domain expertise. In this paper, we propose SERSAL, a general self-prompting method by synergy learning with small models to enhance LLM tabular prediction in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, SERSAL utilizes the LLM's prior outcomes as original soft noisy annotations, which are dynamically leveraged to teach a better small student model. Reversely, the outcomes from the trained small model are used to teach the LLM to further refine its real capability. This process can be repeatedly applied to gradually distill refined knowledge for continuous progress. Comprehensive experiments on widely used medical domain tabular datasets show that, without access to gold labels, applying SERSAL to OpenAI GPT reasoning process attains substantial improvement compared to linguistic prompting methods, which serves as an orthogonal direction for tabular LLM, and increasing prompting bonus is observed as more powerful LLMs appear.</p>

<p>Abstract: In Distributed optimization and Learning, and even more in the modern framework of federated learning, communication, which is slow and costly, is critical. We introduce LoCoDL, a communication-efficient algorithm that leverages the two popular and effective techniques of Local training, which reduces the communication frequency, and Compression, in which short bitstreams are sent instead of full-dimensional vectors of floats. LoCoDL works with a large class of unbiased compressors that includes widely-used sparsification and quantization methods. LoCoDL provably benefits from local training and compression and enjoys a doubly-accelerated communication complexity, with respect to the condition number of the functions and the model dimension, in the general heterogenous regime with strongly convex functions. This is confirmed in practice, with LoCoDL outperforming existing algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reservoir Computing is an Unconventional Computation model to perform computation on various different substrates, such as recurrent neural networks or physical materials. The method takes a 'black-box' approach, training only the outputs of the system it is built on. As such, evaluating the computational capacity of these systems can be challenging. We review and critique the evaluation methods used in the field of reservoir computing. We introduce a categorisation of benchmark tasks. We review multiple examples of benchmarks from the literature as applied to reservoir computing, and note their strengths and shortcomings. We suggest ways in which benchmarks and their uses may be improved to the benefit of the reservoir computing community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seanie Lee, Minsu Kim, Lynn Cherif, David Dobre, Juho Lee, Sung Ju Hwang, Kenji Kawaguchi, Gauthier Gidel, Yoshua Bengio, Nikolay Malkin, Moksh Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: Red-teaming, or identifying prompts that elicit harmful responses, is a critical step in ensuring the safe and responsible deployment of large language models (LLMs). Developing effective protection against many modes of attack prompts requires discovering diverse attacks. Automated red-teaming typically uses reinforcement learning to fine-tune an attacker language model to generate prompts that elicit undesirable responses from a target LLM, as measured, for example, by an auxiliary toxicity classifier. We show that even with explicit regularization to favor novelty and diversity, existing approaches suffer from mode collapse or fail to generate effective attacks. As a flexible and probabilistically principled alternative, we propose to use GFlowNet fine-tuning, followed by a secondary smoothing phase, to train the attacker model to generate diverse and effective attack prompts. We find that the attacks generated by our method are effective against a wide range of target LLMs, both with and without safety tuning, and transfer well between target LLMs. Finally, we demonstrate that models safety-tuned using a dataset of red-teaming prompts generated by our method are robust to attacks from other RL-based red-teaming approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiran Lin, Anna Gerchanovsky, Omer Akgul, Lujo Bauer, Matt Fredrikson, Zifan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Writing effective prompts for large language models (LLM) can be unintuitive and burdensome. In response, services that optimize or suggest prompts have emerged. While such services can reduce user effort, they also introduce a risk: the prompt provider can subtly manipulate prompts to produce heavily biased LLM responses. In this work, we show that subtle synonym replacements in prompts can increase the likelihood (by a difference up to 78%) that LLMs mention a target concept (e.g., a brand, political party, nation). We substantiate our observations through a user study, showing that our adversarially perturbed prompts 1) are indistinguishable from unaltered prompts by humans, 2) push LLMs to recommend target concepts more often, and 3) make users more likely to notice target concepts, all without arousing suspicion. The practicality of this attack has the potential to undermine user autonomy. Among other measures, we recommend implementing warnings against using prompts from untrusted parties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Yadong Lu, Yelong Shen, Chen Liang, Weizhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has long been a challenging problem. Previous approaches have either suffered from quadratic computational complexity or limited extrapolation ability in length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall recent memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across a variety of benchmarks. Pretrained on sequences of 4K length, Samba shows improved perplexity in context lengths of up to 1M in zero-shot. When finetuned on 4K-length sequences, Samba efficiently extrapolates to a 256K context length with perfect memory recall on the Passkey Retrieval task, and exhibits superior retrieval extrapolation on the challenging Phonebook task compared to full-attention models. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba achieves a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention for user prompts of 128K length, and a 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. Our code for training on open source data is publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in advancing various fields of research and society. However, the current community of LLMs overly focuses on benchmarks for analyzing specific foundational skills (e.g. mathematics and code generation), neglecting an all-round evaluation of the computer science field. To bridge this gap, we introduce CS-Bench, the first multilingual (English, Chinese, French, German) benchmark dedicated to evaluating the performance of LLMs in computer science. CS-Bench comprises approximately 10K meticulously curated test samples, covering 26 subfields across 4 key areas of computer science, encompassing various task forms and divisions of knowledge and reasoning. Utilizing CS-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of over 30 mainstream LLMs, revealing the relationship between CS performance and model scales. We also quantitatively analyze the reasons for failures in existing LLMs and highlight directions for improvements, including knowledge supplementation and CS-specific reasoning. Further cross-capability experiments show a high correlation between LLMs' capabilities in computer science and their abilities in mathematics and coding. Moreover, expert LLMs specialized in mathematics and coding also demonstrate strong performances in several CS subfields. Looking ahead, we envision CS-Bench serving as a cornerstone for LLM applications in the CS field and paving new avenues in assessing LLMs' diverse reasoning capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moritz Kappel, Florian Hahlbohm, Timon Scholz, Susana Castillo, Christian Theobalt, Martin Eisemann, Vladislav Golyanik, Marcus Magnor</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic reconstruction and spatiotemporal novel-view synthesis of non-rigidly deforming scenes recently gained increased attention. While existing work achieves impressive quality and performance on multi-view or teleporting camera setups, most methods fail to efficiently and faithfully recover motion and appearance from casual monocular captures. This paper contributes to the field by introducing a new method for dynamic novel view synthesis from monocular video, such as casual smartphone captures.
  Our approach represents the scene as a $\textit{dynamic neural point cloud}$, an implicit time-conditioned point distribution that encodes local geometry and appearance in separate hash-encoded neural feature grids for static and dynamic regions. By sampling a discrete point cloud from our model, we can efficiently render high-quality novel views using a fast differentiable rasterizer and neural rendering network. Similar to recent work, we leverage advances in neural scene analysis by incorporating data-driven priors like monocular depth estimation and object segmentation to resolve motion and depth ambiguities originating from the monocular captures. In addition to guiding the optimization process, we show that these priors can be exploited to explicitly initialize our scene representation to drastically improve optimization speed and final image quality. As evidenced by our experimental evaluation, our dynamic point cloud model not only enables fast optimization and real-time frame rates for interactive applications, but also achieves competitive image quality on monocular benchmark sequences.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco Eiras, Aleksandar Petrov, Philip H. S. Torr, M. Pawan Kumar, Adel Bibi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research shows that fine-tuning on benign instruction-following data can inadvertently undo the safety alignment process and increase a model's propensity to comply with harmful queries. While instruction-following fine-tuning is important, task-specific fine-tuning - where models are trained on datasets with clear ground truth answers (e.g., multiple choice questions) - can enhance model performance on specialized downstream tasks. Understanding and mitigating safety risks in the task-specific setting remains distinct from the instruction-following context due to structural differences in the data. Our work demonstrates how malicious actors can subtly manipulate the structure of almost any task-specific dataset to foster significantly more dangerous model behaviors, while maintaining an appearance of innocuity and reasonable downstream task performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel mitigation strategy that mixes in safety data which mimics the task format and prompting style of the user data, showing this is significantly more effective and efficient than existing baselines at re-establishing safety alignment while maintaining similar task performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeffrey Willette, Heejun Lee, Youngwan Lee, Myeongjae Jeon, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: The transformer's context window is vital for tasks such as few-shot learning and conditional generation as it preserves previous tokens for active memory. However, as the context lengths increase, the computational costs grow quadratically, hindering the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world, long sequence scenarios. Although some recent key-value caching (KV Cache) methods offer linear inference complexity, they naively manage the stored context, prematurely evicting tokens and losing valuable information. Moreover, they lack an optimized prefill/prompt stage strategy, resulting in higher latency than even quadratic attention for realistic context sizes. In response, we introduce a novel mechanism that leverages cascading sub-cache buffers to selectively retain the most relevant tokens, enabling the model to maintain longer context histories without increasing the cache size. Our approach outperforms linear caching baselines across key benchmarks, including streaming perplexity, question answering, book summarization, and passkey retrieval, where it retains better retrieval accuracy at 1M tokens after four doublings of the cache size of 65K. Additionally, our method reduces prefill stage latency by a factor of 6.8 when compared to flash attention on 1M tokens. These innovations not only enhance the computational efficiency of LLMs but also pave the way for their effective deployment in resource-constrained environments, enabling large-scale, real-time applications with significantly reduced latency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vaishnavi Pulavarthi, Deeksha Nandal, Soham Dan, Debjit Pal</p>
<p>Abstract: Assertions have been the de facto collateral for simulation-based and formal verification of hardware designs for over a decade. The quality of hardware verification, \ie, detection and diagnosis of corner-case design bugs, is critically dependent on the quality of the assertions. There has been a considerable amount of research leveraging a blend of data-driven statistical analysis and static analysis to generate high-quality assertions from hardware design source code and design execution trace data. Despite such concerted effort, all prior research struggles to scale to industrial-scale large designs, generates too many low-quality assertions, often fails to capture subtle and non-trivial design functionality, and does not produce any easy-to-comprehend explanations of the generated assertions to understand assertions' suitability to different downstream validation tasks. Recently, with the advent of Large-Language Models (LLMs), there has been a widespread effort to leverage prompt engineering to generate assertions. However, there is little effort to quantitatively establish the effectiveness and suitability of various LLMs for assertion generation. In this paper, we present AssertionBench, a novel benchmark to evaluate LLMs' effectiveness for assertion generation quantitatively. AssertioBench contains 100 curated Verilog hardware designs from OpenCores and formally verified assertions for each design generated from GoldMine and HARM. We use AssertionBench to compare state-of-the-art LLMs to assess their effectiveness in inferring functionally correct assertions for hardware designs. Our experiments demonstrate how LLMs perform relative to each other, the benefits of using more in-context exemplars in generating a higher fraction of functionally correct assertions, and the significant room for improvement for LLM-based assertion generators.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study how to subvert large language models (LLMs) from following prompt-specified rules. We first formalize rule-following as inference in propositional Horn logic, a mathematical system in which rules have the form "if $P$ and $Q$, then $R$" for some propositions $P$, $Q$, and $R$. Next, we prove that although small transformers can faithfully follow such rules, maliciously crafted prompts can still mislead both theoretical constructions and models learned from data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that popular attack algorithms on LLMs find adversarial prompts and induce attention patterns that align with our theory. Our novel logic-based framework provides a foundation for studying LLMs in rule-based settings, enabling a formal analysis of tasks like logical reasoning and jailbreak attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramya Deshpande, Francesco Mottes, Ariana-Dalia Vlad, Michael P. Brenner, Alma dal Co</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the rules underlying organismal development is a major unsolved problem in biology. Each cell in a developing organism responds to signals in its local environment by dividing, excreting, consuming, or reorganizing, yet how these individual actions coordinate over a macroscopic number of cells to grow complex structures with exquisite functionality is unknown. Here we use recent advances in automatic differentiation to discover local interaction rules and genetic networks that yield emergent, systems-level characteristics in a model of development. We consider a growing tissue with cellular interactions mediated by morphogen diffusion, cell adhesion and mechanical stress. Each cell has an internal genetic network that is used to make decisions based on the cell's local environment. We show that one can learn the parameters governing cell interactions in the form of interpretable genetic networks for complex developmental scenarios, including directed axial elongation, cell type homeostasis via chemical signaling and homogenization of growth via mechanical stress. When combined with recent experimental advances measuring spatio-temporal dynamics and gene expression of cells in a growing tissue, the methodology outlined here offers a promising path to unraveling the cellular bases of development.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present AutoBencher, a declarative framework for automatic benchmark construction, and use it to scalably discover novel insights and vulnerabilities of existing language models. Concretely, given a few desiderata of benchmarks (e.g., question difficulty, topic salience), we operationalize each desideratum and cast benchmark creation as an optimization problem. Specifically, we experiment with two settings with different optimization objectives: (i) for capability evaluation, we declare the goal of finding a salient, difficult dataset that induces novel performance patterns; (ii) for safety evaluation, we declare the goal of finding a dataset of unsafe prompts that existing LMs fail to decline. To tackle this optimization problem, we use a language model to iteratively propose and refine dataset descriptions, which are then used to generate topic-specific questions and answers. These descriptions are optimized to improve the declared desiderata. We use AutoBencher (powered by GPT-4) to create datasets for math, multilinguality, knowledge, and safety. The scalability of AutoBencher allows it to test fine-grained categories and tail knowledge, creating datasets that elicit 22% more model errors (i.e., difficulty) than existing benchmarks. On the novelty ends, AutoBencher also helps identify specific gaps not captured by existing benchmarks: e.g., Gemini-Pro has knowledge gaps on Permian Extinction and Fordism while GPT-4o fails to decline harmful requests about cryptocurrency scams.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Mohammad Karimi Mamaghan, Samuele Papa, Karl Henrik Johansson, Stefan Bauer, Andrea Dittadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Object-centric (OC) representations, which model visual scenes as compositions of discrete objects, have the potential to be used in various downstream tasks to achieve systematic compositional generalization and facilitate reasoning. However, these claims have yet to be thoroughly validated empirically. Recently, foundation models have demonstrated unparalleled capabilities across diverse domains, from language to computer vision, positioning them as a potential cornerstone of future research for a wide range of computational tasks. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study on representation learning for downstream Visual Question Answering (VQA), which requires an accurate compositional understanding of the scene. We thoroughly investigate the benefits and trade-offs of OC models and alternative approaches including large pre-trained foundation models on both synthetic and real-world data, ultimately identifying a promising path to leverage the strengths of both paradigms. The extensiveness of our study, encompassing over 600 downstream VQA models and 15 different types of upstream representations, also provides several additional insights that we believe will be of interest to the community at large.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Irtaza Khalid, Steven Schockaert</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing models that can learn to reason is a notoriously challenging problem. We focus on reasoning in relational domains, where the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) seems like a natural choice. However, previous work has shown that regular GNNs lack the ability to systematically generalize from training examples on test graphs requiring longer inference chains, which fundamentally limits their reasoning abilities. A common solution relies on neuro-symbolic methods that systematically reason by learning rules, but their scalability is often limited and they tend to make unrealistically strong assumptions, e.g.\ that the answer can always be inferred from a single relational path. We propose the Epistemic GNN (EpiGNN), a novel parameter-efficient and scalable GNN architecture with an epistemic inductive bias for systematic reasoning. Node embeddings in EpiGNNs are treated as epistemic states, and message passing is implemented accordingly. We show that EpiGNNs achieve state-of-the-art results on link prediction tasks that require systematic reasoning. Furthermore, for inductive knowledge graph completion, EpiGNNs rival the performance of state-of-the-art specialized approaches. Finally, we introduce two new benchmarks that go beyond standard relational reasoning by requiring the aggregation of information from multiple paths. Here, existing neuro-symbolic approaches fail, yet EpiGNNs learn to reason accurately. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/erg0dic/gnn-sg.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan-Pablo Ortega, Florian Rossmannek</p>
<p>Abstract: Several topological and analytical notions of continuity and fading memory for causal and time-invariant filters are introduced, and the relations between them are analyzed. A significant generalization of the convolution theorem that establishes the equivalence between the fading memory property and the availability of convolution representations of linear filters is proved. This result extends a previous similar characterization to a complete array of weighted norms in the definition of the fading memory property. Additionally, the main theorem shows that the availability of convolution representations can be characterized, at least when the codomain is finite-dimensional, not only by the fading memory property but also by the reunion of two purely topological notions that are called minimal continuity and minimal fading memory property. Finally, when the input space and the codomain of a linear functional are Hilbert spaces, it is shown that minimal continuity and the minimal fading memory property guarantee the existence of interesting embeddings of the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08558">Linear combinations of latents in generative models: subspaces and beyond</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Erik Bodin, Alexandru Stere, Dragos D. Margineantu, Carl Henrik Ek, Henry Moss</p>
<p>Abstract: Sampling from generative models has become a crucial tool for applications like data synthesis and augmentation. Diffusion, Flow Matching and Continuous Normalizing Flows have shown effectiveness across various modalities, and rely on latent variables for generation. For experimental design or creative applications that require more control over the generation process, it has become common to manipulate the latent variable directly. However, existing approaches for performing such manipulations (e.g. interpolation or forming low-dimensional representations) only work well in special cases or are network or data-modality specific. We propose Linear combinations of Latent variables (LOL) as a general-purpose method to form linear combinations of latent variables that adhere to the assumptions of the generative model. As LOL is easy to implement and naturally addresses the broader task of forming any linear combinations, e.g. the construction of subspaces of the latent space, LOL dramatically simplifies the creation of expressive low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yidong Zhou, Jintai Chen, Jinglei Cheng, Gopal Karemore, Marinka Zitnik, Frederic T. Chong, Junyu Liu, Tianfan Fu, Zhiding Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Drug discovery and development is a highly complex and costly endeavor, typically requiring over a decade and substantial financial investment to bring a new drug to market. Traditional computer-aided drug design (CADD) has made significant progress in accelerating this process, but the development of quantum computing offers potential due to its unique capabilities. This paper discusses the integration of quantum computing into drug discovery and development, focusing on how quantum technologies might accelerate and enhance various stages of the drug development cycle. Specifically, we explore the application of quantum computing in addressing challenges related to drug discovery, such as molecular simulation and the prediction of drug-target interactions, as well as the optimization of clinical trial outcomes. By leveraging the inherent capabilities of quantum computing, we might be able to reduce the time and cost associated with bringing new drugs to market, ultimately benefiting public health.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhecheng Liu (University of California, Los Angeles), Diederik Beckers (California Institute of Technology), Jeff D. Eldredge (University of California, Los Angeles)</p>
<p>Abstract: The intrinsic high dimension of fluid dynamics is an inherent challenge to control of aerodynamic flows, and this is further complicated by a flow's nonlinear response to strong disturbances. Deep reinforcement learning, which takes advantage of the exploratory aspects of reinforcement learning (RL) and the rich nonlinearity of a deep neural network, provides a promising approach to discover feasible control strategies. However, the typical model-free approach to reinforcement learning requires a significant amount of interaction between the flow environment and the RL agent during training, and this high training cost impedes its development and application. In this work, we propose a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) approach by incorporating a novel reduced-order model as a surrogate for the full environment. The model consists of a physics-augmented autoencoder, which compresses high-dimensional CFD flow field snaphsots into a three-dimensional latent space, and a latent dynamics model that is trained to accurately predict the long-time dynamics of trajectories in the latent space in response to action sequences. The accuracy and robustness of the model are demonstrated in the scenario of a pitching airfoil within a highly disturbed environment. Additionally, an application to a vertical-axis wind turbine in a disturbance-free environment is discussed in the Appendix Based on the model trained in the pitching airfoil problem, we realize an MBRL strategy to mitigate lift variation during gust-airfoil encounters. We demonstrate that the policy learned in the reduced-order environment translates to an effective control strategy in the full CFD environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdalwhab Abdalwhab, Giovanni Beltrame, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, David St-Onge</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotics can help address the growing worker shortage challenge of the manufacturing industry. As such, machine tending is a task collaborative robots can tackle that can also highly boost productivity. Nevertheless, existing robotics systems deployed in that sector rely on a fixed single-arm setup, whereas mobile robots can provide more flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce a multi-agent multi-machine tending learning framework by mobile robots based on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) techniques with the design of a suitable observation and reward. Moreover, an attention-based encoding mechanism is developed and integrated into Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm to boost its performance for machine tending scenarios. Our model (AB-MAPPO) outperformed MAPPO in this new challenging scenario in terms of task success, safety, and resources utilization. Furthermore, we provided an extensive ablation study to support our various design decisions.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03550">DKDM: Data-Free Knowledge Distillation for Diffusion Models with Any Architecture</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianlong Xiang, Miao Zhang, Yuzhang Shang, Jianlong Wu, Yan Yan, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated exceptional generative capabilities across various domains, including image, video, and so on. A key factor contributing to their effectiveness is the high quantity and quality of data used during training. However, mainstream DMs now consume increasingly large amounts of data. For example, training a Stable Diffusion model requires billions of image-text pairs. This enormous data requirement poses significant challenges for training large DMs due to high data acquisition costs and storage expenses. To alleviate this data burden, we propose a novel scenario: using existing DMs as data sources to train new DMs with any architecture. We refer to this scenario as Data-Free Knowledge Distillation for Diffusion Models (DKDM), where the generative ability of DMs is transferred to new ones in a data-free manner. To tackle this challenge, we make two main contributions. First, we introduce a DKDM objective that enables the training of new DMs via distillation, without requiring access to the data. Second, we develop a dynamic iterative distillation method that efficiently extracts time-domain knowledge from existing DMs, enabling direct retrieval of training data without the need for a prolonged generative process. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore this scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that our data-free approach not only achieves competitive generative performance but also, in some instances, outperforms models trained with the entire dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raika Karimi, Faezeh Faez, Yingxue Zhang, Xing Li, Lei Chen, Mingxuan Yuan, Mahdi Biparva</p>
<p>Abstract: Contemporary hardware design benefits from the abstraction provided by high-level logic gates, streamlining the implementation of logic circuits. Logic Synthesis Optimization (LSO) operates at one level of abstraction within the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflow, targeting improvements in logic circuits with respect to performance metrics such as size and speed in the final layout. Recent trends in the field show a growing interest in leveraging Machine Learning (ML) for EDA, notably through ML-guided logic synthesis utilizing policy-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods.Despite these advancements, existing models face challenges such as overfitting and limited generalization, attributed to constrained public circuits and the expressiveness limitations of graph encoders. To address these hurdles, and tackle data scarcity issues, we introduce LSOformer, a novel approach harnessing Autoregressive transformer models and predictive SSL to predict the trajectory of Quality of Results (QoR). LSOformer integrates cross-attention modules to merge insights from circuit graphs and optimization sequences, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy for QoR metrics. Experimental studies validate the effectiveness of LSOformer, showcasing its superior performance over baseline architectures in QoR prediction tasks, where it achieves improvements of 5.74%, 4.35%, and 17.06% on the EPFL, OABCD, and proprietary circuits datasets, respectively, in inductive setup.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15511">Bayesian computation with generative diffusion models by Multilevel Monte Carlo</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdul-Lateef Haji-Ali, Marcelo Pereyra, Luke Shaw, Konstantinos Zygalakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful strategy to perform stochastic sampling in Bayesian inverse problems, delivering remarkably accurate solutions for a wide range of challenging applications. However, diffusion models often require a large number of neural function evaluations per sample in order to deliver accurate posterior samples. As a result, using diffusion models as stochastic samplers for Monte Carlo integration in Bayesian computation can be highly computationally expensive, particularly in applications that require a substantial number of Monte Carlo samples for conducting uncertainty quantification analyses. This cost is especially high in large-scale inverse problems such as computational imaging, which rely on large neural networks that are expensive to evaluate. With quantitative imaging applications in mind, this paper presents a Multilevel Monte Carlo strategy that significantly reduces the cost of Bayesian computation with diffusion models. This is achieved by exploiting cost-accuracy trade-offs inherent to diffusion models to carefully couple models of different levels of accuracy in a manner that significantly reduces the overall cost of the calculation, without reducing the final accuracy. The proposed approach achieves a $4\times$-to-$8\times$ reduction in computational cost w.r.t. standard techniques across three benchmark imaging problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dexuan Ding, Lei Wang, Liyun Zhu, Tom Gedeon, Piotr Koniusz</p>
<p>Abstract: In computer vision tasks, features often come from diverse representations, domains (e.g., indoor and outdoor), and modalities (e.g., text, images, and videos). Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains or modalities. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing relationship graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we expand graphs through iterative graph relationship updates and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to integrate these expanded relationships for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise relationship score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byoungwoo Park, Hyungi Lee, Juho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as healthcare, climate, and economics, are often collected as irregular time series, which poses challenges for accurate modeling. In this paper, we propose the Amortized Control of continuous State Space Model (ACSSM) for continuous dynamical modeling of time series for irregular and discrete observations. We first present a multi-marginal Doob's $h$-transform to construct a continuous dynamical system conditioned on these irregular observations. Following this, we introduce a variational inference algorithm with a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO), leveraging stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory to approximate the intractable Doob's $h$-transform and simulate the conditioned dynamics. To improve efficiency and scalability during both training and inference, ACSSM leverages auxiliary variable to flexibly parameterize the latent dynamics and amortized control. Additionally, it incorporates a simulation-free latent dynamics framework and a transformer-based data assimilation scheme, facilitating parallel inference of the latent states and ELBO computation. Through empirical evaluations across a variety of real-world datasets, ACSSM demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as classification, regression, interpolation, and extrapolation, while maintaining computational efficiency.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06940">Representation Alignment for Generation: Training Diffusion Transformers Is Easier Than You Think</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihyun Yu, Sangkyung Kwak, Huiwon Jang, Jongheon Jeong, Jonathan Huang, Jinwoo Shin, Saining Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the denoising process in (generative) diffusion models can induce meaningful (discriminative) representations inside the model, though the quality of these representations still lags behind those learned through recent self-supervised learning methods. We argue that one main bottleneck in training large-scale diffusion models for generation lies in effectively learning these representations. Moreover, training can be made easier by incorporating high-quality external visual representations, rather than relying solely on the diffusion models to learn them independently. We study this by introducing a straightforward regularization called REPresentation Alignment (REPA), which aligns the projections of noisy input hidden states in denoising networks with clean image representations obtained from external, pretrained visual encoders. The results are striking: our simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality when applied to popular diffusion and flow-based transformers, such as DiTs and SiTs. For instance, our method can speed up SiT training by over 17.5$\times$, matching the performance (without classifier-free guidance) of a SiT-XL model trained for 7M steps in less than 400K steps. In terms of final generation quality, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results of FID=1.42 using classifier-free guidance with the guidance interval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeru Shi, Kai Mei, Mingyu Jin, Yongye Su, Chaoji Zuo, Wenyue Hua, Wujiang Xu, Yujie Ren, Zirui Liu, Mengnan Du, Dong Deng, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the development of intelligent applications and systems such as LLM-based agents and agent operating systems (AIOS). However, when these applications and systems interact with the underlying file system, the file system still remains the traditional paradigm: reliant on manual navigation through precise commands. This paradigm poses a bottleneck to the usability of these systems as users are required to navigate complex folder hierarchies and remember cryptic file names. To address this limitation, we propose an LLM-based semantic file system ( LSFS ) for prompt-driven file management. Unlike conventional approaches, LSFS incorporates LLMs to enable users or agents to interact with files through natural language prompts, facilitating semantic file management. At the macro-level, we develop a comprehensive API set to achieve semantic file management functionalities, such as semantic file retrieval, file update monitoring and summarization, and semantic file rollback). At the micro-level, we store files by constructing semantic indexes for them, design and implement syscalls of different semantic operations (e.g., CRUD, group by, join) powered by vector database. Our experiments show that LSFS offers significant improvements over traditional file systems in terms of user convenience, the diversity of supported functions, and the accuracy and efficiency of file operations. Additionally, with the integration of LLM, our system enables more intelligent file management tasks, such as content summarization and version comparison, further enhancing its capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianren Zhang, Xianfeng Tang, Hui Liu, Zongyu Wu, Qi He, Dongwon Lee, Suhang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies show LLMs struggle with complex instructions involving multiple constraints (e.g., length, format, sentiment). Existing works address this issue by fine-tuning, which heavily relies on fine-tuning data quality and is computational expensive. An alternative is leveraging LLMs' self-correction to refine responses for better constraint adherence. However, this is limited by the feedback quality, as LLMs cannot generate reliable feedback or detect errors. Moreover, its effectiveness relies on few-shot examples illustrating response modifications. As constraints in complex instructions are diverse, manually crafting such examples for each constraint type can be labor-intensive and sub-optimal. To address these two challenges, we propose the Divide-Verify-Refine (DVR) framework with three steps: (1) Divide complex instructions into single constraints and prepare appropriate tools; (2) Verify responses using tools that provide rigorous check and textual guidance (e.g., Python toolkit for format checks or pre-trained classifiers for content analysis); (3) Refine: To maximize refinement effectiveness, we propose dynamic few-shot prompting, where a refinement repository collects successful refinements, and these examples are selectively retrieved for future refinements. Recognizing the lack of complexity in existing datasets, we create a new dataset of complex instructions. DVR doubles Llama3.1-8B's constraint adherence and triples Mistral-7B's performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in many graph machine learning tasks but face challenges when scaling to large networks. GNN transferability allows training on smaller graphs and applying the model to larger ones, but existing methods often rely on random subsampling, leading to disconnected subgraphs and reduced model expressivity. We propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that leverages feature homophily to preserve graph structure. By minimizing the trace of the data correlation matrix, our method better preserves the graph Laplacian trace -- a proxy for the graph connectivity -- than random sampling, while achieving lower complexity than spectral methods. Experiments on citation networks show improved performance in preserving Laplacian trace and GNN transferability compared to random sampling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuele Poppi, Zheng-Xin Yong, Yifei He, Bobbie Chern, Han Zhao, Aobo Yang, Jianfeng Chi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked widespread concerns about their safety. Recent work demonstrates that safety alignment of LLMs can be easily removed by fine-tuning with a few adversarially chosen instruction-following examples, i.e., fine-tuning attacks. We take a further step to understand fine-tuning attacks in multilingual LLMs. We first discover cross-lingual generalization of fine-tuning attacks: using a few adversarially chosen instruction-following examples in one language, multilingual LLMs can also be easily compromised (e.g., multilingual LLMs fail to refuse harmful prompts in other languages). Motivated by this finding, we hypothesize that safety-related information is language-agnostic and propose a new method termed Safety Information Localization (SIL) to identify the safety-related information in the model parameter space. Through SIL, we validate this hypothesis and find that only changing 20% of weight parameters in fine-tuning attacks can break safety alignment across all languages. Furthermore, we provide evidence to the alternative pathways hypothesis for why freezing safety-related parameters does not prevent fine-tuning attacks, and we demonstrate that our attack vector can still jailbreak LLMs adapted to new languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shen Nie, Fengqi Zhu, Chao Du, Tianyu Pang, Qian Liu, Guangtao Zeng, Min Lin, Chongxuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have shown promise in language modeling, yet their scalability and effectiveness in core language tasks, such as text generation and language understanding, remain underexplored. This paper establishes the first scaling law for MDMs, demonstrating a scaling rate comparable to autoregressive models (ARMs) and a relatively small compute gap. Motivated by their scalability, we train a family of MDMs with up to 1.1 billion (B) parameters to systematically evaluate their performance against ARMs of comparable or larger sizes. Fully leveraging the probabilistic formulation of MDMs, we propose a simple yet effective unsupervised classifier-free guidance that effectively exploits large-scale unpaired data, boosting performance for conditional inference. In language understanding, the 1.1B MDM outperforms the 1.1B TinyLlama model trained on the same data across four of eight zero-shot benchmarks. Notably, it achieves competitive math reasoning ability with the 7B Llama-2 model on the GSM8K dataset. In text generation, MDMs with 16 times more pre-training time offer a flexible trade-off against ARMs with the accelerated sampling technique KV-Cache: MDMs match ARMs in performance while being 1.4 times faster during sampling. Moreover, MDMs address challenging tasks for ARMs by effectively handling bidirectional reasoning and adapting to temporal shifts in data. Notably, a 1.1B MDM breaks the reverse curse encountered by much larger ARMs with significantly more data and computation, such as 13B Llama-2 and 175B GPT-3.

<p>Abstract: Building a generalist model for user interface (UI) understanding is challenging due to various foundational issues, such as platform diversity, resolution variation, and data limitation. In this paper, we introduce Ferret-UI 2, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) designed for universal UI understanding across a wide range of platforms, including iPhone, Android, iPad, Webpage, and AppleTV. Building on the foundation of Ferret-UI, Ferret-UI 2 introduces three key innovations: support for multiple platform types, high-resolution perception through adaptive scaling, and advanced task training data generation powered by GPT-4o with set-of-mark visual prompting. These advancements enable Ferret-UI 2 to perform complex, user-centered interactions, making it highly versatile and adaptable for the expanding diversity of platform ecosystems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cem Ates Musluoglu, Alexander Bertrand</p>
<p>Abstract: With the emergence of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), many traditional signal processing tasks are required to be computed in a distributed fashion, without transmissions of the raw data to a centralized processing unit, due to the limited energy and bandwidth resources available to the sensors. In this paper, we propose a distributed independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm, which aims at identifying the original signal sources based on observations of their mixtures measured at various sensor nodes. One of the most commonly used ICA algorithms is known as FastICA, which requires a spatial pre-whitening operation in the first step of the algorithm. Such a pre-whitening across all nodes of a WSN is impossible in a bandwidth-constrained distributed setting as it requires to correlate each channel with each other channel in the WSN. We show that an explicit network-wide pre-whitening step can be circumvented by leveraging the properties of the so-called Distributed Adaptive Signal Fusion (DASF) framework. Despite the lack of such a network-wide pre-whitening, we can still obtain the $Q$ least Gaussian independent components of the centralized ICA solution, where $Q$ scales linearly with the required communication load.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangmin Bae, Adam Fisch, Hrayr Harutyunyan, Ziwei Ji, Seungyeon Kim, Tal Schuster</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are expensive to deploy. Parameter sharing offers a possible path towards reducing their size and cost, but its effectiveness in modern LLMs remains fairly limited. In this work, we revisit "layer tying" as form of parameter sharing in Transformers, and introduce novel methods for converting existing LLMs into smaller "Recursive Transformers" that share parameters across layers, with minimal loss of performance. Here, our Recursive Transformers are efficiently initialized from standard pretrained Transformers, but only use a single block of unique layers that is then repeated multiple times in a loop. We further improve performance by introducing Relaxed Recursive Transformers that add flexibility to the layer tying constraint via depth-wise low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules, yet still preserve the compactness of the overall model. We show that our recursive models (e.g., recursive Gemma 1B) outperform both similar-sized vanilla pretrained models (such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Pythia 1B) and knowledge distillation baselines -- and can even recover most of the performance of the original "full-size" model (e.g., Gemma 2B with no shared parameters). Finally, we propose Continuous Depth-wise Batching, a promising new inference paradigm enabled by the Recursive Transformer when paired with early exiting. In a theoretical analysis, we show that this has the potential to lead to significant (2-3x) gains in inference throughput.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Nanbo, Firas Laakom, Yucheng Xu, Wenyi Wang, J\"urgen Schmidhuber</p>
<p>Abstract: World modelling is essential for understanding and predicting the dynamics of complex systems by learning both spatial and temporal dependencies. However, current frameworks, such as Transformers and selective state-space models like Mambas, exhibit limitations in efficiently encoding spatial and temporal structures, particularly in scenarios requiring long-term high-dimensional sequence modelling. To address these issues, we propose a novel recurrent framework, the \textbf{FACT}ored \textbf{S}tate-space (\textbf{FACTS}) model, for spatial-temporal world modelling. The FACTS framework constructs a graph-structured memory with a routing mechanism that learns permutable memory representations, ensuring invariance to input permutations while adapting through selective state-space propagation. Furthermore, FACTS supports parallel computation of high-dimensional sequences. We empirically evaluate FACTS across diverse tasks, including multivariate time series forecasting, object-centric world modelling, and spatial-temporal graph prediction, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms or matches specialised state-of-the-art models, despite its general-purpose world modelling design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minkai Xu, Tomas Geffner, Karsten Kreis, Weili Nie, Yilun Xu, Jure Leskovec, Stefano Ermon, Arash Vahdat</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in autoregressive language models, alternative generative paradigms beyond left-to-right generation are still being actively explored. Discrete diffusion models, with the capacity for parallel generation, have recently emerged as a promising alternative. Unfortunately, these models still underperform the autoregressive counterparts, with the performance gap increasing when reducing the number of sampling steps. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is a consequence of an imperfect approximation used by diffusion models. In this work, we propose Energy-based Diffusion Language Model (EDLM), an energy-based model operating at the full sequence level for each diffusion step, introduced to improve the underlying approximation used by diffusion models. More specifically, we introduce an EBM in a residual form, and show that its parameters can be obtained by leveraging a pretrained autoregressive model or by finetuning a bidirectional transformer via noise contrastive estimation. We also propose an efficient generation algorithm via parallel important sampling. Comprehensive experiments on language modeling benchmarks show that our model can consistently outperform state-of-the-art diffusion models by a significant margin, and approaches autoregressive models' perplexity. We further show that, without any generation performance drop, our framework offers a 1.3$\times$ sampling speedup over existing diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kacper Wyrwal, Andreas Krause, Viacheslav Borovitskiy</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose practical deep Gaussian process models on Riemannian manifolds, similar in spirit to residual neural networks. With manifold-to-manifold hidden layers and an arbitrary last layer, they can model manifold- and scalar-valued functions, as well as vector fields. We target data inherently supported on manifolds, which is too complex for shallow Gaussian processes thereon. For example, while the latter perform well on high-altitude wind data, they struggle with the more intricate, nonstationary patterns at low altitudes. Our models significantly improve performance in these settings, enhancing prediction quality and uncertainty calibration, and remain robust to overfitting, reverting to shallow models when additional complexity is unneeded. We further showcase our models on Bayesian optimisation problems on manifolds, using stylised examples motivated by robotics, and obtain substantial improvements in later stages of the optimisation process. Finally, we show our models to have potential for speeding up inference for non-manifold data, when, and if, it can be mapped to a proxy manifold well enough.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Oblak, Despoina Paschalidou, Sanja Fidler, Matan Atzmon</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing a dynamic scene from image inputs is a fundamental computer vision task with many downstream applications. Despite recent advancements, existing approaches still struggle to achieve high-quality reconstructions from unseen viewpoints and timestamps. This work introduces the ReMatching framework, designed to improve reconstruction quality by incorporating deformation priors into dynamic reconstruction models. Our approach advocates for velocity-field based priors, for which we suggest a matching procedure that can seamlessly supplement existing dynamic reconstruction pipelines. The framework is highly adaptable and can be applied to various dynamic representations. Moreover, it supports integrating multiple types of model priors and enables combining simpler ones to create more complex classes. Our evaluations on popular benchmarks involving both synthetic and real-world dynamic scenes demonstrate that augmenting current state-of-the-art methods with our approach leads to a clear improvement in reconstruction accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel P. Jeong, Pranav Mani, Saurabh Garg, Zachary C. Lipton, Michael Oberst</p>
<p>Abstract: Several recent works seek to adapt general-purpose large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for medical applications through continued pretraining on publicly available biomedical corpora. These works typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining improves performance on various downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical exam questions. In this paper, we compare ten "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning regimes for medical question answering (QA). For instance, on clinical-note-based QA tasks in the 3-shot setting, medical LLMs outperform their base models in only 26.7% of cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 16.7% of cases, and perform significantly worse in the remaining 56.7% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i) comparing each medical model directly against its base model; (ii) optimizing the prompts for each model separately in zero-/few-shot prompting; and (iii) accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen the conclusions of future studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ajinkya Deshpande, Deep Gupta, Ankit Bhurane, Nisha Meshram, Sneha Singh, Petia Radeva</p>
<p>Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common type of liver cancer whose early-stage diagnosis is a common challenge, mainly due to the manual assessment of hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images, which is a time-consuming process and may lead to variability in decision-making. For accurate detection of HCC, we propose a hybrid deep learning-based architecture that uses transfer learning to extract the features from pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models and a classifier made up of a sequence of fully connected layers. This study uses a publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC)database (n=491) for model development and database of Kasturba Gandhi Medical College (KMC), India for validation. The pre-processing step involves patch extraction, colour normalization, and augmentation that results in 3920 patches for the TCGA dataset. The developed hybrid deep neural network consisting of a CNN-based pre-trained feature extractor and a customized artificial neural network-based classifier is trained using five-fold cross-validation. For this study, eight different state-of-the-art models are trained and tested as feature extractors for the proposed hybrid model. The proposed hybrid model with ResNet50-based feature extractor provided the sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, accuracy, and AUC of 100.00%, 100.00%, 100.00%, 100.00%, and 1.00, respectively on the TCGA database. On the KMC database, EfficientNetb3 resulted in the optimal choice of the feature extractor giving sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, accuracy, and AUC of 96.97, 98.85, 96.71, 96.71, and 0.99, respectively. The proposed hybrid models showed improvement in accuracy of 2% and 4% over the pre-trained models in TCGA-LIHC and KMC databases.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03496">TRENDy: Temporal Regression of Effective Nonlinear Dynamics</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Ricci, Guy Pelc, Zoe Piran, Noa Moriel, Mor Nitzan</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatiotemporal dynamics pervade the natural sciences, from the morphogen dynamics underlying patterning in animal pigmentation to the protein waves controlling cell division. A central challenge lies in understanding how controllable parameters induce qualitative changes in system behavior called bifurcations. This endeavor is particularly difficult in realistic settings where governing partial differential equations (PDEs) are unknown and data is limited and noisy. To address this challenge, we propose TRENDy (Temporal Regression of Effective Nonlinear Dynamics), an equation-free approach to learning low-dimensional, predictive models of spatiotemporal dynamics. TRENDy first maps input data to a low-dimensional space of effective dynamics through a cascade of multiscale filtering operations. Our key insight is the recognition that these effective dynamics can be fit by a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) having the same parameter space as the input PDE. The preceding filtering operations strongly regularize the phase space of the NODE, making TRENDy significantly more robust to noise compared to existing methods. We train TRENDy to predict the effective dynamics of synthetic and real data representing dynamics from across the physical and life sciences. We then demonstrate how we can automatically locate both Turing and Hopf bifurcations in unseen regions of parameter space. We finally apply our method to the analysis of spatial patterning of the ocellated lizard through development. We found that TRENDy's predicted effective state not only accurately predicts spatial changes over time but also identifies distinct pattern features unique to different anatomical regions, such as the tail, neck, and body--an insight that highlights the potential influence of surface geometry on reaction-diffusion mechanisms and their role in driving spatially varying pattern dynamics.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06071">KaSA: Knowledge-Aware Singular-Value Adaptation of Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Wang, Juyong Jiang, Chansung Park, Sunghun Kim, Jing Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing sizes of large language models (LLMs) result in significant computational overhead and memory usage when adapting these models to specific tasks or domains. Various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been devised to mitigate these challenges by training a small set of parameters for the task-specific updates of the model weights. Among PEFT methods, LoRA stands out for its simplicity and efficiency, inspiring the development of a series of variants. However, LoRA and its successors disregard the knowledge that is noisy or irrelevant to the targeted task, detrimentally impacting model performance and leading to suboptimality. To address this limitation, we introduce Knowledge-aware Singular-value Adaptation (KaSA), a PEFT method that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) with knowledge-aware singular values to dynamically activate knowledge based on its relevance to the task at hand. We conduct extensive experiments across a range of LLMs on tasks spanning natural language understanding (NLU), generation (NLG), instruction following, and commonsense reasoning. The experimental results demonstrate that KaSA consistently outperforms FFT and 14 popular PEFT baselines across 16 benchmarks and 4 synthetic datasets, underscoring our method's efficacy and adaptability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuning Han, Bingyin Zhao, Rui Chu, Feng Luo, Biplab Sikdar, Yingjie Lao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies show that diffusion models (DMs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks impose unconcealed triggers (e.g., a gray box and eyeglasses) that contain evident patterns, rendering remarkable attack effects yet easy detection upon human inspection and defensive algorithms. While it is possible to improve stealthiness by reducing the strength of the backdoor, doing so can significantly compromise its generality and effectiveness. In this paper, we propose UIBDiffusion, the universal imperceptible backdoor attack for diffusion models, which allows us to achieve superior attack and generation performance while evading state-of-the-art defenses. We propose a novel trigger generation approach based on universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) and reveal that such perturbations, which are initially devised for fooling pre-trained discriminative models, can be adapted as potent imperceptible backdoor triggers for DMs. We evaluate UIBDiffusion on multiple types of DMs with different kinds of samplers across various datasets and targets. Experimental results demonstrate that UIBDiffusion brings three advantages: 1) Universality, the imperceptible trigger is universal (i.e., image and model agnostic) where a single trigger is effective to any images and all diffusion models with different samplers; 2) Utility, it achieves comparable generation quality (e.g., FID) and even better attack success rate (i.e., ASR) at low poison rates compared to the prior works; and 3) Undetectability, UIBDiffusion is plausible to human perception and can bypass Elijah and TERD, the SOTA defenses against backdoors for DMs. We will release our backdoor triggers and code.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-quality benchmarks are the foundation for embodied AI research, enabling significant advancements in long-horizon navigation, manipulation and rearrangement tasks. However, as frontier tasks in robotics get more advanced, they require faster simulation speed, more intricate test environments, and larger demonstration datasets. To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of prior magical grasp implementations at a fraction of the GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models have emergent capabilities that come unexpectedly at scale, but we need a theoretical framework to explain why and how they emerge. We prove that language models are actually non-ergodic systems while providing a mathematical framework based on Stuart Kauffman's theory of the adjacent possible (TAP) to explain capability emergence. Our resource-constrained TAP equation demonstrates how architectural, training, and contextual constraints interact to shape model capabilities through phase transitions in semantic space. We prove through experiments with three different language models that capacities emerge through discrete transitions guided by constraint interactions and path-dependent exploration. This framework provides a theoretical basis for understanding emergence in language models and guides the development of architectures that can guide capability emergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Phelps, Daniel J. Lizotte, Douglas G. Woolford</p>
<p>Abstract: There is a widespread and longstanding belief that machine learning models are biased towards the majority (or negative) class when learning from imbalanced data, leading them to neglect or ignore the minority (or positive) class. In this study, we show that this belief is not necessarily correct for decision trees, and that their bias can actually be in the opposite direction. Motivated by a recent simulation study that suggested that decision trees can be biased towards the minority class, our paper aims to reconcile the conflict between that study and decades of other works. First, we critically evaluate past literature on this problem, finding that failing to consider the data generating process has led to incorrect conclusions about the bias in decision trees. We then prove that, under specific conditions related to the predictors, decision trees fit to purity and trained on a dataset with only one positive case are biased towards the minority class. Finally, we demonstrate that splits in a decision tree are also biased when there is more than one positive case. Our findings have implications on the use of popular tree-based models, such as random forests.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifu Qiu, Varun Embar, Yizhe Zhang, Navdeep Jaitly, Shay B. Cohen, Benjamin Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in long-context language models (LCLMs) promise to transform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by simplifying pipelines. With their expanded context windows, LCLMs can process entire knowledge bases and perform retrieval and reasoning directly -- a capability we define as In-Context Retrieval and Reasoning (ICR^2). However, existing benchmarks like LOFT often overestimate LCLM performance by providing overly simplified contexts. To address this, we introduce ICR^2, a benchmark that evaluates LCLMs in more realistic scenarios by including confounding passages retrieved with strong retrievers. We then propose three methods to enhance LCLM performance: (1) retrieve-then-generate fine-tuning, (2) retrieval-attention-probing, which uses attention heads to filter and de-noise long contexts during decoding, and (3) joint retrieval head training alongside the generation head. Our evaluation of five well-known LCLMs on LOFT and ICR^2 demonstrates significant gains with our best approach applied to Mistral-7B: +17 and +15 points by Exact Match on LOFT, and +13 and +2 points on ICR^2, compared to vanilla RAG and supervised fine-tuning, respectively. It even outperforms GPT-4-Turbo on most tasks despite being a much smaller model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated learning is a machine learning method that supports training models on decentralized devices or servers, where each holds its local data, removing the need for data exchange. This approach is especially useful in healthcare, as it enables training on sensitive data without needing to share them. The nature of federated learning necessitates robust security precautions due to data leakage concerns during communication. To address this issue, we propose a new approach that employs selective encryption, homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, and bit-wise scrambling to minimize data leakage while achieving good execution performance. Our technique , FAS (fast and secure federated learning) is used to train deep learning models on medical imaging data. We implemented our technique using the Flower framework and compared with a state-of-the-art federated learning approach that also uses selective homomorphic encryption. Our experiments were run in a cluster of eleven physical machines to create a real-world federated learning scenario on different datasets. We observed that our approach is up to 90\% faster than applying fully homomorphic encryption on the model weights. In addition, we can avoid the pretraining step that is required by our competitor and can save up to 20\% in terms of total execution time. While our approach was faster, it obtained similar security results as the competitor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyeob Baek, Yi-Fu Wu, Gautam Singh, Sungjin Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans have an innate ability to decompose their perceptions of the world into objects and their attributes, such as colors, shapes, and movement patterns. This cognitive process enables us to imagine novel futures by recombining familiar concepts. However, replicating this ability in artificial intelligence systems has proven challenging, particularly when it comes to modeling videos into compositional concepts and generating unseen, recomposed futures without relying on auxiliary data, such as text, masks, or bounding boxes. In this paper, we propose Dreamweaver, a neural architecture designed to discover hierarchical and compositional representations from raw videos and generate compositional future simulations. Our approach leverages a novel Recurrent Block-Slot Unit (RBSU) to decompose videos into their constituent objects and attributes. In addition, Dreamweaver uses a multi-future-frame prediction objective to capture disentangled representations for dynamic concepts more effectively as well as static concepts. In experiments, we demonstrate our model outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines for world modeling when evaluated under the DCI framework across multiple datasets. Furthermore, we show how the modularized concept representations of our model enable compositional imagination, allowing the generation of novel videos by recombining attributes from previously seen objects. cun-bjy.github.io/dreamweaver-website</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose ReMiDi, a novel method for inferring neuronal microstructure as arbitrary 3D meshes using a differentiable diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) simulator. We first implemented in PyTorch a differentiable dMRI simulator that simulates the forward diffusion process using a finite-element method on an input 3D microstructure mesh. To achieve significantly faster simulations, we solve the differential equation semi-analytically using a matrix formalism approach. Given a reference dMRI signal $S_{ref}$, we use the differentiable simulator to iteratively update the input mesh such that it matches $S_{ref}$ using gradient-based learning. Since directly optimizing the 3D coordinates of the vertices is challenging, particularly due to ill-posedness of the inverse problem, we instead optimize a lower-dimensional latent space representation of the mesh. The mesh is first encoded into spectral coefficients, which are further encoded into a latent $\textbf{z}$ using an auto-encoder, and are then decoded back into the true mesh. We present an end-to-end differentiable pipeline that simulates signals that can be tuned to match a reference signal by iteratively updating the latent representation $\textbf{z}$. We demonstrate the ability to reconstruct microstructures of arbitrary shapes represented by finite-element meshes, with a focus on axonal geometries found in the brain white matter, including bending, fanning and beading fibers.

<p>Abstract: We propose a shape-constrained approach to dynamic pricing for censored data in the linear valuation model that eliminates the need for tuning parameters commonly required in existing methods. Previous works have addressed the challenge of unknown market noise distribution $F_0$ using strategies ranging from kernel methods to reinforcement learning algorithms, such as bandit techniques and upper confidence bounds (UCB), under the Lipschitz (and stronger) assumption(s) on $F_0$. In contrast, our method relies on isotonic regression under the weaker assumption that $F_0$ is $\alpha$-Holder continuous for some $\alpha \in (0,1]$. Simulations and experiments with real-world data obtained by Welltower Inc (a major healthcare Real Estate Investment Trust) consistently demonstrate that our method attains better empirical regret in comparison to several existing methods in the literature while offering the advantage of being completely tuning-parameter free.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alfredo Braunstein, Louise Budzynski, Matteo Mariani, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi</p>
<p>Abstract: In Bayesian inference, computing the posterior distribution from the data is typically a non-trivial problem, which usually requires approximations such as mean-field approaches or numerical methods, like the Monte Carlo Markov Chain. Being a high-dimensional distribution over a set of correlated variables, the posterior distribution can undergo the notorious replica symmetry breaking transition. When it happens, several mean-field methods and virtually every Monte Carlo scheme can not provide a reasonable approximation to the posterior and its marginals. Replica symmetry is believed to be guaranteed whenever the data is generated with known prior and likelihood distributions, namely under the so-called Nishimori conditions. In this paper, we break this belief, by providing a counter-example showing that, under the Nishimori conditions, replica symmetry breaking arises. Introducing a simple, geometrical model that can be thought of as a patient zero retrieval problem in a highly infectious regime of the epidemic Susceptible-Infectious model, we show that under the Nishimori conditions, there is evidence of replica symmetry breaking. We achieve this result by computing the instability of the replica symmetric cavity method toward the one step replica symmetry broken phase. The origin of this phenomenon -- replica symmetry breaking under the Nishimori conditions -- is likely due to the correlated disorder appearing in the epidemic models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seokhun Park, Insung Kong, Yongchan Choi, Chanmoo Park, Yongdai Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpretability for machine learning models is becoming more and more important as machine learning models become more complex. The functional ANOVA model, which decomposes a high-dimensional function into a sum of lower dimensional functions (commonly referred to as components), is one of the most popular tools for interpretable AI, and recently, various neural networks have been developed for estimating each component in the functional ANOVA model. However, such neural networks are highly unstable when estimating each component since the components themselves are not uniquely defined. That is, there are multiple functional ANOVA decompositions for a given function. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network which guarantees a unique functional ANOVA decomposition and thus is able to estimate each component stably and accurately. We call our proposed neural network ANOVA Tensor Product Neural Network (ANOVA-TPNN) since it is motivated by the tensor product basis expansion. Theoretically, we prove that ANOVA-TPNN can approximate any smooth function well. Empirically, we show that ANOVA-TPNN provide much more stable estimation of each component and thus much more stable interpretation when training data and initial values of the model parameters vary than existing neural networks do.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Mahdi Abedi, David Pardo, Tariq Alkhalifah</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained increasing attention for solving partial differential equations, including the Helmholtz equation, due to their flexibility and mesh-free formulation. However, their low-frequency bias limits their accuracy and convergence speed for high-frequency wavefield simulations. To alleviate these problems, we propose a simplified PINN framework that incorporates Gabor functions, designed to capture the oscillatory and localized nature of wavefields more effectively. Unlike previous attempts that rely on auxiliary networks to learn Gabor parameters, we redefine the network's task to map input coordinates to a custom Gabor coordinate system, simplifying the training process without increasing the number of trainable parameters compared to a simple PINN. We validate the proposed method across multiple velocity models, including the complex Marmousi and Overthrust models, and demonstrate its superior accuracy, faster convergence, and better robustness features compared to both traditional PINNs and earlier Gabor-based PINNs. Additionally, we propose an efficient integration of a Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) to enhance wavefield behavior near the boundaries. These results suggest that our approach offers an efficient and accurate alternative for scattered wavefield modeling and lays the groundwork for future improvements in PINN-based seismic applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiji Xie, Chenjia Bai, Jiyuan Shi, Junkai Yang, Yunfei Ge, Weinan Zhang, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans possess delicate dynamic balance mechanisms that enable them to maintain stability across diverse terrains and under extreme conditions. However, despite significant advances recently, existing locomotion algorithms for humanoid robots are still struggle to traverse extreme environments, especially in cases that lack external perception (e.g., vision or LiDAR). This is because current methods often rely on gait-based or perception-condition rewards, lacking effective mechanisms to handle unobservable obstacles and sudden balance loss. To address this challenge, we propose a novel whole-body locomotion algorithm based on dynamic balance and Reinforcement Learning (RL) that enables humanoid robots to traverse extreme terrains, particularly narrow pathways and unexpected obstacles, using only proprioception. Specifically, we introduce a dynamic balance mechanism by leveraging an extended measure of Zero-Moment Point (ZMP)-driven rewards and task-driven rewards in a whole-body actor-critic framework, aiming to achieve coordinated actions of the upper and lower limbs for robust locomotion. Experiments conducted on a full-sized Unitree H1-2 robot verify the ability of our method to maintain balance on extremely narrow terrains and under external disturbances, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the robot's adaptability to complex environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Betley, Daniel Tan, Niels Warncke, Anna Sztyber-Betley, Xuchan Bao, Mart\'in Soto, Nathan Labenz, Owain Evans</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding: it asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned.
  Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment.
  In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger.
  It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheol-Hui Lee, Hakseung Kim, Byung C. Yoon, Dong-Joo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Sleep is essential for maintaining human health and quality of life. Analyzing physiological signals during sleep is critical in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual diagnoses by clinicians are time-intensive and subjective. Despite advances in deep learning that have enhanced automation, these approaches remain heavily dependent on large-scale labeled datasets. This study introduces SynthSleepNet, a multimodal hybrid self-supervised learning framework designed for analyzing polysomnography (PSG) data. SynthSleepNet effectively integrates masked prediction and contrastive learning to leverage complementary features across multiple modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). This approach enables the model to learn highly expressive representations of PSG data. Furthermore, a temporal context module based on Mamba was developed to efficiently capture contextual information across signals. SynthSleepNet achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream tasks: sleep-stage classification, apnea detection, and hypopnea detection, with accuracies of 89.89%, 99.75%, and 89.60%, respectively. The model demonstrated robust performance in a semi-supervised learning environment with limited labels, achieving accuracies of 87.98%, 99.37%, and 77.52% in the same tasks. These results underscore the potential of the model as a foundational tool for the comprehensive analysis of PSG data. SynthSleepNet demonstrates comprehensively superior performance across multiple downstream tasks compared to other methodologies, making it expected to set a new standard for sleep disorder monitoring and diagnostic systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ads recommendation is a prominent service of online advertising systems and has been actively studied. Recent studies indicate that scaling-up and advanced design of the recommendation model can bring significant performance improvement. However, with a larger model scale, such prior studies have a significantly increasing gap from industry as they often neglect two fundamental challenges in industrial-scale applications. First, training and inference budgets are restricted for the model to be served, exceeding which may incur latency and impair user experience. Second, large-volume data arrive in a streaming mode with data distributions dynamically shifting, as new users/ads join and existing users/ads leave the system. We propose the External Large Foundation Model (ExFM) framework to address the overlooked challenges. Specifically, we develop external distillation and a data augmentation system (DAS) to control the computational cost of training/inference while maintaining high performance. We design the teacher in a way like a foundation model (FM) that can serve multiple students as vertical models (VMs) to amortize its building cost. We propose Auxiliary Head and Student Adapter to mitigate the data distribution gap between FM and VMs caused by the streaming data issue. Comprehensive experiments on internal industrial-scale applications and public datasets demonstrate significant performance gain by ExFM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixin Lu, {\L}ukasz Ku\'smierz, Stefan Mihalas</p>
<p>Abstract: We have derived a novel loss function from the Fokker-Planck equation that links dynamical system models with their probability density functions, demonstrating its utility in model identification and density estimation. In the first application, we show that this loss function can enable the extraction of dynamical parameters from non-temporal datasets, including timestamp-free measurements from steady non-equilibrium systems such as noisy Lorenz systems and gene regulatory networks. In the second application, when coupled with a density estimator, this loss facilitates density estimation when the dynamic equations are known. For density estimation, we propose a density estimator that integrates a Gaussian Mixture Model with a normalizing flow model. It simultaneously estimates normalized density, energy, and score functions from both empirical data and dynamics. It is compatible with a variety of data-based training methodologies, including maximum likelihood and score matching. It features a latent space akin to a modern Hopfield network, where the inherent Hopfield energy effectively assigns low densities to sparsely populated data regions, addressing common challenges in neural density estimators. Additionally, this Hopfield-like energy enables direct and rapid data manipulation through the Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP) rule, facilitating tasks such as denoising and clustering. Our work demonstrates a principled framework for leveraging the complex interdependencies between dynamics and density estimation, as illustrated through synthetic examples that clarify the underlying theoretical intuitions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  PIN AI Team, Bill Sun, Gavin Guo, Regan Peng, Boliang Zhang, Shouqiao Wang, Laura Florescu, Xi Wang, Davide Crapis, Ben Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Personal AI assistants (e.g., Apple Intelligence, Meta AI) offer proactive recommendations that simplify everyday tasks, but their reliance on sensitive user data raises concerns about privacy and trust. To address these challenges, we introduce the Guardian of Data (GOD), a secure, privacy-preserving framework for training and evaluating AI assistants directly on-device. Unlike traditional benchmarks, the GOD model measures how well assistants can anticipate user needs-such as suggesting gifts-while protecting user data and autonomy. Functioning like an AI school, it addresses the cold start problem by simulating user queries and employing a curriculum-based approach to refine the performance of each assistant. Running within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), it safeguards user data while applying reinforcement and imitation learning to refine AI recommendations. A token-based incentive system encourages users to share data securely, creating a data flywheel that drives continuous improvement. Specifically, users mine with their data, and the mining rate is determined by GOD's evaluation of how well their AI assistant understands them across categories such as shopping, social interactions, productivity, trading, and Web3. By integrating privacy, personalization, and trust, the GOD model provides a scalable, responsible path for advancing personal AI assistants. For community collaboration, part of the framework is open-sourced at https://github.com/PIN-AI/God-Model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning algorithms have made incredible strides in the past decade yet due to the complexity of these algorithms, the science of deep learning remains in its early stages. Being an experimentally driven field, it is natural to seek a theory of deep learning within the physics paradigm. As deep learning is largely about learning functions and distributions over functions, statistical field theory, a rich and versatile toolbox for tackling complex distributions over functions (fields) is an obvious choice of formalism. Research efforts carried out in the past few years have demonstrated the ability of field theory to provide useful insights on generalization, implicit bias, and feature learning effects. Here we provide a pedagogical review of this emerging line of research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Hu Zhang, Ioannis Anagnostides, Emanuel Tewolde, Ratip Emin Berker, Gabriele Farina, Vincent Conitzer, Tuomas Sandholm</p>
<p>Abstract: $\Phi$-equilibria -- and the associated notion of $\Phi$-regret -- are a powerful and flexible framework at the heart of online learning and game theory, whereby enriching the set of deviations $\Phi$ begets stronger notions of rationality. Recently, Daskalakis, Farina, Fishelson, Pipis, and Schneider (STOC '24) -- abbreviated as DFFPS -- settled the existence of efficient algorithms when $\Phi$ contains only linear maps under a general, $d$-dimensional convex constraint set $\mathcal{X}$. In this paper, we significantly extend their work by resolving the case where $\Phi$ is $k$-dimensional; degree-$\ell$ polynomials constitute a canonical such example with $k = d^{O(\ell)}$. In particular, positing only oracle access to $\mathcal{X}$, we obtain two main positive results: i) a $\text{poly}(n, d, k, \text{log}(1/\epsilon))$-time algorithm for computing $\epsilon$-approximate $\Phi$-equilibria in $n$-player multilinear games, and ii) an efficient online algorithm that incurs average $\Phi$-regret at most $\epsilon$ using $\text{poly}(d, k)/\epsilon^2$ rounds.
  We also show nearly matching lower bounds in the online learning setting, thereby obtaining for the first time a family of deviations that captures the learnability of $\Phi$-regret.
  From a technical standpoint, we extend the framework of DFFPS from linear maps to the more challenging case of maps with polynomial dimension. At the heart of our approach is a polynomial-time algorithm for computing an expected fixed point of any $\phi : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{X}$ based on the ellipsoid against hope (EAH) algorithm of Papadimitriou and Roughgarden (JACM '08). In particular, our algorithm for computing $\Phi$-equilibria is based on executing EAH in a nested fashion -- each step of EAH itself being implemented by invoking a separate call to EAH.</p>

<p>Abstract: Variational inequalities (VIs) encompass many fundamental problems in diverse areas ranging from engineering to economics and machine learning. However, their considerable expressivity comes at the cost of computational intractability. In this paper, we introduce and analyze a natural relaxation -- which we refer to as expected variational inequalities (EVIs) -- where the goal is to find a distribution that satisfies the VI constraint in expectation. By adapting recent techniques from game theory, we show that, unlike VIs, EVIs can be solved in polynomial time under general (nonmonotone) operators. EVIs capture the seminal notion of correlated equilibria, but enjoy a greater reach beyond games. We also employ our framework to capture and generalize several existing disparate results, including from settings such as smooth games, and games with coupled constraints or nonconcave utilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled large language models (LLMs) to utilize additional computation through intermediate tokens to solve complex tasks. However, we posit that typical reasoning traces contain many redundant tokens, incurring extraneous inference costs. Upon examination of the output distribution of current LLMs, we find evidence on their latent ability to reason more concisely, relative to their default behavior. To elicit this capability, we propose simple fine-tuning methods which leverage self-generated concise reasoning paths obtained by best-of-N sampling and few-shot conditioning, in task-specific settings. Our combined method achieves a 30% reduction in output tokens on average, across five model families on GSM8K and MATH, while maintaining average accuracy. By exploiting the fundamental stochasticity and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, our self-training approach robustly elicits concise reasoning on a wide range of models, including those with extensive post-training.

We introduce a novel approach to control the sensitivity of whole slide image (WSI) classification models, based on optimal transport and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingsen Yan, Yixu Feng, Cheng Zhang, Guansong Pang, Kangbiao Shi, Peng Wu, Wei Dong, Jinqiu Sun, Yanning Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) is a crucial computer vision task that aims to restore detailed visual information from corrupted low-light images. Many existing LLIE methods are based on standard RGB (sRGB) space, which often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due to inherent high color sensitivity in sRGB. While converting the images using Hue, Saturation and Value (HSV) color space helps resolve the brightness issue, it introduces significant red and black noise artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a new color space for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by polarized HS maps and learnable intensity. The former enforces small distances for red coordinates to remove the red artifacts, while the latter compresses the low-light regions to remove the black artifacts. To fully leverage the chromatic and intensity information, a novel Color and Intensity Decoupling Network (CIDNet) is further introduced to learn accurate photometric mapping function under different lighting conditions in the HVI space. Comprehensive results from benchmark and ablation experiments show that the proposed HVI color space with CIDNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.
