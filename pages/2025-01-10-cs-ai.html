<p><b>Authors:</b> Cuihui Xia, Lei Yue, Deliang Chen, Yuyang Li, Hongqiang Yang, Ancheng Xue, Zhiqiang Li, Qing He, Guoqing Zhang, Dambaru Ballab Kattel, Lei Lei, Ming Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional equation-driven hydrological models often struggle to accurately predict streamflow in challenging regional Earth systems like the Tibetan Plateau, while hybrid and existing algorithm-driven models face difficulties in interpreting hydrological behaviors. This work introduces HydroTrace, an algorithm-driven, data-agnostic model that substantially outperforms these approaches, achieving a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 98% and demonstrating strong generalization on unseen data. Moreover, HydroTrace leverages advanced attention mechanisms to capture spatial-temporal variations and feature-specific impacts, enabling the quantification and spatial resolution of streamflow partitioning as well as the interpretation of hydrological behaviors such as glacier-snow-streamflow interactions and monsoon dynamics. Additionally, a large language model (LLM)-based application allows users to easily understand and apply HydroTrace's insights for practical purposes. These advancements position HydroTrace as a transformative tool in hydrological and broader Earth system modeling, offering enhanced prediction accuracy and interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Goertzel</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces ActPC-Geom, an approach to accelerate Active Predictive Coding (ActPC) in neural networks by integrating information geometry, specifically using Wasserstein-metric-based methods for measure-dependent gradient flows. We propose replacing KL-divergence in ActPC's predictive error assessment with the Wasserstein metric, suggesting this may enhance network robustness.
  To make this computationally feasible, we present strategies including: (1) neural approximators for inverse measure-dependent Laplacians, (2) approximate kernel PCA embeddings for low-rank approximations feeding into these approximators, and (3) compositional hypervector embeddings derived from kPCA outputs, with algebra optimized for fuzzy FCA lattices learned through neural architectures analyzing network states.
  This results in an ActPC architecture capable of real-time online learning and integrating continuous (e.g., transformer-like or Hopfield-net-like) and discrete symbolic ActPC networks, including frameworks like OpenCog Hyperon or ActPC-Chem for algorithmic chemistry evolution. Shared probabilistic, concept-lattice, and hypervector models enable symbolic-subsymbolic integration.
  Key features include (1) compositional reasoning via hypervector embeddings in transformer-like architectures for tasks like commonsense reasoning, and (2) Hopfield-net dynamics enabling associative long-term memory and attractor-driven cognitive features.
  We outline how ActPC-Geom combines few-shot learning with online weight updates, enabling deliberative thinking and seamless symbolic-subsymbolic reasoning. Ideas from Galois connections are explored for efficient hybrid ActPC/ActPC-Chem processing. Finally, we propose a specialized HPC design optimized for real-time focused attention and deliberative reasoning tailored to ActPC-Geom's demands.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ofir Marom</p>
<p>Abstract: Case-based reasoning (CBR) is an experience-based approach to problem solving, where a repository of solved cases is adapted to solve new cases. Recent research shows that Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can support the Retrieve and Reuse stages of the CBR pipeline by retrieving similar cases and using them as additional context to an LLM query. Most studies have focused on text-only applications, however, in many real-world problems the components of a case are multimodal. In this paper we present MCBR-RAG, a general RAG framework for multimodal CBR applications. The MCBR-RAG framework converts non-text case components into text-based representations, allowing it to: 1) learn application-specific latent representations that can be indexed for retrieval, and 2) enrich the query provided to the LLM by incorporating all case components for better context. We demonstrate MCBR-RAG's effectiveness through experiments conducted on a simplified Math-24 application and a more complex Backgammon application. Our empirical results show that MCBR-RAG improves generation quality compared to a baseline LLM with no contextual information provided.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05075">A Text-Based Knowledge-Embedded Soft Sensing Modeling Approach for General Industrial Process Tasks Based on Large Language Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Tong, Han Liu, Runyuan Guo, Xueqiong Tian, Wenqing Wang, Ding Liu, Youmin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven soft sensors (DDSS) have become mainstream methods for predicting key performance indicators in process industries. However, DDSS development requires complex and costly customized designs tailored to various tasks during the modeling process. Moreover, DDSS are constrained to a single structured data modality, limiting their ability to incorporate additional contextual knowledge. Furthermore, DDSSs' limited representation learning leads to weak predictive performance with scarce data. To address these challenges, we propose a general framework named LLM-TKESS (large language model for text-based knowledge-embedded soft sensing), harnessing the powerful general problem-solving capabilities, cross-modal knowledge transfer abilities, and few-shot capabilities of LLM for enhanced soft sensing modeling. Specifically, an auxiliary variable series encoder (AVS Encoder) is proposed to unleash LLM's potential for capturing temporal relationships within series and spatial semantic relationships among auxiliary variables. Then, we propose a two-stage fine-tuning alignment strategy: in the first stage, employing parameter-efficient fine-tuning through autoregressive training adjusts LLM to rapidly accommodate process variable data, resulting in a soft sensing foundation model (SSFM). Subsequently, by training adapters, we adapt the SSFM to various downstream tasks without modifying its architecture. Then, we propose two text-based knowledge-embedded soft sensors, integrating new natural language modalities to overcome the limitations of pure structured data models. Furthermore, benefiting from LLM's pre-existing world knowledge, our model demonstrates outstanding predictive capabilities in small sample conditions. Using the thermal deformation of air preheater rotor as a case study, we validate through extensive experiments that LLM-TKESS exhibits outstanding performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harshith Manjunath, Lucas Heublein, Tobias Feigl, Felix Ott</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems applied across various domains, including NLP, information retrieval, and recommendation systems. Despite their adaptability and efficiency, LLMs have not been extensively explored for signal processing tasks, particularly in the domain of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) interference monitoring. GNSS interference monitoring is essential to ensure the reliability of vehicle localization on roads, a critical requirement for numerous applications. However, GNSS-based positioning is vulnerable to interference from jamming devices, which can compromise its accuracy. The primary objective is to identify, classify, and mitigate these interferences. Interpreting GNSS snapshots and the associated interferences presents significant challenges due to the inherent complexity, including multipath effects, diverse interference types, varying sensor characteristics, and satellite constellations. In this paper, we extract features from a large GNSS dataset and employ LLaVA to retrieve relevant information from an extensive knowledge base. We employ prompt engineering to interpret the interferences and environmental factors, and utilize t-SNE to analyze the feature embeddings. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of visual and logical reasoning within the GNSS context. Furthermore, our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models in interference classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixuan Li, Lewis Frampton, Federico Mora, Elizabeth Polgreen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in the domain of program synthesis. This level of performance is not, however, universal across all tasks, all LLMs and all prompting styles. There are many areas where one LLM dominates, one prompting style dominates, or where calling a symbolic solver is a better choice than an LLM. A key challenge for the user then, is to identify not only when an LLM is the right choice of solver, and the appropriate LLM to call for a given synthesis task, but also the right way to call it. A non-expert user who makes the wrong choice, incurs a cost both in terms of results (number of tasks solved, and the time it takes to solve them) and financial cost, if using a closed-source language model via a commercial API. We frame this choice as an online learning problem. We use a multi-armed bandit algorithm to select which symbolic solver, or LLM and prompt combination to deploy in order to maximize a given reward function (which may prioritize solving time, number of synthesis tasks solved, or financial cost of solving). We implement an instance of this approach, called CYANEA, and evaluate it on synthesis queries from the literature in ranking function synthesis, from the syntax-guided synthesis competition, and fresh, unseen queries generated from SMT problems. CYANEA solves 37.2\% more queries than the best single solver and achieves results within 4\% of the virtual best solver.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ritam Guha, Nilavra Pathak</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual estimators are critical for learning and refining policies using logged data, a process known as Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE). OPE allows researchers to assess new policies without costly experiments, speeding up the evaluation process. Online experimental methods, such as A/B tests, are effective but often slow, thus delaying the policy selection and optimization process.
  In this work, we explore the application of OPE methods in the context of resource allocation in dynamic auction environments. Given the competitive nature of environments where rapid decision-making is crucial for gaining a competitive edge, the ability to quickly and accurately assess algorithmic performance is essential. By utilizing counterfactual estimators as a preliminary step before conducting A/B tests, we aim to streamline the evaluation process, reduce the time and resources required for experimentation, and enhance confidence in the chosen policies. Our investigation focuses on the feasibility and effectiveness of using these estimators to predict the outcomes of potential resource allocation strategies, evaluate their performance, and facilitate more informed decision-making in policy selection. Motivated by the outcomes of our initial study, we envision an advanced analytics system designed to seamlessly and dynamically assess new resource allocation strategies and policies.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05366">Search-o1: Agentic Search-Enhanced Large Reasoning Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxi Li, Guanting Dong, Jiajie Jin, Yuyao Zhang, Yujia Zhou, Yutao Zhu, Peitian Zhang, Zhicheng Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have demonstrated impressive long stepwise reasoning capabilities through large-scale reinforcement learning. However, their extended reasoning processes often suffer from knowledge insufficiency, leading to frequent uncertainties and potential errors. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{Search-o1}, a framework that enhances LRMs with an agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism and a Reason-in-Documents module for refining retrieved documents. Search-o1 integrates an agentic search workflow into the reasoning process, enabling dynamic retrieval of external knowledge when LRMs encounter uncertain knowledge points. Additionally, due to the verbose nature of retrieved documents, we design a separate Reason-in-Documents module to deeply analyze the retrieved information before injecting it into the reasoning chain, minimizing noise and preserving coherent reasoning flow. Extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks in science, mathematics, and coding, as well as six open-domain QA benchmarks, demonstrate the strong performance of Search-o1. This approach enhances the trustworthiness and applicability of LRMs in complex reasoning tasks, paving the way for more reliable and versatile intelligent systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nolan P Shaw, P Michael Furlong, Britt Anderson, Jeff Orchard</p>
<p>Abstract: At the risk of overstating the case, connectionist approaches to machine learning, i.e. neural networks, are enjoying a small vogue right now. However, these methods require large volumes of data and produce models that are uninterpretable to humans. An alternative framework that is compatible with neural networks and gradient-based learning, but explicitly models compositionality, is Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). VSAs are a family of algebras on high-dimensional vector representations. They arose in cognitive science from the need to unify neural processing and the kind of symbolic reasoning that humans perform. While machine learning methods have benefited from category theoretical analyses, VSAs have not yet received similar treatment. In this paper, we present a first attempt at applying category theory to VSAs. Specifically, we conduct a brief literature survey demonstrating the lacking intersection of these two topics, provide a list of desiderata for VSAs, and propose that VSAs may be understood as a (division) rig in a category enriched over a monoid in Met (the category of Lawvere metric spaces). This final contribution suggests that VSAs may be generalised beyond current implementations. It is our hope that grounding VSAs in category theory will lead to more rigorous connections with other research, both within and beyond, learning and cognition.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background: The field of Artificial Intelligence has undergone cyclical periods of growth and decline, known as AI summers and winters. Currently, we are in the third AI summer, characterized by significant advancements and commercialization, particularly in the integration of Symbolic AI and Sub-Symbolic AI, leading to the emergence of Neuro-Symbolic AI.
  Methods: The review followed the PRISMA methodology, utilizing databases such as IEEE Explore, Google Scholar, arXiv, ACM, and SpringerLink. The inclusion criteria targeted peer-reviewed papers published between 2020 and 2024. Papers were screened for relevance to Neuro-Symbolic AI, with further inclusion based on the availability of associated codebases to ensure reproducibility.
  Results: From an initial pool of 1,428 papers, 167 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in detail. The majority of research efforts are concentrated in the areas of learning and inference (63%), logic and reasoning (35%), and knowledge representation (44%). Explainability and trustworthiness are less represented (28%), with Meta-Cognition being the least explored area (5%). The review identifies significant interdisciplinary opportunities, particularly in integrating explainability and trustworthiness with other research areas.
  Conclusion: Neuro-Symbolic AI research has seen rapid growth since 2020, with concentrated efforts in learning and inference. Significant gaps remain in explainability, trustworthiness, and Meta-Cognition. Addressing these gaps through interdisciplinary research will be crucial for advancing the field towards more intelligent, reliable, and context-aware AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanting Xie, Bingheng Li, Erlin Pan, Zhaochen Guo, Zhao Kang, Wenyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing graph clustering methods primarily focus on exploiting topological structure, often neglecting the ``missing-half" node feature information, especially how these features can enhance clustering performance. This issue is further compounded by the challenges associated with high-dimensional features. Feature selection in graph clustering is particularly difficult because it requires simultaneously discovering clusters and identifying the relevant features for these clusters. To address this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm called ``one node one model", which builds an exclusive model for each node and defines the node label as a combination of predictions for node groups. Specifically, the proposed ``Feature Personalized Graph Clustering (FPGC)" method identifies cluster-relevant features for each node using a squeeze-and-excitation block, integrating these features into each model to form the final representations. Additionally, the concept of feature cross is developed as a data augmentation technique to learn low-order feature interactions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FPGC outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods. Moreover, the plug-and-play nature of our method provides a versatile solution to enhance GNN-based models from a feature perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Xiao, Weiliang Zhang, Xiaohan Huang, Hengshu Zhu, Min Wu, Xiaoli Li, Yuanchun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Gene panel selection aims to identify the most informative genomic biomarkers in label-free genomic datasets. Traditional approaches, which rely on domain expertise, embedded machine learning models, or heuristic-based iterative optimization, often introduce biases and inefficiencies, potentially obscuring critical biological signals. To address these challenges, we present an iterative gene panel selection strategy that harnesses ensemble knowledge from existing gene selection algorithms to establish preliminary boundaries or prior knowledge, which guide the initial search space. Subsequently, we incorporate reinforcement learning through a reward function shaped by expert behavior, enabling dynamic refinement and targeted selection of gene panels. This integration mitigates biases stemming from initial boundaries while capitalizing on RL's stochastic adaptability. Comprehensive comparative experiments, case studies, and downstream analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its improved precision and efficiency for label-free biomarker discovery. Our results underscore the potential of this approach to advance single-cell genomics data analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is an important metric that measures the total value a customer will bring to a business over their lifetime. The Beta Geometric Negative Binomial Distribution (BGNBD) and Gamma Gamma Distribution are two models that can be used to calculate CLV, taking into account both the frequency and value of customer transactions. This article explains the BGNBD and Gamma Gamma Distribution models, and how they can be used to calculate CLV for NFT (Non-Fungible Token) transaction data in a blockchain setting. By estimating the parameters of these models using historical transaction data, businesses can gain insights into the lifetime value of their customers and make data-driven decisions about marketing and customer retention strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongwei Zhang, Meixia Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Coping with the impact of dynamic channels is a critical issue in joint source-channel coding (JSCC)-based semantic communication systems. In this paper, we propose a lightweight channel-adaptive semantic coding architecture called SNR-EQ-JSCC. It is built upon the generic Transformer model and achieves channel adaptation (CA) by Embedding the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) into the attention blocks and dynamically adjusting attention scores through channel-adaptive Queries. Meanwhile, penalty terms are introduced in the loss function to stabilize the training process. Considering that instantaneous SNR feedback may be imperfect, we propose an alternative method that uses only the average SNR, which requires no retraining of SNR-EQ-JSCC. Simulation results conducted on image transmission demonstrate that the proposed SNR-EQJSCC outperforms the state-of-the-art SwinJSCC in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and perception metrics while only requiring 0.05% of the storage overhead and 6.38% of the computational complexity for CA. Moreover, the channel-adaptive query method demonstrates significant improvements in perception metrics. When instantaneous SNR feedback is imperfect, SNR-EQ-JSCC using only the average SNR still surpasses baseline schemes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rancy Chepchirchir, Jill Sunday, Raymond Confidence, Dong Zhang, Talha Chaudhry, Udunna C. Anazodo, Kendi Muchungi, Yujing Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the utilization of lower-quality Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology raises questions about the applicability of machine learning methods for clinical tasks. This study aims to provide a robust deep learning-based brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) method tailored for the SSA population using a threefold approach. Firstly, the impact of domain shift from the SSA training data on model efficacy was examined, revealing no significant effect. Secondly, a comparative analysis of 3D and 2D full-resolution models using the nnU-Net framework indicates similar performance of both the models trained for 300 epochs achieving a five-fold cross-validation score of 0.93. Lastly, addressing the performance gap observed in SSA validation as opposed to the relatively larger BraTS glioma (GLI) validation set, two strategies are proposed: fine-tuning SSA cases using the GLI+SSA best-pretrained 2D fullres model at 300 epochs, and introducing a novel neural style transfer-based data augmentation technique for the SSA cases. This investigation underscores the potential of enhancing brain tumor prediction within SSA's unique healthcare landscape.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores a novel approach aimed at overcoming existing challenges in the realm of local search algorithms. Our aim is to improve the decision process that takes place within a local search algorithm so as to make the best possible transitions in the neighborhood at each iteration. To improve this process, we propose to use a neural network that has the same input information as conventional local search algorithms. In this paper, which is an extension of the work [Goudet et al. 2024] presented at EvoCOP2024, we investigate different ways of representing this information so as to make the algorithm as efficient as possible but also robust to monotonic transformations of the problem objective function. To assess the efficiency of this approach, we develop an experimental setup centered around NK landscape problems, offering the flexibility to adjust problem size and ruggedness. This approach offers a promising avenue for the emergence of new local search algorithms and the improvement of their problem-solving capabilities for black-box problems.</p>

This issue is particularly pronounced in the standard diffusion transformer architecture due to its quadratic complexity relative to input length. Recent works have addressed this by reducing the number of tokens processed in the model, often through masking. In contrast, this work aims to improve the training efficiency of the diffusion backbone by using predefined routes that store this information until it is reintroduced to deeper layers of the model, rather than discarding these tokens entirely. Further, we combine multiple routes and introduce an adapted auxiliary loss that accounts for all applied routes. Our method is not limited to the common transformer-based model - it can also be applied to state-space models. Unlike most current approaches, TREAD achieves this without architectural modifications. Finally, we show that our method reduces the computational cost and simultaneously boosts model performance on the standard benchmark ImageNet-1K 256 x 256 in class-conditional synthesis. Both of these benefits multiply to a convergence speedup of 9.55x at 400K training iterations compared to DiT and 25.39x compared to the best benchmark performance of DiT at 7M training iterations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyuan Bao, Eiman Kanjo, Soumya Banerjee, Hasib-Al Rashid, Tinoosh Mohsenin</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing computational capabilities of microcontroller units (MCUs), edge devices can now support machine learning models. However, deploying decentralised federated learning (DFL) on such devices presents key challenges, including intermittent connectivity, limited communication range, and dynamic network topologies. This paper proposes a novel framework, bilayer Gossip Decentralised Parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent (GD PSGD), designed to address these issues in resource-constrained environments. The framework incorporates a hierarchical communication structure using Distributed Kmeans (DKmeans) clustering for geographic grouping and a gossip protocol for efficient model aggregation across two layers: intra-cluster and inter-cluster. We evaluate the framework's performance against the Centralised Federated Learning (CFL) baseline using the MCUNet model on the CIFAR-10 dataset under IID and Non-IID conditions. Results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable accuracy to CFL on IID datasets, requiring only 1.8 additional rounds for convergence. On Non-IID datasets, the accuracy loss remains under 8\% for moderate data imbalance. These findings highlight the framework's potential to support scalable and privacy-preserving learning on edge devices with minimal performance trade-offs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony Desch\^enes, R\'emi Georges, Cem Subakan, Bruna Ugulino, Antoine Henry, Michael Morin</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the wood product industry has been facing a skilled labor shortage. The result is more frequent sudden failures, resulting in additional costs for these companies already operating in a very competitive market. Moreover, sawmills are challenging environments for machinery and sensors. Given that experienced machine operators may be able to diagnose defects or malfunctions, one possible way of assisting novice operators is through acoustic monitoring. As a step towards the automation of wood-processing equipment and decision support systems for machine operators, in this paper, we explore using a deep convolutional autoencoder for acoustic anomaly detection of wood planers on a new real-life dataset. Specifically, our convolutional autoencoder with skip connections (Skip-CAE) and our Skip-CAE transformer outperform the DCASE autoencoder baseline, one-class SVM, isolation forest and a published convolutional autoencoder architecture, respectively obtaining an area under the ROC curve of 0.846 and 0.875 on a dataset of real-factory planer sounds. Moreover, we show that adding skip connections and attention mechanism under the form of a transformer encoder-decoder helps to further improve the anomaly detection capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ismail B. Mustapha, Muyideen Abdulkareem, Shafaatunnur Hasan, Abideen Ganiyu, Hatem Nabus, Jin Chai Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of pavement under loading depends on the strength of the subgrade. However, experimental estimation of properties of pavement strengths such as California bearing ratio (CBR), unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and resistance value (R) are often tedious, time-consuming and costly, thereby inspiring a growing interest in machine learning based tools which are simple, cheap and fast alternatives. Thus, the potential application of two boosting techniques; categorical boosting (CatBoost) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and support vector regression (SVR), is similarly explored in this study for estimation of properties of subgrade soil modified with hydrated lime activated rice husk ash (HARSH). Using 121 experimental data samples of varying proportions of HARSH, plastic limit, liquid limit, plasticity index, clay activity, optimum moisture content, and maximum dry density as input for CBR, UCS and R estimation, four evaluation metrics namely coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are used to evaluate the models' performance. The results indicate that XGBoost outperformed CatBoost and SVR in estimating these properties, yielding R2 of 0.9994, 0.9995 and 0.9999 in estimating the CBR, UCS and R respectively. Also, SVR outperformed CatBoost in estimating the CBR and R with R2 of 0.9997 respectively. On the other hand, CatBoost outperformed SVR in estimating the UCS with R2 of 0.9994. Feature sensitivity analysis shows that the three machine learning techniques are unanimous that increasing HARSH proportion lead to values of the estimated properties respectively. A comparison with previous results also shows superiority of XGBoost in estimating subgrade properties.</p>

<p>Abstract: Code Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate great versatility in adapting to various downstream tasks, including code generation and completion, as well as bug detection and fixing. However, Code LLMs often fail to capture existing coding standards, leading to the generation of code that conflicts with the required design patterns for a given project. As a result, developers must post-process to adapt the generated code to the project's design norms. In this work, we empirically investigate the biases of Code LLMs in software development. Through carefully designed experiments, we assess the models' understanding of design patterns across recognition, comprehension, and generation. Our findings reveal that biases in Code LLMs significantly affect the reliability of downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihwan Lee, Tiantian Feng, Aditya Kommineni, Sudarsana Reddy Kadiri, Shrikanth Narayanan</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) offer numerous human-centered application possibilities, particularly affecting people with neurological disorders. Text or speech decoding from brain activities is a relevant domain that could augment the quality of life for people with impaired speech perception. We propose a novel approach to enhance listened speech decoding from electroencephalography (EEG) signals by utilizing an auxiliary phoneme predictor that simultaneously decodes textual phoneme sequences. The proposed model architecture consists of three main parts: EEG module, speech module, and phoneme predictor. The EEG module learns to properly represent EEG signals into EEG embeddings. The speech module generates speech waveforms from the EEG embeddings. The phoneme predictor outputs the decoded phoneme sequences in text modality. Our proposed approach allows users to obtain decoded listened speech from EEG signals in both modalities (speech waveforms and textual phoneme sequences) simultaneously, eliminating the need for a concatenated sequential pipeline for each modality. The proposed approach also outperforms previous methods in both modalities. The source code and speech samples are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brandon J Walton, Mst Eshita Khatun, James M Ghawaly, Aisha Ali-Gombe</p>
<p>Abstract: Malware analysis is a complex process of examining and evaluating malicious software's functionality, origin, and potential impact. This arduous process typically involves dissecting the software to understand its components, infection vector, propagation mechanism, and payload. Over the years, deep reverse engineering of malware has become increasingly tedious, mainly due to modern malicious codebases' fast evolution and sophistication. Essentially, analysts are tasked with identifying the elusive needle in the haystack within the complexities of zero-day malware, all while under tight time constraints. Thus, in this paper, we explore leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic malware analysis to expedite the analysis of known and novel samples. Built on GPT-4o-mini model, \msp is designed to augment malware analysis for Android through a hierarchical-tiered summarization chain and strategic prompt engineering. Additionally, \msp performs malware categorization, distinguishing potential malware from benign applications, thereby saving time during the malware reverse engineering process. Despite not being fine-tuned for Android malware analysis, we demonstrate that through optimized and advanced prompt engineering \msp can achieve up to 77% classification accuracy while providing highly robust summaries at functional, class, and package levels. In addition, leveraging the backward tracing of the summaries from package to function levels allowed us to pinpoint the precise code snippets responsible for malicious behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract: In Costa Rica, an average of 5 tons of seashells are extracted from ecosystems annually. Confiscated seashells, cannot be returned to their ecosystems due to the lack of origin recognition. To address this issue, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) specifically for seashell identification. We built a dataset from scratch, consisting of approximately 19000 images from the Pacific and Caribbean coasts. Using this dataset, the model achieved a classification accuracy exceeding 85%. The model has been integrated into a user-friendly application, which has classified over 36,000 seashells to date, delivering real-time results within 3 seconds per image. To further enhance the system's accuracy, an anomaly detection mechanism was incorporated to filter out irrelevant or anomalous inputs, ensuring only valid seashell images are processed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Mai, Julie Carson-Berndsen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to significant progress in text-based dialogue systems. These systems can now generate high-quality responses that are accurate and coherent across a wide range of topics and tasks. However, spoken dialogue systems still lag behind in terms of naturalness. They tend to produce robotic interactions, with issues such as slow response times, overly generic or cautious replies, and a lack of natural rhythm and fluid turn-taking. This shortcoming is largely due to the over-reliance on the traditional cascaded design, which involve separate, sequential components, as well as the use of text as an intermediate representation. This paper propose a real-time, textless spoken dialogue generation model (RTTL-DG) that aims to overcome these challenges. Our system enables fluid turn-taking and generates responses with minimal delay by processing streaming spoken conversation directly. Additionally, our model incorporates backchannels, filters, laughter, and other paralinguistic signals, which are often absent in cascaded dialogue systems, to create more natural and human-like interactions. The implementations and generated samples are available in our repository: https://github.com/mailong25/rts2s-dg</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Gao, Mu Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: The growth in the use of online advertising to foster brand awareness over recent years is largely attributable to the ubiquity of social media. One pivotal technology contributing to the success of online brand advertising is frequency capping, a mechanism that enables marketers to control the number of times an ad is shown to a specific user. However, the very foundation of this technology is being scrutinized as the industry gravitates towards advertising solutions that prioritize user privacy. This paper delves into the issue of reach measurement and optimization within the context of $k$-anonymity, a privacy-preserving model gaining traction across major online advertising platforms. We outline how to report reach within this new privacy landscape and demonstrate how probabilistic discounting, a probabilistic adaptation of traditional frequency capping, can be employed to optimize campaign performance. Experiments are performed to assess the trade-off between user privacy and the efficacy of online brand advertising. Notably, we discern a significant dip in performance as long as privacy is introduced, yet this comes with a limited additional cost for advertising platforms to offer their users more privacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michail Ouroutzoglou, Mingmin Zhao, Joshua Hellerstein, Hariharan Rahul, Asima Badic, Brian S. Kim, Dina Katabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Chronic itch affects 13% of the US population, is highly debilitating, and underlies many medical conditions. A major challenge in clinical care and new therapeutics development is the lack of an objective measure for quantifying itch, leading to reliance on subjective measures like patients' self-assessment of itch severity. In this paper, we show that a home radio device paired with artificial intelligence (AI) can concurrently capture scratching and evaluate its impact on sleep quality by analyzing radio signals bouncing in the environment. The device eliminates the need for wearable sensors or skin contact, enabling monitoring of chronic itch over extended periods at home without burdening patients or interfering with their skin condition. To validate the technology, we conducted an observational clinical study of chronic pruritus patients, monitored at home for one month using both the radio device and an infrared camera. Comparing the output of the device to ground truth data from the camera demonstrates its feasibility and accuracy (ROC AUC = 0.997, sensitivity = 0.825, specificity = 0.997). The results reveal a significant correlation between scratching and low sleep quality, manifested as a reduction in sleep efficiency (R = 0.6, p < 0.001) and an increase in sleep latency (R = 0.68, p < 0.001). Our study underscores the potential of passive, long-term, at-home monitoring of chronic scratching and its sleep implications, offering a valuable tool for both clinical care of chronic itch patients and pharmaceutical clinical trials.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bearing in mind the limited parametric knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) which supplies them with the relevant external knowledge has served as an approach to mitigate the issue of hallucinations to a certain extent. However, uniformly retrieving supporting context makes response generation source-inefficient, as triggering the retriever is not always necessary, or even inaccurate, when a model gets distracted by noisy retrieved content and produces an unhelpful answer. Motivated by these issues, we introduce Semantic Uncertainty Guided Adaptive Retrieval (SUGAR), where we leverage context-based entropy to actively decide whether to retrieve and to further determine between single-step and multi-step retrieval. Our empirical results show that selective retrieval guided by semantic uncertainty estimation improves the performance across diverse question answering tasks, as well as achieves a more efficient inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Audio super-resolution is challenging owing to its ill-posed nature. Recently, the application of diffusion models in audio super-resolution has shown promising results in alleviating this challenge. However, diffusion-based models have limitations, primarily the necessity for numerous sampling steps, which causes significantly increased latency when synthesizing high-quality audio samples. In this paper, we propose FLowHigh, a novel approach that integrates flow matching, a highly efficient generative model, into audio super-resolution. We also explore probability paths specially tailored for audio super-resolution, which effectively capture high-resolution audio distributions, thereby enhancing reconstruction quality. The proposed method generates high-fidelity, high-resolution audio through a single-step sampling process across various input sampling rates. The experimental results on the VCTK benchmark dataset demonstrate that FLowHigh achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio super-resolution, as evaluated by log-spectral distance and ViSQOL while maintaining computational efficiency with only a single-step sampling process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingang Li, Zhenghui Sha</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) tools empower designers to design and modify 3D models through a series of CAD operations, commonly referred to as a CAD sequence. In scenarios where digital CAD files are not accessible, reverse engineering (RE) has been used to reconstruct 3D CAD models. Recent advances have seen the rise of data-driven approaches for RE, with a primary focus on converting 3D data, such as point clouds, into 3D models in boundary representation (B-rep) format. However, obtaining 3D data poses significant challenges, and B-rep models do not reveal knowledge about the 3D modeling process of designs. To this end, our research introduces a novel data-driven approach with an Image2CADSeq neural network model. This model aims to reverse engineer CAD models by processing images as input and generating CAD sequences. These sequences can then be translated into B-rep models using a solid modeling kernel. Unlike B-rep models, CAD sequences offer enhanced flexibility to modify individual steps of model creation, providing a deeper understanding of the construction process of CAD models. To quantitatively and rigorously evaluate the predictive performance of the Image2CADSeq model, we have developed a multi-level evaluation framework for model assessment. The model was trained on a specially synthesized dataset, and various network architectures were explored to optimize the performance. The experimental and validation results show great potential for the model in generating CAD sequences from 2D image data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance and have been put into practical use in commercial applications, but they still have potential safety mechanism vulnerabilities. Jailbreak attacks are red teaming methods that aim to bypass safety mechanisms and discover MLLMs' potential risks. Existing MLLMs' jailbreak methods often bypass the model's safety mechanism through complex optimization methods or carefully designed image and text prompts. Despite achieving some progress, they have a low attack success rate on commercial closed-source MLLMs. Unlike previous research, we empirically find that there exists a Shuffle Inconsistency between MLLMs' comprehension ability and safety ability for the shuffled harmful instruction. That is, from the perspective of comprehension ability, MLLMs can understand the shuffled harmful text-image instructions well. However, they can be easily bypassed by the shuffled harmful instructions from the perspective of safety ability, leading to harmful responses. Then we innovatively propose a text-image jailbreak attack named SI-Attack. Specifically, to fully utilize the Shuffle Inconsistency and overcome the shuffle randomness, we apply a query-based black-box optimization method to select the most harmful shuffled inputs based on the feedback of the toxic judge model. A series of experiments show that SI-Attack can improve the attack's performance on three benchmarks. In particular, SI-Attack can obviously improve the attack success rate for commercial MLLMs such as GPT-4o or Claude-3.5-Sonnet.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging face dual challenges: domain shift, where models perform poorly when deployed in settings different from their training environment, and class imbalance, where certain disease conditions are naturally underrepresented. We present Imbalance-Aware Domain Adaptation (IADA), a novel framework that simultaneously tackles both challenges through three key components: (1) adaptive feature learning with class-specific attention mechanisms, (2) balanced domain alignment with dynamic weighting, and (3) adaptive threshold optimization. Our theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees and complexity bounds. Through extensive experiments on embryo development assessment across four imaging modalities, IADA demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods, achieving up to 25.19\% higher accuracy while maintaining balanced performance across classes. In challenging scenarios with low-quality imaging systems, IADA shows robust generalization with AUC improvements of up to 12.56\%. These results demonstrate IADA's potential for developing reliable and equitable medical imaging systems for diverse clinical settings.

<p>Abstract: Domain-adaptive post-training of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach for specialized domains such as medicine and finance. However, significant challenges remain in identifying optimal adaptation criteria and training strategies across varying data and model configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce FINDAP, a systematic and fine-grained investigation into domain-adaptive post-training of LLMs for the finance domain. Our approach begins by identifying the core capabilities required for the target domain and designing a comprehensive evaluation suite aligned with these needs. We then analyze the effectiveness of key post-training stages, including continual pretraining, instruction tuning, and preference alignment. Building on these insights, we propose an effective training recipe centered on a novel preference data distillation method, which leverages process signals from a generative reward model. The resulting model, Llama-Fin, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of financial tasks. Our analysis also highlights how each post-training stage contributes to distinct capabilities, uncovering specific challenges and effective solutions, providing valuable insights for domain adaptation of LLMs. Project page: https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/FinDap</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks have spearheaded remarkable advancements in time series forecasting (TSF), one of the major tasks in time series modeling.

In this study, we introduce a pioneering test-time adaptation framework tailored for TSF (TSF-TTA). TAFAS, the proposed approach to TSF-TTA, flexibly adapts source forecasters to continuously shifting test distributions while preserving the core semantic information learned during pre-training. The novel utilization of partially-observed ground truth and gated calibration module enables proactive, robust, and model-agnostic adaptation of source forecasters. Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets and cutting-edge architectures demonstrate the efficacy and generality of TAFAS, especially in long-term forecasting scenarios that suffer from significant distribution shifts.

To address this gap, we introduce \Dataset, the first human-created question-answering (QA) dataset for long-term time-series sensor data for daily life monitoring. \Dataset is created by human workers and includes 5.6K diverse and practical queries that reflect genuine human interests, paired with accurate answers derived from sensor data. We further establish benchmarks for state-of-the-art AI models on this dataset and evaluate their performance on typical edge devices. Our results reveal a gap between current models and optimal QA performance and efficiency, highlighting the need for new contributions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhargava Uppuluri, Anjel Patel, Neil Mehta, Sridhar Kamath, Pratyush Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: In autonomous driving, traditional Computer Vision (CV) agents often struggle in unfamiliar situations due to biases in the training data. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents address this by learning from experience and maximizing rewards, which helps them adapt to dynamic environments. However, ensuring their generalization remains challenging, especially with static training environments. Additionally, DRL models lack transparency, making it difficult to guarantee safety in all scenarios, particularly those not seen during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a method that combines DRL with Curriculum Learning for autonomous driving. Our approach uses a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn safe driving in the CARLA simulator. The agent is trained using two-fold curriculum learning, progressively increasing environment difficulty and incorporating a collision penalty in the reward function to promote safety. This method improves the agent's adaptability and reliability in complex environments, and understand the nuances of balancing multiple reward components from different feedback signals in a single scalar reward function. Keywords: Computer Vision, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Variational Autoencoder, Proximal Policy Optimization, Curriculum Learning, Autonomous Driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Chen, Changli Wu, Jiayi Ji, Yiwei Ma, Danni Yang, Xiaoshuai Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Referring Expression Segmentation (3D-RES) aims to segment point cloud scenes based on a given expression. However, existing 3D-RES approaches face two major challenges: feature ambiguity and intent ambiguity. Feature ambiguity arises from information loss or distortion during point cloud acquisition due to limitations such as lighting and viewpoint. Intent ambiguity refers to the model's equal treatment of all queries during the decoding process, lacking top-down task-specific guidance. In this paper, we introduce an Image enhanced Prompt Decoding Network (IPDN), which leverages multi-view images and task-driven information to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. To address feature ambiguity, we propose the Multi-view Semantic Embedding (MSE) module, which injects multi-view 2D image information into the 3D scene and compensates for potential spatial information loss. To tackle intent ambiguity, we designed a Prompt-Aware Decoder (PAD) that guides the decoding process by deriving task-driven signals from the interaction between the expression and visual features. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that IPDN outperforms the state-ofthe-art by 1.9 and 4.2 points in mIoU metrics on the 3D-RES and 3D-GRES tasks, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Sameer, Wei Zhang, Xin Lou, Qingyu Yan, Terence Goh, Yulin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: The surging demand for batteries requires advanced battery management systems, where battery capacity modelling is a key functionality. In this paper, we aim to achieve accurate battery capacity prediction by learning from historical measurements of battery dynamics. We propose GiNet, a gated recurrent units enhanced Informer network, for predicting battery's capacity. The novelty and competitiveness of GiNet lies in its capability of capturing sequential and contextual information from raw battery data and reflecting the battery's complex behaviors with both temporal dynamics and long-term dependencies. We conducted an experimental study based on a publicly available dataset to showcase GiNet's strength of gaining a holistic understanding of battery behavior and predicting battery capacity accurately. GiNet achieves 0.11 mean absolute error for predicting the battery capacity in a sequence of future time slots without knowing the historical battery capacity. It also outperforms the latest algorithms significantly with 27% error reduction on average compared to Informer. The promising results highlight the importance of customized and optimized integration of algorithm and battery knowledge and shed light on other industry applications as well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yota Maeda, Ken Arai, Yu Tanaka, Yu Terada, Hiroshi Ueno, Hiroyuki Tezuka</p>
<p>Abstract: The discovery of causal relationships from observed data has attracted significant interest from disciplines such as economics, social sciences, epidemiology, and biology. In practical applications, considerable knowledge of the underlying systems is often unavailable, and real data are often associated with nonlinear causal structures, which make the direct use of most conventional causality analysis methods difficult. This study proposes a novel quantum Peter-Clark (qPC) algorithm for causal discovery that does not assume any underlying model structures. Based on the independence conditional tests in a class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces characterized by quantum circuits, the proposed qPC algorithm can explore causal relationships from the observed data drawn from arbitrary distributions. We conducted systematic experiments on fundamental graph parts of causal structures, demonstrating that the qPC algorithm exhibits a significantly better performance, particularly with smaller sample sizes compared to its classical counterpart. Furthermore, we proposed a novel optimization approach based on Kernel Target Alignment (KTA) for determining hyperparameters of quantum kernels. This method effectively reduced the risk of false positives in causal discovery, enabling more reliable inference. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed quantum algorithm can empower classical algorithms for robust and accurate inference in causal discovery, supporting them in regimes where classical algorithms typically fail. Additionally, the effectiveness of this method was validated using the Boston Housing dataset as a real-world application. These findings demonstrate the new potential of quantum circuit-based causal discovery methods in addressing practical challenges, particularly in small-sample scenarios where traditional approaches have shown limitations.</p>

<p>Abstract: The UAV-VLA (Visual-Language-Action) system is a tool designed to facilitate communication with aerial robots. By integrating satellite imagery processing with the Visual Language Model (VLM) and the powerful capabilities of GPT, UAV-VLA enables users to generate general flight paths-and-action plans through simple text requests. This system leverages the rich contextual information provided by satellite images, allowing for enhanced decision-making and mission planning. The combination of visual analysis by VLM and natural language processing by GPT can provide the user with the path-and-action set, making aerial operations more efficient and accessible. The newly developed method showed the difference in the length of the created trajectory in 22% and the mean error in finding the objects of interest on a map in 34.22 m by Euclidean distance in the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonsoo Jo, Hyunjin Hwang, Fanchen Bu, Soo Yong Lee, Chanyoung Park, Kijung Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks are allegedly unnoticeable. Prior studies have designed attack noticeability measures on graphs, primarily using statistical tests to compare the topology of original and (possibly) attacked graphs. However, we observe two critical limitations in the existing measures. First, because the measures rely on simple rules, attackers can readily enhance their attacks to bypass them, reducing their attack "noticeability" and, yet, maintaining their attack performance. Second, because the measures naively leverage global statistics, such as degree distributions, they may entirely overlook attacks until severe perturbations occur, letting the attacks be almost "totally unnoticeable." To address the limitations, we introduce HideNSeek, a learnable measure for graph attack noticeability. First, to mitigate the bypass problem, HideNSeek learns to distinguish the original and (potential) attack edges using a learnable edge scorer (LEO), which scores each edge on its likelihood of being an attack. Second, to mitigate the overlooking problem, HideNSeek conducts imbalance-aware aggregation of all the edge scores to obtain the final noticeability score. Using six real-world graphs, we empirically demonstrate that HideNSeek effectively alleviates the observed limitations, and LEO (i.e., our learnable edge scorer) outperforms eleven competitors in distinguishing attack edges under five different attack methods. For an additional application, we show that LEO boost the performance of robust GNNs by removing attack-like edges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runhua Xu, Bo Li, Chao Li, James B. D. Joshi, Shuai Ma, Jianxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning is a computing paradigm that enhances privacy by enabling multiple parties to collaboratively train a machine learning model without revealing personal data. However, current research indicates that traditional federated learning platforms are unable to ensure privacy due to privacy leaks caused by the interchange of gradients. To achieve privacy-preserving federated learning, integrating secure aggregation mechanisms is essential. Unfortunately, existing solutions are vulnerable to recently demonstrated inference attacks such as the disaggregation attack. This paper proposes TAPFed, an approach for achieving privacy-preserving federated learning in the context of multiple decentralized aggregators with malicious actors. TAPFed uses a proposed threshold functional encryption scheme and allows for a certain number of malicious aggregators while maintaining security and privacy. We provide formal security and privacy analyses of TAPFed and compare it to various baselines through experimental evaluation. Our results show that TAPFed offers equivalent performance in terms of model quality compared to state-of-the-art approaches while reducing transmission overhead by 29%-45% across different model training scenarios. Most importantly, TAPFed can defend against recently demonstrated inference attacks caused by curious aggregators, which the majority of existing approaches are susceptible to.</p>

Regional ocean emulation presents unique challenges owing to the complex bathymetry and lateral boundary conditions as well as from fundamental biases in deep learning-based frameworks, such as instability and hallucinations. In this paper, we develop a deep learning-based framework to autoregressively integrate ocean-surface variables over the Gulf of Mexico at $8$ Km spatial resolution without unphysical drifts over decadal time scales and simulataneously downscale and bias-correct it to $4$ Km resolution using a physics-constrained generative model. The framework shows both short-term skills as well as accurate long-term statistics in terms of mean and variability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Wen, Ziqian Lu, Fengli Shen, Zhe-Ming Lu, Jialin Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Human skeleton information is important in skeleton-based action recognition, which provides a simple and efficient way to describe human pose. However, existing skeleton-based methods focus more on the skeleton, ignoring the objects interacting with humans, resulting in poor performance in recognizing actions that involve object interactions. We propose a new action recognition framework introducing object nodes to supplement absent interactive object information. We also propose Spatial Temporal Variable Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-VGCN) to effectively model the Variable Graph (VG) containing object nodes. Specifically, in order to validate the role of interactive object information, by leveraging a simple self-training approach, we establish a new dataset, JXGC 24, and an extended dataset, NTU RGB+D+Object 60, including more than 2 million additional object nodes. At the same time, we designe the Variable Graph construction method to accommodate a variable number of nodes for graph structure. Additionally, we are the first to explore the overfitting issue introduced by incorporating additional object information, and we propose a VG-based data augmentation method to address this issue, called Random Node Attack. Finally, regarding the network structure, we introduce two fusion modules, CAF and WNPool, along with a novel Node Balance Loss, to enhance the comprehensive performance by effectively fusing and balancing skeleton and object node information. Our method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art on multiple skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks. The accuracy of our method on NTU RGB+D 60 cross-subject split is 96.7\%, and on cross-view split, it is 99.2\%.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Octopus, a novel video multimodal large language model. LLaVA-Octopus adaptively weights features from different visual projectors based on user instructions, enabling us to leverage the complementary strengths of each projector. We observe that different visual projectors exhibit distinct characteristics when handling specific tasks. For instance, some projectors excel at capturing static details, while others are more effective at processing temporal information, and some are better suited for tasks requiring temporal coherence. By dynamically adjusting feature weights according to user instructions, LLaVA-Octopus dynamically selects and combines the most suitable features, significantly enhancing the model's performance in multimodal tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LLaVA-Octopus achieves excellent performance across multiple benchmarks, especially in tasks such as multimodal understanding, visual question answering, and video understanding, highlighting its broad application potential.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have been widely used in the generative domain due to their convincing performance in modeling complex data distributions. Moreover, they have shown competitive results on discriminative tasks, such as image segmentation. While diffusion models have also been explored for automatic music transcription, their performance has yet to reach a competitive level. In this paper, we focus on discrete diffusion model's refinement capabilities and present a novel architecture for piano transcription. Our model utilizes Neighborhood Attention layers as the denoising module, gradually predicting the target high-resolution piano roll, conditioned on the finetuned features of a pretrained acoustic model. To further enhance refinement, we devise a novel strategy which applies distinct transition states during training and inference stage of discrete diffusion models. Experiments on the MAESTRO dataset show that our approach outperforms previous diffusion-based piano transcription models and the baseline model in terms of F1 score.

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes the first video-grounded entailment tree reasoning method for commonsense video question answering (VQA). Despite the remarkable progress of large visual-language models (VLMs), there are growing concerns that they learn spurious correlations between videos and likely answers, reinforced by their black-box nature and remaining benchmarking biases. Our method explicitly grounds VQA tasks to video fragments in four steps: entailment tree construction, video-language entailment verification, tree reasoning, and dynamic tree expansion. A vital benefit of the method is its generalizability to current video and image-based VLMs across reasoning types. To support fair evaluation, we devise a de-biasing procedure based on large-language models that rewrites VQA benchmark answer sets to enforce model reasoning. Systematic experiments on existing and de-biased benchmarks highlight the impact of our method components across benchmarks, VLMs, and reasoning types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tarun Ram Menta, Susmit Agrawal, Chirag Agarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prevalent in modern applications but often memorize training data, leading to privacy breaches and copyright issues. Existing research has mainly focused on posthoc analyses, such as extracting memorized content or developing memorization metrics, without exploring the underlying architectural factors that contribute to memorization. In this work, we investigate memorization from an architectural lens by analyzing how attention modules at different layers impact its memorization and generalization performance. Using attribution techniques, we systematically intervene in the LLM architecture by bypassing attention modules at specific blocks while keeping other components like layer normalization and MLP transformations intact. We provide theorems analyzing our intervention mechanism from a mathematical view, bounding the difference in layer outputs with and without our attributions. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that attention modules in deeper transformer blocks are primarily responsible for memorization, whereas earlier blocks are crucial for the models generalization and reasoning capabilities. We validate our findings through comprehensive experiments on different LLM families (Pythia and GPTNeo) and five benchmark datasets. Our insights offer a practical approach to mitigate memorization in LLMs while preserving their performance, contributing to safer and more ethical deployment in real world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm has revolutionized satellite remote sensing applications. However, this approach remains largely underexplored for airborne laser scanning (ALS), an important technology for applications such as forest management and urban planning. In this study, we address this gap by constructing a large-scale ALS point cloud dataset and evaluating its impact on downstream applications. Our dataset comprises ALS point clouds collected across the contiguous United States, provided by the United States Geological Survey's 3D Elevation Program. To ensure efficient data collection while capturing diverse land cover and terrain types, we introduce a geospatial sampling method that selects point cloud tiles based on land cover maps and digital elevation models. As a baseline self-supervised learning model, we adopt BEV-MAE, a state-of-the-art masked autoencoder for 3D outdoor point clouds, and pre-train it on the constructed dataset. The pre-trained models are subsequently fine-tuned for downstream tasks, including tree species classification, terrain scene recognition, and point cloud semantic segmentation. Our results show that the pre-trained models significantly outperform their scratch counterparts across all downstream tasks, demonstrating the transferability of the representations learned from the proposed dataset. Furthermore, we observe that scaling the dataset using our geospatial sampling method consistently enhances performance, whereas pre-training on datasets constructed with random sampling fails to achieve similar improvements. These findings highlight the utility of the constructed dataset and the effectiveness of our sampling strategy in the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm.

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning demonstrated immense success in modelling complex physics-driven systems, providing end-to-end trainable solutions by interacting with a simulated or real environment, maximizing a scalar reward signal. In this work, we propose, building upon previous work, a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach with assignment constraints for reconstructing particle tracks in pixelated particle detectors. Our approach optimizes collaboratively a parametrized policy, functioning as a heuristic to a multidimensional assignment problem, by jointly minimizing the total amount of particle scattering over the reconstructed tracks in a readout frame. To satisfy constraints, guaranteeing a unique assignment of particle hits, we propose a safety layer solving a linear assignment problem for every joint action. Further, to enforce cost margins, increasing the distance of the local policies predictions to the decision boundaries of the optimizer mappings, we recommend the use of an additional component in the blackbox gradient estimation, forcing the policy to solutions with lower total assignment costs. We empirically show on simulated data, generated for a particle detector developed for proton imaging, the effectiveness of our approach, compared to multiple single- and multi-agent baselines. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of constraints with cost margins for both optimization and generalization, introduced by wider regions with high reconstruction performance as well as reduced predictive instabilities. Our results form the basis for further developments in RL-based tracking, offering both enhanced performance with constrained policies and greater flexibility in optimizing tracking algorithms through the option for individual and team rewards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Rohan, Md Junayed Hasan, Andrei Petrovski</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth estimation (DE) provides spatial information about a scene and enables tasks such as 3D reconstruction, object detection, and scene understanding. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using deep learning (DL)-based methods for DE. Traditional techniques rely on handcrafted features that often struggle to generalise to diverse scenes and require extensive manual tuning. However, DL models for DE can automatically extract relevant features from input data, adapt to various scene conditions, and generalise well to unseen environments. Numerous DL-based methods have been developed, making it necessary to survey and synthesize the state-of-the-art (SOTA). Previous reviews on DE have mainly focused on either monocular or stereo-based techniques, rather than comprehensively reviewing DE. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic literature review (SLR) that comprehensively focuses on DE. Therefore, this SLR study is being conducted. Initially, electronic databases were searched for relevant publications, resulting in 1284 publications. Using defined exclusion and quality criteria, 128 publications were shortlisted and further filtered to select 59 high-quality primary studies. These studies were analysed to extract data and answer defined research questions. Based on the results, DL methods were developed for mainly three different types of DE: monocular, stereo, and multi-view. 20 publicly available datasets were used to train, test, and evaluate DL models for DE, with KITTI, NYU Depth V2, and Make 3D being the most used datasets. 29 evaluation metrics were used to assess the performance of DE. 35 base models were reported in the primary studies, and the top five most-used base models were ResNet-50, ResNet-18, ResNet-101, U-Net, and VGG-16. Finally, the lack of ground truth data was among the most significant challenges reported by primary studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Document-Level Biomedical Relation Extraction (Bio-RE) aims to identify relations between biomedical entities within extensive texts, serving as a crucial subfield of biomedical text mining. Existing Bio-RE methods struggle with cross-sentence inference, which is essential for capturing relations spanning multiple sentences. Moreover, previous methods often overlook the incompleteness of documents and lack the integration of external knowledge, limiting contextual richness. Besides, the scarcity of annotated data further hampers model training. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have inspired us to explore all the above issues for document-level Bio-RE. Specifically, we propose a document-level Bio-RE framework via LLM Adaptive Document-Relation Cross-Mapping (ADRCM) Fine-Tuning and Concept Unique Identifier (CUI) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). First, we introduce the Iteration-of-REsummary (IoRs) prompt for solving the data scarcity issue. In this way, Bio-RE task-specific synthetic data can be generated by guiding ChatGPT to focus on entity relations and iteratively refining synthetic data. Next, we propose ADRCM fine-tuning, a novel fine-tuning recipe that establishes mappings across different documents and relations, enhancing the model's contextual understanding and cross-sentence inference capabilities. Finally, during the inference, a biomedical-specific RAG approach, named CUI RAG, is designed to leverage CUIs as indexes for entities, narrowing the retrieval scope and enriching the relevant document contexts. Experiments conducted on three Bio-RE datasets (GDA, CDR, and BioRED) demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method by comparing it with other related works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marika Eik, Ahmet Kose, Hossein Nourollahi Hokmabad, Juri Belikov</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the application of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to improve the transparency and understanding of predictive models in control of automated supply air temperature (ASAT) of Air Handling Unit (AHU). The study focuses on forecasting of ASAT using a linear regression with Huber loss. However, having only a control curve without semantic and/or physical explanation is often not enough. The present study employs one of the XAI methods: Shapley values, which allows to reveal the reasoning and highlight the contribution of each feature to the final ASAT forecast. In comparison to other XAI methods, Shapley values have solid mathematical background, resulting in interpretation transparency. The study demonstrates the contrastive explanations--slices, for each control value of ASAT, which makes it possible to give the client objective justifications for curve changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Esposito</p>
<p>Abstract: Context. Developing secure and reliable software remains a key challenge in software engineering (SE). The ever-evolving technological landscape offers both opportunities and threats, creating a dynamic space where chaos and order compete. Secure software engineering (SSE) must continuously address vulnerabilities that endanger software systems and carry broader socio-economic risks, such as compromising critical national infrastructure and causing significant financial losses. Researchers and practitioners have explored methodologies like Static Application Security Testing Tools (SASTTs) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, including machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs), to detect and mitigate these vulnerabilities. Each method has unique strengths and limitations.
  Aim. This thesis seeks to bring order to the chaos in SSE by addressing domain-specific differences that impact AI accuracy.
  Methodology. The research employs a mix of empirical strategies, such as evaluating effort-aware metrics, analyzing SASTTs, conducting method-level analysis, and leveraging evidence-based techniques like systematic dataset reviews. These approaches help characterize vulnerability prediction datasets.
  Results. Key findings include limitations in static analysis tools for identifying vulnerabilities, gaps in SASTT coverage of vulnerability types, weak relationships among vulnerability severity scores, improved defect prediction accuracy using just-in-time modeling, and threats posed by untouched methods.
  Conclusions. This thesis highlights the complexity of SSE and the importance of contextual knowledge in improving AI-driven vulnerability and defect prediction. The comprehensive analysis advances effective prediction models, benefiting both researchers and practitioners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Drago Plecko, Paul Secombe, Andrea Clarke, Amelia Fiske, Samarra Toby, Donisha Duff, David Pilcher, Leo Anthony Celi, Rinaldo Bellomo, Elias Bareinboim</p>
<p>Abstract: The new era of large-scale data collection and analysis presents an opportunity for diagnosing and understanding the causes of health inequities. In this study, we describe a framework for systematically analyzing health disparities using causal inference. The framework is illustrated by investigating racial and ethnic disparities in intensive care unit (ICU) outcome between majority and minority groups in Australia (Indigenous vs. Non-Indigenous) and the United States (African-American vs. White). We demonstrate that commonly used statistical measures for quantifying inequity are insufficient, and focus on attributing the observed disparity to the causal mechanisms that generate it. We find that minority patients are younger at admission, have worse chronic health, are more likely to be admitted for urgent and non-elective reasons, and have higher illness severity. At the same time, however, we find a protective direct effect of belonging to a minority group, with minority patients showing improved survival compared to their majority counterparts, with all other variables kept equal. We demonstrate that this protective effect is related to the increased probability of being admitted to ICU, with minority patients having an increased risk of ICU admission. We also find that minority patients, while showing improved survival, are more likely to be readmitted to ICU. Thus, due to worse access to primary health care, minority patients are more likely to end up in ICU for preventable conditions, causing a reduction in the mortality rates and creating an effect that appears to be protective. Since the baseline risk of ICU admission may serve as proxy for lack of access to primary care, we developed the Indigenous Intensive Care Equity (IICE) Radar, a monitoring system for tracking the over-utilization of ICU resources by the Indigenous population of Australia across geographical areas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueyi Ke, Satoshi Tsutsui, Yayun Zhang, Bihan Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Infants develop complex visual understanding rapidly, even preceding of the acquisition of linguistic inputs. As computer vision seeks to replicate the human vision system, understanding infant visual development may offer valuable insights. In this paper, we present an interdisciplinary study exploring this question: can a computational model that imitates the infant learning process develop broader visual concepts that extend beyond the vocabulary it has heard, similar to how infants naturally learn? To investigate this, we analyze a recently published model in Science by Vong et al.,which is trained on longitudinal, egocentric images of a single child paired with transcribed parental speech. We introduce a training-free framework that can discover visual concept neurons hidden in the model's internal representations. Our findings show that these neurons can classify objects outside its original vocabulary. Furthermore, we compare the visual representations in infant-like models with those in moder computer vision models, such as CLIP or ImageNet pre-trained model, highlighting key similarities and differences. Ultimately, our work bridges cognitive science and computer vision by analyzing the internal representations of a computational model trained on an infant's visual and linguistic inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqing Li, Mutlu Cukurova, Sahan Bulathwela</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of Automatic Question Generation (QG) models has the potential to significantly improve educational practices by reducing the teacher workload associated with creating educational content. This paper introduces a novel approach to educational question generation that controls the topical focus of questions. The proposed Topic-Controlled Question Generation (T-CQG) method enhances the relevance and effectiveness of the generated content for educational purposes. Our approach uses fine-tuning on a pre-trained T5-small model, employing specially created datasets tailored to educational needs. The research further explores the impacts of pre-training strategies, quantisation, and data augmentation on the model's performance. We specifically address the challenge of generating semantically aligned questions with paragraph-level contexts, thereby improving the topic specificity of the generated questions. In addition, we introduce and explore novel evaluation methods to assess the topical relatedness of the generated questions. Our results, validated through rigorous offline and human-backed evaluations, demonstrate that the proposed models effectively generate high-quality, topic-focused questions. These models have the potential to reduce teacher workload and support personalised tutoring systems by serving as bespoke question generators. With its relatively small number of parameters, the proposals not only advance the capabilities of question generation models for handling specific educational topics but also offer a scalable solution that reduces infrastructure costs. This scalability makes them feasible for widespread use in education without reliance on proprietary large language models like ChatGPT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laura Puccioni, Alireza Farshin, Mariano Scazzariello, Changjie Wang, Marco Chiesa, Dejan Kostic</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their exceptional performance in various complex code generation tasks. However, their broader adoption is limited by significant computational demands and high resource requirements, particularly memory and processing power. To mitigate such requirements, model pruning techniques are used to create more compact models with significantly fewer parameters. However, current approaches do not focus on the efficient extraction of programming-language-specific sub-models. In this work, we explore the idea of efficiently deriving coding-specific sub-models through unstructured pruning (i.e., Wanda). We investigate the impact of different domain-specific calibration datasets on pruning outcomes across three distinct domains and extend our analysis to extracting four language-specific sub-models: Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. We are the first to efficiently extract programming-language-specific sub-models using appropriate calibration datasets while maintaining acceptable accuracy w.r.t. full models. We are also the first to provide analytical evidence that domain-specific tasks activate distinct regions within LLMs, supporting the creation of specialized sub-models through unstructured pruning. We believe that this work has significant potential to enhance LLM accessibility for coding by reducing computational requirements to enable local execution on consumer-grade hardware, and supporting faster inference times critical for real-time development feedback.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peizhuo Lv, Mengjie Sun, Hao Wang, Xiaofeng Wang, Shengzhi Zhang, Yuxuan Chen, Kai Chen, Limin Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, tremendous success has been witnessed in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely used to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) in domain-specific, knowledge-intensive, and privacy-sensitive tasks. However, attackers may steal those valuable RAGs and deploy or commercialize them, making it essential to detect Intellectual Property (IP) infringement. Most existing ownership protection solutions, such as watermarks, are designed for relational databases and texts. They cannot be directly applied to RAGs because relational database watermarks require white-box access to detect IP infringement, which is unrealistic for the knowledge base in RAGs. Meanwhile, post-processing by the adversary's deployed LLMs typically destructs text watermark information. To address those problems, we propose a novel black-box "knowledge watermark" approach, named RAG-WM, to detect IP infringement of RAGs. RAG-WM uses a multi-LLM interaction framework, comprising a Watermark Generator, Shadow LLM & RAG, and Watermark Discriminator, to create watermark texts based on watermark entity-relationship tuples and inject them into the target RAG. We evaluate RAG-WM across three domain-specific and two privacy-sensitive tasks on four benchmark LLMs. Experimental results show that RAG-WM effectively detects the stolen RAGs in various deployed LLMs. Furthermore, RAG-WM is robust against paraphrasing, unrelated content removal, knowledge insertion, and knowledge expansion attacks. Lastly, RAG-WM can also evade watermark detection approaches, highlighting its promising application in detecting IP infringement of RAG systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changjie Wang, Mariano Scazzariello, Marco Chiesa</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the vast body of research literature proposing algorithms with formal guarantees, the amount of verifiable code in today's systems remains minimal. This discrepancy stems from the inherent difficulty of verifying code, particularly due to the time-consuming nature and strict formalism of proof details that formal verification tools require. However, the emergence of transformers in Large Language Models presents a promising solution to this challenge. In this position paper, we believe that transformers have the potential to read research papers that propose algorithms with formal proofs and translate these proofs into verifiable code. We leverage transformers to first build a formal structure of the proof using the original text from the paper, and then to handle the tedious, low-level aspects of proofs that are often omitted by humans. We argue that this approach can significantly reduce the barrier to formal verification. The above idea of reading papers to write verifiable code opens new avenues for automating the verification of complex systems, enabling a future where formally verified algorithms from academic research can more seamlessly transition into real-world software systems, thereby improving code reliability and security.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atharva Mutsaddi, Aditya Choudhary</p>
<p>Abstract: Plagiarism involves using another person's work or concepts without proper attribution, presenting them as original creations. With the growing amount of data communicated in regional languages such as Marathi -- one of India's regional languages -- it is crucial to design robust plagiarism detection systems tailored for low-resource languages. Language models like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have demonstrated exceptional capability in text representation and feature extraction, making them essential tools for semantic analysis and plagiarism detection. However, the application of BERT for low-resource languages remains under-explored, particularly in the context of plagiarism detection. This paper presents a method to enhance the accuracy of plagiarism detection for Marathi texts using BERT sentence embeddings in conjunction with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) feature representation. This approach effectively captures statistical, semantic, and syntactic aspects of text features through a weighted voting ensemble of machine learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxuan Peng, Mengshi Qi, Dong Zhao, Huadong Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D human pose estimation (3D HPE) has emerged as a prominent research topic, particularly in the realm of RGB-based methods. However, RGB images are susceptible to limitations such as sensitivity to lighting conditions and potential user discomfort. Consequently, multi-modal sensing, which leverages non-intrusive sensors, is gaining increasing attention. Nevertheless, multi-modal 3D HPE still faces challenges, including modality imbalance and the imperative for continual learning. In this work, we introduce a novel balanced continual multi-modal learning method for 3D HPE, which harnesses the power of RGB, LiDAR, mmWave, and WiFi. Specifically, we propose a Shapley value-based contribution algorithm to quantify the contribution of each modality and identify modality imbalance. To address this imbalance, we employ a re-learning strategy. Furthermore, recognizing that raw data is prone to noise contamination, we develop a novel denoising continual learning approach. This approach incorporates a noise identification and separation module to mitigate the adverse effects of noise and collaborates with the balanced learning strategy to enhance optimization. Additionally, an adaptive EWC mechanism is employed to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely-adopted multi-modal dataset, MM-Fi, which demonstrate the superiority of our approach in boosting 3D pose estimation and mitigating catastrophic forgetting in complex scenarios. We will release our codes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Krogmann, Pascal Lenzner, Alexander Skopalik</p>
<p>Abstract: We study strategic location choice by customers and sellers, termed the Bakers and Millers Game in the literature. In our generalized setting, each miller can freely choose any location for setting up a mill, while each baker is restricted in the choice of location for setting up a bakery. For optimal bargaining power, a baker would like to select a location with many millers to buy flour from and with little competition from other bakers. Likewise, a miller aims for a location with many bakers and few competing millers. Thus, both types of agents choose locations to optimize the ratio of agents of opposite type divided by agents of the same type at their chosen location. Originally raised in the context of Fractional Hedonic Games, the Bakers and Millers Game has applications that range from commerce to product design.
  We study the impact of location restrictions on the properties of the game. While pure Nash equilibria trivially exist in the setting without location restrictions, we show via a sophisticated, efficient algorithm that even the more challenging restricted setting admits equilibria. Moreover, the computed equilibrium approximates the optimal social welfare by a factor of at most $2\left(\frac{e}{e-1}\right)$. Furthermore, we give tight bounds on the price of anarchy/stability.
  On the conceptual side, the location choice feature adds a new layer to the standard setting of Hedonic Games, in the sense that agents that select the same location form a coalition. This allows to naturally restrict the possible coalitions that can be formed. With this, our model generalizes simple symmetric Fractional Hedonic Games on complete bipartite valuation graphs and also Hedonic Diversity Games with utilities single-peaked at 0. We believe that this generalization is also a very interesting direction for other types of Hedonic Games.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant improvements in their capabilities, but also to increased concerns about their alignment with human values and intentions. Current alignment strategies, including adaptive training and inference-time methods, have demonstrated potential in this area. However, these approaches still struggle to balance deployment complexity and capability across various tasks and difficulties. In this work, we introduce the Streaming Distribution Induce Aligner (Stream Aligner), a novel alignment paradigm that combines efficiency with enhanced performance in various tasks throughout the generation process. Stream Aligner achieves dynamic sentence-level correction by using a small model to learn the preferences of the suffix sentence, iteratively correcting the suffix sentence output by the upstream model, and then using the corrected sentence to replace the suffix sentence in subsequent generations. Compared to Aligner, our experiments demonstrate that Stream Aligner reduces reliance on the capabilities of additional models, enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs, and decreases latency during user interaction. Specifically, Stream Aligner-2B model has achieved an improvement of 76.1% in helpfulness, 36.0% in harmlessness on the tested Llama2-70B-chat model, and Stream Aligner-8B has achieved an improvement of 3.5% on the math ability of the tested Llama3-70B-Instruct model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Corrigibility of autonomous agents is an under explored part of system design, with previous work focusing on single agent systems. It has been suggested that uncertainty over the human preferences acts to keep the agents corrigible, even in the face of human irrationality. We present a general framework for modelling corrigibility in a multi-agent setting as a 2 player game in which the agents always have a move in which they can ask the human for supervision. This is formulated as a Bayesian game for the purpose of introducing uncertainty over the human beliefs. We further analyse two specific cases. First, a two player corrigibility game, in which we want corrigibility displayed in both agents for both common payoff (monotone) games and harmonic games. Then we investigate an adversary setting, in which one agent is considered to be a `defending' agent and the other an `adversary'. A general result is provided for what belief over the games and human rationality the defending agent is required to have to induce corrigibility.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores ideas and provides a potential roadmap for the development and evaluation of physics-specific large-scale AI models, which we call Large Physics Models (LPMs). These models, based on foundation models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) - trained on broad data - are tailored to address the demands of physics research. LPMs can function independently or as part of an integrated framework. This framework can incorporate specialized tools, including symbolic reasoning modules for mathematical manipulations, frameworks to analyse specific experimental and simulated data, and mechanisms for synthesizing theories and scientific literature. We begin by examining whether the physics community should actively develop and refine dedicated models, rather than relying solely on commercial LLMs. We then outline how LPMs can be realized through interdisciplinary collaboration among experts in physics, computer science, and philosophy of science. To integrate these models effectively, we identify three key pillars: Development, Evaluation, and Philosophical Reflection. Development focuses on constructing models capable of processing physics texts, mathematical formulations, and diverse physical data. Evaluation assesses accuracy and reliability by testing and benchmarking. Finally, Philosophical Reflection encompasses the analysis of broader implications of LLMs in physics, including their potential to generate new scientific understanding and what novel collaboration dynamics might arise in research. Inspired by the organizational structure of experimental collaborations in particle physics, we propose a similarly interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to building and refining Large Physics Models. This roadmap provides specific objectives, defines pathways to achieve them, and identifies challenges that must be addressed to realise physics-specific large scale AI models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Kr\"ugel, Matthias Uhl</p>
<p>Abstract: Every maneuver of a vehicle redistributes risks between road users. While human drivers do this intuitively, autonomous vehicles allow and require deliberative algorithmic risk management. But how should traffic risks be distributed among road users? In a global experimental study in eight countries with different cultural backgrounds and almost 11,000 participants, we compared risk distribution preferences. It turns out that risk preferences in road traffic are strikingly similar between the cultural zones. The vast majority of participants in all countries deviates from a guiding principle of minimizing accident probabilities in favor of weighing up the probability and severity of accidents. At the national level, the consideration of accident probability and severity hardly differs between countries. The social dilemma of autonomous vehicles detected in deterministic crash scenarios disappears in risk assessments of everyday traffic situations in all countries.

In sum, our results suggest that a global consensus on the risk ethics of autonomous driving is easier to establish than on the ethics of crashing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Dreyer, Jim Berend, Tobias Labarta, Johanna Vielhaben, Thomas Wiegand, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Wojciech Samek</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlike human-engineered systems such as aeroplanes, where each component's role and dependencies are well understood, the inner workings of AI models remain largely opaque, hindering verifiability and undermining trust. This paper introduces SemanticLens, a universal explanation method for neural networks that maps hidden knowledge encoded by components (e.g., individual neurons) into the semantically structured, multimodal space of a foundation model such as CLIP. In this space, unique operations become possible, including (i) textual search to identify neurons encoding specific concepts, (ii) systematic analysis and comparison of model representations, (iii) automated labelling of neurons and explanation of their functional roles, and (iv) audits to validate decision-making against requirements. Fully scalable and operating without human input, SemanticLens is shown to be effective for debugging and validation, summarizing model knowledge, aligning reasoning with expectations (e.g., adherence to the ABCDE-rule in melanoma classification), and detecting components tied to spurious correlations and their associated training data. By enabling component-level understanding and validation, the proposed approach helps bridge the "trust gap" between AI models and traditional engineered systems. We provide code for SemanticLens on https://github.com/jim-berend/semanticlens and a demo on https://semanticlens.hhi-research-insights.eu.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Armando Collado-Villaverde, Pablo Mu\~noz, Maria D. R-Moreno</p>
<p>Abstract: Missing data in time-series analysis poses significant challenges, affecting the reliability of downstream applications. Imputation, the process of estimating missing values, has emerged as a key solution. This paper introduces BRATI, a novel deep-learning model designed to address multivariate time-series imputation by combining Bidirectional Recurrent Networks and Attention mechanisms. BRATI processes temporal dependencies and feature correlations across long and short time horizons, utilizing two imputation blocks that operate in opposite temporal directions. Each block integrates recurrent layers and attention mechanisms to effectively resolve long-term dependencies.
  We evaluate BRATI on three real-world datasets under diverse missing-data scenarios: randomly missing values, fixed-length missing sequences, and variable-length missing sequences. Our findings demonstrate that BRATI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, delivering superior accuracy and robustness in imputing multivariate time-series data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Hao Huang, Chang Xu, Yueying Wu, Wu-Jun Li, Jiang Bian</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series generation models are crucial for applications like data augmentation and privacy preservation. Most existing time series generation models are typically designed to generate data from one specified domain. While leveraging data from other domain for better generalization is proved to work in other application areas, this approach remains challenging for time series modeling due to the large divergence in patterns among different real world time series categories. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain time series diffusion model with domain prompts, named TimeDP. In TimeDP, we utilize a time series semantic prototype module which defines time series prototypes to represent time series basis, each prototype vector serving as "word" representing some elementary time series feature. A prototype assignment module is applied to extract the extract domain specific prototype weights, for learning domain prompts as generation condition. During sampling, we extract "domain prompt" with few-shot samples from the target domain and use the domain prompts as condition to generate time series samples. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines to provide the state-of-the-art in-domain generation quality and strong unseen domain generation capability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gerald Tesauro, Gregory R. Galperin</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a Monte-Carlo simulation algorithm for real-time policy improvement of an adaptive controller. In the Monte-Carlo simulation, the long-term expected reward of each possible action is statistically measured, using the initial policy to make decisions in each step of the simulation. The action maximizing the measured expected reward is then taken, resulting in an improved policy. Our algorithm is easily parallelizable and has been implemented on the IBM SP1 and SP2 parallel-RISC supercomputers.
  We have obtained promising initial results in applying this algorithm to the domain of backgammon. Results are reported for a wide variety of initial policies, ranging from a random policy to TD-Gammon, an extremely strong multi-layer neural network. In each case, the Monte-Carlo algorithm gives a substantial reduction, by as much as a factor of 5 or more, in the error rate of the base players. The algorithm is also potentially useful in many other adaptive control applications in which it is possible to simulate the environment.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05408">TimeRL: Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning with Polyhedral Dependence Graphs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro F. Silvestre, Peter Pietzuch</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern deep learning (DL) workloads increasingly use complex deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms that generate training data within the learning loop. This results in programs with several nested loops and dynamic data dependencies between tensors. While DL systems with eager execution support such dynamism, they lack the optimizations and smart scheduling of graph-based execution. Graph-based execution, however, cannot express dynamic tensor shapes, instead requiring the use of multiple static subgraphs. Either execution model for DRL thus leads to redundant computation, reduced parallelism, and less efficient memory management.
  We describe TimeRL, a system for executing dynamic DRL programs that combines the dynamism of eager execution with the whole-program optimizations and scheduling of graph-based execution. TimeRL achieves this by introducing the declarative programming model of recurrent tensors, which allows users to define dynamic dependencies as intuitive recurrence equations. TimeRL translates recurrent tensors into a polyhedral dependence graph (PDG) with dynamic dependencies as symbolic expressions. Through simple PDG transformations, TimeRL applies whole-program optimizations, such as automatic vectorization, incrementalization, and operator fusion. The PDG also allows for the computation of an efficient program-wide execution schedule, which decides on buffer deallocations, buffer donations, and GPU/CPU memory swapping. We show that TimeRL executes current DRL algorithms up to 47$\times$ faster than existing DRL systems, while using 16$\times$ less GPU peak memory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozhi Qi, Brent Yi, Mike Lambeta, Yi Ma, Roberto Calandra, Jitendra Malik</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning policies in simulation and transferring them to the real world has become a promising approach in dexterous manipulation. However, bridging the sim-to-real gap for each new task requires substantial human effort, such as careful reward engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and system identification. In this work, we present a system that leverages low-level skills to address these challenges for more complex tasks. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical policy for in-hand object reorientation based on previously acquired rotation skills. This hierarchical policy learns to select which low-level skill to execute based on feedback from both the environment and the low-level skill policies themselves. Compared to learning from scratch, the hierarchical policy is more robust to out-of-distribution changes and transfers easily from simulation to real-world environments. Additionally, we propose a generalizable object pose estimator that uses proprioceptive information, low-level skill predictions, and control errors as inputs to estimate the object pose over time. We demonstrate that our system can reorient objects, including symmetrical and textureless ones, to a desired pose.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniruddha Mahapatra, Long Mai, Yitian Zhang, David Bourgin, Feng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Video tokenizers are essential for latent video diffusion models, converting raw video data into spatiotemporally compressed latent spaces for efficient training. However, extending state-of-the-art video tokenizers to achieve a temporal compression ratio beyond 4x without increasing channel capacity poses significant challenges. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to enhance temporal compression. We find that the reconstruction quality of temporally subsampled videos from a low-compression encoder surpasses that of high-compression encoders applied to original videos. This indicates that high-compression models can leverage representations from lower-compression models. Building on this insight, we develop a bootstrapped high-temporal-compression model that progressively trains high-compression blocks atop well-trained lower-compression models. Our method includes a cross-level feature-mixing module to retain information from the pretrained low-compression model and guide higher-compression blocks to capture the remaining details from the full video sequence. Evaluation of video benchmarks shows that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality while increasing temporal compression compared to direct extensions of existing video tokenizers. Furthermore, the resulting compact latent space effectively trains a video diffusion model for high-quality video generation with a reduced token budget.</p>

<p>Abstract: The success of social media platforms has facilitated the emergence of various forms of online abuse within digital communities. This abuse manifests in multiple ways, including hate speech, cyberbullying, emotional abuse, grooming, and sexting. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the different forms of abuse prevalent in social media, with a particular focus on how emerging technologies, such as Language Models (LMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), are reshaping both the detection and generation of abusive content within these networks. We delve into the mechanisms through which social media abuse is perpetuated, exploring the psychological and social impact. Additionally, we examine the dual role of advanced language models-highlighting their potential to enhance automated detection systems for abusive behavior while also acknowledging their capacity to generate harmful content. This paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on online safety and ethics, offering insights into the evolving landscape of cyberabuse and the technological innovations that both mitigate and exacerbate it.</p>

<p>Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has made significant strides in distilling image-generative models for 3D generation. However, its maximum-likelihood-seeking behavior often leads to degraded visual quality and diversity, limiting its effectiveness in 3D applications. In this work, we propose Consistent Flow Distillation (CFD), which addresses these limitations. We begin by leveraging the gradient of the diffusion ODE or SDE sampling process to guide the 3D generation. From the gradient-based sampling perspective, we find that the consistency of 2D image flows across different viewpoints is important for high-quality 3D generation. To achieve this, we introduce multi-view consistent Gaussian noise on the 3D object, which can be rendered from various viewpoints to compute the flow gradient. Our experiments demonstrate that CFD, through consistent flows, significantly outperforms previous methods in text-to-3D generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We empirically study autoregressive pre-training from videos. To perform our study, we construct a series of autoregressive video models, called Toto. We treat videos as sequences of visual tokens and train transformer models to autoregressively predict future tokens. Our models are pre-trained on a diverse dataset of videos and images comprising over 1 trillion visual tokens. We explore different architectural, training, and inference design choices. We evaluate the learned visual representations on a range of downstream tasks including image recognition, video classification, object tracking, and robotics. Our results demonstrate that, despite minimal inductive biases, autoregressive pre-training leads to competitive performance across all benchmarks. Finally, we find that scaling our video models results in similar scaling curves to those seen in language models, albeit with a different rate. More details at https://brjathu.github.io/toto/</p>

<p>Abstract: Citywalk, a recently popular form of urban travel, requires genuine personalization and understanding of fine-grained requests compared to traditional itinerary planning. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of Open-domain Urban Itinerary Planning (OUIP), which generates personalized urban itineraries from user requests in natural language. We then present ITINERA, an OUIP system that integrates spatial optimization with large language models to provide customized urban itineraries based on user needs. This involves decomposing user requests, selecting candidate points of interest (POIs), ordering the POIs based on cluster-aware spatial optimization, and generating the itinerary. Experiments on real-world datasets and the performance of the deployed system demonstrate our system's capacity to deliver personalized and spatially coherent itineraries compared to current solutions.

<p>Abstract: The integration of autonomous vehicles into urban traffic has great potential to improve efficiency by reducing congestion and optimizing traffic flow systematically. In this paper, we introduce CoMAL (Collaborative Multi-Agent LLMs), a framework designed to address the mixed-autonomy traffic problem by collaboration among autonomous vehicles to optimize traffic flow. CoMAL is built upon large language models, operating in an interactive traffic simulation environment. It utilizes a Perception Module to observe surrounding agents and a Memory Module to store strategies for each agent. The overall workflow includes a Collaboration Module that encourages autonomous vehicles to discuss the effective strategy and allocate roles, a reasoning engine to determine optimal behaviors based on assigned roles, and an Execution Module that controls vehicle actions using a hybrid approach combining rule-based models. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAL achieves superior performance on the Flow benchmark. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of different language models and compare our framework with reinforcement learning approaches. It highlights the strong cooperative capability of LLM agents and presents a promising solution to the mixed-autonomy traffic challenge.

<p>Abstract: AI holds promise for transforming scientific processes, including hypothesis generation. Prior work on hypothesis generation can be broadly categorized into theory-driven and data-driven approaches. While both have proven effective in generating novel and plausible hypotheses, it remains an open question whether they can complement each other. To address this, we develop the first method that combines literature-based insights with data to perform LLM-powered hypothesis generation. We apply our method on five different datasets and demonstrate that integrating literature and data outperforms other baselines (8.97\% over few-shot, 15.75\% over literature-based alone, and 3.37\% over data-driven alone). Additionally, we conduct the first human evaluation to assess the utility of LLM-generated hypotheses in assisting human decision-making on two challenging tasks: deception detection and AI generated content detection. Our results show that human accuracy improves significantly by 7.44\% and 14.19\% on these tasks, respectively. These findings suggest that integrating literature-based and data-driven approaches provides a comprehensive and nuanced framework for hypothesis generation and could open new avenues for scientific inquiry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danyal Aftab, Steven Davy</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models demonstrate impressive proficiency in language understanding and generation. Nonetheless, training these models from scratch, even the least complex billion-parameter variant demands significant computational resources rendering it economically impractical for many organizations. With large language models functioning as general-purpose task solvers, this paper investigates their task-specific fine-tuning. We employ task-specific datasets and prompts to fine-tune two pruned LLaMA models having 5 billion and 4 billion parameters. This process utilizes the pre-trained weights and focuses on a subset of weights using the LoRA method. One challenge in fine-tuning the LLaMA model is crafting a precise prompt tailored to the specific task. To address this, we propose a novel approach to fine-tune the LLaMA model under two primary constraints: task specificity and prompt effectiveness. Our approach, Tailored LLaMA initially employs structural pruning to reduce the model sizes from 7B to 5B and 4B parameters. Subsequently, it applies a carefully designed prompt specific to the task and utilizes the LoRA method to accelerate the fine-tuning process. Moreover, fine-tuning a model pruned by 50\% for less than one hour restores the mean accuracy of classification tasks to 95.68\% at a 20\% compression ratio and to 86.54\% at a 50\% compression ratio through few-shot learning with 50 shots. Our validation of Tailored LLaMA on these two pruned variants demonstrates that even when compressed to 50\%, the models maintain over 65\% of the baseline model accuracy in few-shot classification and generation tasks. These findings highlight the efficacy of our tailored approach in maintaining high performance with significantly reduced model sizes.</p>

Our evaluation compares the performance of state-of-the-art SLMs and LLMs for both modalities (text and images) and the results reveal that while SLMs are computationally efficient, LLMs demonstrate superior accuracy in identifying subtle framing and text-visual inconsistencies. Furthermore, empirical analysis shows that incorporating visual cues alongside textual data improves bias detection accuracy by 3 to 5%.

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing medical practice, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and healthcare delivery. However, its adaptation in medical settings still faces significant challenges, related to data availability and privacy constraints. Synthetic data has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these issues, addressing data scarcity while preserving privacy. Recently, Latent Diffusion Models have emerged as a powerful tool for generating high-quality synthetic data. Meanwhile, the integration of different modalities has gained interest, emphasizing the need of models capable of handle multimodal medical data. Existing approaches struggle to integrate complementary information and lack the ability to generate modalities simultaneously. To address this challenge, we present MedCoDi-M, a 6.77-billion-parameter model, designed for multimodal medical data generation, that, following Foundation Model paradigm, exploits contrastive learning and large quantity of data to build a shared latent space which capture the relationships between different data modalities. Further, we introduce the Multi-Prompt training technique, which significantly boosts MedCoDi-M's generation under different settings. We extensively validate MedCoDi-M: first we benchmark it against five competitors on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, a state-of-the-art dataset for Chest X-ray and radiological report generation. Secondly, we perform a Visual Turing Test with expert radiologists to assess the realism and clinical relevance of the generated data, ensuring alignment with real-world scenarios. Finally, we assess the utility of MedCoDi-M in addressing key challenges in the medical field, such as anonymization, data scarcity and imbalance learning. The results are promising, demonstrating the applicability of MedCoDi-M in medical contexts. Project page is at https://cosbidev.github.io/MedCoDi-M/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Numair Sani, Daniel Malinsky, Ilya Shpitser</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal approaches to post-hoc explainability for black-box prediction models (e.g., deep neural networks trained on image pixel data) have become increasingly popular. However, existing approaches have two important shortcomings: (i) the "explanatory units" are micro-level inputs into the relevant prediction model, e.g., image pixels, rather than interpretable macro-level features that are more useful for understanding how to possibly change the algorithm's behavior, and (ii) existing approaches assume there exists no unmeasured confounding between features and target model predictions, which fails to hold when the explanatory units are macro-level variables. Our focus is on the important setting where the analyst has no access to the inner workings of the target prediction algorithm, rather only the ability to query the output of the model in response to a particular input. To provide causal explanations in such a setting, we propose to learn causal graphical representations that allow for arbitrary unmeasured confounding among features. We demonstrate the resulting graph can differentiate between interpretable features that causally influence model predictions versus those that are merely associated with model predictions due to confounding. Our approach is motivated by a counterfactual theory of causal explanation wherein good explanations point to factors that are "difference-makers" in an interventionist sense.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern, state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision have millions of parameters. Thus, explaining the complex decisions of such networks to humans is challenging. A technical approach to reduce CNN complexity is network pruning, where less important parameters are deleted. The work presented in this paper investigates whether this technical complexity reduction also helps with perceived explainability. To do so, we conducted a pre-study and two human-grounded experiments, assessing the effects of different pruning ratios on CNN explainability. Overall, we evaluated four different compression rates (i.e., CPR 2, 4, 8, and 32) with 37 500 tasks on Mechanical Turk. Results indicate that lower compression rates have a positive influence on explainability, while higher compression rates show negative effects. Furthermore, we were able to identify sweet spots that increase both the perceived explainability and the model's performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Spandan Garg, Roshanak Zilouchian Moghaddam, Neel Sundaresan</p>
<p>Abstract: Performance bugs are non-functional bugs that can even manifest in well-tested commercial products. Fixing these performance bugs is an important yet challenging problem. In this work, we address this challenge and present a new approach called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Generation (RAPGen). Given a code snippet with a performance issue, RAPGen first retrieves a prompt instruction from a pre-constructed knowledge-base of previous performance bug fixes and then generates a prompt using the retrieved instruction. It then uses this prompt on a Large Language Model (such as Codex) in zero-shot to generate a fix. We compare our approach with the various prompt variations and state of the art methods in the task of performance bug fixing. Our evaluation shows that RAPGen can generate performance improvement suggestions equivalent or better than a developer in ~60% of the cases, getting ~42% of them verbatim, in an expert-verified dataset of past performance changes made by C# developers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghua Zhang, Li Liu, Olli Silv\'en, Matti Pietik\"ainen, Dewen Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) presents a unique challenge in Machine Learning (ML), as it necessitates the Incremental Learning (IL) of new classes from sparsely labeled training samples without forgetting previous knowledge. While this field has seen recent progress, it remains an active exploration area. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of FSCIL. In our in-depth examination, we delve into various facets of FSCIL, encompassing the problem definition, the discussion of the primary challenges of unreliable empirical risk minimization and the stability-plasticity dilemma, general schemes, and relevant problems of IL and Few-shot Learning (FSL). Besides, we offer an overview of benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we introduce the Few-shot Class-incremental Classification (FSCIC) methods from data-based, structure-based, and optimization-based approaches and the Few-shot Class-incremental Object Detection (FSCIOD) methods from anchor-free and anchor-based approaches. Beyond these, we present several promising research directions within FSCIL that merit further investigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Han, Kaixiong Gong, Yiyuan Zhang, Jiaqi Wang, Kaipeng Zhang, Dahua Lin, Yu Qiao, Peng Gao, Xiangyu Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention due to their strong multimodal understanding capability. However, existing works rely heavily on modality-specific encoders, which usually differ in architecture and are limited to common modalities. In this paper, we present OneLLM, an MLLM that aligns eight modalities to language using a unified framework. We achieve this through a unified multimodal encoder and a progressive multimodal alignment pipeline. In detail, we first train an image projection module to connect a vision encoder with LLM. Then, we build a universal projection module (UPM) by mixing multiple image projection modules and dynamic routing. Finally, we progressively align more modalities to LLM with the UPM. To fully leverage the potential of OneLLM in following instructions, we also curated a comprehensive multimodal instruction dataset, including 2M items from image, audio, video, point cloud, depth/normal map, IMU and fMRI brain activity. OneLLM is evaluated on 25 diverse benchmarks, encompassing tasks such as multimodal captioning, question answering and reasoning, where it delivers excellent performance.

<p>Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive and, to our knowledge, the first review of inclusive human-computer interaction (HCI) within autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven cars with partial autonomy, emphasizing accessibility and user-centered design principles. We explore the current technologies and HCI systems designed to enhance passenger experience, particularly for individuals with accessibility needs. Key technologies discussed include brain-computer interfaces, anthropomorphic interaction, virtual reality, augmented reality, mode adaptation, voice-activated interfaces, haptic feedback, etc. Each technology is evaluated for its role in creating an inclusive in-vehicle environment. Furthermore, we highlight recent interface designs by leading companies and review emerging concepts and prototypes under development or testing, which show significant potential to address diverse accessibility requirements. Safety considerations, ethical concerns, and adoption of AVs are other major issues that require thorough investigation. Building on these findings, we propose an end-to-end design framework that addresses accessibility requirements across diverse user demographics, including older adults and individuals with physical or cognitive impairments. This work provides actionable insights for designers, researchers, and policymakers aiming to create safer and more comfortable environments in autonomous and regular vehicles accessible to all users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Yang, Jianfeng Zhang, Yichun Shi, Bowen Chen, Chenxu Zhang, Huichao Zhang, Xiaofeng Yang, Xiu Li, Jiashi Feng, Guosheng Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Benefiting from the rapid development of 2D diffusion models, 3D content generation has witnessed significant progress. One promising solution is to finetune the pre-trained 2D diffusion models to produce multi-view images and then reconstruct them into 3D assets via feed-forward sparse-view reconstruction models. However, limited by the 3D inconsistency in the generated multi-view images and the low reconstruction resolution of the feed-forward reconstruction models, the generated 3d assets are still limited to incorrect geometries and blurry textures. To address this problem, we present a multi-view based refine method, named Magic-Boost, to further refine the generation results. In detail, we first propose a novel multi-view conditioned diffusion model which extracts 3d prior from the synthesized multi-view images to synthesize high-fidelity novel view images and then introduce a novel iterative-update strategy to adopt it to provide precise guidance to refine the coarse generated results through a fast optimization process. Conditioned on the strong 3d priors extracted from the synthesized multi-view images, Magic-Boost is capable of providing precise optimization guidance that well aligns with the coarse generated 3D assets, enriching the local detail in both geometry and texture within a short time ($\sim15$min). Extensive experiments show Magic-Boost greatly enhances the coarse generated inputs, generates high-quality 3D assets with rich geometric and textural details.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Li, Fei Tao, Wei Ye, Aydin Nassehi, John W. Sutherland</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we introduce Generative Manufacturing Systems (GMS) as a novel approach to effectively manage and coordinate autonomous manufacturing assets, thereby enhancing their responsiveness and flexibility to address a wide array of production objectives and human preferences. Deviating from traditional explicit modeling, GMS employs generative AI, including diffusion models and ChatGPT, for implicit learning from envisioned futures, marking a shift from a model-optimum to a training-sampling decision-making. Through the integration of generative AI, GMS enables complex decision-making through interactive dialogue with humans, allowing manufacturing assets to generate multiple high-quality global decisions that can be iteratively refined based on human feedback. Empirical findings showcase GMS's substantial improvement in system resilience and responsiveness to uncertainties, with decision times reduced from seconds to milliseconds. The study underscores the inherent creativity and diversity in the generated solutions, facilitating human-centric decision-making through seamless and continuous human-machine interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Leemann, Alina Fastowski, Felix Pfeiffer, Gjergji Kasneci</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the critical challenge of applying feature attribution methods to the transformer architecture, which dominates current applications in natural language processing and beyond. Traditional attribution methods to explainable AI (XAI) explicitly or implicitly rely on linear or additive surrogate models to quantify the impact of input features on a model's output. In this work, we formally prove an alarming incompatibility: transformers are structurally incapable of representing linear or additive surrogate models used for feature attribution, undermining the grounding of these conventional explanation methodologies. To address this discrepancy, we introduce the Softmax-Linked Additive Log Odds Model (SLALOM), a novel surrogate model specifically designed to align with the transformer framework. SLALOM demonstrates the capacity to deliver a range of insightful explanations with both synthetic and real-world datasets. We highlight SLALOM's unique efficiency-quality curve by showing that SLALOM can produce explanations with substantially higher fidelity than competing surrogate models or provide explanations of comparable quality at a fraction of their computational costs. We release code for SLALOM as an open-source project online at https://github.com/tleemann/slalom_explanations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niccolo Anceschi, Federico Ferrari, David B. Dunson, Himel Mallick</p>
<p>Abstract: It is increasingly common in a wide variety of applied settings to collect data of multiple different types on the same set of samples. Our particular focus in this article is on studying relationships between such multiview features and responses. A motivating application arises in the context of precision medicine where multi-omics data are collected to correlate with clinical outcomes. It is of interest to infer dependence within and across views while combining multimodal information to improve the prediction of outcomes. The signal-to-noise ratio can vary substantially across views, motivating more nuanced statistical tools beyond standard late and early fusion. This challenge comes with the need to preserve interpretability, select features, and obtain accurate uncertainty quantification. We propose a joint additive factor regression model (JAFAR) with a structured additive design, accounting for shared and view-specific components. We ensure identifiability via a novel dependent cumulative shrinkage process (D-CUSP) prior. We provide an efficient implementation via a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler and extend our approach to allow flexible feature and outcome distributions. Prediction of time-to-labor onset from immunome, metabolome, and proteome data illustrates performance gains against state-of-the-art competitors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaron Lohner, Francesco Compagno, Jonathan Francis, Alessandro Oltramari</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognizing a traffic accident is an essential part of any autonomous driving or road monitoring system. An accident can appear in a wide variety of forms, and understanding what type of accident is taking place may be useful to prevent it from recurring. This work focuses on classifying traffic scenes into specific accident types. We approach the problem by representing a traffic scene as a graph, where objects such as cars can be represented as nodes, and relative distances and directions between them as edges. This representation of a traffic scene is referred to as a scene graph, and can be used as input for an accident classifier. Better results are obtained with a classifier that fuses the scene graph input with visual and textual representations. This work introduces a multi-stage, multimodal pipeline that pre-processes videos of traffic accidents, encodes them as scene graphs, and aligns this representation with vision and language modalities before executing the classification task. When trained on 4 classes, our method achieves a balanced accuracy score of 57.77% on an (unbalanced) subset of the popular Detection of Traffic Anomaly (DoTA) benchmark, representing an increase of close to 5 percentage points from the case where scene graph information is not taken into account.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Akbar Husnoo, Adnan Anwar, Md Enamul Haque, A. N. Mahmood</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing security and privacy concerns in the Smart Grid sector have led to a significant demand for robust intrusion detection systems within critical smart grid infrastructure. To address the challenges posed by privacy preservation and decentralized power system zones with distinct data ownership, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving solution which facilitates collaborative training of attack detection models without necessitating the sharing of raw data. However, FL presents several implementation limitations in the power system domain due to its heavy reliance on a centralized aggregator and the risks of privacy leakage during model update transmission. To overcome these technical bottlenecks, this paper introduces a novel decentralized federated anomaly detection scheme based on two main gossip protocols namely Random Walk and Epidemic. Our findings indicate that the Random Walk protocol exhibits superior performance compared to the Epidemic protocol, highlighting its efficacy in decentralized federated learning environments. Experimental validation of the proposed framework utilizing publicly available industrial control systems datasets demonstrates superior attack detection accuracy while safeguarding data confidentiality and mitigating the impact of communication latency and stragglers. Furthermore, our approach yields a notable 35% improvement in training time compared to conventional FL, underscoring the efficacy and robustness of our decentralized learning method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval, the initial stage of a recommendation system, is tasked with down-selecting items from a pool of tens of millions of candidates to a few thousands. Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) has been a typical choice for this problem, addressing the computational demands of deep neural networks across vast item corpora. EBR utilizes Two Tower or Siamese Networks to learn representations for users and items, and employ Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search to efficiently retrieve relevant items. Despite its popularity in industry, EBR faces limitations. The Two Tower architecture, relying on a single dot product interaction, struggles to capture complex data distributions due to limited capability in learning expressive interactions between users and items. Additionally, ANN index building and representation learning for user and item are often separate, leading to inconsistencies exacerbated by representation (e.g. continuous online training) and item drift (e.g. items expired and new items added). In this paper, we introduce the Hierarchical Structured Neural Network (HSNN), an efficient deep neural network model to learn intricate user and item interactions beyond the commonly used dot product in retrieval tasks, achieving sublinear computational costs relative to corpus size. A Modular Neural Network (MoNN) is designed to maintain high expressiveness for interaction learning while ensuring efficiency. A mixture of MoNNs operate on a hierarchical item index to achieve extensive computation sharing, enabling it to scale up to large corpus size. MoNN and the hierarchical index are jointly learnt to continuously adapt to distribution shifts in both user interests and item distributions. HSNN achieves substantial improvement in offline evaluation compared to prevailing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wall Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequence modeling with State Space models (SSMs) has demonstrated performance surpassing that of Transformers in various tasks, raising expectations for their potential to outperform the Decision Transformer and its enhanced variants in offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, decision models based on Mamba, a state-of-the-art SSM, failed to achieve superior performance compared to these enhanced Decision Transformers. We hypothesize that this limitation arises from information loss during the selective scanning phase. To address this, we propose the Decision MetaMamba (DMM), which augments Mamba with a token mixer in its input layer. This mixer explicitly accounts for the multimodal nature of offline RL inputs, comprising state, action, and return-to-go. The DMM demonstrates improved performance while significantly reducing parameter count compared to prior models. Notably, similar performance gains were achieved using a simple linear token mixer, emphasizing the importance of preserving information from proximate time steps rather than the specific design of the token mixer itself. This novel modification to Mamba's input layer represents a departure from conventional timestamp-based encoding approaches used in Transformers. By enhancing performance of Mamba in offline RL, characterized by memory efficiency and fast inference, this work opens new avenues for its broader application in future RL research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junxiong Wang, Daniele Paliotta, Avner May, Alexander M. Rush, Tri Dao</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear RNN architectures, like Mamba, can be competitive with Transformer models in language modeling while having advantageous deployment characteristics. Given the focus on training large-scale Transformer models, we consider the challenge of converting these pretrained models for deployment. We demonstrate that it is feasible to distill large Transformers into linear RNNs by reusing the linear projection weights from attention layers with academic GPU resources. The resulting hybrid model, which incorporates a quarter of the attention layers, achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer in chat benchmarks and outperforms open-source hybrid Mamba models trained from scratch with trillions of tokens in both chat benchmarks and general benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates the inference speed of Mamba and hybrid models. Overall we show how, with limited computation resources, we can remove many of the original attention layers and generate from the resulting model more efficiently. Our top-performing model, distilled from Llama3-8B-Instruct, achieves a 29.61 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 against GPT-4 and 7.35 on MT-Bench, surpassing the best 8B scale instruction-tuned linear RNN model. We also find that the distilled model has natural length extrapolation, showing almost perfect accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack test at 20x the distillation length.

<p>Abstract: This study investigated the use of deep learning to identify multi-level upper airway collapses in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients based on snoring sounds. We fi-ne-tuned ResNet-50 and Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) models using snoring recordings from 37 subjects undergoing drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) between 2020 and 2021. Snoring sounds were labeled according to the VOTE (Velum, Orophar-ynx, Tongue Base, Epiglottis) classification, resulting in 259 V, 403 O, 77 T, 13 E, 1016 VO, 46 VT, 140 OT, 39 OE, 30 VOT, and 3150 non-snoring (N) 0.5-second clips. The models were trained for two multi-label classification tasks: identifying obstructions at V, O, T, and E levels, and identifying retropalatal (RP) and retroglossal (RG) obstruc-tions. Results showed AST slightly outperformed ResNet-50, demonstrating good abil-ity to identify V (F1-score: 0.71, MCC: 0.61, AUC: 0.89), O (F1-score: 0.80, MCC: 0.72, AUC: 0.94), and RP obstructions (F1-score: 0.86, MCC: 0.77, AUC: 0.97). However, both models struggled with T, E, and RG classifications due to limited data. Retrospective analysis of a full-night recording showed the potential to profile airway obstruction dynamics. We expect this information, combined with polysomnography and other clinical parameters, can aid clinical triage and treatment planning for OSA patients.</p>

<p>Abstract: We initiate the study of Preference-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (PbMARL), exploring both theoretical foundations and empirical validations. We define the task as identifying the Nash equilibrium from a preference-only offline dataset in general-sum games, a problem marked by the challenge of sparse feedback signals. Our theory establishes the upper complexity bounds for Nash Equilibrium in effective PbMARL, demonstrating that single-policy coverage is inadequate and highlighting the importance of unilateral dataset coverage. These theoretical insights are verified through comprehensive experiments. To enhance the practical performance, we further introduce two algorithmic techniques. (1) We propose a Mean Squared Error (MSE) regularization along the time axis to achieve a more uniform reward distribution and improve reward learning outcomes. (2) We propose an additional penalty based on the distribution of the dataset to incorporate pessimism, improving stability and effectiveness during training. Our findings underscore the multifaceted approach required for PbMARL, paving the way for effective preference-based multi-agent systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) locally on mobile devices is advantageous in scenarios where transmitting data to remote cloud servers is either undesirable due to privacy concerns or impractical due to network connection. Recent advancements (MLC, 2023a; Gerganov, 2023) have facilitated the local deployment of LLMs. However, local deployment also presents challenges, particularly in balancing quality (generative performance), latency, and throughput within the hardware constraints of mobile devices. In this paper, we introduce our lightweight, all-in-one automated benchmarking framework that allows users to evaluate LLMs on mobile devices. We provide a comprehensive benchmark of various popular LLMs with different quantization configurations (both weights and activations) across multiple mobile platforms with varying hardware capabilities. Unlike traditional benchmarks that assess full-scale models on high-end GPU clusters, we focus on evaluating resource efficiency (memory and power consumption) and harmful output for compressed models on mobile devices. Our key observations include i) differences in energy efficiency and throughput across mobile platforms; ii) the impact of quantization on memory usage, GPU execution time, and power consumption; and iii) accuracy and performance degradation of quantized models compared to their non-quantized counterparts; and iv) the frequency of hallucinations and toxic content generated by compressed LLMs on mobile devices.</p>

While techniques like $\mu$P (Yang et al., 2022) provide scaling rules for optimal $\eta$ transfer in the infinite model size limit, the optimal scaling behavior in the infinite data size limit remains unknown. We fill in this gap by observing for the first time an intricate dependence of optimal $\eta$ scaling on the pretraining token budget $T$, $B$ and its relation to the critical batch size $B_\mathrm{crit}$, which we measure to evolve as $B_\mathrm{crit} \propto T$. Furthermore, we show that the optimal batch size is positively correlated with $B_\mathrm{crit}$: keeping it fixed becomes suboptimal over time even if learning rate is scaled optimally. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that the observed optimal $\eta$ and $B$ dynamics are preserved with $\mu$P model scaling, challenging the conventional view of $B_\mathrm{crit}$ dependence solely on loss value. Complementing optimality, we examine the sensitivity of loss to changes in learning rate, where we find the sensitivity to decrease with increase of $T$ and to remain constant with $\mu$P model scaling. We hope our results make the first step towards a unified picture of the joint optimal data and model scaling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Will Dorrell, Kyle Hsu, Luke Hollingsworth, Jin Hwa Lee, Jiajun Wu, Chelsea Finn, Peter E Latham, Tim EJ Behrens, James CR Whittington</p>
<p>Abstract: Why do biological and artificial neurons sometimes modularise, each encoding a single meaningful variable, and sometimes entangle their representation of many variables? In this work, we develop a theory of when biologically inspired networks -- those that are nonnegative and energy efficient -- modularise their representation of source variables (sources). We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on a sample of sources that determine whether the neurons in an optimal biologically-inspired linear autoencoder modularise. Our theory applies to any dataset, extending far beyond the case of statistical independence studied in previous work. Rather we show that sources modularise if their support is ``sufficiently spread''. From this theory, we extract and validate predictions in a variety of empirical studies on how data distribution affects modularisation in nonlinear feedforward and recurrent neural networks trained on supervised and unsupervised tasks. Furthermore, we apply these ideas to neuroscience data, showing that range independence can be used to understand the mixing or modularising of spatial and reward information in entorhinal recordings in seemingly conflicting experiments. Further, we use these results to suggest alternate origins of mixed-selectivity, beyond the predominant theory of flexible nonlinear classification. In sum, our theory prescribes precise conditions on when neural activities modularise, providing tools for inducing and elucidating modular representations in brains and machines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Awais, Ali Husain Salem Abdulla Alharthi, Amandeep Kumar, Hisham Cholakkal, Rao Muhammad Anwer</p>
<p>Abstract: Significant progress has been made in advancing large multimodal conversational models (LMMs), capitalizing on vast repositories of image-text data available online. Despite this progress, these models often encounter substantial domain gaps, hindering their ability to engage in complex conversations across new domains. Recent efforts have aimed to mitigate this issue, albeit relying on domain-specific image-text data to curate instruction-tuning data. However, many domains, such as agriculture, lack such vision-language data. In this work, we propose an approach to construct instruction-tuning data that harnesses vision-only data for the agriculture domain. We utilize diverse agricultural datasets spanning multiple domains, curate class-specific information, and employ large language models (LLMs) to construct an expert-tuning set, resulting in a 70k expert-tuning dataset called AgroInstruct. Subsequently, we expert-tuned and created AgroGPT, an efficient LMM that can hold complex agriculture-related conversations and provide useful insights. We also develop AgroEvals for evaluation and compare {AgroGPT's} performance with large open and closed-source models. {AgroGPT} excels at identifying fine-grained agricultural concepts, can act as an agriculture expert, and provides helpful information for multimodal agriculture questions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanming Zhang, Jing Lu, Fei Chen, Haoliang Du, Xia Gao, Zhibin Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Decoding the directional focus of an attended speaker from listeners' electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is essential for developing brain-computer interfaces to improve the quality of life for individuals with hearing impairment. Previous works have concentrated on binary directional focus decoding, i.e., determining whether the attended speaker is on the left or right side of the listener. However, a more precise decoding of the exact direction of the attended speaker is necessary for effective speech processing. Additionally, audio spatial information has not been effectively leveraged, resulting in suboptimal decoding results. In this paper, it is found that on the recently presented dataset with 14-class directional focus, models relying exclusively on EEG inputs exhibit significantly lower accuracy when decoding the directional focus in both leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-trial-out scenarios. By integrating audio spatial spectra with EEG features, the decoding accuracy can be effectively improved. The CNN, LSM-CNN, and Deformer models are employed to decode the directional focus from listeners' EEG signals and audio spatial spectra. The proposed Sp-EEG-Deformer model achieves notable 14-class decoding accuracies of 55.35% and 57.19% in leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-trial-out scenarios with a decision window of 1 second, respectively. Experiment results indicate increased decoding accuracy as the number of alternative directions reduces. These findings suggest the efficacy of our proposed dual modal directional focus decoding strategy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elia Cunegatti, Leonardo Lucio Custode, Giovanni Iacca</p>
<p>Abstract: Network pruning focuses on computational techniques that aim to reduce a given model's computational cost by removing a subset of its parameters while having minimal impact on performance. Throughout the last decade, the most widely used pruning paradigm has been pruning and re-training, which nowadays is inconvenient due to the vast amount of pre-trained models, which are in any case too expensive to re-train. In this paper, we exploit functional information from dense pre-trained models, i.e., their activations, to obtain sparse models that maximize the activations' alignment w.r.t. their corresponding dense models. Hence, we propose \textsc{NeuroAL}, a \emph{top-up} algorithm that can be used on top of any given pruning algorithm for LLMs, which modifies the block-wise and row-wise sparsity exploiting information from both the dense model and its sparse version to maximize the \emph{neuron alignment} among activations. Differently from existing methods, our approach adaptively selects the best hyperparameters for the block-wise and row-wise sparsity ratios w.r.t. the model and the desired sparsity, and requires \emph{no re-training}. We test our method over 276 cases combining four LLM families, three sparsity ratios, and ten language tasks (three language modeling and seven zero-shot datasets), showing how it consistently outperforms the latest state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance-runtime trade-off.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Einari Vaaras, Manu Airaksinen, Okko R\"as\"anen</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a data-driven learning approach that utilizes the innate structure of the data to guide the learning process. In contrast to supervised learning, which depends on external labels, SSL utilizes the inherent characteristics of the data to produce its own supervisory signal. However, one frequent issue with SSL methods is representation collapse, where the model outputs a constant input-invariant feature representation. This issue hinders the potential application of SSL methods to new data modalities, as trying to avoid representation collapse wastes researchers' time and effort. This paper introduces a novel SSL algorithm for time-series data called Prediction of Functionals from Masked Latents (PFML). Instead of predicting masked input signals or their latent representations directly, PFML operates by predicting statistical functionals of the input signal corresponding to masked embeddings, given a sequence of unmasked embeddings. The algorithm is designed to avoid representation collapse, rendering it straightforwardly applicable to different time-series data domains, such as novel sensor modalities in clinical data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PFML through complex, real-life classification tasks across three different data modalities: infant posture and movement classification from multi-sensor inertial measurement unit data, emotion recognition from speech data, and sleep stage classification from EEG data. The results show that PFML is superior to a conceptually similar SSL method and a contrastive learning-based SSL method. Additionally, PFML is on par with the current state-of-the-art SSL method, while also being conceptually simpler and without suffering from representation collapse.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Lei, Yanchuan Chang, Nir Lipovetzky, Krista A. Ehinger</p>
<p>Abstract: The strong performance of large language models (LLMs) raises extensive discussion on their application to code generation. Recent research suggests continuous program refinements through visible tests to improve code generation accuracy in LLMs. However, these methods suffer from LLMs' inefficiency and limited reasoning capacity. In this work, we propose an LLM programming workflow (LPW) designed to improve both initial code generation and subsequent refinements within a structured two-phase workflow. Specifically, the solution generation phase formulates a solution plan, which is then verified through visible tests to specify the intended natural language solution. Subsequently, the code implementation phase drafts an initial code according to the solution plan and its verification. If the generated code fails the visible tests, the plan verification serves as the intended solution to consistently inform the refinement process for correcting bugs. Compared to state-of-the-art methods across various existing LLMs, LPW significantly improves the Pass@1 accuracy by up to 16.4% on well-established text-to-code generation benchmarks. LPW also sets new state-of-the-art Pass@1 accuracy, achieving 98.2% on HumanEval, 84.8% on MBPP, 59.3% on LiveCode, 62.6% on APPS, and 34.7% on CodeContest, using GPT-4o as the backbone.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate and consistent evaluation is crucial for decision-making across numerous fields, yet it remains a challenging task due to inherent subjectivity, variability, and scale. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With their ability to process diverse data types and provide scalable, cost-effective, and consistent assessments, LLMs present a compelling alternative to traditional expert-driven evaluations. However, ensuring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge that requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-as-a-Judge, addressing the core question: How can reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems be built? We explore strategies to enhance reliability, including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally, we propose methodologies for evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications, challenges, and future directions. This survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Liu, Jihai Zhang, Fangquan Lin, Cheng Yang, Min Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present massive inherent knowledge and superior semantic comprehension capability, which have revolutionized various tasks in natural language processing. Despite their success, a critical gap remains in enabling LLMs to perform knowledge graph completion (KGC). Empirical evidence suggests that LLMs consistently perform worse than conventional KGC approaches, even through sophisticated prompt design or tailored instruction-tuning. Fundamentally, applying LLMs on KGC introduces several critical challenges, including a vast set of entity candidates, hallucination issue of LLMs, and under-exploitation of the graph structure. To address these challenges, we propose a novel instruction-tuning-based method, namely FtG. Specifically, we present a \textit{filter-then-generate} paradigm and formulate the KGC task into a multiple-choice question format. In this way, we can harness the capability of LLMs while mitigating the issue casused by hallucinations. Moreover, we devise a flexible ego-graph serialization prompt and employ a structure-text adapter to couple structure and text information in a contextualized manner. Experimental results demonstrate that FtG achieves substantial performance gain compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract: In this paper we present our submission for the NorSID Shared Task as part of the 2025 VarDial Workshop (Scherrer et al., 2025), consisting of three tasks: Intent Detection, Slot Filling and Dialect Identification, evaluated using data in different dialects of the Norwegian language. For Intent Detection and Slot Filling, we have fine-tuned a multitask model in a cross-lingual setting, to leverage the xSID dataset available in 17 languages. In the case of Dialect Identification, our final submission consists of a model fine-tuned on the provided development set, which has obtained the highest scores within our experiments. Our final results on the test set show that our models do not drop in performance compared to the development set, likely due to the domain-specificity of the dataset and the similar distribution of both subsets. Finally, we also report an in-depth analysis of the provided datasets and their artifacts, as well as other sets of experiments that have been carried out but did not yield the best results. Additionally, we present an analysis on the reasons why some methods have been more successful than others; mainly the impact of the combination of languages and domain-specificity of the training data on the results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Qu, Yuhang Jiang, Boyuan Wang, Yixiu Mao, Cheems Wang, Chang Liu, Xiangyang Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) often encounters delayed and sparse feedback in real-world applications, even with only episodic rewards. Previous approaches have made some progress in reward redistribution for credit assignment but still face challenges, including training difficulties due to redundancy and ambiguous attributions stemming from overlooking the multifaceted nature of mission performance evaluation. Hopefully, Large Language Model (LLM) encompasses fruitful decision-making knowledge and provides a plausible tool for reward redistribution. Even so, deploying LLM in this case is non-trivial due to the misalignment between linguistic knowledge and the symbolic form requirement, together with inherent randomness and hallucinations in inference. To tackle these issues, we introduce LaRe, a novel LLM-empowered symbolic-based decision-making framework, to improve credit assignment. Key to LaRe is the concept of the Latent Reward, which works as a multi-dimensional performance evaluation, enabling more interpretable goal attainment from various perspectives and facilitating more effective reward redistribution. We examine that semantically generated code from LLM can bridge linguistic knowledge and symbolic latent rewards, as it is executable for symbolic objects. Meanwhile, we design latent reward self-verification to increase the stability and reliability of LLM inference. Theoretically, reward-irrelevant redundancy elimination in the latent reward benefits RL performance from more accurate reward estimation. Extensive experimental results witness that LaRe (i) achieves superior temporal credit assignment to SOTA methods, (ii) excels in allocating contributions among multiple agents, and (iii) outperforms policies trained with ground truth rewards for certain tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhifeng Jiang, Zhihua Jin, Guoliang He</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in applications where system prompts, which guide model outputs, play a crucial role. These prompts often contain business logic and sensitive information, making their protection essential. However, adversarial and even regular user queries can exploit LLM vulnerabilities to expose these hidden prompts. To address this issue, we propose PromptKeeper, a robust defense mechanism designed to safeguard system prompts. PromptKeeper tackles two core challenges: reliably detecting prompt leakage and mitigating side-channel vulnerabilities when leakage occurs. By framing detection as a hypothesis-testing problem, PromptKeeper effectively identifies both explicit and subtle leakage. Upon detection, it regenerates responses using a dummy prompt, ensuring that outputs remain indistinguishable from typical interactions when no leakage is present. PromptKeeper ensures robust protection against prompt extraction attacks via either adversarial or regular queries, while preserving conversational capability and runtime efficiency during benign user interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Xiong, Nan Yin, Shiyang Liang, Haoyang Li, Yingxu Wang, Duo Ai, Fang Pan, Jingjie Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Inferencing Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) from gene expression data is a pivotal challenge in systems biology, and several innovative computational methods have been introduced. However, most of these studies have not considered the skewed degree distribution of genes. Specifically, some genes may regulate multiple target genes while some genes may be regulated by multiple regulator genes. Such a skewed degree distribution issue significantly complicates the application of directed graph embedding methods. To tackle this issue, we propose the Cross-Attention Complex Dual Graph Embedding Model (XATGRN). Our XATGRN employs a cross-attention mechanism to effectively capture intricate gene interactions from gene expression profiles. Additionally, it uses a Dual Complex Graph Embedding approach to manage the skewed degree distribution, thereby ensuring precise prediction of regulatory relationships and their directionality. Our model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various datasets, underscoring its efficacy in elucidating complex gene regulatory mechanisms.

<p>Abstract: As large-scale language models increasingly impact safety-critical domains, ensuring their reliable adherence to well-defined principles remains a fundamental challenge. We introduce Deliberative Alignment, a new paradigm that directly teaches the model safety specifications and trains it to explicitly recall and accurately reason over the specifications before answering. We used this approach to align OpenAI's o-series models, and achieved highly precise adherence to OpenAI's safety policies, without requiring human-written chain-of-thoughts or answers. Deliberative Alignment pushes the Pareto frontier by simultaneously increasing robustness to jailbreaks while decreasing overrefusal rates, and also improves out-of-distribution generalization. We demonstrate that reasoning over explicitly specified policies enables more scalable, trustworthy, and interpretable alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taneesh Gupta, Rahul Madhavan, Xuchao Zhang, Chetan Bansal, Saravan Rajmohan</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce REFA, a family of reference-free alignment methods that optimize over multiple user preferences while enforcing fine-grained length control. Our approach integrates deviation-based weighting to emphasize high-quality responses more strongly, length normalization to prevent trivial short-response solutions, and an EOS-probability regularizer to mitigate dataset-induced brevity biases. Theoretically, we show that under the Uncertainty Reduction with Sequence Length Assertion (URSLA), naive length normalization can still incentivize length-based shortcuts. By contrast, REFA corrects these subtle incentives, guiding models toward genuinely more informative and higher-quality outputs. Empirically, REFA sets a new state-of-the-art among reference-free alignment methods, producing richer responses aligned more closely with human preferences. Compared to a base supervised fine-tuned (SFT) mistral-7b model that achieves 8.4% length-controlled win rate (LC-WR) and 6.2% win rate (WR), our best REFA configuration attains 21.62% LC-WR and 19.87% WR on the AlpacaEval v2 benchmark. This represents a substantial improvement over both the strongest multi-preference baseline, InfoNCA (16.82% LC-WR, 10.44% WR), and the strongest reference-free baseline, SimPO (20.01% LC-WR, 17.65% WR)</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural networks are widely regarded as black-box models, creating significant challenges in understanding their inner workings, especially in natural language processing (NLP) applications. To address this opacity, model explanation techniques like Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) have emerged as essential tools for providing insights into the behavior of these complex systems. This study leverages LIME to interpret a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network trained on a text classification task. By analyzing the contribution of individual features to model predictions, the LIME approach enhances interpretability and supports informed decision-making. Despite its effectiveness in offering localized explanations, LIME has limitations in capturing global patterns and feature interactions. This research highlights the strengths and shortcomings of LIME and proposes directions for future work to achieve more comprehensive interpretability in neural NLP models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Significant progress has been made in automated problem-solving using societies of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). In finance, efforts have largely focused on single-agent systems handling specific tasks or multi-agent frameworks independently gathering data. However, multi-agent systems' potential to replicate real-world trading firms' collaborative dynamics remains underexplored. TradingAgents proposes a novel stock trading framework inspired by trading firms, featuring LLM-powered agents in specialized roles such as fundamental analysts, sentiment analysts, technical analysts, and traders with varied risk profiles. The framework includes Bull and Bear researcher agents assessing market conditions, a risk management team monitoring exposure, and traders synthesizing insights from debates and historical data to make informed decisions. By simulating a dynamic, collaborative trading environment, this framework aims to improve trading performance. Detailed architecture and extensive experiments reveal its superiority over baseline models, with notable improvements in cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, highlighting the potential of multi-agent LLM frameworks in financial trading.

This paper presents Drift2Matrix, a novel framework that leverages kernel-induced self-representation for adaptive responses to concept drift in time series. Drift2Matrix employs a kernel-based learning mechanism to generate a representation matrix, encapsulating the inherent dynamics of co-evolving time series. This matrix serves as a key tool for identification and adaptation to concept drift by observing its temporal variations. Furthermore, Drift2Matrix effectively identifies prevailing patterns and offers insights into emerging trends through pattern evolution analysis. Our empirical evaluation of Drift2Matrix across various datasets demonstrates its effectiveness in handling the complexities of concept drift. This approach introduces a novel perspective in the theoretical domain of co-evolving time series analysis, enhancing adaptability and accuracy in the face of dynamic data environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinkai Wang, Xiaohui Chen, Liping Liu, Soha Hassoun</p>
<p>Abstract: The annotation (assigning structural chemical identities) of MS/MS spectra remains a significant challenge due to the enormous molecular diversity in biological samples and the limited scope of reference databases. Currently, the vast majority of spectral measurements remain in the "dark chemical space" without structural annotations. To improve annotation, we propose MADGEN (Mass-spec Attends to De Novo Molecular GENeration), a scaffold-based method for de novo molecular structure generation guided by mass spectrometry data. MADGEN operates in two stages: scaffold retrieval and spectra-conditioned molecular generation starting with the scaffold. In the first stage, given an MS/MS spectrum, we formulate scaffold retrieval as a ranking problem and employ contrastive learning to align mass spectra with candidate molecular scaffolds. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, we employ the MS/MS spectrum to guide an attention-based generative model to generate the final molecule. Our approach constrains the molecular generation search space, reducing its complexity and improving generation accuracy. We evaluate MADGEN on three datasets (NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym) and evaluate MADGEN's performance with a predictive scaffold retriever and with an oracle retriever. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using attention to integrate spectral information throughout the generation process to achieve strong results with the oracle retriever.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01973">INFELM: In-depth Fairness Evaluation of Large Text-To-Image Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Jin, Xing Liu, Yu Liu, Jia Qing Yap, Andrea Wong, Adriana Crespo, Qi Lin, Zhiyuan Yin, Qiang Yan, Ryan Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) and large vision models (LVMs) have propelled the evolution of multi-modal AI systems, which have demonstrated the remarkable potential for industrial applications by emulating human-like cognition. However, they also pose significant ethical challenges, including amplifying harmful content and reinforcing societal biases. For instance, biases in some industrial image generation models highlighted the urgent need for robust fairness assessments. Most existing evaluation frameworks focus on the comprehensiveness of various aspects of the models, but they exhibit critical limitations, including insufficient attention to content generation alignment and social bias-sensitive domains. More importantly, their reliance on pixel-detection techniques is prone to inaccuracies.
  To address these issues, this paper presents INFELM, an in-depth fairness evaluation on widely-used text-to-image models. Our key contributions are: (1) an advanced skintone classifier incorporating facial topology and refined skin pixel representation to enhance classification precision by at least 16.04%, (2) a bias-sensitive content alignment measurement for understanding societal impacts, (3) a generalizable representation bias evaluation for diverse demographic groups, and (4) extensive experiments analyzing large-scale text-to-image model outputs across six social-bias-sensitive domains. We find that existing models in the study generally do not meet the empirical fairness criteria, and representation bias is generally more pronounced than alignment errors. INFELM establishes a robust benchmark for fairness assessment, supporting the development of multi-modal AI systems that align with ethical and human-centric principles.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02132">A hybrid marketplace of ideas</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomer Jordi Chaffer, Dontrail Cotlage, Justin Goldston</p>
<p>Abstract: The convergence of humans and artificial intelligence systems introduces new dynamics into the cultural and intellectual landscape. Complementing emerging cultural evolution concepts such as machine culture, AI agents represent a significant techno-sociological development, particularly within the anthropological study of Web3 as a community focused on decentralization through blockchain. Despite their growing presence, the cultural significance of AI agents remains largely unexplored in academic literature. Toward this end, we conceived hybrid netnography, a novel interdisciplinary approach that examines the cultural and intellectual dynamics within digital ecosystems by analyzing the interactions and contributions of both human and AI agents as co-participants in shaping narratives, ideas, and cultural artifacts. We argue that, within the Web3 community on the social media platform X, these agents challenge traditional notions of participation and influence in public discourse, creating a hybrid marketplace of ideas, a conceptual space where human and AI generated ideas coexist and compete for attention. We examine the current state of AI agents in idea generation, propagation, and engagement, positioning their role as cultural agents through the lens of memetics and encouraging further inquiry into their cultural and societal impact. Additionally, we address the implications of this paradigm for privacy, intellectual property, and governance, highlighting the societal and legal challenges of integrating AI agents into the hybrid marketplace of ideas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Restrepo, Chenwei Wu, Yueran Jia, Jaden K. Sun, Jack Gallifant, Catherine G. Bielick, Yugang Jia, Leo A. Celi</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate imputation of missing laboratory values in electronic health records (EHRs) is critical to enable robust clinical predictions and reduce biases in AI systems in healthcare. Existing methods, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and decision tree-based approaches such as XGBoost, struggle to model the complex temporal and contextual dependencies in EHR data, mainly in underrepresented groups. In this work, we propose Lab-MAE, a novel transformer-based masked autoencoder framework that leverages self-supervised learning for the imputation of continuous sequential lab values. Lab-MAE introduces a structured encoding scheme that jointly models laboratory test values and their corresponding timestamps, enabling explicit capturing temporal dependencies. Empirical evaluation on the MIMIC-IV dataset demonstrates that Lab-MAE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines such as XGBoost across multiple metrics, including root mean square error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), and Wasserstein distance (WD). Notably, Lab-MAE achieves equitable performance across demographic groups of patients, advancing fairness in clinical predictions. We further investigate the role of follow-up laboratory values as potential shortcut features, revealing Lab-MAE's robustness in scenarios where such data is unavailable. The findings suggest that our transformer-based architecture, adapted to the characteristics of the EHR data, offers a foundation model for more accurate and fair clinical imputation models. In addition, we measure and compare the carbon footprint of Lab-MAE with the baseline XGBoost model, highlighting its environmental requirements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valery Istomin, Oleg Pereziabov, Ilya Afanasyev</p>
<p>Abstract: This research focuses on developing a method for restoring the topology of digital images of paper documents captured by a camera, using algorithms for detection, segmentation, geometry restoration, and dewarping. Our methodology employs deep learning (DL) for document outline detection, followed by computer vision (CV) to create a topological 2D grid using cubic polynomial interpolation and correct nonlinear distortions by remapping the image. Using classical CV methods makes the document topology restoration process more efficient and faster, as it requires significantly fewer computational resources and memory. We developed a new pipeline for automatic document dewarping and reconstruction, along with a framework and annotated dataset to demonstrate its efficiency. Our experiments confirm the promise of our methodology and its superiority over existing benchmarks (including mobile apps and popular DL solutions, such as RectiNet, DocGeoNet, and DocTr++) both visually and in terms of document readability via Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and geometry restoration metrics. This paves the way for creating high-quality digital copies of paper documents and enhancing the efficiency of OCR systems. Project page: https://github.com/HorizonParadox/DRCCBI</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03847">Diffusion as Shader: 3D-aware Video Diffusion for Versatile Video Generation Control</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekai Gu, Rui Yan, Jiahao Lu, Peng Li, Zhiyang Dou, Chenyang Si, Zhen Dong, Qifeng Liu, Cheng Lin, Ziwei Liu, Wenping Wang, Yuan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating high-quality videos from text prompts or images. However, precise control over the video generation process, such as camera manipulation or content editing, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods for controlled video generation are typically limited to a single control type, lacking the flexibility to handle diverse control demands. In this paper, we introduce Diffusion as Shader (DaS), a novel approach that supports multiple video control tasks within a unified architecture. Our key insight is that achieving versatile video control necessitates leveraging 3D control signals, as videos are fundamentally 2D renderings of dynamic 3D content. Unlike prior methods limited to 2D control signals, DaS leverages 3D tracking videos as control inputs, making the video diffusion process inherently 3D-aware. This innovation allows DaS to achieve a wide range of video controls by simply manipulating the 3D tracking videos. A further advantage of using 3D tracking videos is their ability to effectively link frames, significantly enhancing the temporal consistency of the generated videos. With just 3 days of fine-tuning on 8 H800 GPUs using less than 10k videos, DaS demonstrates strong control capabilities across diverse tasks, including mesh-to-video generation, camera control, motion transfer, and object manipulation.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04070">More is not always better? Enhancing Many-Shot In-Context Learning with Differentiated and Reweighting Objectives</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoqing Zhang, Ang Lv, Yuhan Liu, Flood Sung, Wei Liu, Shuo Shang, Xiuying Chen, Rui Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at few-shot in-context learning (ICL) without requiring parameter updates. However, as the number of ICL demonstrations increases from a few to many, performance tends to plateau and eventually decline. We identify two primary causes for this trend: the suboptimal negative log-likelihood (NLL) optimization objective and the incremental data noise. To address these issues, we introduce DrICL, a novel optimization method that enhances model performance through Differentiated Learning and advantage-based Reweighting objectives. Globally, DrICL utilizes differentiated learning to optimize the NLL objective, ensuring that many-shot performance surpasses zero-shot levels. Locally, it dynamically adjusts the weighting of many-shot demonstrations by leveraging cumulative advantages inspired by reinforcement learning, thereby improving generalization. This approach allows the model to handle varying numbers of shots effectively, mitigating the impact of noisy data. Recognizing the lack of multi-task datasets with diverse many-shot distributions, we develop the Many-Shot ICL Benchmark (ICL-50)-a large-scale benchmark of 50 tasks that cover shot numbers from 1 to 350 within sequences of up to 8,000 tokens-for fine-tuning purposes. ICL-50 facilitates the evaluation of many-shot ICL strategies across seven prominent NLP tasks and 50 distinct datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs enhanced with DrICL achieve significant improvements in many-shot setups across various tasks, including both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. We release the code and benchmark dataset hoping to facilitate further research in many-shot ICL.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04228">Constraints as Rewards: Reinforcement Learning for Robots without Reward Functions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Ishihara, Noriaki Takasugi, Kotaro Kawakami, Masaya Kinoshita, Kazumi Aoyama</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become an essential algorithm for generating complex robotic behaviors. However, to learn such behaviors, it is necessary to design a reward function that describes the task, which often consists of multiple objectives that needs to be balanced. This tuning process is known as reward engineering and typically involves extensive trial-and-error. In this paper, to avoid this trial-and-error process, we propose the concept of Constraints as Rewards (CaR). CaR formulates the task objective using multiple constraint functions instead of a reward function and solves a reinforcement learning problem with constraints using the Lagrangian-method. By adopting this approach, different objectives are automatically balanced, because Lagrange multipliers serves as the weights among the objectives. In addition, we will demonstrate that constraints, expressed as inequalities, provide an intuitive interpretation of the optimization target designed for the task. We apply the proposed method to the standing-up motion generation task of a six-wheeled-telescopic-legged robot and demonstrate that the proposed method successfully acquires the target behavior, even though it is challenging to learn with manually designed reward functions.</p>
