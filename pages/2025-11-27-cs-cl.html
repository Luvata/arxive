<p><b>Authors:</b> Hen-Hsen Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable, but the most celebrated efficiency methods -- mixture-of-experts (MoE), speculative decoding, and complex retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- were built for hyperscale providers with vast infrastructure and elite teams. Outside that context, their benefits collapse into overhead, fragility, and wasted carbon. The result is that a handful of Big Tech companies benefit, while thousands of hospitals, schools, governments, and enterprises are left without viable options. We argue that the next frontier is not greater sophistication at scale, but robust simplicity: efficiency that thrives under modest resources and minimal expertise. We propose a new research agenda: retrofitting pretrained models with more efficient architectures without retraining, inventing lightweight fine-tuning that preserves alignment, making reasoning economical despite long chains of thought, enabling dynamic knowledge management without heavy RAG pipelines, and adopting Overhead-Aware Efficiency (OAE) as a standard benchmark. By redefining efficiency to include adoption cost, sustainability, and fairness, we can democratize LLM deployment -- ensuring that optimization reduces inequality and carbon waste rather than amplifying them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tcharlies Schmitz</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the Harmonic Token Projection (HTP), a reversible and deterministic framework for generating text embeddings without training, vocabularies, or stochastic parameters. Unlike neural embeddings that rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, HTP encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space. The harmonic formulation provides phase-coherent projections that preserve both structure and reversibility, enabling semantic similarity estimation from purely geometric alignment. Experimental evaluation on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) and its multilingual extension shows that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.68 in English, maintaining stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair. This demonstrates that meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings. Keywords: Harmonic Token Projection, reversible embedding, deterministic encoding, semantic similarity, multilingual representation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hossein Mohanna, Ali Ait-Bachir</p>
<p>Abstract: Text classification with hierarchical taxonomies is a fundamental requirement in IT Service Management (ITSM) systems, where support tickets must be categorized into tree-structured taxonomies. We present a dual-embedding centroid-based classification framework that maintains separate semantic and lexical centroid representations per category, combining them through reciprocal rank fusion at inference time. The framework achieves performance competitive with Support Vector Machines (hierarchical F1: 0.731 vs 0.727) while providing interpretability through centroid representations. Evaluated on 8,968 ITSM tickets across 123 categories, this method achieves 5.9 times faster training and up to 152 times faster incremental updates. With 8.6-8.8 times speedup across batch sizes (100-1000 samples) when excluding embedding computation. These results make the method suitable for production ITSM environments prioritizing interpretability and operational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongfu Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward models are crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences but face two representative challenges. First, traditional discriminative reward models usually concatenate questions and responses directly as input, resulting in low data efficiency. Second, reward models are vulnerable to reward overoptimization. We propose PIRA, a training paradigm addressing these issues through three strategies: (1) Reformulating question-answer pairs into preference-based instructions for clearer and more explicit task specification, (2) aggregating rewards from diverse preference tasks to reduce bias and improve robustness, and (3) averaging value-head outputs under varying dropout rates to stabilize rewards. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of PIRA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mann Khatri, Mirza Yusuf, Rajiv Ratn Shah, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets from the web, exhibit remarkable general reasoning skills. Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saad Mankarious, Ayah Zirikly, Daniel Wiechmann, Elma Kerz, Edward Kempa, Yu Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media data has become a vital resource for studying mental health, offering real-time insights into thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that traditional methods often miss. Progress in this area has been facilitated by benchmark datasets for mental health analysis; however, most existing benchmarks have become outdated due to limited data availability, inadequate cleaning, and the inherently diverse nature of social media content (e.g., multilingual and harmful material). We present a new benchmark dataset, \textbf{MindSET}, curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses to address these limitations. The annotated dataset contains over \textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection. Overall, MindSET provides a robust foundation for researchers exploring the intersection of social media and mental health, supporting both early risk detection and deeper analysis of emerging psychological trends.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Hui, Xiaokai Wei, Reza Shirkavand, Chen Wang, Weizhi Zhang, Alejandro Pel\'aez, Michelle Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm that unifies retrieval and generation, representing items as discrete semantic tokens and enabling flexible sequence modeling with autoregressive models. Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines. FlexCode provides a new mechanism for token representation in generative recommenders, achieving stronger accuracy and tail robustness, and offering a new perspective on balancing memorization and generalization in token-based recommendation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saleh Almohaimeed, May Alsofyani, Saad Almohaimeed, Mansour Al Ghanim, Liqiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the task of cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL has received significant attention. Enables users with no prior knowledge of SQL to have a conversation with databases using natural language. However, most of the available datasets and research have been conducted in English, along with some work in Chinese. To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach named GAT corrector, which enhanced the performance across all 40 experiments, yielding an average improvement of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and an average increase of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings. Finally, we conducted an ablation study with two more experiments to explain why the GAT corrector outperformed the previous GAT verifier technique, particularly for the Arabic language.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite high performance on clinical benchmarks, large language models may reach correct conclusions through faulty reasoning, a failure mode with safety implications for oncology decision support that is not captured by accuracy-based evaluation. In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes. These findings show that large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed. The taxonomy provides a generalizable framework for evaluating and improving reasoning fidelity before clinical deployment.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20683">Dynamic Template Selection for Output Token Generation Optimization: MLP-Based and Transformer Approaches</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bharadwaj Yadavalli</p>
<p>Abstract: Contemporary large language model deployments typically employ uniform prompting strategies across diverse query types, applying verbose response patterns to both complex analytical tasks and straightforward factual questions. This one-size-fits-all methodology leads to substantial token inefficiency, a concern amplified by the significant cost differential between input and output tokens--the latter commanding 4-8x higher prices across major providers. We present Dynamic Template Selection (DTS), which adaptively matches response templates to query complexity, achieving significant cost reductions without compromising response quality.
  We compared two routing approaches: a simple MLP that uses pre-computed embeddings and a more complex fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer. Through comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 MMLU questions, we find that the MLP router achieves 90.5% routing accuracy on held-out test data, marginally exceeding RoBERTa's performance (89.5%) despite utilizing 125M fewer parameters. Notably, our empirical analysis reveals provider-agnostic behavior in template selection--routing decisions generalize effectively across 3 major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude), as validated through 9,000 production API calls. While routing accuracy remains consistent at 90.5% across providers, observed token reductions vary from 32.6% to 33.9%, reflecting provider-specific generation characteristics.
  This work contributes several key elements: formal problem formulation with theoretical grounding in machine learning, four algorithms with corresponding complexity analyses, and extensive empirical validation across production systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trung Cuong Dang, David Mohaisen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models, trained on massive corpora, are prone to verbatim memorization of training data, creating significant privacy and copyright risks. While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths. Through experiments on open-source and aligned chat models, we demonstrate that our multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data, providing a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque, posing a significant challenge to their safe and reliable deployment. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for decomposing LLM representations into more interpretable features, but explaining the features captured by SAEs remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose SAGE (SAE AGentic Explainer), an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanation-driven process. SAGE implements a rigorous methodology by systematically formulating multiple explanations for each feature, designing targeted experiments to test them, and iteratively refining explanations based on empirical activation feedback. Experiments on features from SAEs of diverse language models demonstrate that SAGE produces explanations with significantly higher generative and predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanationdriven process.

<p>Abstract: As language models (LMs) are increasingly adopted across domains, high-quality benchmarking frameworks that accurately estimate performance are essential for guiding deployment decisions. While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller {\Delta} across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong Dong, Weijie Su</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new tokenizer for language models that minimizes the average tokens per character, thereby reducing the number of tokens needed to represent text during training and to generate text during inference. Our method, which we refer to as the Length-MAX tokenizer, obtains its vocabulary by casting a length-weighted objective maximization as a graph partitioning problem and developing a greedy approximation algorithm. On FineWeb and diverse domains, it yields 14--18\% fewer tokens than Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) across vocabulary sizes from 10K to 50K, and the reduction is 13.0\% when the size is 64K. Training GPT-2 models at 124M, 355M, and 1.3B parameters from scratch with five runs each shows 18.5\%, 17.2\%, and 18.5\% fewer steps, respectively, to reach a fixed validation loss, and 13.7\%, 12.7\%, and 13.7\% lower inference latency, together with a 16\% throughput gain at 124M, while consistently improving on downstream tasks including reducing LAMBADA perplexity by 11.7\% and enhancing HellaSwag accuracy by 4.3\%. Moreover, the Length-MAX tokenizer achieves 99.62\% vocabulary coverage and the out-of-vocabulary rate remains low at 0.12\% on test sets. These results demonstrate that optimizing for average token length, rather than frequency alone, offers an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing -- and often improving -- downstream performance. The tokenizer is compatible with production systems and reduces embedding and KV-cache memory by 18\% at inference.</p>

This makes memory a critical component, yet its management and evolution remain largely underexplored. Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction. We unify and implement over ten representative memory modules and evaluate them across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning and QA datasets. To better benchmark experience reuse, we provide a baseline method, ExpRAG, for retrieving and utilizing prior experience, and further propose ReMem, an action-think-memory refine pipeline that tightly integrates reasoning, task actions, and memory updates to achieve continual improvement.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20872">Winning with Less for Low Resource Languages: Advantage of Cross-Lingual English_Persian Argument Mining Model over LLM Augmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Jahan, Masood Ghayoomi, Annette Hautli-Janisz</p>
<p>Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of natural language processing to identify and extract the argument components, like premises and conclusions, within a text and to recognize the relations between them. It reveals the logical structure of texts to be used in tasks like knowledge extraction. This paper aims at utilizing a cross-lingual approach to argument mining for low-resource languages, by constructing three training scenarios. We examine the models on English, as a high-resource language, and Persian, as a low-resource language. To this end, we evaluate the models based on the English Microtext corpus \citep{PeldszusStede2015}, and its parallel Persian translation. The learning scenarios are as follow: (i) zero-shot transfer, where the model is trained solely with the English data, (ii) English-only training enhanced by synthetic examples generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) a cross-lingual model that combines the original English data with manually translated Persian sentences. The zero-shot transfer model attains F1 scores of 50.2\% on the English test set and 50.7\% on the Persian test set. LLM-based augmentation model improves the performance up to 59.2\% on English and 69.3\% on Persian. The cross-lingual model, trained on both languages but evaluated solely on the Persian test set, surpasses the LLM-based variant, by achieving a F1 of 74.8\%. Results indicate that a lightweight cross-lingual blend can outperform considerably the more resource-intensive augmentation pipelines, and it offers a practical pathway for the argument mining task to overcome data resource shortage on low-resource languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nura Aljaafari, Danilo S. Carvalho, Andr\'e Freitas</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite displaying semantic competence, large language models' internal mechanisms that ground abstract semantic structure remain insufficiently characterised. We propose a method integrating role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison to study how LLMs implement semantic roles. Our analysis uncovers: (i) highly concentrated circuits (89-94% attribution within 28 nodes); (ii) gradual structural refinement rather than phase transitions, with larger models sometimes bypassing localised circuits; and (iii) moderate cross-scale conservation (24-59% component overlap) alongside high spectral similarity. These findings suggest that LLMs form compact, causally isolated mechanisms for abstract semantic structure, and these mechanisms exhibit partial transfer across scales and architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reham Omar, Abdelghny Orogat, Ibrahim Abdelaziz, Omij Mangukiya, Panos Kalnis, Essam Mansour</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) combines the factual grounding of KG-based QA with the interactive nature of dialogue systems. KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ioana Buhnila, Aman Sinha, Mathieu Constant</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven efficient in giving definition-type answers to user input queries. While for humans giving various types of answers, such as examples and paraphrases, is an easy task, LLMs struggle to provide correct answers for other than definition-type queries. In this study, we evaluated this drop in performance using TrackList, a fine-grained linguistic and statistical analysis pipeline to investigate the impact of the pre-training data on LLMs answers to diverse linguistic queries. We also introduce RefoMed-EN, an English dataset consisting of 6170 human-annotated medical terms alongside their corresponding definitions, denominations, exemplifications, explanations, or paraphrases. We studied whether the high frequency of a concept (head) or low frequency (tail) impacts the language model's performance. We evaluated the quality of the LLM's output using syntactic and semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations and embeddings. Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest. Additionally, we showed that for definition-type questions, large language models are prone to paraphrase more on popular and frequent knowledge and less on tail and technical knowledge, especially in the expert texts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar (Boston University)</p>
<p>Abstract: Can in-context learning (ICL) override pre-trained label semantics, or does it merely refine an existing semantic backbone? We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21066">Context-Aware Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting for Sarcasm Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Iskandardinata, William Christian, Derwin Suhartono</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting sarcasm remains a challenging task in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) despite recent advances in neural network approaches. Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection. However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs. Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis. Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text. Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy. We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD. Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method. Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD. These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thura Aung, Eaint Kay Khaing Kyaw, Ye Kyaw Thu, Thazin Myint Oo, Thepchai Supnithi</p>
<p>Abstract: In low-resource languages like Burmese, classification tasks often fine-tune only the final classification layer, keeping pre-trained encoder weights frozen. While Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are commonly used, their fixed non-linearity can limit expressiveness and increase computational cost. This work explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as alternative classification heads, evaluating Fourier-based FourierKAN, Spline-based EfficientKAN, and Grid-based FasterKAN-across diverse embeddings including TF-IDF, fastText, and multilingual transformers (mBERT, Distil-mBERT). Experimental results show that KAN-based heads are competitive with or superior to MLPs. EfficientKAN with fastText achieved the highest F1-score (0.928), while FasterKAN offered the best trade-off between speed and accuracy. On transformer embeddings, EfficientKAN matched or slightly outperformed MLPs with mBERT (0.917 F1). These findings highlight KANs as expressive, efficient alternatives to MLPs for low-resource language classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bryan E. Tuck, Rakesh M. Verma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models must satisfy hard orthographic constraints during controlled text generation, yet systematic cross-architecture evaluation remains limited. We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade. These patterns are inconsistent with uniform compute benefits. Using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle, we establish modest but consistent calibration (r=0.24-0.38) across all families, yet identify systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography ("data", "poop", "loll": 86-95% human success, 89-96% model miss rate). These failures reveal over-reliance on distributional plausibility that penalizes orthographically atypical but constraint-valid patterns, suggesting architectural innovations may be required beyond simply scaling parameters or computational budgets.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates sequence-to-sequence Transformer models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) error correction in low-resource Burmese, focusing on different feature integration strategies including IPA and alignment information. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing ASR error correction specifically for Burmese. We evaluate five ASR backbones and show that our ASR Error Correction (AEC) approaches consistently improve word- and character-level accuracy over baseline outputs. The proposed AEC model, combining IPA and alignment features, reduced the average WER of ASR models from 51.56 to 39.82 before augmentation (and 51.56 to 43.59 after augmentation) and improving chrF++ scores from 0.5864 to 0.627, demonstrating consistent gains over the baseline ASR outputs without AEC. Our results highlight the robustness of AEC and the importance of feature design for improving ASR outputs in low-resource settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manish Jain, Satheesh Kumar Ponnambalam, Salman Faroz, Chandrakanth Lns, Vinay Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across general domains, yet their application to specialized sectors such as mortgage finance requires domain-specific knowledge augmentation while preserving instruction-following fidelity. We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Wang, Yanxu Zhu, Dongyuan Lu, Jitao Sang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steven Wang, Kyle Hunt, Shaojie Tang, Kenneth Joseph</p>
<p>Abstract: There is ongoing debate about whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as substitutes for human participants in survey and experimental research. While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the development of the first open conversational speech dataset for the Isan language, the most widely spoken regional dialect in Thailand. Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing. By releasing this dataset as an open resource, we aim to contribute to inclusive AI development, support research on underrepresented languages, and provide a basis for addressing the linguistic and technical challenges inherent in modeling conversational speech.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the state-of-the-art performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) achieved on many tasks, their massive scale often leads to high computational and environmental costs, limiting their accessibility. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by reducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong downstream performance. Despite the increased development in PEFT methods, current evaluations remain limited (in terms of evaluated models and datasets) and difficult to reproduce. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEFT-Bench, a unified end-to-end benchmark for evaluating diverse PEFT methods on autoregressive LLMs. We demonstrate its usage across 27 NLP datasets and 6 PEFT methods. To account for different PEFT training and inference factors, we also introduce the PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) metric, which takes trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory usage into account.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Kugler</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of Martin's Law - the empirical relationship between word frequency and polysemy - in text generated by neural language models during training. Using DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings as an operationalization of word senses, we analyze four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints. Our results reveal a non-monotonic developmental trajectory: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, reaches peak correlation (r > 0.6) at checkpoint 104, then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models (70M, 160M) experience catastrophic semantic collapse at late checkpoints, while larger models (410M, 1B) show graceful degradation. The frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r $\approx$ -0.3) across all models. These findings suggest that compliance with linguistic regularities in LLM-generated text is not monotonically increasing with training, but instead follows a balanced trajectory with an optimal semantic window. This work establishes a novel methodology for evaluating emergent linguistic structure in neural language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Fonseca Rivera</p>
<p>Abstract: Lindsey (2025) investigates introspective awareness in language models through four experiments, finding that models can sometimes detect and identify injected activation patterns -- but unreliably (~20% success in the best model). We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected "thoughts" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at {\alpha}=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting "thoughts" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether "training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences." We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anton\'in Jarol\'im, Martin Faj\v{c}\'ik, Lucia Makaiov\'a</p>
<p>Abstract: Misinformation frequently spreads in user comments under online news articles, highlighting the need for effective methods to detect factually incorrect information. To strongly support or refute claims extracted from such comments, it is necessary to identify relevant documents and pinpoint the exact text spans that justify or contradict each claim. This paper focuses on the latter task -- fine-grained evidence extraction for Czech and Slovak claims. We create new dataset, containing two-way annotated fine-grained evidence created by paid annotators. We evaluate large language models (LLMs) on this dataset to assess their alignment with human annotations. The results reveal that LLMs often fail to copy evidence verbatim from the source text, leading to invalid outputs. Error-rate analysis shows that the {llama3.1:8b model achieves a high proportion of correct outputs despite its relatively small size, while the gpt-oss-120b model underperforms despite having many more parameters. Furthermore, the models qwen3:14b, deepseek-r1:32b, and gpt-oss:20b demonstrate an effective balance between model size and alignment with human annotations.</p>

However, when applied to complex enterprise databases, such methods struggle to maintain coherent reasoning due to limited context capacity, unreliable schema linking, and weak grounding in database semantics. To overcome these issues, we introduce DSR-SQL, a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tate \textbf{R}easoning framework that models Text-to-SQL as an interaction between an adaptive context state and a progressive generation state. The first constructs a compact, semantically faithful environment by refining large schemas and selecting relevant structures, while the second formalizes SQL synthesis as feedback-guided state transitions, enabling the model to self-correct and align with user intent. Without any post-training or in-context examples, DSR-SQL achieves competitive performance, reaching 35.28\% execution accuracy on Spider 2.0-Snow and 68.32\% on BIRD development set. Our implementation will be open-sourced at: https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group/DSR-SQL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaifeng Hong, Yinglong Zhang, Xiaoying Hong, Xuewen Xia, Xing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-attributed graphs require models to effectively combine strong textual understanding with structurally informed reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration. The source code of this model has been released at https://github.com/hongkaifeng/Odin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> O\u{g}uz Ka\u{g}an Hitit, Leander Girrbach, Zeynep Akata</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned checkpoints into a single model without additional training, offering an attractive approach to reusing models and efficiently improving performance. However, it remains unclear whether the advantages reported for smaller models and classifiers generalize to LLMs. We present a large-scale, systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art merging methods, including recent subspace methods, across four open-weight LLMs, twelve fine-tuned checkpoints per base model, and sixteen standard LLM benchmarks. Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops. Our findings indicate that current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs. This motivates the design of LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods. Code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yurui Zheng, Yijun Chen, Shaohong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Readability assessment aims to evaluate the reading difficulty of a text. In recent years, while deep learning technology has been gradually applied to readability assessment, most approaches fail to consider either the length of the text or the ordinal relationship of readability labels. This paper proposes a bidirectional readability assessment mechanism that captures contextual information to identify regions with rich semantic information in the text, thereby predicting the readability level of individual sentences. These sentence-level labels are then used to assist in predicting the overall readability level of the document. Additionally, a pairwise sorting algorithm is introduced to model the ordinal relationship between readability levels through label subtraction. Experimental results on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance and outperforms other baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lina Conti, Dennis Fucci, Marco Gaido, Matteo Negri, Guillaume Wisniewski, Luisa Bentivogli</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlike text, speech conveys information about the speaker, such as gender, through acoustic cues like pitch. This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bangla Sign Language Translation (BdSLT) has been severely constrained so far as the language itself is very low resource. Standard sentence level dataset creation for BdSLT is of immense importance for developing AI based assistive tools for deaf and hard of hearing people of Bangla speaking community. In this paper, we present a dataset, IsharaKhobor , and two subset of it for enabling research. We also present the challenges towards developing the dataset and present some way forward by benchmarking with landmark based raw and RQE embedding. We do some ablation on vocabulary restriction and canonicalization of the same within the dataset, which resulted in two more datasets, IsharaKhobor_small and IsharaKhobor_canonical_small. The dataset is publicly available at: www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasanssl/isharakhobor [1].</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minjoon Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit inconsistent behavior when answering paraphrased questions, suggesting a reliance on surface-level patterns rather than true semantic understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce RoParQ, a benchmark specifically constructed to evaluate cross-paraphrase consistency in closed-book multiple-choice QA. This benchmark is derived from standard datasets by generating paraphrases via proprietary models and selectively retaining examples that elicit inconsistent confidence from a judge model. We further propose XParaCon, a novel evaluation metric that quantifies a model's robustness by measuring the standard deviation of accuracies across question variants. Additionally, we implement a reasoning-based, paraphrase-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategy designed to align models toward semantic invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted alignment significantly enhances robustness. Notably, fine-tuned lightweight models achieved consistency levels comparable to much larger pre-trained models. These results highlight the efficacy of our approach in mitigating superficial memorization and fostering more robust, reliable LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixiu Zhao, Xiaozhi Wang, Zijun Yao, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. In this paper, we introduce a simple, lightweight, and broadly applicable method with a focus on isolating neurons that encode specific skills. Building upon prior work that identified "skill neurons" via soft prompt training on classification tasks, our approach extends the analysis to complex scenarios involving multiple skills. We correlate neuron activations with auxiliary metrics -- such as external labels and the model's own confidence score -- thereby uncovering interpretable and task-specific behaviors without the need for manual token aggregation. We empirically validate our method on tasks spanning open-ended text generation and natural language inference, demonstrating its ability to detect neurons that not only drive known skills but also reveal previously unidentified shortcuts in arithmetic reasoning on BigBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyang Fan, Diba Hashemi, Sai Praneeth Karimireddy, Martin Jaggi</p>
<p>Abstract: Incorporating metadata in Large Language Models (LLMs) pretraining has recently emerged as a promising approach to accelerate training. However prior work highlighted only one useful signal-URLs, leaving open the question of whether other forms of metadata could yield greater benefits. In this study, we investigate a wider range of metadata types and find other types of metadata, such as fine-grained indicators of document quality that can also accelerate pretraining when prepended. We identify a common feature among effective metadata: they encode information at a finer granularity. We further introduce metadata appending as a means of improving training efficiency, where predicting an appropriate metadata as auxiliary task can help speed up pretraining. In addition, learnable meta-tokens trained with masked loss can recover part of the speedup by inducing quality-aware latent structure. Using probing, we analyze latent representations to understand how metadata shapes learning. Together, these results yield practical guidelines for integrating metadata to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM pretraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Marklov\'a, Ond\v{r}ej Vin\v{s}, Martina Vok\'a\v{c}ov\'a, Ji\v{r}\'i Mili\v{c}ka</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are increasingly capable of producing creative texts, yet most studies on AI-generated poetry focus on English -- a language that dominates training data. In this paper, we examine the perception of AI- and human-written Czech poetry. We ask if Czech native speakers are able to identify it and how they aesthetically judge it. Participants performed at chance level when guessing authorship (45.8\% correct on average), indicating that Czech AI-generated poems were largely indistinguishable from human-written ones. Aesthetic evaluations revealed a strong authorship bias: when participants believed a poem was AI-generated, they rated it as less favorably, even though AI poems were in fact rated equally or more favorably than human ones on average. The logistic regression model uncovered that the more the people liked a poem, the less probable was that they accurately assign the authorship. Familiarity with poetry or literary background had no effect on recognition accuracy. Our findings show that AI can convincingly produce poetry even in a morphologically complex, low-resource (with respect of the training data of AI models) Slavic language such as Czech. The results suggest that readers' beliefs about authorship and the aesthetic evaluation of the poem are interconnected.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthetic data has become increasingly important for training large language models, especially when real data is scarce, expensive, or privacy-sensitive. Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality, more diverse, and structurally richer. However, existing frameworks for multi-agent synthesis often depend on a centralized orchestrator, creating scalability bottlenecks, or are hardcoded for specific domains, limiting flexibility. We present \textbf{Matrix}, a decentralized framework that represents both control and data flow as serialized messages passed through distributed queues. This peer-to-peer design eliminates the central orchestrator. Each task progresses independently through lightweight agents, while compute-intensive operations, such as LLM inference or containerized environments, are handled by distributed services. Built on Ray, Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and provides a modular, configurable design that enables easy adaptation to a wide range of data generation workflows. We evaluate Matrix across diverse synthesis scenarios, such as multi-agent collaborative dialogue, web-based reasoning data extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation in customer service environments. In all cases, Matrix achieves $2$--$15\times$ higher data generation throughput under identical hardware resources, without compromising output quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models are powerful generalists, yet solving deep and complex problems such as those of the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) remains both conceptually challenging and computationally expensive. We show that small orchestrators managing other models and a variety of tools can both push the upper bound of intelligence and improve efficiency in solving difficult agentic tasks. We introduce ToolOrchestra, a method for training small orchestrators that coordinate intelligent tools. ToolOrchestra explicitly uses reinforcement learning with outcome-, efficiency-, and user-preference-aware rewards. Using ToolOrchestra, we produce Orchestrator, an 8B model that achieves higher accuracy at lower cost than previous tool-use agents while aligning with user preferences on which tools are to be used for a given query. On HLE, Orchestrator achieves a score of 37.1%, outperforming GPT-5 (35.1%) while being 2.5x more efficient. On tau2-Bench and FRAMES, Orchestrator surpasses GPT-5 by a wide margin while using only about 30% of the cost. Extensive analysis shows that Orchestrator achieves the best trade-off between performance and cost under multiple metrics, and generalizes robustly to unseen tools. These results demonstrate that composing diverse tools with a lightweight orchestration model is both more efficient and more effective than existing methods, paving the way for practical and scalable tool-augmented reasoning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeganeh Kordi, Nihal V. Nayak, Max Zuo, Ilana Nguyen, Stephen H. Bach</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate how well large language models (LLMs) generalize across different task difficulties, a key question for effective data curation and evaluation. Existing research is mixed regarding whether training on easier or harder data leads to better results, and whether those gains come on easier or harder test data. We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' generalization across models, datasets, and fine-grained groups of example difficulty. We rank examples in six datasets using the outputs of thousands of different LLMs and Item Response Theory (IRT), a well-established difficulty metric in educational testing. Unlike prior work, our difficulty ratings are therefore determined solely by the abilities of many different LLMs, excluding human opinions of difficulty. With a more objective, larger-scale, and finer-grained analysis, we show that cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties. These results show the importance of having a range of difficulties in both training and evaluation data for LLMs, and that taking shortcuts with respect to difficulty is risky.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenliang Li, Adel Elmahdy, Alex Boyd, Zhongruo Wang, Alfredo Garcia, Parminder Bhatia, Taha Kass-Hout, Cao Xiao, Mingyi Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: PPO has been widely adopted for training large language models (LLMs) at the token level in multi-turn dialogue and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO. These results demonstrate that combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.</p>

The benchmark includes autofail conditions for missed crises, medical advice (WOPR Act), harmful information, and attachment engineering. We evaluate four frontier models across 17 scenarios (N=68) spanning three complexity tiers. All models show significant safety gaps (11.8-44.8 percent crisis detection), indicating the necessity of deterministic crisis routing in production systems. DeepSeek Chat v3 achieves the highest overall score (75.9 percent), while strengths differ by dimension: GPT-4o Mini leads Compliance (88.2 percent), Gemini leads Trauma-Informed Design (85.0 percent), and Claude Sonnet 4.5 ranks highest in crisis detection (44.8 percent). We release all scenarios, judge prompts, and scoring configurations with code. InvisibleBench extends single-turn safety tests by evaluating longitudinal risk, where real harms emerge.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now deployed at unprecedented scale, assisting millions of users in daily tasks. However, the risk of these models assisting unlawful activities remains underexplored. In this study, we define this high-risk behavior as complicit facilitation - the provision of guidance or support that enables illicit user instructions - and present four empirical studies that assess its prevalence in widely deployed LLMs. Using real-world legal cases and established legal frameworks, we construct an evaluation benchmark spanning 269 illicit scenarios and 50 illicit intents to assess LLMs' complicit facilitation behavior. Our findings reveal widespread LLM susceptibility to complicit facilitation, with GPT-4o providing illicit assistance in nearly half of tested cases. Moreover, LLMs exhibit deficient performance in delivering credible legal warnings and positive guidance. Further analysis uncovers substantial safety variation across socio-legal contexts. On the legal side, we observe heightened complicity for crimes against societal interests, non-extreme but frequently occurring violations, and malicious intents driven by subjective motives or deceptive justifications. On the social side, we identify demographic disparities that reveal concerning complicit patterns towards marginalized and disadvantaged groups, with older adults, racial minorities, and individuals in lower-prestige occupations disproportionately more likely to receive unlawful guidance. Analysis of model reasoning traces suggests that model-perceived stereotypes, characterized along warmth and competence, are associated with the model's complicit behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that existing safety alignment strategies are insufficient and may even exacerbate complicit behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daeheon Jeong, Seoyeon Byun, Kihoon Son, Dae Hyun Kim, Juho Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuele Dell'Erba, Andrew D. Bagdanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qineng Wang, Wenlong Huang, Yu Zhou, Hang Yin, Tianwei Bao, Jianwen Lyu, Weiyu Liu, Ruohan Zhang, Jiajun Wu, Li Fei-Fei, Manling Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Adnan Arefeen, Biplob Debnath, Srimat Chakradhar</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saurabhchand Bhati, Samuel Thomas, Hilde Kuehne, Rogerio Feris, James Glass</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) demonstrate impressive performance across diverse tasks, ranging from speech recognition to general audio understanding. However, their scalability is limited by the quadratic complexity of attention and the high token rates of audio signals. These challenges make it difficult to extend LALMs to long-form audio and to deploy them on resource-constrained platforms such as edge devices.
  In this paper, we explore techniques such as unsupervised segmentation, uniform average pooling, etc., to reduce the number of audio tokens generated by the LALM's audio encoder but before they are consumed by the LLM decoder. To mitigate potential performance degradation introduced by the compressed representations, we employ low-rank adapters to finetune the model. We evaluate our proposed models on two tasks, automatic speech recognition and speech-to-speech translation tasks, that are dependent on effectively uncovering the underlying lexical content of the input signal and study the effect of downsampling on these tasks. Experimental results show that compressed LALMs can achieve performance closer to frame-level LALMs while reducing the input audio token count upto three times before the LLM backbone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhisheng Zheng, Xiaohang Sun, Tuan Dinh, Abhishek Yanamandra, Abhinav Jain, Zhu Liu, Sunil Hadap, Vimal Bhat, Manoj Aggarwal, Gerard Medioni, David Harwath</p>
<p>Abstract: The scarcity of parallel speech corpora critically hampers speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), often forcing reliance on complex, multi-stage pipelines. This paper introduces RosettaSpeech, a novel and simplified framework for zero-shot S2ST that is trained on monolingual speech-text data augmented by machine translation supervision. While our method leverages the linguistic knowledge inherent in text-based NMT models, it strictly eliminates the need for parallel speech-to-speech pairs. Our model uniquely uses text as an intermediate bridge during training but functions as a direct, end-to-end speech-to-speech model at inference. This streamlined approach achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. For instance, on the CVSS-C test set, RosettaSpeech outperforms leading systems, achieving an ASR-BLEU score of 25.17 for German-to-English and 29.86 for Spanish-to-English-relative gains of over 27% and 14%, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a single model can deliver strong many-to-one translation performance (FR/ES/DE -> EN). We also provide a foundational analysis of how training data scaling impacts model performance. By prioritizing reliance on abundant parallel text rather than difficult-to-acquire parallel speech, RosettaSpeech offers a scalable path to creating high-quality, speaker-preserving S2ST for a much broader array of languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangzu Peng, Aditya Chattopadhyay, Luca Zancato, Elvis Nunez, Wei Xia, Stefano Soatto</p>
<p>Abstract: As efficient alternatives to softmax Attention, linear state-space models (SSMs) achieve constant memory and linear compute, but maintain only a lossy, fading summary of the past, often leading to inferior performance in recall oriented tasks. We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that reduces this gap by accounting for the full past when predicting the next token, while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. GKA achieves this by solving an online ridge regression problem at test time, with constant memory and linear compute cost in the sequence length. Drawing inspiration from the Kalman Filter, we iteratively solve the online ridge regression problem. However, a critical insight is that standard Kalman filter equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and difficult to parallelize in modern hardware. We address both challenges through two key innovations: (1) an adaptive regularization strategy with input-dependent gating that controls the condition number of the ridge regression, ensuring numerical stability while balancing memory retention. And (2) the use of Chebyshev Iteration instead of other conventional iterative solvers, which we demonstrate to be more stable in low-precision settings. To further improve scalability, we develop a hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation of Chebyshev Iteration along with custom kernels for backpropagating through our adaptive regularization and gating mechanisms. Empirically, GKA shows strong language understanding capabilites on short-context tasks outperforming existing SSM layers (like Mamba2, GLA and Gated DeltaNet). On long-context, GKA excels at real-world RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens, achieving more than $10$% relative improvement over other fading memory baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quan Xiao, Tianyi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline data selection and online self-refining generation, which enhance the data quality, are crucial steps in adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks. We tackle offline data selection and online self-refining generations through an optimization perspective. Specifically, bilevel data selection is used for offline data selection with respect to the validation dataset, and we treat online self-refining generation as a model adaptation step of selecting the model trained on current responses that best fits the validation data. Our framework offers a unified understanding of offline data selection and self-refining generation by assigning a learned data weight to each question and response, either explicitly or implicitly. For the first time, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the bilevel data selection framework and demonstrate its performance gains over unfiltered direct mixing baselines. By combining offline data with validation-weighted online generations, our method enhances fine-tuning performance. Experiments on quality enhancement and safety-aware LLM fine-tuning validate its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Zipf's law in language lacks a definitive origin, debated across fields. This study explains Zipf-like behavior using geometric mechanisms without linguistic elements. The Full Combinatorial Word Model (FCWM) forms words from a finite alphabet, generating a geometric distribution of word lengths. Interacting exponential forces yield a power-law rank-frequency curve, determined by alphabet size and blank symbol probability. Simulations support predictions, matching English, Russian, and mixed-genre data. The symbolic model suggests Zipf-type laws arise from geometric constraints, not communicative efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chungpa Lee, Thomas Zeng, Jongwon Jeong, Jy-yong Sohn, Kangwook Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in lieu of humans. While scalable, their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity of LLMs, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, in general we only have estimates of these values and it is not well known how to properly construct confidence intervals using only estimates. This work presents a simple plug-in framework that corrects such bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration dataset, enabling practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation. Additionally, to reduce uncertainty in the accuracy estimate, we introduce an adaptive algorithm that efficiently allocates calibration sample sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Li, Yibing Song, Xin Zhang, Lei Luo, Xiang Li, Jian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., "shape", "color"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

<p>Abstract: Millions of users across the globe turn to AI chatbots for their creative needs, inviting widespread interest in understanding how such chatbots represent diverse cultures. At the same time, evaluating cultural representations in open-ended tasks remains challenging and underexplored. In this work, we present TALES, an evaluation of cultural misrepresentations in LLM-generated stories for diverse Indian cultural identities. First, we develop TALES-Tax, a taxonomy of cultural misrepresentations by collating insights from participants with lived experiences in India through focus groups (N=9) and individual surveys (N=15). Using TALES-Tax, we evaluate 6 models through a large-scale annotation study spanning 2,925 annotations from 108 annotators with lived cultural experience from across 71 regions in India and 14 languages. Concerningly, we find that 88\% of the generated stories contain one or more cultural inaccuracies, and such errors are more prevalent in mid- and low-resourced languages and stories based in peri-urban regions in India. Lastly, we transform the annotations into TALES-QA, a standalone question bank to evaluate the cultural knowledge of foundational models. Through this evaluation, we surprisingly discover that models often possess the requisite cultural knowledge despite generating stories rife with cultural misrepresentations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ariful Islam, Md Rifat Hossen, Abir Ahmed, B M Taslimul Haque</p>
<p>Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has emerged as a critical tool for extracting fine-grained sentiment insights from user-generated content, particularly in e-commerce and social media domains. However, research on Bangla ABSA remains significantly underexplored due to the absence of comprehensive datasets and specialized frameworks for triplet extraction in this language. This paper introduces BanglaASTE, a novel framework for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) that simultaneously identifies aspect terms, opinion expressions, and sentiment polarities from Bangla product reviews. Our contributions include: (1) creation of the first annotated Bangla ASTE dataset containing 3,345 product reviews collected from major e-commerce platforms including Daraz, Facebook, and Rokomari; (2) development of a hybrid classification framework that employs graph-based aspect-opinion matching with semantic similarity techniques; and (3) implementation of an ensemble model combining BanglaBERT contextual embeddings with XGBoost boosting algorithms for enhanced triplet extraction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble approach achieves superior performance with 89.9% accuracy and 89.1% F1-score, significantly outperforming baseline models across all evaluation metrics. The framework effectively addresses key challenges in Bangla text processing including informal expressions, spelling variations, and data sparsity. This research advances the state-of-the-art in low-resource language sentiment analysis and provides a scalable solution for Bangla e-commerce analytics applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayuan Zhang, Kaiquan Chen, Zhihao Lu, Enshen Zhou, Qian Yu, Jing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederico Wieser, Martin Benfeghoul, Haitham Bou Ammar, Jun Wang, Zafeirios Fountas</p>
<p>Abstract: The rigid, uniform allocation of computation in standard Transformer (TF) architectures can limit their efficiency and scalability, particularly for large-scale models and long sequences. Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.</p>

TAGFN enables rigorous evaluation of both traditional and LLM-based graph outlier detection methods. Furthermore, it facilitates the development of misinformation detection capabilities in LLMs through fine-tuning.

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still lack robustness in spatial intelligence, demonstrating poor performance on spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intelligence: spatial 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding. G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has marked a pivotal shift in the field of natural language processing (NLP). LLMs have revolutionized a multitude of domains, and they have made a significant impact in the medical field. Large language models are now more abundant than ever, and many of these models exhibit bilingual capabilities, proficient in both English and Chinese. However, a comprehensive evaluation of these models remains to be conducted. This lack of assessment is especially apparent within the context of radiology NLP. This study seeks to bridge this gap by critically evaluating thirty two LLMs in interpreting radiology reports, a crucial component of radiology NLP. Specifically, the ability to derive impressions from radiologic findings is assessed. The outcomes of this evaluation provide key insights into the performance, strengths, and weaknesses of these LLMs, informing their practical applications within the medical domain.</p>

To evaluate the factuality of multimodal summarization models, we propose two fine-grained and explainable evaluation frameworks (FALLACIOUS) for different application scenarios, i.e. reference-based factuality evaluation framework and reference-free factuality evaluation framework. Notably, the reference-free factuality evaluation framework doesn't need ground truth and hence it has a wider application scenario. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks, we compute the correlation between our frameworks and the other metrics. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed method. We will release our code and dataset via github.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> B. N. Kausik</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent LLMs have hundreds of billions of parameters consuming vast resources. Furthermore, the so called "AI scaling law" for transformers suggests that the number of parameters must scale linearly with the size of the data. In response, we inquire into efficient LLMs, i.e. those with the fewest parameters that achieve the desired accuracy on a training corpus. Specifically, by comparing theoretical and empirical estimates of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we derive a natural AI scaling law that the number of parameters in an efficient LLM scales as $D^{\gamma}$ where $D$ is the size of the training data and $ \gamma \in [0.44, 0.72]$, suggesting the existence of more efficient architectures. Against this backdrop, we propose recurrent transformers, combining the efficacy of transformers with the efficiency of recurrent networks, progressively applying a single transformer layer to a fixed-width sliding window across the input sequence. Recurrent transformers (a) run in linear time in the sequence length, (b) are memory-efficient and amenable to parallel processing in large batches, (c) learn to forget history for language tasks, or accumulate history for long range tasks like copy and selective copy, and (d) are amenable to curriculum training to overcome vanishing gradients. In our experiments, we find that recurrent transformers perform favorably on benchmark tests.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Zeng, Hannah Stortz, Eric Sclafani, Alina Shabaeva, Maria Elizabeth Garza, Daniel Greeson, Owen Rambow</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Gram2Vec, a grammatical style embedding system that embeds documents into a higher dimensional space by extracting the normalized relative frequencies of grammatical features present in the text. Compared to neural approaches, Gram2Vec offers inherent interpretability based on how the feature vectors are generated. In this paper, we use authorship verification and AI detection as two applications to show how Gram2Vec can be used. For authorship verification, we use the features from Gram2Vec to explain why a pair of documents is by the same or by different authors. We also demonstrate how Gram2Vec features can be used to train a classifier for AI detection, outperforming machine learning models trained on a comparable set of Biber features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangyu Meng, Qingkai Zeng, John P. Lalor, Hong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Directly learning from examples of varying difficulty levels is often challenging for both humans and machine learning models. A more effective strategy involves exposing learners to examples in a progressive order from easy to difficult. Curriculum Learning (CL) has been proposed to implement this strategy in machine learning model training. However, two key challenges persist in CL framework design: defining the difficulty of training data and determining the appropriate amount of data to input at each training step. Drawing inspiration from psychometrics, this paper presents a Psychology-based Unified Dynamic Framework for Curriculum Learning (PUDF). We quantify the difficulty of training data by applying Item Response Theory (IRT) to responses from Artificial Crowds (AC). This theory-driven IRT-AC approach leads to global (i.e., model-independent) and interpretable difficulty values. Leveraging IRT, we propose a training strategy, Dynamic Data Selection via Model Ability Estimation (DDS-MAE), to schedule the appropriate amount of data during model training. Since our difficulty labeling and model ability estimation are based on a consistent theory, namely IRT, their values are comparable within the same scope, potentially leading to aligned training data selection and faster convergence compared to the other CL methods. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning pre-trained large language models with PUDF leads to higher accuracy and faster convergence on a suite of benchmark datasets compared to standard fine-tuning and state-of-the-art CL methods. Ablation studies and downstream analyses further validate the impact of PUDF for CL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leanne Nortje, Dan Oneata, Gabriel Pirlogeanu, Herman Kamper</p>
<p>Abstract: Given an image query, visually prompted keyword localisation (VPKL) aims to find occurrences of the depicted word in a speech collection. This can be useful when transcriptions are not available for a low-resource language (e.g. if it is unwritten). Previous work showed that VPKL can be performed with a visually grounded speech model trained on paired images and unlabelled speech. But all experiments were done on English. Moreover, transcriptions were used to get positive and negative pairs for the contrastive loss. This paper introduces a few-shot learning scheme to mine pairs automatically without transcriptions. On English, this results in only a small drop in performance. We also - for the first time - consider VPKL on a real low-resource language, Yoruba. While scores are reasonable, here we see a bigger drop in performance compared to using ground truth pairs because the mining is less accurate in Yoruba.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinlam Chow, Guy Tennenholtz, Izzeddin Gur, Vincent Zhuang, Bo Dai, Sridhar Thiagarajan, Craig Boutilier, Rishabh Agarwal, Aviral Kumar, Aleksandra Faust</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have indicated that effectively utilizing inference-time compute is crucial for attaining better performance from large language models (LLMs). In this work, we propose a novel inference-aware fine-tuning paradigm, in which the model is fine-tuned in a manner that directly optimizes the performance of the inference-time strategy. We study this paradigm using the simple yet effective Best-of-N (BoN) inference strategy, in which a verifier selects the best out of a set of LLM-generated responses. We devise the first imitation learning and reinforcement learning~(RL) methods for BoN-aware fine-tuning, overcoming the challenging, non-differentiable argmax operator within BoN. We empirically demonstrate that our BoN-aware models implicitly learn a meta-strategy that interleaves best responses with more diverse responses that might be better suited to a test-time input -- a process reminiscent of the exploration-exploitation trade-off in RL. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BoN-aware fine-tuning in terms of improved performance and inference-time compute. In particular, we show that our methods improve the Bo32 performance of Gemma 2B on Hendrycks MATH from 26.8% to 30.8%, and pass@32 from 60.0% to 67.0%, as well as the pass@16 on HumanEval from 61.6% to 67.1%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siqi Fan, Xuezhi Fang, Xingrun Xing, Peng Han, Shuo Shang, Yequan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the large number of parameters, the inference phase of Large Language Models (LLMs) is resource-intensive. Unlike traditional model compression, which needs retraining, recent dynamic computation methods show that not all components are required for inference, enabling a training-free pipeline. In this paper, we focus on the dynamic depth of LLM generation. A token-position aware layer skipping framework is proposed to save 1.5x times operations efficiently while maintaining performance. We first observed that tokens predicted later have lower perplexity and thus require less computation. Then, we propose a training-free algorithm called Position-Aware Depth Decay Decoding ($D^3$), which leverages a power-law decay function, $\left\lfloor L \times (\alpha^i) \right\rfloor$, to determine the number of layers to retain when generating token $T_i$. Remarkably, without any retraining, the $D^3$ achieves success across a wide range of generation tasks for the first time. Experiments on large language models (\ie the Llama) with $7 \sim 70$ billion parameters show that $D^3$ can achieve an average 1.5x speedup compared with the full-inference pipeline while maintaining comparable performance with nearly no performance drop ($<1\%$) on the GSM8K and BBH benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khanh-Tung Tran, Barry O'Sullivan, Hoang D. Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle reasoning tasks by generating chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, yet these gains have largely applied to high-resource languages, leaving low-resource languages behind. In this work, we first investigate CoT techniques in extremely low-resource scenarios through previous prompting, model-editing, and fine-tuning approaches. We introduce English-Pivoted CoT Training, leveraging the insight that LLMs internally operate in a latent space aligned toward the dominant language. Given input in a low-resource language, we perform supervised fine-tuning to generate CoT in English and output the final response in the target language. Across mathematical reasoning benchmarks, our approach outperforms other baselines with up to 28.33% improvement in low-resource scenarios. Our analysis and additional experiments, including Mixed-Language CoT and Two-Stage Training, show that explicitly separating language understanding from reasoning enhances cross-lingual reasoning abilities. To facilitate future work, we also release \emph{LC2024}, the first benchmark for mathematical tasks in Irish, an extremely low-resource and endangered language. Our results and resources highlight a practical pathway to multilingual reasoning without extensive retraining in every extremely low-resource language, despite data scarcity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linxuan Wang, Shuiyuan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: To explore the relationship between dependency distance (DD) and hierarchical distance (HD) in Japanese, we compared the probability distributions of DD and HD with and without sentence length fixed, and analyzed the changes in mean dependency distance (MDD) and mean hierarchical distance (MHD) as sentence length increases, along with their correlation coefficient based on the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese. It was found that the valency of the predicates is the underlying factor behind the trade-off relation between MDD and MHD in Japanese. Native speakers of Japanese regulate the linear complexity and hierarchical complexity through the valency of the predicates, and the relative sizes of MDD and MHD depend on whether the threshold of valency has been reached. Apart from the cognitive load, the valency of the predicates also affects the probability distributions of DD and HD. The effect of the valency of the predicates on the distribution of HD is greater than on that of DD, which leads to differences in their probability distributions and causes the mean of MDD to be lower than that of MHD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihyeong Park, Sungryeol Jeon, Chaelyn Lee, Seokhun Jeon, Byung-Soo Kim, Jemin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in chatbots, code generators, and search engines. Workload such as chain-of-throught, complex reasoning, agent services significantly increase the inference cost by invoke the model repeatedly. Optimization methods such as parallelism, compression, and caching have been adopted to reduce costs, but the diverse service requirements make it hard to select the right method. Recently, specialized LLM inference engines have emerged as a key component for integrating the optimization methods into service-oriented infrastructures. However, a systematic study on inference engines is still lacking.This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of 25 open-source and commercial inference engines. We examine each inference engine in terms of ease-of-use, ease-of-deployment, general-purpose support, scalability, and suitability for throughput- and latency-aware computation. Furthermore, we explore the design goals of each inference engine by investigating the optimization techniques it supports. In addition, we assess the ecosystem maturity of open source inference engines and handle the performance and cost policy of commercial solutions.We outline future research directions that include support for complex LLM-based services, support of various hardware, and enhanced security, offering practical guidance to researchers and developers in selecting and designing optimized LLM inference engines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuansheng Gao, Han Bao, Tong Zhang, Bin Li, Jixiang Luo, Ronghao Chen, Zonghui Wang, Wenzhi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Mental manipulation is a subtle yet pervasive form of psychological abuse that poses serious threats to mental health. Nevertheless, detecting mental manipulation remains a largely underexplored research problem. The field faces three major challenges: (i) insufficient and hard-to-obtain training data; (ii) the covert nature of mental manipulation, which hinders detection; and (iii) the lack of real-world datasets. To address these challenges, we propose MentalMAC, a novel framework that enhances large language models' ability to detect elements of mental manipulation in multi-turn dialogue. Our approach consists of three key components: EvoSA, an annotation-free data augmentation method based on evolutionary operations and speech act theory; teacher-model-generated multi-task supervision; and progressive task-level anti-curriculum distillation. We then constructed the ReaMent dataset, comprising 5,000 real-world dialogue samples, utilizing MentalMAC-distilled models to aid in human annotation. Vast experiments show that MentalMAC achieves up to 25.9% improvement in F1mac and 8.1% in accuracy over the best-performing baseline, outperforming commercial LLMs such as GPT-4 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet.

<p>Abstract: Web navigation is a unique domain that can automate many repetitive real-life tasks and is challenging as it requires long-horizon sequential decision making beyond typical multimodal large language model (MLLM) tasks. Yet, specialized reward models for web navigation that can be utilized during both training and test-time have been absent until now. Despite the importance of speed and cost-effectiveness, prior works have utilized MLLMs as reward models, which poses significant constraints for real-world deployment. To address this, in this work, we propose the first process reward model (PRM) called Web-Shepherd which could assess web navigation trajectories in a step-level. To achieve this, we first construct the WebPRM Collection, a large-scale dataset with 40K step-level preference pairs and annotated checklists spanning diverse domains and difficulty levels. Next, we also introduce the WebRewardBench, the first meta-evaluation benchmark for evaluating PRMs. In our experiments, we observe that our Web-Shepherd achieves about 30 points better accuracy compared to using GPT-4o on WebRewardBench. Furthermore, when testing on WebArena-lite by using GPT-4o-mini as the policy and Web-Shepherd as the verifier, we achieve 10.9 points better performance, in 10 less cost compared to using GPT-4o-mini as the verifier. Our model, dataset, and code are publicly available at LINK.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are revolutionizing human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based instructions imposes limitations on accessibility and convenience, particularly in hands-free scenarios. To address this issue, we propose replacing text with speech as the instruction input modality for GUI agents, and introduce UITron-Speech, which is the first end-to-end GUI agent capable of directly processing speech instructions and on-device screenshots to predict user actions. To tackle the problem of data scarcity, we synthesize high-quality speech instruction datasets using a random-speaker text-to-speech model. Additionally, we design a mixed-modality training strategy to mitigate the inherent modality imbalance in pre-trained foundation models. Furthermore, we conduct a statistical analysis of the distribution of GUI grounding prediction errors and propose a training-free two-step grounding refinement method to alleviate minor localization deviations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UITron-Speech achieves robust performance and superior adaptability, underscoring the feasibility and potential of speech-driven GUI agents for more accessible and intelligent human-computer interaction.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on knowledge graphs for factual reasoning, yet how retrieval design shapes their performance remains unclear. We examine how question decomposition changes the retrieved subgraph's content and structure. Using a hybrid retrieval function that controls the importance of initial question and subquestions, we show that subquestion-based retrieval improves content precision, but yields disjoint subgraphs, while question-based retrieval maintains structure at the cost of relevance. Optimal performance arises between these extremes, revealing that balancing retrieval content and structure is key to effective LLM reasoning over structured knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Hoang Nguyen, Thuat Thien Nguyen, Minh Nhat Ta, Tung Le, Huy Tien Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: News recommendation systems play a critical role in alleviating information overload by delivering personalized content. A key challenge lies in jointly modeling multi-view representations of news articles and capturing the dynamic, dual-scale nature of user interests-encompassing both short- and long-term preferences. Prior methods often rely on single-view features or insufficiently model user behavior across time. In this work, we introduce Co-NAML-LSTUR, a hybrid news recommendation framework that integrates NAML for attentive multi-view news encoding and LSTUR for hierarchical user modeling, designed for training on limited data resources. Our approach leverages BERT-based embeddings to enhance semantic representation. We evaluate Co-NAML-LSTUR on two widely used benchmarks, MIND-small and MIND-large. Results show that our model significantly outperforms strong baselines, achieving improvements over NRMS by 1.55% in AUC and 1.15% in MRR, and over NAML by 2.45% in AUC and 1.71% in MRR. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our efficiency-focused hybrid model, which combines multi-view news modeling with dual-scale user representations for practical, resource-limited resources rather than a claim to absolute state-of-the-art (SOTA).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meishan Zhang, Xin Zhang, Xinping Zhao, Shouzheng Huang, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text embeddings have attracted growing interest due to their effectiveness across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including retrieval, classification, clustering, bitext mining, and summarization. With the emergence of pretrained language models (PLMs), general-purpose text embeddings (GPTE) have gained significant traction for their ability to produce rich, transferable representations. The general architecture of GPTE typically leverages PLMs to derive dense text representations, which are then optimized through contrastive learning on large-scale pairwise datasets. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of GPTE in the era of PLMs, focusing on the roles PLMs play in driving its development. We first examine the fundamental architecture and describe the basic roles of PLMs in GPTE, i.e., embedding extraction, expressivity enhancement, training strategies, learning objectives, and data construction. We then describe advanced roles enabled by PLMs, including multilingual support, multimodal integration, code understanding, and scenario-specific adaptation. Finally, we highlight potential future research directions that move beyond traditional improvement goals, including ranking integration, safety considerations, bias mitigation, structural information incorporation, and the cognitive extension of embeddings. This survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for both newcomers and established researchers seeking to understand the current state and future potential of GPTE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhuang Xu, Xu Han, Yuanchi Zhang, Yixuan Wang, Yijun Liu, Shiyu Ji, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are distinguished by their strong performance scaling with increasing parameters across a wide range of tasks, yet they also suffer from substantial computational and storage overheads. Notably, the performance gains of MoE models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding. Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level ideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of Qwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.</p>

<p>Abstract: As an Indo-Aryan language with limited available data, Chakma remains largely underrepresented in language models. In this work, we introduce a novel corpus of contextually coherent Bangla-transliterated Chakma, curated from Chakma literature, and validated by native speakers. Using this dataset, we fine-tune six encoder-based transformer models, including multilingual (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, DistilBERT), regional (BanglaBERT, IndicBERT), and monolingual English (DeBERTaV3) variants on masked language modeling (MLM) tasks. Our experiments show that fine-tuned multilingual models outperform their pre-trained counterparts when adapted to Bangla-transliterated Chakma, achieving up to 73.54% token accuracy and a perplexity as low as 2.90. Our analysis further highlights the impact of data quality on model performance and shows the limitations of OCR pipelines for morphologically rich Indic scripts. Our research demonstrates that Bangla-transliterated Chakma can be very effective for transfer learning for Chakma language, and we release our dataset to encourage further research on multilingual language modeling for low-resource languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and complex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless interactions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and utilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce substantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new memory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance and efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of human memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First, cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information through lightweight compression and groups information according to their topics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based groups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally, long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that decouples consolidation from online inference. On LongMemEval and LoCoMo, using GPT and Qwen backbones, LightMem consistently surpasses strong baselines, improving QA accuracy by up to 7.7% / 29.3%, reducing total token usage by up to 38x / 20.9x and API calls by up to 30x / 55.5x, while purely online test-time costs are even lower, achieving up to 106x / 117x token reduction and 159x / 310x fewer API calls.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjin Liu, Haoran Luo, Xueyuan Lin, Haoming Liu, Tiesunlong Shen, Jiapu Wang, Rui Mao, Erik Cambria</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, advanced large language models (LLMs) have emerged at an increasingly rapid pace. However, when faced with complex problems, most users are often unable to provide accurate and effective prompts to interact with LLMs, thus limiting the performance of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose Prompt-R1, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that uses a small-scale LLM to collaborate with large-scale LLMs, replacing user interaction to solve problems better. This collaboration is cast as a multi-turn prompt interaction, where the small-scale LLM thinks and generates prompts, and the large-scale LLM performs complex reasoning. A dual-constrained reward is designed to optimize for correctness, generation quality, and reasoning accuracy. Prompt-R1 provides a plug-and-play framework that supports both inference and training with various large-scale LLMs. Experiments on multiple public datasets show that Prompt-R1 significantly outperforms baseline models across tasks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QwenQKing/Prompt-R1.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has led to impressive performance on a range of tasks, yet advanced instruction following (IF)-especially for complex, multi-turn, and system-prompted instructions-remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation and effective training for such capabilities are hindered by the lack of high-quality, human-annotated benchmarks and reliable, interpretable reward signals. In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curated rubrics that assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL. This work establishes rubrics as a powerful tool for both training and evaluating advanced IF in LLMs, paving the way for more capable and reliable AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaopei Huang, Qifeng Dai, Guozheng Wu, Xiaopeng Wu, Kehan Chen, Chuan Yu, Xubin Li, Tiezheng Ge, Wenxuan Wang, Qin Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of smart personal devices, service-oriented human-agent interactions have become increasingly prevalent. This trend highlights the need for personalized dialogue assistants that can understand user-specific traits to accurately interpret requirements and tailor responses to individual preferences. However, existing approaches often overlook the complexities of long-term interactions and fail to capture users' subjective characteristics. To address these gaps, we present PAL-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the personalization capabilities of service-oriented assistants in long-term user-agent interactions. In the absence of available real-world data, we develop a multi-step LLM-based synthesis pipeline, which is further verified and refined by human annotators. This process yields PAL-Set, the first Chinese dataset comprising multi-session user logs and dialogue histories, which serves as the foundation for PAL-Bench. Furthermore, to improve personalized service-oriented interactions, we propose H$^2$Memory, a hierarchical and heterogeneous memory framework that incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to improve personalized response generation. Comprehensive experiments on both our PAL-Bench and an external dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed memory framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: While web data quality is crucial for large language models, most curation efforts focus on filtering and deduplication,treating HTML-to-text extraction as a fixed pre-processing step. Existing web corpora rely on heuristic-based extractors like Trafilatura, which struggle to preserve document structure and frequently corrupt structured elements such as formulas, codes, and tables. We hypothesize that improving extraction quality can be as impactful as aggressive filtering strategies for downstream performance. We introduce MinerU-HTML, a novel extraction pipeline that reformulates content extraction as a sequence labeling problem solved by a 0.6B-parameter language model. Unlike text-density heuristics, MinerU-HTML leverages semantic understanding and employs a two-stage formatting pipeline that explicitly categorizes semantic elements before converting to Markdown. Crucially, its model-based approach is inherently scalable, whereas heuristic methods offer limited improvement pathways. On MainWebBench, our benchmark of 7,887 annotated web pages, MinerU-HTML achieves 81.8\% ROUGE-N F1 compared to Trafilatura's 63.6\%, with exceptional structured element preservation (90.9\% for code blocks, 94.0\% for formulas). Using MinerU-HTML, we construct AICC (AI-ready Common Crawl), a 7.3-trillion token multilingual corpus from two Common Crawl snapshots. In controlled pretraining experiments where AICC and Trafilatura-extracted TfCC undergo identical filtering, models trained on AICC (62B tokens) achieve 50.8\% average accuracy across 13 benchmarks, outperforming TfCC by 1.08pp-providing direct evidence that extraction quality significantly impacts model capabilities. AICC also surpasses RefinedWeb and FineWeb on key benchmarks. We publicly release MainWebBench, MinerU-HTML, and AICC, demonstrating that HTML extraction is a critical, often underestimated component of web corpus construction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie He, Richard He Bai, Sinead Williamson, Jeff Z. Pan, Navdeep Jaitly, Yizhe Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but still suffers from long contexts and disjoint retrieval-generation optimization. In this work, we propose CLaRa (Continuous Latent Reasoning), a unified framework that performs embedding-based compression and joint optimization in a shared continuous space. To obtain semantically rich and retrievable compressed vectors, we introduce SCP, a key-preserving data synthesis framework using QA and paraphrase supervision. CLaRa then trains the reranker and generator end-to-end via a single language modeling loss, with gradients flowing through both modules using a differentiable top-k estimator. Theoretically, this unified optimization aligns retrieval relevance with answer quality. Experiments across multiple QA benchmarks show that CLaRa achieves state-of-the-art compression and reranking performance, often surpassing text-based fine-tuned baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep research models perform multi-step research to produce long-form, well-attributed answers. However, most open deep research models are trained on easily verifiable short-form QA tasks via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which does not extend to realistic long-form tasks. We address this with Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER), in which we construct and maintain rubrics that co-evolve with the policy model during training; this allows the rubrics to incorporate information that the model has newly explored and to provide discriminative, on-policy feedback. Using RLER, we develop Deep Research Tulu (DR Tulu-8B), the first open model that is directly trained for open-ended, long-form deep research. Across four long-form deep research benchmarks in science, healthcare and general domains, DR Tulu substantially outperforms existing open deep research models, and matches or exceeds proprietary deep research systems, while being significantly smaller and cheaper per query. To facilitate future research, we release all data, models, and code, including our new MCP-based agent infrastructure for deep research systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farzad Ahmed, Joniel Augustine Jerome, Meliha Yetisgen, \"Ozlem Uzuner</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: Clinical documentation contains factual, diagnostic, and management errors that can compromise patient safety. Large language models (LLMs) may help detect and correct such errors, but their behavior under different prompting strategies remains unclear. We evaluate zero-shot prompting, static prompting with random exemplars (SPR), and retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting (RDP) for three subtasks of medical error processing: error flag detection, error sentence detection, and error correction.
  Methods: Using the MEDEC dataset, we evaluated nine instruction-tuned LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI o-series models). We measured performance using accuracy, recall, false-positive rate (FPR), and an aggregate score of ROUGE-1, BLEURT, and BERTScore for error correction. We also analyzed example outputs to identify failure modes and differences between LLM and clinician reasoning.
  Results: Zero-shot prompting showed low recall in both detection tasks, often missing abbreviation-heavy or atypical errors. SPR improved recall but increased FPR. Across all nine LLMs, RDP reduced FPR by about 15 percent, improved recall by 5 to 10 percent in error sentence detection, and generated more contextually accurate corrections.
  Conclusion: Across diverse LLMs, RDP outperforms zero-shot and SPR prompting. Using retrieved exemplars improves detection accuracy, reduces false positives, and enhances the reliability of medical error correction.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20072">MTA: A Merge-then-Adapt Framework for Personalized Large Language Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaopeng Li, Yuanjin Zheng, Wanyu Wang, wenlin zhang, Pengyue Jia, Yiqi Wang, Maolin Wang, Xuetao Wei, Xiangyu Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized Large Language Models (PLLMs) aim to align model outputs with individual user preferences, a crucial capability for user-centric applications. However, the prevalent approach of fine-tuning a separate module for each user faces two major limitations: (1) storage costs scale linearly with the number of users, rendering the method unscalable; and (2) fine-tuning a static model from scratch often yields suboptimal performance for users with sparse data. To address these challenges, we propose MTA, a Merge-then-Adapt framework for PLLMs. MTA comprises three key stages. First, we construct a shared Meta-LoRA Bank by selecting anchor users and pre-training meta-personalization traits within meta-LoRA modules. Second, to ensure scalability and enable dynamic personalization combination beyond static models, we introduce an Adaptive LoRA Fusion stage. This stage retrieves and dynamically merges the most relevant anchor meta-LoRAs to synthesize a user-specific one, thereby eliminating the need for user-specific storage and supporting more flexible personalization. Third, we propose a LoRA Stacking for Few-Shot Personalization stage, which applies an additional ultra-low-rank, lightweight LoRA module on top of the merged LoRA. Fine-tuning this module enables effective personalization under few-shot settings. Extensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing SOTA methods across multiple tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models excel on broad multilingual benchmarks but remain to be evaluated extensively in figurative and culturally grounded reasoning, especially in low-resource contexts. We present BengaliFig, a compact yet richly annotated challenge set that targets this gap in Bengali, a widely spoken low-resourced language. The dataset contains 435 unique riddles drawn from Bengali oral and literary traditions. Each item is annotated along five orthogonal dimensions capturing reasoning type, trap type, cultural depth, answer category, and difficulty, and is automatically converted to multiple-choice format through a constraint-aware, AI-assisted pipeline. We evaluate eight frontier LLMs from major providers under zero-shot and few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, revealing consistent weaknesses in metaphorical and culturally specific reasoning. BengaliFig thus contributes both a diagnostic probe for evaluating LLM robustness in low-resource cultural contexts and a step toward inclusive and heritage-aware NLP evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models are rapidly gaining popularity and have been widely adopted in real-world applications. While the quality of training data is essential, privacy concerns arise during data collection. Federated learning offers a solution by allowing multiple clients to collaboratively train LLMs without sharing local data. However, FL introduces new challenges, such as model convergence issues due to heterogeneous data and high communication costs. A comprehensive study is required to address these challenges and guide future research. This paper surveys Federated learning for LLMs (FedLLM), highlighting recent advances and future directions. We focus on two key aspects: fine-tuning and prompt learning in a federated setting, discussing existing work and associated research challenges. We finally propose potential directions for federated LLMs, including pre-training, federated agents, and LLMs for federated learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: This article introduces misinfo-general, a benchmark dataset for evaluating misinformation models' ability to perform out-of-distribution generalization. Misinformation changes rapidly, much more quickly than moderators can annotate at scale, resulting in a shift between the training and inference data distributions. As a result, misinformation detectors need to be able to perform out-of-distribution generalization, an attribute they currently lack. Our benchmark uses distant labelling to enable simulating covariate shifts in misinformation content. We identify time, event, topic, publisher, political bias, misinformation type as important axes for generalization, and we evaluate a common class of baseline models on each. Using article metadata, we show how this model fails desiderata, which is not necessarily obvious from classification metrics. Finally, we analyze properties of the data to ensure limited presence of modelling shortcuts. We make the dataset and accompanying code publicly available: https://github.com/ioverho/misinfo-general</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diji Yang, Linda Zeng, Kezhen Chen, Yi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: While inference-time thinking allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to address complex problems, the extended thinking process can be unreliable or inconsistent because of the model's probabilistic nature, especially near its knowledge boundaries. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this by having the model critique its own reasoning to make corrections. However, such self-critique inherits the same biases of the original output, known as the introspection illusion. Moving beyond such introspection and inspired by core methodologies in ethology, we propose an externalist three-step framework Distillation-Reinforcement-Reasoning (DRR). Rather than relying on a model's introspection, DRR evaluates its observable behaviors to provide corrective feedback. DRR first distills the reasoner's behavioral traces, then trains a lightweight, external Discriminative Model (DM). At inference time, this DM acts as a critic, identifying and rejecting suspicious reasoning steps. This external feedback compels the LLM to discard flawed pathways and explore alternatives, thereby enhancing reasoning quality without altering the base model. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework significantly outperforms prominent self-critique methods. Benefiting from a lightweight and annotation-free design, DRR offers a scalable and adaptable solution for improving the reliability of reasoning in a wide range of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Pratap</p>
<p>Abstract: In an era dominated by datafication, the reduction of human experiences to quantifiable metrics raises profound philosophical and ethical questions. This paper explores these issues through the lens of Meursault, the protagonist of Albert Camus' The Stranger, whose emotionally detached existence epitomizes the existential concept of absurdity. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques including emotion detection (BERT), sentiment analysis (VADER), and named entity recognition (spaCy)-this study quantifies key events and behaviors in Meursault's life. Our analysis reveals the inherent limitations of applying algorithmic models to complex human experiences, particularly those rooted in existential alienation and moral ambiguity. By examining how modern AI tools misinterpret Meursault's actions and emotions, this research underscores the broader ethical dilemmas of reducing nuanced human narratives to data points, challenging the foundational assumptions of our data-driven society. The findings presented in this paper serve as a critique of the increasing reliance on data-driven narratives and advocate for incorporating humanistic values in artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual captioning benchmarks have become outdated with the emergence of modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as the brief ground-truth sentences and traditional metrics fail to assess detailed captions effectively. While recent benchmarks attempt to address this by focusing on keyword extraction or object-centric evaluation, they remain limited to vague-view or object-view analyses and incomplete visual element coverage. In this paper, we introduce CAPability, a comprehensive multi-view benchmark for evaluating visual captioning across 12 dimensions spanning six critical views. We curate nearly 11K human-annotated images and videos with visual element annotations to evaluate the generated captions. CAPability stably assesses both the correctness and thoroughness of captions with \textit{precision} and \textit{hit} metrics. By converting annotations to QA pairs, we further introduce a heuristic metric, \textit{know but cannot tell} ($K\bar{T}$), indicating a significant performance gap between QA and caption capabilities. Our work provides a holistic analysis of MLLMs' captioning abilities, as we identify their strengths and weaknesses across various dimensions, guiding future research to enhance specific aspects of their capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have revolutionized their reasoning and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities. However, their complex logical reasoning performance on text-rich images remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce LogicOCR, a benchmark comprising 2780 questions with two subsets, i.e., LogicOCR-Gen with 1100 multi-choice questions on generated images, and LogicOCR-Real with 1680 meticulously designed free-form questions on real-world images. For constructing LogicOCR-Gen, we first curate a text corpus from the Chinese National Civil Servant Examination, and customize an automatic pipeline to steer GPT-Image-1 to generate images with varied layouts and fonts, ensuring contextual relevance and visual realism. Then, the generated images are manually verified. We evaluate a range of representative LMMs under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and direct-answer settings. Our multi-dimensional analysis reveals key insights, such as the impact of test-time scaling, input modality differences, and sensitivity to visual-text orientation. Notably, LMMs still lag in multimodal reasoning compared to text-only inputs, indicating that they have not fully bridged visual reading with reasoning. Moreover, we propose TextCue, a training-free method that enhances LMMs' perception of image regions containing important text cues for solving questions. We leverage LMMs' attention maps and an off-the-shelf text segmentation specialist to determine the region, which is then cropped and enlarged to augment the original image. Experiments show its effectiveness, e.g., a 1.8% accuracy gain over LLaVA-OV-1.5-8B under the CoT setting. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/MiliLab/LogicOCR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hoyeon Chang, Jinho Park, Hanseul Cho, Sohee Yang, Miyoung Ko, Hyeonbin Hwang, Seungpil Won, Dohaeng Lee, Youbin Ahn, Minjoon Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite impressive capabilities, LLMs' successes often rely on pattern-matching behaviors, yet these are also linked to OOD generalization failures in compositional tasks. However, behavioral studies commonly employ task setups that allow multiple generalization sources (e.g., algebraic invariances, structural repetition), obscuring a precise and testable account of how well LLMs perform generalization through pattern matching and their limitations. To address this ambiguity, we first formalize pattern matching as functional equivalence, i.e., identifying pairs of subsequences of inputs that consistently lead to identical results when the rest of the input is held constant. Then, we systematically study how decoder-only Transformer and Mamba behave in controlled tasks with compositional structures that isolate this mechanism. Our formalism yields predictive and quantitative insights: (1) Instance-wise success of pattern matching is well predicted by the number of contexts witnessing the relevant functional equivalence. (2) We prove a tight sample complexity bound of learning a two-hop structure by identifying the exponent of the data scaling law for perfect in-domain generalization. Our empirical results align with the theoretical prediction, under 20x parameter scaling and across architectures. (3) Path ambiguity is a structural barrier: when a variable influences the output via multiple paths, models fail to form unified intermediate state representations, impairing accuracy and interpretability. (4) Chain-of-Thought reduces data requirements yet does not resolve path ambiguity. Hence, we provide a predictive, falsifiable boundary for pattern matching and a foundational diagnostic for disentangling mixed generalization mechanisms.</p>

Most recent works in ASD explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in goal-driven settings, relying on human-specified research questions to guide hypothesis generation. However, scientific discovery may be accelerated further by allowing the AI system to drive exploration by its own criteria. The few existing approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity heuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former struggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the latter suffers from imprecise definitions. This paper presents AutoDiscovery -- a method for open-ended ASD that instead drives scientific exploration using Bayesian surprise. Here, we quantify the epistemic shift from the LLM's prior beliefs about a hypothesis to its posterior beliefs after gathering experimental results. To efficiently explore the space of nested hypotheses, our method employs a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) strategy with progressive widening using surprisal as the reward function. We evaluate AutoDiscovery in the setting of data-driven discovery across 21 real-world datasets spanning domains such as biology, economics, finance, and behavioral science. Our results demonstrate that under a fixed budget, AutoDiscovery substantially outperforms competitors by producing 5-29% more discoveries deemed surprising by the LLM. Our human evaluation further reveals that two-thirds of discoveries made by our system are surprising to domain experts as well, suggesting this is an important step towards building open-ended ASD systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixin Xie, Xurui Song, Jun Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a competitive non-autoregressive paradigm due to their unique training and inference approach. However, there is currently a lack of safety study on this novel architecture. In this paper, we present the first analysis of dLLMs' safety performance and propose a novel safety alignment method tailored to their unique generation characteristics. Specifically, we identify a critical asymmetry between the defender and attacker in terms of security. For the defender, we reveal that the middle tokens of the response, rather than the initial ones, are more critical to the overall safety of dLLM outputs; this seems to suggest that aligning middle tokens can be more beneficial to the defender. The attacker, on the contrary, may have limited power to manipulate middle tokens, as we find dLLMs have a strong tendency towards a sequential generation order in practice, forcing the attack to meet this distribution and diverting it from influencing the critical middle tokens. Building on this asymmetry, we introduce Middle-tOken Safety Alignment (MOSA), a novel method that directly aligns the model's middle generation with safe refusals exploiting reinforcement learning. We implement MOSA and compare its security performance against eight attack methods on two benchmarks. We also test the utility of MOSA-aligned dLLM on coding, math, and general reasoning. The results strongly prove the superiority of MOSA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hakaze Cho, Haolin Yang, Gouki Minegishi, Naoya Inoue</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics, we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover, we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information removal mechanism and denoising heads.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15585">Leveraging Test Driven Development with Large Language Models for Reliable and Verifiable Spreadsheet Code Generation: A Research Framework</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Thorne, Advait Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly leveraged for generating both traditional software code and spreadsheet logic. Despite their impressive generative capabilities, these models frequently exhibit critical issues such as hallucinations, subtle logical inconsistencies, and syntactic errors, risks particularly acute in high stakes domains like financial modelling and scientific computations, where accuracy and reliability are paramount. This position paper proposes a structured research framework that integrates the proven software engineering practice of Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Large Language Model (LLM) driven generation to enhance the correctness of, reliability of, and user confidence in generated outputs. We hypothesise that a "test first" methodology provides both technical constraints and cognitive scaffolding, guiding LLM outputs towards more accurate, verifiable, and comprehensible solutions. Our framework, applicable across diverse programming contexts, from spreadsheet formula generation to scripting languages such as Python and strongly typed languages like Rust, includes an explicitly outlined experimental design with clearly defined participant groups, evaluation metrics, and illustrative TDD based prompting examples. By emphasising test driven thinking, we aim to improve computational thinking, prompt engineering skills, and user engagement, particularly benefiting spreadsheet users who often lack formal programming training yet face serious consequences from logical errors. We invite collaboration to refine and empirically evaluate this approach, ultimately aiming to establish responsible and reliable LLM integration in both educational and professional development practices.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02607">UniChange: Unifying Change Detection with Multimodal Large Language Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Zhang, Danyang Li, Xiaohang Dong, Tianhao Wu, Hualong Yu, Jianye Wang, Qicheng Li, Xiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities. Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories, eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks (WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively, surpassing all previous methods.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15703">Think Visually, Reason Textually: Vision-Language Synergy in ARC</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Beichen Zhang, Yuhang Zang, Xiaoyi Dong, Yuhang Cao, Haodong Duan, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Abstract reasoning from minimal examples remains a core unsolved problem for frontier foundation models such as GPT-5 and Grok 4. These models still fail to infer structured transformation rules from a handful of examples, which is a key hallmark of human intelligence. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) provides a rigorous testbed for this capability, demanding conceptual rule induction and transfer to novel tasks. Most existing methods treat ARC-AGI as a purely textual reasoning task, overlooking the fact that humans rely heavily on visual abstraction when solving such puzzles. However, our pilot experiments reveal a paradox: naively rendering ARC-AGI grids as images degrades performance due to imprecise rule execution. This leads to our central hypothesis that vision and language possess complementary strengths across distinct reasoning stages: vision supports global pattern abstraction and verification, whereas language specializes in symbolic rule formulation and precise execution. Building on this insight, we introduce two synergistic strategies: (1) Vision-Language Synergy Reasoning (VLSR), which decomposes ARC-AGI into modality-aligned subtasks; and (2) Modality-Switch Self-Correction (MSSC), which leverages vision to verify text-based reasoning for intrinsic error correction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach yields up to a 4.33\% improvement over text-only baselines across diverse flagship models and multiple ARC-AGI tasks. Our findings suggest that unifying visual abstraction with linguistic reasoning is a crucial step toward achieving generalizable, human-like intelligence in future foundation models.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable success in text and vision domains through extended chain-of-thought deliberation. However, a perplexing phenomenon persists in audio language models: they consistently perform better with minimal or no reasoning, raising a fundamental question - can audio intelligence truly benefit from deliberate thinking? We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence. By establishing the first successful audio reasoning model, Step-Audio-R1 opens new pathways toward building truly multimodal reasoning systems that think deeply across all sensory modalities.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16595">TimeViper: A Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Vision-Language Model for Efficient Long Video Understanding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Boshen Xu, Zihan Xiao, Jiaze Li, Jianzhong Ju, Zhenbo Luo, Jian Luan, Qin Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce TimeViper, a hybrid vision-language model designed to tackle challenges of long video understanding. Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.</p>
