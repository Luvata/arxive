<p><b>Authors:</b> Tai Vu, Robert Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meriem Zerkouk, Miloud Mihoubi, Belkacem Chikhaoui</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management. Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately, our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing, leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and prompt engineering to extract sentiment relevant features from the CrisisMMD dataset. To effectively model intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism within the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this mechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the model's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data. The deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused features, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines. Experimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social media data into informative and noninformative categories across various natural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and 5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal data. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into the sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to real time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize the accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal analysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work presents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis management solutions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Santosh Humagain, Toni Schneidereit</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks approach the approximation of differential equations by directly incorporating their structure and given conditions in a loss function. This enables conditions like, e.g., invariants to be easily added during the modelling phase. In addition, the approach can be considered as mesh free and can be utilised to compute solutions on arbitrary grids after the training phase. Therefore, physics-informed neural networks are emerging as a promising alternative to solving differential equations with methods from numerical mathematics. However, their performance highly depends on a large variety of factors. In this paper, we systematically investigate and evaluate a core component of the approach, namely the training point distribution. We test two ordinary and two partial differential equations with five strategies for training data generation and shallow network architectures, with one and two hidden layers. In addition to common distributions, we introduce sine-based training points, which are motivated by the construction of Chebyshev nodes. The results are challenged by using certain parameter combinations like, e.g., random and fixed-seed weight initialisation for reproducibility. The results show the impact of the training point distributions on the solution accuracy and we find evidence that they are connected to the characteristics of the differential equation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Su Chen, Xiaohua Qi, Xixun Lin, Yanmin Shang, Xiaolin Xu, Yangxi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning temporal interaction networks(TIN) is previously regarded as a coarse-grained multi-sequence prediction problem, ignoring the network topology structure influence. This paper addresses this limitation and a Deep Graph Neural Point Process(DGNPP) model for TIN is proposed. DGNPP consists of two key modules: the Node Aggregation Layer and the Self Attentive Layer. The Node Aggregation Layer captures topological structures to generate static representation for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically updates embeddings over time. By incorporating both dynamic and static embeddings into the event intensity function and optimizing the model via maximum likelihood estimation, DGNPP predicts events and occurrence time effectively. Experimental evaluations on three public datasets demonstrate that DGNPP achieves superior performance in event prediction and time prediction tasks with high efficiency, significantly outperforming baseline models and effectively mitigating the limitations of prior approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper studies an application of a recurrent neural network to clustering method for the S-P chart: a binary data set used widely in education. As the number of students increases, the S-P chart becomes hard to handle. In order to classify the large chart into smaller charts, we present a simple clustering method based on the network dynamics. In the method, the network has multiple fixed points and basins of attraction give clusters corresponding to small S-P charts. In order to evaluate the clustering performance, we present an important feature quantity: average caution index that characterizes singularity of students answer oatterns. Performing fundamental experiments, effectiveness of the method is confirmed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suhang Hu, Wei Hu, Yuhang Su, Fan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks, such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training. We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations, achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring manually annotated CoTs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lakshmi Priya P. K., Andreas Schwung</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering the governing equations of a physical system and designing an effective feedback controller remains one of the most challenging and intensive areas of ongoing research. This task demands a deep understanding of the system behavior, including the nonlinear factors that influence its dynamics. In this article, we propose a novel methodology for identifying a feedback linearized physical system based on known prior dynamic behavior. Initially, the system is identified using a sparse regression algorithm, subsequently a feedback controller is designed for the discovered system by applying Lie derivatives to the dictionary of output functions to derive an augmented constraint which guarantees that no internal dynamics are observed. Unlike the prior related works, the novel aspect of this article combines the approach of stacked regression algorithm and relative degree conditions to discover and feedback linearize the true governing equations of a physical model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nobuyuki Oishi, Philip Birch, Daniel Roggen, Paula Lago</p>
<p>Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) hinders model performance and limits generalization across real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this issue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used in HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially resulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the activity labels. In this study, we introduce and systematically characterize Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation. PPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose estimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics simulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and hardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional STDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First, we evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to their STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can reduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects used for training. Experiments show consistent benefits of PPDAs, improving macro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs. As the first systematic study of PPDA in sensor-based HAR, these results highlight the advantages of pursuing physical plausibility in data augmentation and the potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement Unit data for training deep learning HAR models. This cost-effective and scalable approach therefore helps address the annotation scarcity challenge in HAR.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13285">Towards Human-AI Complementarity in Matching Tasks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian Arnaiz-Rodriguez, Nina Corvelo Benz, Suhas Thejaswi, Nuria Oliver, Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven algorithmic matching systems promise to help human decision makers make better matching decisions in a wide variety of high-stakes application domains, such as healthcare and social service provision. However, existing systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity: decisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not necessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our work aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching (comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative approach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task like existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most confident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process, comatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the human decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale human subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch outperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic matching on their own. The data gathered in our human subject study and an implementation of our system are available as open source at https://github.com/Networks-Learning/human-AI-complementarity-matching.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13288">Hierarchical Conformal Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Floris den Hengst, In\`es Blin, Majid Mohammadi, Syed Ihtesham Hussain Shah, Taraneh Younesian</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty in machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample coverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction set of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high probability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper presents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that incorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of prediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose solutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the hierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial nature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured subset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding optimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of audio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a user study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat prediction sets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13316">Efficient Constraint-Aware Flow Matching via Randomized Exploration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyan Huan, Jacob Boerma, Li-Ping Liu, Shuchin Aeron</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of generating samples via Flow Matching (FM) with an additional requirement that the generated samples must satisfy given constraints. We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable distance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint set is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we propose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that penalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples. For case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is numerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This approach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex constraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to constrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show that a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow but with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is more computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained generation, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve significant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target distributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show how our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator, using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier. We conclude with several future research directions. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhengyanHuan/FM-RE.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13326">Decoding Communications with Partial Information</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan Cope, Peter McBurney</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine language acquisition is often presented as a problem of imitation learning: there exists a community of language users from which a learner observes speech acts and attempts to decode the mappings between utterances and situations. However, an interesting consideration that is typically unaddressed is partial observability, i.e. the learner is assumed to see all relevant information. This paper explores relaxing this assumption, thereby posing a more challenging setting where such information needs to be inferred from knowledge of the environment, the actions taken, and messages sent. We see several motivating examples of this problem, demonstrate how they can be solved in a toy setting, and formally explore challenges that arise in more general settings. A learning-based algorithm is then presented to perform the decoding of private information to facilitate language acquisition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirali Arbab, Zeinab Davarani, Mehran Safayani</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the complex neural activity dynamics is crucial for the development of the field of neuroscience. Although current functional MRI classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI classification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph creation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueming Yuan, Ahan Gupta, Jianping Li, Sajal Dash, Feiyi Wang, Minjia Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication. Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs - perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant computational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE training system designed to deliver scalable training performance for next-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel techniques, including efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform kernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with sequence-sharded MoE blocks. Our evaluation on the Frontier supercomputer, powered by AMD MI250X GPUs, shows that X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to 545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than the largest trainable model with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining high training throughput. The source code of X-MoE is available at https://github.com/Supercomputing-System-AI-Lab/X-MoE.</p>

However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or purely data-driven models, which tend to falter under data scarcity. We propose a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal inference. We evaluate ODE-Diff across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations, synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and distributional accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seohyeon Cha, Kevin Chan, Gustavo de Veciana, Haris Vikalo</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent services on resource-constrained edge devices has spurred the development of collaborative inference systems that distribute workloads across end devices, edge servers, and the cloud. While most existing frameworks focus on single-task, single-model scenarios, many real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality) require concurrent execution of diverse tasks including detection, segmentation, and depth estimation. In this work, we propose a unified framework to jointly decide which multi-task models to deploy (onload) at clients and edge servers, and how to route queries across the hierarchy (offload) to maximize overall inference accuracy under memory, compute, and communication constraints. We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and introduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating algorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed submodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained linear programming. We further extend J3O to account for batching at the edge, maintaining scalability under heterogeneous task loads. Experiments show J3O consistently achieves over $97\%$ of the optimal accuracy while incurring less than $15\%$ of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nooshin Bahador, Milad Lankarany</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a quantitative framework for evaluating the spatial concordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones (SOZs) and statistically anomalous channels identified through time-frequency analysis of chirp events. The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1) Unsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with adaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on spectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and temporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both exact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that the LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects outliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming exact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1) were highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those with successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas failure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460). The key takeaway is that chirp-based outlier detection, combined with weighted spatial metrics, provides a complementary method for SOZ localization, particularly in patients with successful surgical outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamran Chitsaz, Roshan Balaji, Quentin Fournier, Nirav Pravinbhai Bhatt, Sarath Chandar</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing de-novo molecules with desired property profiles requires efficient exploration of the vast chemical space ranging from $10^{23}$ to $10^{60}$ possible synthesizable candidates. While various deep generative models have been developed to design small molecules using diverse input representations, Molecular Large Language Models (Mol-LLMs) based on string representations have emerged as a scalable approach capable of exploring billions of molecules. However, there remains limited understanding regarding how standard language modeling practices such as textual representations, tokenization strategies, model size, and dataset scale impact molecular generation performance. In this work, we systematically investigate these critical aspects by introducing NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5 billion molecules for de-novo molecule generation. Through extensive empirical analyses, we identify a weak correlation between performance metrics measured during pretraining and actual downstream performance, revealing important distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics. NovoMolGen establishes new state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and goal-directed molecular generation tasks, thus providing a robust foundation for advancing efficient and effective molecular modeling strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuyun Deng, Huiwen Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored in networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper, we address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose learning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to benefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms incur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as agents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We establish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity associated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance contexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy Carleton, Debajoy Mukherjee, Srinivas Shakkottai, Dileep Kalathil</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives -- such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via Value-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment framework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the base model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models are combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that adjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The value models are trained using a simple iterative algorithm that ensures monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy. We show empirically that MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models and combine them post hoc, and even approaches the performance of the idealized setting where models are fine-tuned for a user's exact preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunfeng Ge, Ming Jin, Yiji Zhao, Hongyan Li, Bo Du, Chang Xu, Shirui Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality, resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF), an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions. Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Fang, Zhiqi Shao, S T Boris Choy, Junbin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edesio Alcoba\c{c}a, Andr\'e C. P. L. F. de Carvalho</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) has democratized the design of machine learning based systems, by automating model selection, hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering. However, the high computational cost associated with traditional search and optimization strategies, such as Random Search, Particle Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization, remains a significant challenge. Moreover, AutoML systems typically explore a large search space, which can lead to overfitting. This paper introduces a metalearning method for dynamically designing search spaces for AutoML system. The proposed method uses historical metaknowledge to select promising regions of the search space, accelerating the optimization process. According to experiments conducted for this study, the proposed method can reduce runtime by 89\% in Random Search and search space by (1.8/13 preprocessor and 4.3/16 classifier), without compromising significant predictive performance. Moreover, the proposed method showed competitive performance when adapted to Auto-Sklearn, reducing its search space. Furthermore, this study encompasses insights into meta-feature selection, meta-model explainability, and the trade-offs inherent in search space reduction strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: In real-world applications, machine learning models face online label shift, where label distributions change over time. Effective adaptation requires careful learning rate selection: too low slows adaptation and too high causes instability. We propose ASAP (Adaptive Shift Aware Post-training), which dynamically adjusts the learning rate by computing the cosine distance between current and previous unlabeled outputs and mapping it within a bounded range. ASAP requires no labels, model ensembles, or past inputs, using only the previous softmax output for fast, lightweight adaptation. Experiments across multiple datasets and shift scenarios show ASAP consistently improves accuracy and efficiency, making it practical for unsupervised model adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruobing Jiang, Mengzhe Liu, Haobing Liu, Yanwei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes. The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak" optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline models.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study presents a pipeline leveraging t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for interpretable visualizations of chirp features across diverse outcome scenarios. The dataset, comprising chirp-based temporal, spectral, and frequency metrics. Using t-SNE, local neighborhood relationships were preserved while addressing the crowding problem through Student t-distribution-based similarity optimization. Three classification tasks were formulated on the 2D t-SNE embeddings: (1) distinguishing clinical success from failure/no-resection, (2) separating high-difficulty from low-difficulty cases, and (3) identifying optimal cases, defined as successful outcomes with minimal clinical difficulty. Four classifiers, namely, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors, were trained and evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Across tasks, the Random Forest and k-NN classifiers demonstrated superior performance, achieving up to 88.8% accuracy in optimal case detection (successful outcomes with minimal clinical difficulty). Additionally, feature influence sensitivity maps were generated using SHAP explanations applied to model predicting t-SNE coordinates, revealing spatially localized feature importance within the embedding space. These maps highlighted how specific chirp attributes drive regional clustering and class separation, offering insights into the latent structure of the data. The integrated framework showcases the potential of interpretable embeddings and local feature attribution for clinical stratification and decision support.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengyu Lai, Yixiao Chen, Hui Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for linearization. This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework for PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address this challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent space, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear interactions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in turbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details and nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in existing neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a dynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate linear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical systems. Experimental results across diverse PDE benchmarks demonstrate that DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing prediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios reaching up to 86.7\%, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel, computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'es P\'aez</p>
<p>Abstract: The opaqueness of many complex machine learning algorithms is often mentioned as one of the main obstacles to the ethical development of artificial intelligence (AI). But what does it mean for an algorithm to be opaque? Highly complex algorithms such as artificial neural networks process enormous volumes of data in parallel along multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes, rendering their inner workings epistemically inaccessible to any human being, including their designers and developers; they are "black boxes" for all their stakeholders. But opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical complexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from view for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision systems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness. In the first part of the chapter, we will examine these two ways of understanding opacity and the ethical implications that stem from each of them. In the second part, we explore the different explanatory methods that have been developed in computer science to overcome an AI system's technical opaqueness. As the analysis shows, explainable AI (XAI) still faces numerous challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyan Wu, Ivan Korolija, Rui Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid, maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance. Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a critical public health threat within hospitals as well as long-term care facilities. Better understanding of MRSA risks, evaluation of interventions and forecasting MRSA rates are important public health problems. Existing forecasting models rely on statistical or neural network approaches, which lack epidemiological interpretability, and have limited performance. Mechanistic epidemic models are difficult to calibrate and limited in incorporating diverse datasets. We present CALYPSO, a hybrid framework that integrates neural networks with mechanistic metapopulation models to capture the spread dynamics of infectious diseases (i.e., MRSA) across healthcare and community settings. Our model leverages patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare transfer patterns to learn region- and time-specific parameters governing MRSA spread. This enables accurate, interpretable forecasts at multiple spatial resolutions (county, healthcare facility, region, state) and supports counterfactual analyses of infection control policies and outbreak risks. We also show that CALYPSO improves statewide forecasting performance by over 4.5% compared to machine learning baselines, while also identifying high-risk regions and cost-effective strategies for allocating infection prevention resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changshuai Wei, Qing Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Risk prediction that capitalizes on emerging genetic findings holds great promise for improving public health and clinical care. However, recent risk prediction research has shown that predictive tests formed on existing common genetic loci, including those from genome-wide association studies, have lacked sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Because most rare variants on the genome have not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease prediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction strategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are proposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk prediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an extension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional procedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the use of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set. We found that a prediction model built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on common variants alone AUC = 0.585. We further evaluated the performance of two approaches by gradually reducing the number of common variants in the analysis. We found that the CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when the number of common variants in the data decreased. In an extreme scenario, when there are only rare variants in the data, the CROC reached an AUC value of 0.603, whereas the FROC had an AUC value of 0.524.</p>

<p>Abstract: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2019, designated Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a serious antimicrobial resistance threat. The risk of acquiring MRSA and suffering life-threatening consequences due to it remains especially high for hospitalized patients due to a unique combination of factors, including: co-morbid conditions, immuno suppression, antibiotic use, and risk of contact with contaminated hospital workers and equipment. In this paper, we present a novel generative probabilistic model, GenHAI, for modeling sequences of MRSA test results outcomes for patients during a single hospitalization. This model can be used to answer many important questions from the perspectives of hospital administrators for mitigating the risk of MRSA infections. Our model is based on the probabilistic programming paradigm, and can be used to approximately answer a variety of predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model by comparing it against discriminative and generative machine learning models using two real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingyu Si, Jingyao Wang, Wenwen Qiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has recently demonstrated superiority in multiple downstream tasks. In this paper, we generalize the standard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of two parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three existing SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be unified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further propose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into designing the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class information of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is challenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties. To address this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and inter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship between anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or far from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further away from the anchor point in the feature space. Both the theoretical analysis and the empirical evaluation demonstrate the superiority of ADC.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13607">Bounding Causal Effects and Counterfactuals</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Maringgele</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured confounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice. Partial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on unverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives bounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its theoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied work, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of practical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically comparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal scenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a common evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a recently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to counterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving both discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method in terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to assumption violations. To support practitioners, we distill our findings into a practical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning model to predict the best-performing method based on observable data characteristics.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13625">Towards a Larger Model via One-Shot Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Client Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Ye, Xueli An, Onur Ayan, Junfan Wang, Xueqiang Yan, Georg Carle</p>
<p>Abstract: Large models, renowned for superior performance, outperform smaller ones even without billion-parameter scales. While mobile network servers have ample computational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy constraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared model by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it requires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which neglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients, and increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose FedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot settings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter sharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange model prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces communication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full model weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model architectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may be biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth labels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate these issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that iteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning reliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label generation and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates diverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks where clients possess valuable private data but limited computational resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Tian, Wenshuo Chen, Zexi Li, Songning Lai, Jiemin Wu, Yutao Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: How far are we really from automatically generating neural networks? While neural network weight generation shows promise, current approaches struggle with generalization to unseen tasks and practical application exploration. To address this, we propose T2W, a diffusion transformer framework that generates task-specific weights conditioned on natural language descriptions. T2W hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integrates text embeddings from CLIP via a prior attention mechanism, and employs adversarial training with weight-space augmentation to enhance generalization. Experiments on Cifar100, Caltech256, and TinyImageNet demonstrate T2W's ability to produce high-quality weights for unseen tasks, outperforming optimization-based initialization and enabling novel applications such as weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion. Our work bridges textual semantics with weight-space dynamics, supported by an open-source dataset of text-weight pairs, advancing the practicality of generative models in neural network parameter synthesis. Our code is available on Github.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern machine learning is trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD), whose performance critically depends on how the learning rate (LR) is adjusted and decreased over time. Yet existing LR regimes may be intricate, or need to tune one or more additional hyper-parameters manually whose bottlenecks include huge computational expenditure, time and power in practice. This work, in a natural and direct manner, clarifies how LR should be updated automatically only according to the intrinsic variation of stochastic gradients. An explainable LR regime by leveraging stochastic second-order algorithms is developed, behaving a similar pattern to heuristic algorithms but implemented simply without any parameter tuning requirement, where it is of an automatic procedure that LR should increase (decrease) as the norm of stochastic gradients decreases (increases). The resulting LR regime shows its efficiency, robustness, and scalability in different classical stochastic algorithms, containing SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD, on machine learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenfei Liang, Yanan Zhao, Rui She, Yiming Li, Wee Peng Tay</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many applications. In subgraph federated learning (FL), this data is distributed across clients, each with a local subgraph. Personalized subgraph FL aims to develop a customized model for each client to handle diverse data distributions. However, performance variation across clients remains a key issue due to the heterogeneity of local subgraphs. To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework built on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors with efficient personalized model generation. Specifically, FedSheafHN embeds each client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph by leveraging graph-level embeddings and employing sheaf diffusion within the collaboration graph to enrich client representations. Subsequently, FedSheafHN generates customized client models via a server-optimized hypernetwork. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets. Additionally, it exhibits fast model convergence and effectively generalizes to new clients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashish Jha, Anh huy Phan, Razan Dibo, Valentin Leplat</p>
<p>Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each batch, (ii) applies a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset that spans the batch's dominant subspace, and (iii) dynamically adjusts the subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion. By operating in low-rank subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples instead of full batches, GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy consumption, and $\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions. Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, providing a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rapheal Huang (Yuming), Weilong Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out". Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Rezaei Balef, Katharina Eggensperger</p>
<p>Abstract: Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH) has been fundamental to traditional AutoML systems. However, with the advancements of pre-trained models, modern ML workflows go beyond hyperparameter optimization and often require fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques. While the core challenge of identifying the best-performing model for a downstream task remains, the increasing heterogeneity of ML pipelines demands novel AutoML approaches. This work extends the CASH framework to select and adapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit adapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed bandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to efficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via in-context learning. We show how to extend this method to consider varying costs of pulling arms and to use different PFNs to model reward distributions individually per arm. Experimental results on one novel and two existing standard benchmark tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PS-PFN compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies. We make our code and data available at https://github.com/amirbalef/CASHPlus.</p>

<p>Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method and can be viewed as an extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents. Experimental results on the SMAC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several maps.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13679">Heavy-tailed Linear Bandits: Adversarial Robustness, Best-of-both-worlds, and Beyond</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Canzhe Zhao, Shinji Ito, Shuai Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Heavy-tailed bandits have been extensively studied since the seminal work of \citet{Bubeck2012BanditsWH}. In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits, enabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed noises, have recently attracted significant attention \citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}. However, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few exceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits (MABs) \citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.
  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed bandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the loss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus function, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm for heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity assumption and achieves an $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ worst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\widetilde{O}(\log T)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework to the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed linear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an $\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the best-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose a general data-dependent learning rate, termed \textit{heavy-tailed noise aware stability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW regret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions are satisfied. By using HT-SPM and, in particular, a variance-reduced linear loss estimator, we obtain the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear bandits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolai Antonov, Pr\v{e}mysl \v{S}\r{u}cha, Mikol\'a\v{s} Janota, Jan H\r{u}la</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing research on single-machine scheduling is largely focused on exact algorithms, which perform well on typical instances but can significantly deteriorate on certain regions of the problem space. In contrast, data-driven approaches provide strong and scalable performance when tailored to the structure of specific datasets. Leveraging this idea, we focus on a single-machine scheduling problem where each job is defined by its weight, duration, due date, and deadline, aiming to minimize the total weight of tardy jobs. We introduce a novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines machine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible solutions, which is a common challenge for ML-based algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and adaptability across varied data scenarios, highlighting its flexibility for practical applications. In addition, we conduct a systematic exploration of ML models, addressing a common gap in similar studies by offering a detailed model selection process and providing insights into why the chosen model is the best fit.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a Trans-XFed architecture that combines federated learning with explainable AI techniques for supply chain credit assessment. The proposed model aims to address several key challenges, including privacy, information silos, class imbalance, non-identically and independently distributed (Non-IID) data, and model interpretability in supply chain credit assessment. We introduce a performance-based client selection strategy (PBCS) to tackle class imbalance and Non-IID problems. This strategy achieves faster convergence by selecting clients with higher local F1 scores. The FedProx architecture, enhanced with homomorphic encryption, is used as the core model, and further incorporates a transformer encoder. The transformer encoder block provides insights into the learned features. Additionally, we employ the integrated gradient explainable AI technique to offer insights into decision-making. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Trans-XFed through experimental evaluations on real-world supply chain datasets. The obtained results show its ability to deliver accurate credit assessments compared to several baselines, while maintaining transparency and privacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> No\"el Kury, Dmitry Kobak, Sebastian Damrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data in two dimensions. Existing methods are typically designed to preserve either local (e.g. $t$-SNE, UMAP) or global (e.g. MDS, PCA) structure of the data, but none of the established methods can represent both aspects well. In this paper, we present DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction Enhanced Across Multiple Scales), a method that combines the local structure preservation of $t$-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA via a simple regularization term. Our approach generates a spectrum of embeddings between the locally well-structured $t$-SNE embedding and the globally well-structured PCA embedding, efficiently balancing both local and global structure preservation. We benchmark DREAMS across seven real-world datasets, including five from single-cell transcriptomics and one from population genetics, showcasing qualitatively and quantitatively its superior ability to preserve structure across multiple scales compared to previous approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Taha Shah, Sabrina Khurshid, Gourab Ghatak</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of sequential decision-making for Sharpe ratio (SR) maximization in a stochastic bandit setting. We focus on the Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm, a Bayesian approach celebrated for its empirical performance and exploration efficiency, under the assumption of Gaussian rewards with unknown parameters. Unlike conventional bandit objectives focusing on maximizing cumulative reward, Sharpe ratio optimization instead introduces an inherent tradeoff between achieving high returns and controlling risk, demanding careful exploration of both mean and variance. Our theoretical contributions include a novel regret decomposition specifically designed for the Sharpe ratio, highlighting the role of information acquisition about the reward distribution in driving learning efficiency. Then, we establish fundamental performance limits for the proposed algorithm \texttt{SRTS} in terms of an upper bound on regret. We also derive the matching lower bound and show the order-optimality. Our results show that Thompson Sampling achieves logarithmic regret over time, with distribution-dependent factors capturing the difficulty of distinguishing arms based on risk-adjusted performance. Empirical simulations show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhicheng Yang, Zhijiang Guo, Yinya Huang, Yongxin Wang, Dongchun Xie, Yiwei Wang, Xiaodan Liang, Jing Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions: Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically, naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance. Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the reasoning power of RLVR.</p>

Although Transformer-based models have made significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and Transformer-based models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapid scaling of deep learning models has enabled performance gains across domains, yet it introduced several challenges. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of federated learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Koffi Ismael Ouattara, Ioannis Krontiris, Theo Dimitrakos, Frank Kargl</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI systems increasingly rely on training data, assessing dataset trustworthiness has become critical, particularly for properties like fairness or bias that emerge at the dataset level. Prior work has used Subjective Logic to assess trustworthiness of individual data, but not to evaluate trustworthiness properties that emerge only at the level of the dataset as a whole. This paper introduces the first formal framework for assessing the trustworthiness of AI training datasets, enabling uncertainty-aware evaluations of global properties such as bias. Built on Subjective Logic, our approach supports trust propositions and quantifies uncertainty in scenarios where evidence is incomplete, distributed, and/or conflicting. We instantiate this framework on the trustworthiness property of bias, and we experimentally evaluate it based on a traffic sign recognition dataset. The results demonstrate that our method captures class imbalance and remains interpretable and robust in both centralized and federated contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Imbalanced distribution learning is a common and significant challenge in predictive modeling, often reducing the performance of standard algorithms. Although various approaches address this issue, most are tailored to classification problems, with a limited focus on regression. This paper introduces a novel method to improve learning on tabular data within the Imbalanced Regression (IR) framework, which is a critical problem. We propose using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to model and define a latent representation of data distributions. However, VAEs can be inefficient with imbalanced data like other standard approaches. To address this, we develop an innovative data generation method that combines a disentangled VAE with a Smoothed Bootstrap applied in the latent space. We evaluate the efficiency of this method through numerical comparisons with competitors on benchmark datasets for IR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miko{\l}aj Janusz, Tomasz Wojnar, Yawei Li, Luca Benini, Kamil Adamczewski</p>
<p>Abstract: Pruning is a core technique for compressing neural networks to improve computational efficiency. This process is typically approached in two ways: one-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and iterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for potentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has historically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather than rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and comprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions, benchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying different pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has specific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning ratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on these findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid approach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios, providing valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy tailored to their goals and constraints.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicol\`o Romandini, Cristian Borcea, Rebecca Montanari, Luca Foschini</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can be vulnerable to attacks, such as model poisoning, where adversaries send malicious local weights to compromise the global model. Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address such vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected malicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining. However, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative, applying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging because their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This work presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently mitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within the attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on clients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify which connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due to overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this by carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge the most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while preserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial threat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full knowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and Non-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a model retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data. FedUP achieves effective unlearning while consistently being faster and saving storage compared to the SOTA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rouqaiah Al-Refai, Pankaja Priya Ramasamy, Ragini Ramesh, Patricia Arias-Cabarcos, Philipp Terh\"orst</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance on biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience, highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the suitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most modalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence with expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key open challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yishun Lu, Wesley Armour</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory, enabling them to support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of training samples. However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform effectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise decreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of first-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global minimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high damping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively washes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage, reducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent. In this paper, we introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that restores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster convergence. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by leveraging gradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with a component of the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the Fisher-metric.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13904">Revisiting Diffusion Q-Learning: From Iterative Denoising to One-Step Action Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Thanh Nguyen, Chang D. Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled high-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning (RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among them, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its consistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice due to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both training and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply applying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we revisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action generation during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary models, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While conventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step generation, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates direct, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for multi-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster and more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based baselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time compared to DQL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianheng Ling, Vipin Singh, Chao Qian, Felix Biessmann, Gregor Schiele</p>
<p>Abstract: Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, increasingly challenge aging combined sewer systems, raising the risk of untreated wastewater overflow. Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution. Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE 0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general, our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more resilient combined sewer systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> SM Mazharul Islam, Manfred Huber</p>
<p>Abstract: A policy in deep reinforcement learning (RL), either deterministic or stochastic, is commonly parameterized as a Gaussian distribution alone, limiting the learned behavior to be unimodal. However, the nature of many practical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates robust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges arising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic adaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control domains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted optimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling process of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical Policies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical distribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the sampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable discrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based optimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the behavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining fully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy on a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through better exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform standard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical distribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and multimodal behavior representation in continuous control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bastian Sch\"afer, Lennart Purucker, Maciej Janowski, Frank Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular data, consisting of rows and columns, is omnipresent across various machine learning applications. Each column represents a feature, and features can be combined or transformed to create new, more informative features. Such feature engineering is essential to achieve peak performance in machine learning. Since manual feature engineering is expensive and time-consuming, a substantial effort has been put into automating it. Yet, existing automated feature engineering (AutoFE) methods have never been investigated regarding their usability for practitioners. Thus, we investigated 53 AutoFE methods. We found that these methods are, in general, hard to use, lack documentation, and have no active communities. Furthermore, no method allows users to set time and memory constraints, which we see as a necessity for usable automation. Our survey highlights the need for future work on usable, well-engineered AutoFE methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Yang, Kei Ikemura, Qingwen Zhang, Xiaomeng Zhu, Ci Li, Nazre Batool, Sina Sharif Mansouri, John Folkesson</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent multi-task learning studies suggest that linear scalarization, when using well-chosen fixed task weights, can achieve comparable to or even better performance than complex multi-task optimization (MTO) methods. It remains unclear why certain weights yield optimal performance and how to determine these weights without relying on exhaustive hyperparameter search. This paper establishes a direct connection between linear scalarization and MTO methods, revealing through extensive experiments that well-performing scalarization weights exhibit specific trends in key MTO metrics, such as high gradient magnitude similarity. Building on this insight, we introduce AutoScale, a simple yet effective two-phase framework that uses these MTO metrics to guide weight selection for linear scalarization, without expensive weight search. AutoScale consistently shows superior performance with high efficiency across diverse datasets including a new large-scale benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiho Park, Huiwen Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model, a new combinatorial bandit framework that captures realistic online advertising scenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items simultaneously. Unlike classical contextual bandits, MCCB integrates three key structural elements: (i) cascading feedback based on sequential arm exposure, (ii) parallel context sessions enabling selective exploration, and (iii) heterogeneous arm-level rewards. We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and prove that it achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$ episodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the fact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a second algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning (AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e., user scaling, with a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$. We validate our theoretical findings via numerical experiments, demonstrating the empirical effectiveness of both algorithms under various settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naman Tyagi, Srishti Das,  Kunal, Vatsal Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the Knob-Meter-Rule (KMR) framework, a unified formalism for representing and reasoning about model efficiency techniques in deep learning. By abstracting diverse methods, including pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and parameter-efficient architectures, into a consistent set of controllable knobs, deterministic rules, and measurable meters, KMR provides a mathematically precise and modular perspective on efficiency optimization. The framework enables systematic composition of multiple techniques, flexible policy-driven application, and iterative budgeted optimization through the Budgeted-KMR algorithm. We demonstrate how well-known efficiency methods can be instantiated as KMR triples and present concise algorithmic templates for each. The framework highlights underlying relationships between methods, facilitates hybrid pipelines, and lays the foundation for future research in automated policy learning, dynamic adaptation, and theoretical analysis of cost-quality trade-offs. Overall, KMR offers both a conceptual and practical tool for unifying and advancing model efficiency research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantized neural networks can be viewed as a chain of noisy channels, where rounding in each layer reduces capacity as bit-width shrinks; the floating-point (FP) checkpoint sets the maximum input rate. We track capacity dynamics as the average bit-width decreases and identify resulting quantization bottlenecks by casting fine-tuning as a smooth, constrained optimization problem. Our approach employs a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator (STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale and clamp bounds, and enforces a target bit-width via an exterior-point penalty; mild metric smoothing (via distillation) stabilizes training. Despite its simplicity, the method attains competitive accuracy down to the extreme W1A1 setting while retaining the efficiency of STE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Izadi, Mehran Safayani</p>
<p>Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition marked by disruptions in brain connectivity. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function. Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD, highlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanjun Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: A datatset $X$ on $R^2$ is a finite topological space. Current research of a dataset focuses on statistical methods and the algebraic topological method \cite{carlsson}. In \cite{hu}, the concept of typed topological space was introduced and showed to have the potential for studying finite topological spaces, such as a dataset. It is a new method from the general topology perspective. A typed topological space is a topological space whose open sets are assigned types. Topological concepts and methods can be redefined using open sets of certain types. In this article, we develop a special set of types and its related typed topology on a dataset $X$. Using it, we can investigate the inner structure of $X$. In particular, $R^2$ has a natural quotient space, in which $X$ is organized into tracks, and each track is split into components. Those components are in a order. Further, they can be represented by an integer sequence. Components crossing tracks form branches, and the relationship can be well represented by a type of pseudotree (called typed-II pseudotree). Such structures provide a platform for new algorithms for problems such as calculating convex hull, holes, clustering and anomaly detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Xiao, Ruimeng Ye, Bohan Liu, Xiaolong Ma, Bo Hui</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to regulations like the Right to be Forgotten, there is growing demand for removing training data and its influence from models. Since full retraining is costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this paper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning algorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive structure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning by estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant computational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this end, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to approximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of first-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically, we use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data removal. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives dominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without constructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning baselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dario Coscia, Pim de Haan, Max Welling</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a central tool in simulation-based chemistry. However, like most deep learning models, MLIPs struggle to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution data or when trained in a data-scarce regime, both common scenarios in simulation-based chemistry. Moreover, MLIPs do not provide uncertainty estimates by construction, which are fundamental to guide active learning pipelines and to ensure the accuracy of simulation results compared to quantum calculations. To address this shortcoming, we propose BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic Potentials. BLIP is a scalable, architecture-agnostic variational Bayesian framework for training or fine-tuning MLIPs, built on an adaptive version of Variational Dropout. BLIP delivers well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and minimal computational overhead for energy and forces prediction at inference time, while integrating seamlessly with (equivariant) message-passing architectures. Empirical results on simulation-based computational chemistry tasks demonstrate improved predictive accuracy with respect to standard MLIPs, and trustworthy uncertainty estimates, especially in data-scarse or heavy out-of-distribution regimes. Moreover, fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs with BLIP yields consistent performance gains and calibrated uncertainties.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a general method for learning in sequential settings, but it can often be difficult to specify a good reward function when the task is complex. In these cases, preference feedback or expert demonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both together are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale. We develop a new framing for learning from human data, \emph{reward-rational partial orderings over observations}, designed to be flexible and scalable. Based on this we introduce a practical algorithm, LEOPARD: Learning Estimated Objectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations. LEOPARD can learn from a broad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn reward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited amount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, we use LEOPARD to investigate learning from many types of feedback compared to just a single one, and find that combining feedback types is often beneficial.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI hardware design is advancing rapidly, driven by the promise of design automation to make chip development faster, more efficient, and more accessible to a wide range of users. Amongst automation tools, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by automating and streamlining parts of the design process. However, their potential is hindered by data privacy concerns and the lack of domain-specific training. To address this, we introduce FedChip, a Federated fine-tuning approach that enables multiple Chip design parties to collaboratively enhance a shared LLM dedicated for automated hardware design generation while protecting proprietary data. FedChip enables parties to train the model on proprietary local data and improve the shared LLM's performance. To exemplify FedChip's deployment, we create and release APTPU-Gen, a dataset of 30k design variations spanning various performance metric values such as power, performance, and area (PPA). To encourage the LLM to generate designs that achieve a balance across multiple quality metrics, we propose a new design evaluation metric, Chip@k, which statistically evaluates the quality of generated designs against predefined acceptance criteria. Experimental results show that FedChip improves design quality by more than 77% over high-end LLMs while maintaining data privacy</p>

<p>Abstract: In particular, large-scale deep learning and artificial intelligence model training uses a lot of computational power and energy, so it poses serious sustainability issues. The fast rise in model complexity has resulted in exponential increases in energy consumption, increasing the demand for techniques maximizing computational efficiency and lowering environmental impact. This work explores environmentally driven performance optimization methods especially intended for advanced GPU architectures from NVIDIA, AMD, and other emerging GPU architectures. Our main focus is on investigating hardware-software co-design techniques meant to significantly increase memory-level and kernel-level operations, so improving performance-per-watt measures. Our thorough research encompasses evaluations of specialized tensor and matrix cores, advanced memory optimization methods, and creative integration approaches that taken together result in notable energy efficiency increases. We also discuss important software-level optimizations that augment hardware capability including mixed-precision arithmetic, advanced energy-aware scheduling algorithms, and compiler-driven kernel enhancements. Moreover, we methodically point out important research gaps and suggest future directions necessary to create really sustainable artificial intelligence systems. This paper emphasizes how major increases in training efficiency can be obtained by co-design of hardware and software, so lowering the environmental impact of artificial intelligence without compromising performance. To back up our analysis, we use real-world case studies from top companies like Meta, Google, Amazon, and others that show how these sustainable AI training methods are used in the real world.</p>

A custom convolutional neural network was trained on ASL-derived cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps from 186 cognitively healthy individuals (89 males and 97 females, ages 8-92 years), achieving 95% accuracy in sex classification and revealing robust sex-specific perfusion signatures. Regional analyses identified significantly elevated CBF in females across medial Brodmann areas 6 and 10, the visual area of the cortex, the polar occipital cortex, and both ventral and dorsal dysgranular insula, highlighting sex-specific neurovascular specialization in motor, cognitive, sensory, and affective domains. In addition, we observed a consistent global age-related decline in CBF across both sexes, reflecting progressive cerebrovascular aging. To integrate these findings, we propose a biologically informed Vascular Risk Score (VRS) derived from age- and sex-stratified normative CBF distributions. The VRS enables individualized assessment of cerebral perfusion integrity by quantifying deviations from expected normative patterns. This metric offers a sensitive, personalized biomarker for detecting early hypoperfusion and stratifying vascular contributions to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, thereby advancing the goals of precision neurology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongjun Ding, Binqi Chen, Jinsheng Huang, Taian Guo, Zhengyang Mao, Guoyi Shao, Lutong Zou, Luchen Liu, Ming Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data, is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery, systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote reproducibility and community engagement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwen Han, Meher Mankikar, Julian Michael, Zifan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks: Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prateek Ranka, Fred Morstatter, Andrea Belz, Alexandra Graddy-Reed</p>
<p>Abstract: Classification of scientific abstracts is useful for strategic activities but challenging to automate because the sparse text provides few contextual clues. Metadata associated with the scientific publication can be used to improve performance but still often requires a semi-supervised setting. Moreover, such schemes may generate labels that lack distinction -- namely, they overlap and thus do not uniquely define the abstract. In contrast, experts label and sort these texts with ease. Here we describe an application of a process we call artificial intuition to replicate the expert's approach, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate metadata. We use publicly available abstracts from the United States National Science Foundation to create a set of labels, and then we test this on a set of abstracts from the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation to examine funding trends. We demonstrate the feasibility of this method for research portfolio management, technology scouting, and other strategic activities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyang Jia, Zheng Wei, Zheng Yang, Guohong Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the complex and stochastic nature of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) remains a central challenge in systems biology. Existing modeling paradigms often struggle to effectively capture the intricate, multi-factor regulatory logic and to rigorously manage the dual uncertainties of network structure and kinetic parameters. In response, this work introduces the Probabilistic Categorical GRN(PC-GRN) framework. It is a novel theoretical approach founded on the synergistic integration of three core methodologies. Firstly, category theory provides a formal language for the modularity and composition of regulatory pathways. Secondly, Bayesian Typed Petri Nets (BTPNs) serve as an interpretable,mechanistic substrate for modeling stochastic cellular processes, with kinetic parameters themselves represented as probability distributions. The central innovation of PC-GRN is its end-to-end generative Bayesian inference engine, which learns a full posterior distribution over BTPN models (P (G, {\Theta}|D)) directly from data. This is achieved by the novel interplay of a GFlowNet, which learns a policy to sample network topologies, and a HyperNetwork, which performs amortized inference to predict their corresponding parameter distributions. The resulting framework provides a mathematically rigorous, biologically interpretable, and uncertainty-aware representation of GRNs, advancing predictive modeling and systems-level analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederik Baucks, Robin Schmucker, Laurenz Wiskott</p>
<p>Abstract: Curriculum analytics (CA) studies curriculum structure and student data to ensure the quality of educational programs. An essential aspect is studying course properties, which involves assigning each course a representative difficulty value. This is critical for several aspects of CA, such as quality control (e.g., monitoring variations over time), course comparisons (e.g., articulation), and course recommendation (e.g., advising). Measuring course difficulty requires careful consideration of multiple factors: First, when difficulty measures are sensitive to the performance level of enrolled students, it can bias interpretations by overlooking student diversity. By assessing difficulty independently of enrolled students' performances, we can reduce the risk of bias and enable fair, representative assessments of difficulty. Second, from a measurement theoretic perspective, the measurement must be reliable and valid to provide a robust basis for subsequent analyses. Third, difficulty measures should account for covariates, such as the characteristics of individual students within a diverse populations (e.g., transfer status). In recent years, various notions of difficulty have been proposed. This paper provides the first comprehensive review and comparison of existing approaches for assessing course difficulty based on grade point averages and latent trait modeling. It further offers a hands-on tutorial on model selection, assumption checking, and practical CA applications. These applications include monitoring course difficulty over time and detecting courses with disparate outcomes between distinct groups of students (e.g., dropouts vs. graduates), ultimately aiming to promote high-quality, fair, and equitable learning experiences. To support further research and application, we provide an open-source software package and artificial datasets, facilitating reproducibility and adoption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vladimir Berman</p>
<p>Abstract: This article presents a modern deterministic framework for the study of leading significant digit distributions in numerical data. Rather than relying on traditional probabilistic or mixture-based explanations, we demonstrate that the observed frequencies of leading digits are determined by the underlying arithmetic, algorithmic, and structural properties of the data-generating process. Our approach centers on a shift-invariant functional equation, whose general solution is given by explicit affine-plus-periodic formulas. This structural formulation explains the diversity of digit distributions encountered in both empirical and mathematical datasets, including cases with pronounced deviations from logarithmic or scale-invariant profiles.
  We systematically analyze digit distributions in finite and infinite datasets, address deterministic sequences such as prime numbers and recurrence relations, and highlight the emergence of block-structured and fractal features. The article provides critical examination of probabilistic models, explicit examples and counterexamples, and discusses limitations and open problems for further research. Overall, this work establishes a unified mathematical foundation for digital phenomena and offers a versatile toolset for modeling and analyzing digit patterns in applied and theoretical contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leander Melroy Maben, Keerthana Prasad, Shyamala Guruvare, Vidya Kudva, P C Siddalingaswamy</p>
<p>Abstract: Cervical cancer is among the most commonly occurring cancer among women and claims a huge number of lives in low and middle-income countries despite being relatively easy to treat. Several studies have shown that public screening programs can bring down cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates significantly. While several screening tests are available, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) presents itself as the most viable option for low-resource settings due to the affordability and simplicity of performing the test. VIA requires a trained medical professional to interpret the test and is subjective in nature. Automating VIA using AI eliminates subjectivity and would allow shifting of the task to less trained health workers. Task shifting with AI would help further expedite screening programs in low-resource settings. In our work, we propose a lightweight deep learning algorithm that includes EfficientDet-Lite3 as the Region of Interest (ROI) detector and a MobileNet- V2 based model for classification. These models would be deployed on an android-based device that can operate remotely and provide almost instant results without the requirement of highly-trained medical professionals, labs, sophisticated infrastructure, or internet connectivity. The classification model gives an accuracy of 92.31%, a sensitivity of 98.24%, and a specificity of 88.37% on the test dataset and presents itself as a promising automated low-resource screening approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeynep Ozdemir, Hacer Yalim Keles, Omer Ozgur Tanriover</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness. Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches 82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah Al Nomaan Nafi, Habibur Rahaman, Zafaryab Haider, Tanzim Mahfuz, Fnu Suya, Swarup Bhunia, Prabuddha Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion, enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates (e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM, LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively). Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted adaptive attacks for each new defense.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13313">Flow Matching-Based Generative Modeling for Efficient and Scalable Data Assimilation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Taos Transue, Bohan Chen, So Takao, Bao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is the problem of sequentially estimating the state of a dynamical system from noisy observations. Recent advances in generative modeling have inspired new approaches to DA in high-dimensional nonlinear settings, especially the ensemble score filter (EnSF). However, these come at a significant computational burden due to slow sampling. In this paper, we introduce a new filtering framework based on flow matching (FM) -- called the ensemble flow filter (EnFF) -- to accelerate sampling and enable flexible design of probability paths. EnFF -- a training-free DA approach -- integrates MC estimators for the marginal FM vector field (VF) and a localized guidance to assimilate observations. EnFF has faster sampling and more flexibility in VF design compared to existing generative modeling for DA. Theoretically, we show that EnFF encompasses classical filtering methods such as the bootstrap particle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter as special cases. Experiments on high-dimensional filtering benchmarks demonstrate improved cost-accuracy tradeoffs and the ability to leverage larger ensembles than prior methods. Our results highlight the promise of FM as a scalable tool for filtering in high-dimensional applications that enable the use of large ensembles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tadeu Freitas, Carlos Novo, In\^es Dutra, Jo\~ao Soares, Manuel Correia, Benham Shariati, Rolando Martins</p>
<p>Abstract: Intrusion Tolerant Systems (ITSs) have become increasingly critical due to the rise of multi-domain adversaries exploiting diverse attack surfaces. ITS architectures aim to tolerate intrusions, ensuring system compromise is prevented or mitigated even with adversary presence. Existing ITS solutions often employ Risk Managers leveraging public security intelligence to adjust system defenses dynamically against emerging threats. However, these approaches rely heavily on databases like NVD and ExploitDB, which require manual analysis for newly discovered vulnerabilities. This dependency limits the system's responsiveness to rapidly evolving threats. HAL 9000, an ITS Risk Manager introduced in our prior work, addressed these challenges through machine learning. By analyzing descriptions of known vulnerabilities, HAL 9000 predicts and assesses new vulnerabilities automatically. To calculate the risk of a system, it also incorporates the Exploitability Probability Scoring system to estimate the likelihood of exploitation within 30 days, enhancing proactive defense capabilities.
  Despite its success, HAL 9000's reliance on NVD and ExploitDB knowledge is a limitation, considering the availability of other sources of information. This extended work introduces a custom-built scraper that continuously mines diverse threat sources, including security advisories, research forums, and real-time exploit proofs-of-concept. This significantly expands HAL 9000's intelligence base, enabling earlier detection and assessment of unverified vulnerabilities. Our evaluation demonstrates that integrating scraper-derived intelligence with HAL 9000's risk management framework substantially improves its ability to address emerging threats. This paper details the scraper's integration into the architecture, its role in providing additional information on new threats, and the effects on HAL 9000's management.</p>

<p>Abstract: Earth observation analytics have the potential to serve many time-sensitive applications. However, due to limited bandwidth and duration of ground-satellite connections, it takes hours or even days to download and analyze data from existing Earth observation satellites, making real-time demands like timely disaster response impossible. Toward real-time analytics, we introduce OrbitChain, a collaborative analytics framework that orchestrates computational resources across multiple satellites in an Earth observation constellation. OrbitChain decomposes analytics applications into microservices and allocates computational resources for time-constrained analysis. A traffic routing algorithm is devised to minimize the inter-satellite communication overhead. OrbitChain adopts a pipeline workflow that completes Earth observation tasks in real-time, facilitates time-sensitive applications and inter-constellation collaborations such as tip-and-cue. To evaluate OrbitChain, we implement a hardware-in-the-loop orbital computing testbed. Experiments show that our system can complete up to 60% analytics workload than existing Earth observation analytics framework while reducing the communication overhead by up to 72%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured, multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs. Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449 tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.</p>

<p>Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50 baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved 95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50. In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaewan Moon, Seongmin Park, Jongwuk Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to enrich the semantic representation of textual item information in recommender systems. However, existing linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich textual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of LLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous knowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase optimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item correlation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns an item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling semantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is optimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L3AE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three benchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20.

<p>Abstract: User recommendation systems enhance user engagement by encouraging users to act as inviters to interact with other users (invitees), potentially fostering information propagation. Conventional recommendation methods typically focus on modeling interaction willingness. Influence-Maximization (IM) methods focus on identifying a set of users to maximize the information propagation. However, existing methods face two significant challenges. First, recommendation methods fail to unleash the candidates' spread capability. Second, IM methods fail to account for the willingness to interact. To solve these issues, we propose two models named HeteroIR and HeteroIM. HeteroIR provides an intuitive solution to unleash the dissemination potential of user recommendation systems. HeteroIM fills the gap between the IM method and the recommendation task, improving interaction willingness and maximizing spread coverage. The HeteroIR introduces a two-stage framework to estimate the spread profits. The HeteroIM incrementally selects the most influential invitee to recommend and rerank based on the number of reverse reachable (RR) sets containing inviters and invitees. RR set denotes a set of nodes that can reach a target via propagation. Extensive experiments show that HeteroIR and HeteroIM significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines with the p-value < 0.05. Furthermore, we have deployed HeteroIR and HeteroIM in Tencent's online gaming platforms and gained an 8.5\% and 10\% improvement in the online A/B test, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hassan Barmandah</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50 split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from 47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead, we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohit Raj Rai, Chirag Kothari, Siddhesh Shelke, Amit Awekar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks: natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ninth AI City Challenge continues to advance real-world applications of computer vision and AI in transportation, industrial automation, and public safety. The 2025 edition featured four tracks and saw a 17% increase in participation, with 245 teams from 15 countries registered on the evaluation server. Public release of challenge datasets led to over 30,000 downloads to date. Track 1 focused on multi-class 3D multi-camera tracking, involving people, humanoids, autonomous mobile robots, and forklifts, using detailed calibration and 3D bounding box annotations. Track 2 tackled video question answering in traffic safety, with multi-camera incident understanding enriched by 3D gaze labels. Track 3 addressed fine-grained spatial reasoning in dynamic warehouse environments, requiring AI systems to interpret RGB-D inputs and answer spatial questions that combine perception, geometry, and language. Both Track 1 and Track 3 datasets were generated in NVIDIA Omniverse. Track 4 emphasized efficient road object detection from fisheye cameras, supporting lightweight, real-time deployment on edge devices. The evaluation framework enforced submission limits and used a partially held-out test set to ensure fair benchmarking. Final rankings were revealed after the competition concluded, fostering reproducibility and mitigating overfitting. Several teams achieved top-tier results, setting new benchmarks in multiple tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diego Correa da Silva, Denis Robson Dantas Boaventura, Mayki dos Santos Oliveira, Eduardo Ferreira da Silva, Joel Machado Pires, Frederico Ara\'ujo Dur\~ao</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional recommender systems aim to generate a recommendation list comprising the most relevant or similar items to the user's profile. These approaches can create recommendation lists that omit item genres from the less prominent areas of a user's profile, thereby undermining the user's experience. To solve this problem, the calibrated recommendation system provides a guarantee of including less representative areas in the recommended list. The calibrated context works with three distributions. The first is from the user's profile, the second is from the candidate items, and the last is from the recommendation list. These distributions are G-dimensional, where G is the total number of genres in the system. This high dimensionality requires a different evaluation method, considering that traditional recommenders operate in a one-dimensional data space. In this sense, we implement fifteen models that help to understand how these distributions are structured. We evaluate the users' patterns in three datasets from the movie domain. The results indicate that the models of outlier detection provide a better understanding of the structures. The calibrated system creates recommendation lists that act similarly to traditional recommendation lists, allowing users to change their groups of preferences to the same degree.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah Tokmak, Thomas B. Sch\"on, Dominik Baumann</p>
<p>Abstract: Many safety-critical real-world problems, such as autonomous driving and collaborative robots, are of a distributed multi-agent nature. To optimize the performance of these systems while ensuring safety, we can cast them as distributed optimization problems, where each agent aims to optimize their parameters to maximize a coupled reward function subject to coupled constraints. Prior work either studies a centralized setting, does not consider safety, or struggles with sample efficiency. Since we require sample efficiency and work with unknown and nonconvex rewards and constraints, we solve this optimization problem using safe Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression. Moreover, we consider nearest-neighbor communication between the agents. To capture the behavior of non-neighboring agents, we reformulate the static global optimization problem as a time-varying local optimization problem for each agent, essentially introducing time as a latent variable. To this end, we propose a custom spatio-temporal kernel to integrate prior knowledge. We show the successful deployment of our algorithm in simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Daza, Alberto Bernardi, Luca Costabello, Christophe Gueret, Masoud Mansoury, Michael Cochez, Martijn Schut</p>
<p>Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges. However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker (NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively, refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints while maintaining robust query answering performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results across various tasks, yet their reasoning capabilities remain a fundamental challenge. Developing AI systems with strong reasoning capabilities is regarded as a crucial milestone in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and has garnered considerable attention from both academia and industry. Various techniques have been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, with neuro-symbolic approaches being a particularly promising way. This paper comprehensively reviews recent developments in neuro-symbolic approaches for enhancing LLM reasoning. We first present a formalization of reasoning tasks and give a brief introduction to the neurosymbolic learning paradigm. Then, we discuss neuro-symbolic methods for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs from three perspectives: Symbolic->LLM, LLM->Symbolic, and LLM+Symbolic. Finally, we discuss several key challenges and promising future directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vy Tuong Dang, An Vo, Quang Tau, Duc Dm, Daeyoung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments, investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3 (74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance, decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Shao, Zequan Liang, Ruoyu Zhang, Ruijie Fang, Ning Miao, Ehsan Kourkchi, Setareh Rafatirad, Houman Homayoun, Chongzhou Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Biometric authentication using physiological signals offers a promising path toward secure and user-friendly access control in wearable devices. While electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have shown high discriminability, their intrusive sensing requirements and discontinuous acquisition limit practicality. Photoplethysmography (PPG), on the other hand, enables continuous, non-intrusive authentication with seamless integration into wrist-worn wearable devices. However, most prior work relies on high-frequency PPG (e.g., 75 - 500 Hz) and complex deep models, which incur significant energy and computational overhead, impeding deployment in power-constrained real-world systems. In this paper, we present the first real-world implementation and evaluation of a continuous authentication system on a smartwatch, We-Be Band, using low-frequency (25 Hz) multi-channel PPG signals. Our method employs a Bi-LSTM with attention mechanism to extract identity-specific features from short (4 s) windows of 4-channel PPG. Through extensive evaluations on both public datasets (PTTPPG) and our We-Be Dataset (26 subjects), we demonstrate strong classification performance with an average test accuracy of 88.11%, macro F1-score of 0.88, False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.48%, False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 11.77%, and Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2.76%. Our 25 Hz system reduces sensor power consumption by 53% compared to 512 Hz and 19% compared to 128 Hz setups without compromising performance. We find that sampling at 25 Hz preserves authentication accuracy, whereas performance drops sharply at 20 Hz while offering only trivial additional power savings, underscoring 25 Hz as the practical lower bound. Additionally, we find that models trained exclusively on resting data fail under motion, while activity-diverse training improves robustness across physiological states.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nizheen A. Ali, Ramadhan J. Mstafa</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread use of the internet, there is an increasing need to ensure the security and privacy of transmitted data. This has led to an intensified focus on the study of video steganography, which is a technique that hides data within a video cover to avoid detection. The effectiveness of any steganography method depends on its ability to embed data without altering the original video quality while maintaining high efficiency. This paper proposes a new method to video steganography, which involves utilizing a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for identifying the Region of Interest (ROI) in the cover video. The ROI is the area in the video that is the most suitable for data embedding. The secret data is encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is a widely accepted encryption standard, before being embedded into the cover video, utilizing up to 10% of the cover video. This process ensures the security and confidentiality of the embedded data. The performance metrics for assessing the proposed method are the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and the encoding and decoding time. The results show that the proposed method has a high embedding capacity and efficiency, with a PSNR ranging between 64 and 75 dBs, which indicates that the embedded data is almost indistinguishable from the original video. Additionally, the method can encode and decode data quickly, making it efficient for real time applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanna Herasimchyk, Alhassan Abdelhalim, S\"oren Laue, Michaela Regneri</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features, known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information, concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.</p>

<p>Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities, the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity, achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianbin Tan, Anru R. Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Functional data, i.e., smooth random functions observed over a continuous domain, are increasingly available in areas such as biomedical research, health informatics, and epidemiology. However, effective statistical analysis for functional data is often hindered by challenges such as privacy constraints, sparse and irregular sampling, infinite dimensionality, and non-Gaussian structures. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework named Smooth Flow Matching (SFM), tailored for generative modeling of functional data to enable statistical analysis without exposing sensitive real data. Built upon flow-matching ideas, SFM constructs a semiparametric copula flow to generate infinite-dimensional functional data, free from Gaussianity or low-rank assumptions. It is computationally efficient, handles irregular observations, and guarantees the smoothness of the generated functions, offering a practical and flexible solution in scenarios where existing deep generative methods are not applicable. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the advantages of SFM in terms of both synthetic data quality and computational efficiency. We then apply SFM to generate clinical trajectory data from the MIMIC-IV patient electronic health records (EHR) longitudinal database. Our analysis showcases the ability of SFM to produce high-quality surrogate data for downstream statistical tasks, highlighting its potential to boost the utility of EHR data for clinical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangdao Liu, Huajun Xi, Chi-Man Vong, Hongxin Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Selecting a subset of promising candidates from a large pool is crucial across various scientific and real-world applications. Conformal selection offers a distribution-free and model-agnostic framework for candidate selection with uncertainty quantification. While effective in offline settings, its application to online scenarios, where data arrives sequentially, poses challenges. Notably, conformal selection permits the deselection of previously selected candidates, which is incompatible with applications requiring irreversible selection decisions. This limitation is particularly evident in resource-intensive sequential processes, such as drug discovery, where advancing a compound to subsequent stages renders reversal impractical. To address this issue, we extend conformal selection to an online Accept-to-Reject Changes (ARC) procedure: non-selected data points can be reconsidered for selection later, and once a candidate is selected, the decision is irreversible. Specifically, we propose a novel conformal selection method, Online Conformal Selection with Accept-to-Reject Changes (dubbed OCS-ARC), which incorporates online Benjamini-Hochberg procedure into the candidate selection process. We provide theoretical guarantees that OCS-ARC controls the false discovery rate (FDR) at or below the nominal level at any timestep under both i.i.d. and exchangeable data assumptions. Additionally, we theoretically show that our approach naturally extends to multivariate response settings. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that OCS-ARC significantly improves selection power over the baseline while maintaining valid FDR control across all examined timesteps.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study theoretical predictive performance of ridge and ridge-less least-squares regression when covariate vectors arise from evaluating $p$ random, means-square continuous functions over a latent metric space at $n$ random and unobserved locations, subject to additive noise. This leads us away from the standard assumption of i.i.d. data to a setting in which the $n$ covariate vectors are exchangeable but not independent in general. Under an assumption of independence across dimensions, $4$-th order moment, and other regularity conditions, we obtain probabilistic bounds on a notion of predictive excess risk adapted to our random functional covariate setting, making use of recent results of Barzilai and Shamir. We derive convergence rates in regimes where $p$ grows suitably fast relative to $n$, illustrating interplay between ingredients of the model in determining convergence behaviour and the role of additive covariate noise in benign-overfitting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Am\'endola, Benjamin Hollering, Francesco Nowell</p>
<p>Abstract: Max-linear Bayesian networks (MLBNs) are a relatively recent class of structural equation models which arise when the random variables involved have heavy-tailed distributions. Unlike most directed graphical models, MLBNs are typically not faithful to d-separation and thus classical causal discovery algorithms such as the PC algorithm or greedy equivalence search can not be used to accurately recover the true graph structure. In this paper, we begin the study of constraint-based discovery algorithms for MLBNs given an oracle for testing conditional independence in the true, unknown graph. We show that if the oracle is given by the $\ast$-separation criteria in the true graph, then the PC algorithm remains consistent despite the presence of additional CI statements implied by $\ast$-separation. We also introduce a new causal discovery algorithm named "PCstar" which assumes faithfulness to $C^\ast$-separation and is able to orient additional edges which cannot be oriented with only d- or $\ast$-separation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multidimensional data is often associated with uncertainties that are not well-described by normal distributions. In this work, we describe how such distributions can be projected to a low-dimensional space using uncertainty-aware principal component analysis (UAPCA). We propose to model multidimensional distributions using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and derive the projection from a general formulation that allows projecting arbitrary probability density functions. The low-dimensional projections of the densities exhibit more details about the distributions and represent them more faithfully compared to UAPCA mappings. Further, we support including user-defined weights between the different distributions, which allows for varying the importance of the multidimensional distributions. We evaluate our approach by comparing the distributions in low-dimensional space obtained by our method and UAPCA to those obtained by sample-based projections.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generalization in embodied AI is hindered by the "seeing-to-doing gap," which stems from data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity. To address this, we pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruben Lier</p>
<p>Abstract: H-theorem provides a microscopic foundation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and is therefore essential to establishing statistical physics, but at the same time, H-theorem has been subject to controversy that in part persists till this day. To better understand H-theorem and its relation to the arrow of time, we study the equilibration of randomly oriented and positioned hard disks with periodic boundary conditions. Using a model based on the DeepSets architecture, which imposes permutation invariance of the particle labels, we train a model to capture the irreversibility of the H-functional.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyoon Hahm, Taywon Min, Woogyeol Jin, Kimin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks. Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1) generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance gains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Sun, Lu Pang, Weimin Lyu, Chao Chen, Haibin Ling</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an adversary manipulates the model behavior through overlaying images with special triggers. Existing backdoor defense methods often require accessing a few validation data and model parameters, which is impractical in many real-world applications, e.g., when the model is provided as a cloud service. In this paper, we address the practical task of blind backdoor defense at test time, in particular for local attacks and black-box models. The true label of every test image needs to be recovered on the fly from a suspicious model regardless of image benignity. We consider test-time image purification that incapacitates local triggers while keeping semantic contents intact. Due to diverse trigger patterns and sizes, the heuristic trigger search can be unscalable. We circumvent such barrier by leveraging the strong reconstruction power of generative models, and propose Blind Defense with Masked AutoEncoder (BDMAE). BDMAE detects possible local triggers using image structural similarity and label consistency between the test image and MAE restorations. The detection results are then refined by considering trigger topology. Finally, we fuse MAE restorations adaptively into a purified image for making prediction. Extensive experiments under different backdoor settings validate its effectiveness and generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Th\'eo Uscidda, Luca Eyring, Karsten Roth, Fabian Theis, Zeynep Akata, Marco Cuturi</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning disentangled representations from unlabelled data is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Solving it may unlock other problems, such as generalization, interpretability, or fairness. Although remarkably challenging to solve in theory, disentanglement is often achieved in practice through prior matching. Furthermore, recent works have shown that prior matching approaches can be enhanced by leveraging geometrical considerations, e.g., by learning representations that preserve geometric features of the data, such as distances or angles between points. However, matching the prior while preserving geometric features is challenging, as a mapping that fully preserves these features while aligning the data distribution with the prior does not exist in general. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach to disentangled representation learning based on quadratic optimal transport. We formulate the problem using Gromov-Monge maps that transport one distribution onto another with minimal distortion of predefined geometric features, preserving them as much as can be achieved. To compute such maps, we propose the Gromov-Monge-Gap (GMG), a regularizer quantifying whether a map moves a reference distribution with minimal geometry distortion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for disentanglement across four standard benchmarks, outperforming other methods leveraging geometric considerations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nasir Ahmad</p>
<p>Abstract: Herein the topics of (natural) gradient descent, data decorrelation, and approximate methods for backpropagation are brought into a common discussion. Natural gradient descent illuminates how gradient vectors, pointing at directions of steepest descent, can be improved by considering the local curvature of loss landscapes. We extend this perspective and show that to fully solve the problem illuminated by natural gradients in neural networks, one must recognise that correlations in the data at any linear transformation, including node responses at every layer of a neural network, cause a non-orthonormal relationship between the model's parameters. To solve this requires a method for decorrelating inputs at each individual layer of a neural network. We describe a range of methods which have been proposed for decorrelation and whitening of node output, and expand on these to provide a novel method specifically useful for distributed computing and computational neuroscience. Implementing decorrelation within multi-layer neural networks, we can show that not only is training via backpropagation sped up significantly but also existing approximations of backpropagation, which have failed catastrophically in the past, benefit significantly in their accuracy and convergence speed. This has the potential to provide a route forward for approximate gradient descent methods which have previously been discarded, training approaches for analogue and neuromorphic hardware, and potentially insights as to the efficacy and utility of decorrelation processes in the brain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Ibrahim, Heraldo Rozas, Nagi Gebraeel, Weijun Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a federated classification problem over a network of multiple clients and a central server, in which each client's local data remains private and is subject to uncertainty in both the features and labels. To address these uncertainties, we develop a novel Federated Distributionally Robust Support Vector Machine (FDR-SVM), robustifying the classification boundary against perturbations in local data distributions. Specifically, the data at each client is governed by a unique true distribution that is unknown. To handle this heterogeneity, we develop a novel Mixture of Wasserstein Balls (MoWB) ambiguity set, naturally extending the classical Wasserstein ball to the federated setting. We then establish theoretical guarantees for our proposed MoWB, deriving an out-of-sample performance bound and showing that its design preserves the separability of the FDR-SVM optimization problem. Next, we rigorously derive two algorithms that solve the FDR-SVM problem and analyze their convergence behavior as well as their worst-case time complexity. We evaluate our algorithms on industrial data and various UCI datasets, whereby we demonstrate that they frequently outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongfan Gao, Wangmeng Shen, Xiangfei Qiu, Ronghui Xu, Jilin Hu, Bin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Probabilistic time series imputation has been widely applied in real-world scenarios due to its ability for uncertainty estimation and denoising diffusion probabilistic models~(DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)\textit{The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the dependencies in the time series data effectively.} To address the first challenge, we explore the potential of state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denoising module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for time series data modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple real-world datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shrenik Zinage, Ilias Bilionis, Peter Meckl</p>
<p>Abstract: The stringent regulatory requirements on nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from diesel compression ignition engines require accurate and reliable models for real-time monitoring and diagnostics. Although traditional methods such as physical sensors and virtual engine control module (ECM) sensors provide essential data, they are only used for estimation. Ubiquitous literature primarily focuses on deterministic models with little emphasis on capturing the various uncertainties. The lack of probabilistic frameworks restricts the applicability of these models for robust diagnostics. The objective of this paper is to develop and validate a probabilistic model to predict engine-out NOx emissions using Gaussian process regression. Our approach is as follows. We employ three variants of Gaussian process models: the first with a standard radial basis function kernel with input window, the second incorporating a deep kernel using convolutional neural networks to capture temporal dependencies, and the third enriching the deep kernel with a causal graph derived via graph convolutional networks. The causal graph embeds physics knowledge into the learning process. All models are compared against a virtual ECM sensor using both quantitative and qualitative metrics. We conclude that our model provides an improvement in predictive performance when using an input window and a deep kernel structure. Even more compelling is the further enhancement achieved by the incorporation of a causal graph into the deep kernel. These findings are corroborated across different verification and validation datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hu Wang, Congbo Ma, Ibrahim Almakky, Ian Reid, Gustavo Carneiro, Mohammad Yaqub</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging, particularly through weight averaging, has shown surprising effectiveness in saving computations and improving model performance without any additional training. However, the interpretability of why and how this technique works remains unclear. In this work, we reinterpret weight-averaged model merging through the lens of interpretability and provide empirical insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern its behavior. We approach the problem from three perspectives: (1) we analyze the learned weight structures and demonstrate that model weights encode structured representations that help explain the compatibility of weight averaging; (2) we compare averaging in weight space and feature space across diverse model architectures (CNNs and ViTs) and datasets, aiming to expose under which circumstances what combination paradigm will work more effectively; (3) we study the effect of parameter scaling on prediction stability, highlighting how weight averaging acts as a form of regularization that contributes to robustness. By framing these analyses in an interpretability context, our work contributes to a more transparent and systematic understanding of model merging for stakeholders interested in the safety and reliability of untrained model combination methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Zheng Lin, Qinxuan Shi, Zhanglong Yang, Banafsheh Saber Latibari, Shalaka Satam, Sicong Shao, Soheil Salehi, Pratik Satam</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology enables real-time simulation, prediction, and optimization of physical systems, but practical deployment faces challenges from high data requirements, proprietary data constraints, and limited adaptability to evolving conditions. This work introduces DDD-GenDT, a dynamic data-driven generative digital twin framework grounded in the Dynamic Data-Driven Application Systems (DDDAS) paradigm. The architecture comprises the Physical Twin Observation Graph (PTOG) to represent operational states, an Observation Window Extraction process to capture temporal sequences, a Data Preprocessing Pipeline for sensor structuring and filtering, and an LLM ensemble for zero-shot predictive inference. By leveraging generative AI, DDD-GenDT reduces reliance on extensive historical datasets, enabling DT construction in data-scarce settings while maintaining industrial data privacy. The DDDAS feedback mechanism allows the DT to autonomically adapt predictions to physical twin (PT) wear and degradation, supporting DT-aging, which ensures progressive synchronization of DT with PT evolution. The framework is validated using the NASA CNC milling dataset, with spindle current as the monitored variable. In a zero-shot setting, the GPT-4-based DT achieves an average RMSE of 0.479 A (4.79% of the 10 A spindle current), accurately modeling nonlinear process dynamics and PT aging without retraining. These results show that DDD-GenDT provides a generalizable, data-efficient, and adaptive DT modeling approach, bridging generative AI with the performance and reliability requirements of industrial DT applications.</p>

Acquiring this data has historically been challenging, but geographic information systems data is becoming increasingly available with higher resolution and accuracy. Access to such details enables propagation models to more accurately predict coverage and account for interference in wireless deployments. Machine learning-based modeling can significantly support this effort, with feature based approaches allowing for accurate, efficient, and scalable propagation modeling. Building on previous work, we introduce an extended set of features that improves prediction accuracy while, most importantly, proving model generalization through rigorous statistical assessment and the use of test set holdouts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert O'Shea, Bipin Rajendran</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for backpropagation-free learning employ local error feedback to direct iterative optimisation via gradient descent. In this study, we examine the more restrictive setting where retrograde communication from neuronal outputs is unavailable for pre-synaptic weight optimisation. To address this challenge, we propose Forward Projection (FP). This novel randomised closed-form training method requires only a single forward pass over the entire dataset for model fitting, without retrograde communication. Target values for pre-activation membrane potentials are generated layer-wise via nonlinear projections of pre-synaptic inputs and the labels. Local loss functions are optimised over pre-synaptic inputs using closed-form regression, without feedback from neuronal outputs or downstream layers. Interpretability is a key advantage of FP training; membrane potentials of hidden neurons in FP-trained networks encode information which is interpretable layer-wise as label predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FP across four biomedical datasets. In few-shot learning tasks, FP yielded more generalisable models than those optimised via backpropagation. In large-sample tasks, FP-based models achieve generalisation comparable to gradient descent-based local learning methods while requiring only a single forward propagation step, achieving significant speed up for training. Interpretation functions defined on local neuronal activity in FP-based models successfully identified clinically salient features for diagnosis in two biomedical datasets. Forward Projection is a computationally efficient machine learning approach that yields interpretable neural network models without retrograde communication of neuronal activity during training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael E. Sander, Vincent Roulet, Tianlin Liu, Mathieu Blondel</p>
<p>Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) offer a flexible framework for parameterizing probability distributions using neural networks. However, learning EBMs by exact maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is generally intractable, due to the need to compute the partition function (normalization constant). In this paper, we propose a novel formulation for approximately learning probabilistic EBMs in combinatorially-large discrete spaces, such as sets or permutations. Our key idea is to jointly learn both an energy model and its log-partition, both parameterized as a neural network. Our approach not only provides a novel tractable objective criterion to learn EBMs by stochastic gradient descent (without relying on MCMC), but also a novel means to estimate the log-partition function on unseen data points. On the theoretical side, we show that our approach recovers the optimal MLE solution when optimizing in the space of continuous functions. Furthermore, we show that our approach naturally extends to the broader family of Fenchel-Young losses, allowing us to obtain the first tractable method for optimizing the sparsemax loss in combinatorially-large spaces. We demonstrate our approach on multilabel classification and label ranking.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a cost-efficient active learning (AL) framework for classification, featuring a novel query design called candidate set query. Unlike traditional AL queries requiring the oracle to examine all possible classes, our method narrows down the set of candidate classes likely to include the ground-truth class, significantly reducing the search space and labeling cost. Moreover, we leverage conformal prediction to dynamically generate small yet reliable candidate sets, adapting to model enhancement over successive AL rounds. To this end, we introduce an acquisition function designed to prioritize data points that offer high information gain at lower cost. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet64x64 demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our framework. Notably, it reduces labeling cost by 48% on ImageNet64x64.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suryanarayana Sankagiri, Jalal Etesami, Matthias Grossglauser</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper provides a theoretical analysis of a new learning problem for recommender systems where users provide feedback by comparing pairs of items instead of rating them individually. We assume that comparisons stem from latent user and item features, which reduces the task of predicting preferences to learning these features from comparison data. Similar to the classical matrix factorization problem, the main challenge in this learning task is that the resulting loss function is nonconvex. Our analysis shows that the loss function exhibits (restricted) strong convexity near the true solution, which ensures gradient-based methods converge exponentially, given an appropriate warm start. Importantly, this result holds in a sparse data regime, where each user compares only a few pairs of items. Our main technical contribution is to extend certain concentration inequalities commonly used in matrix completion to our model. Our work demonstrates that learning personalized recommendations from comparison data is computationally and statistically efficient.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a physics-based regularization technique for function learning, inspired by statistical mechanics. By drawing an analogy between optimizing the parameters of an interpolator and minimizing the energy of a system, we introduce corrections that impose constraints on the lower-order moments of the data distribution. This minimizes the discrepancy between the discrete and continuum representations of the data, in turn allowing to access more favorable energy landscapes, thus improving the accuracy of the interpolator. Our approach improves performance in both interpolation and regression tasks, even in high-dimensional spaces. Unlike traditional methods, it does not require empirical parameter tuning, making it particularly effective for handling noisy data. We also show that thanks to its local nature, the method offers computational and memory efficiency advantages over Radial Basis Function interpolators, especially for large datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasir Zubayr Barlas, Kizito Salako</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments in sequential experimental design look to construct a policy that can efficiently navigate the design space, in a way that maximises the expected information gain. Whilst there is work on achieving tractable policies for experimental design problems, there is significantly less work on obtaining policies that are able to generalise well - i.e. able to give good performance despite a change in the underlying statistical properties of the experiments. Conducting experiments sequentially has recently brought about the use of reinforcement learning, where an agent is trained to navigate the design space to select the most informative designs for experimentation. However, there is still a lack of understanding about the benefits and drawbacks of using certain reinforcement learning algorithms to train these agents. In our work, we investigate several reinforcement learning algorithms and their efficacy in producing agents that take maximally informative design decisions in sequential experimental design scenarios. We find that agent performance is impacted depending on the algorithm used for training, and that particular algorithms, using dropout or ensemble approaches, empirically showcase attractive generalisation properties.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we will establish that the Langevin Monte-Carlo algorithm can learn depth-2 neural nets of any size and for any data and we give non-asymptotic convergence rates for it. We achieve this via showing that in q-Renyi divergence, the iterates of Langevin Monte Carlo converge to the Gibbs distribution of Frobenius norm regularized losses for any of these nets, when using smooth activations and in both classification and regression settings. Most critically, the amount of regularization needed for our results is independent of the size of the net. This result achieves a synthesis of several recent observations about isoperimetry conditions under which LMC converges and that two-layer neural loss functions can always be regularized by a certain constant amount such that they satisfy the Villani conditions, and thus their Gibbs measures satisfy a Poincare inequality.</p>

In this work, we take a closer look at the optimization objective of adversarial trigger learning and propose ATLA: Adversarial Trigger Learning with Augmented objectives. ATLA improves the negative log-likelihood loss used by previous studies into a weighted loss formulation that encourages the learned adversarial triggers to optimize more towards response format tokens. This enables ATLA to learn an adversarial trigger from just one query-response pair and the learned trigger generalizes well to other similar queries. We further design a variation to augment trigger optimization with an auxiliary loss that suppresses evasive responses. We showcase how to use ATLA to learn adversarial suffixes jailbreaking LLMs and to extract hidden system prompts. Empirically we demonstrate that ATLA consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, achieving nearly 100% success in attacking while requiring 80% fewer queries. ATLA learned jailbreak suffixes demonstrate high generalization to unseen queries and transfer well to new LLMs. We released our code https://github.com/QData/ALTA_Augmented_Adversarial_Trigger_Learning</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruobing Jiang, Yacong Li, Haobing Liu, Yanwei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) are composed of multiple types of nodes and edges, making it more effective in capturing the complex relational structures inherent in the real world. However, in real-world scenarios, labeled data is often difficult to obtain, which limits the applicability of semi-supervised approaches. Self-supervised learning aims to enable models to automatically learn useful features from data, effectively addressing the challenge of limited labeling data. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework for heterogeneous graphs (ASHGCL), which incorporates three distinct views, each focusing on node attributes, high-order and low-order structural information, respectively, to effectively capture attribute information, high-order structures, and low-order structures for node representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce an attribute-enhanced positive sample selection strategy that combines both structural information and attribute information, effectively addressing the issue of sampling bias. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that ASHGCL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised baselines and even surpasses some supervised benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdo Abouelrous, Laurens Bliek, Adriana F. Gabor, Yaoxin Wu, Yingqian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of Column Generation (CG) using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, we use a RL model based on the attention-mechanism architecture to find the columns with most negative reduced cost in the Pricing Problem (PP). Unlike previous Machine Learning (ML) applications for CG, our model deploys an end-to-end mechanism as it independently solves the pricing problem without the help of any heuristic. We consider a variant of Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) as a case study for our method. Through a set of experiments where our method is compared against a Dynamic Programming (DP)-based heuristic for solving the PP, we show that our method solves the linear relaxation up to a reasonable objective gap in significantly shorter running times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Rauch, Ren\'e Heinrich, Ilyass Moummad, Alexis Joly, Bernhard Sick, Christoph Scholz</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) learn rich semantic representations in audio classification through an efficient self-supervised reconstruction task. However, general-purpose models fail to generalize well when applied directly to fine-grained audio domains. Specifically, bird-sound classification requires distinguishing subtle inter-species differences and managing high intra-species acoustic variability, revealing the performance limitations of general-domain Audio-MAEs. This work demonstrates that bridging this domain gap domain gap requires full-pipeline adaptation, not just domain-specific pretraining data. We systematically revisit and adapt the pretraining recipe, fine-tuning methods, and frozen feature utilization to bird sounds using BirdSet, a large-scale bioacoustic dataset comparable to AudioSet. Our resulting Bird-MAE achieves new state-of-the-art results in BirdSet's multi-label classification benchmark. Additionally, we introduce the parameter-efficient prototypical probing, enhancing the utility of frozen MAE representations and closely approaching fine-tuning performance in low-resource settings. Bird-MAE's prototypical probes outperform linear probing by up to 37 percentage points in mean average precision and narrow the gap to fine-tuning across BirdSet downstream tasks. Bird-MAE also demonstrates robust few-shot capabilities with prototypical probing in our newly established few-shot benchmark on BirdSet, highlighting the potential of tailored self-supervised learning pipelines for fine-grained audio domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhui Pang, Changqing Lin, Hao Lin, Zhihui Zhang, Weiping Ding, Yu Liu, Xiaoshuai Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (GFSCIL) enables models to continually learn from limited samples of novel tasks after initial training on a large base dataset. Existing GFSCIL approaches typically utilize Prototypical Networks (PNs) for metric-based class representations and fine-tune the model during the incremental learning stage. However, these PN-based methods oversimplify learning via novel query set fine-tuning and fail to integrate Graph Continual Learning (GCL) techniques due to architectural constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a more rigorous and practical setting for GFSCIL that excludes query sets during the incremental training phase. Building on this foundation, we introduce Model-Agnostic Meta Graph Continual Learning (MEGA), aimed at effectively alleviating catastrophic forgetting for GFSCIL. Specifically, by calculating the incremental second-order gradient during the meta-training stage, we endow the model to learn high-quality priors that enhance incremental learning by aligning its behaviors across both the meta-training and incremental learning stages. Extensive experiments on four mainstream graph datasets demonstrate that MEGA achieves state-of-the-art results and enhances the effectiveness of various GCL methods in GFSCIL. We believe that our proposed MEGA serves as a model-agnostic GFSCIL paradigm, paving the way for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Nuertey Coleman, Luigi Quarantiello, Ziyue Liu, Qinwen Yang, Samrat Mukherjee, Julio Hurtado, Vincenzo Lomonaco</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of large pre-trained networks has revolutionized the AI field, unlocking new possibilities and achieving unprecedented performance. However, these models inherit a fundamental limitation from traditional Machine Learning approaches: their strong dependence on the \textit{i.i.d.} assumption hinders their adaptability to dynamic learning scenarios. We believe the next breakthrough in AI lies in enabling efficient adaptation to evolving environments -- such as the real world -- where new data and tasks arrive sequentially. This challenge defines the field of Continual Learning (CL), a Machine Learning paradigm focused on developing lifelong learning neural models. One alternative to efficiently adapt these large-scale models is known Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). These methods tackle the issue of adapting the model to a particular data or scenario by performing small and efficient modifications, achieving similar performance to full fine-tuning. However, these techniques still lack the ability to adjust the model to multiple tasks continually, as they suffer from the issue of Catastrophic Forgetting. In this survey, we first provide an overview of CL algorithms and PEFT methods before reviewing the state-of-the-art on Parameter-Efficient Continual Fine-Tuning (PECFT). We examine various approaches, discuss evaluation metrics, and explore potential future research directions. Our goal is to highlight the synergy between CL and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, guide researchers in this field, and pave the way for novel future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charlie Hou, Mei-Yu Wang, Yige Zhu, Daniel Lazar, Giulia Fanti</p>
<p>Abstract: In practical settings, differentially private Federated learning (DP-FL) is the dominant method for training models from private, on-device client data. Recent work has suggested that DP-FL may be enhanced or outperformed by methods that use DP synthetic data (Wu et al., 2024; Hou et al., 2024). The primary algorithms for generating DP synthetic data for FL applications require careful prompt engineering based on public information and/or iterative private client feedback. Our key insight is that the private client feedback collected by prior DP synthetic data methods (Hou et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024) can be viewed as an RL (reinforcement learning) reward. Our algorithm, Policy Optimization for Private Data (POPri) harnesses client feedback using policy optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune LLMs to generate high-quality DP synthetic data. To evaluate POPri, we release LargeFedBench, a new federated text benchmark for uncontaminated LLM evaluations on federated client data. POPri substantially improves the utility of DP synthetic data relative to prior work on LargeFedBench datasets and an existing benchmark from Xie et al. (2024). POPri closes the gap between next-token prediction accuracy in the fully-private and non-private settings by up to 58%, compared to 28% for prior synthetic data methods, and 3% for state-of-the-art DP federated learning methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiping Ji, Hemanth Saratchandran, Peyman Moghadam, Simon Lucey</p>
<p>Abstract: We highlight a curious empirical result within modern Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, self-attention catastrophically fails to train unless it is used in conjunction with a skip connection. This is in contrast to other elements of a ViT that continue to exhibit good performance (albeit suboptimal) when skip connections are removed. Further, we show that this critical dependence on skip connections is a relatively new phenomenon, with previous deep architectures (\eg, CNNs) exhibiting good performance in their absence. In this paper, we theoretically characterize that the self-attention mechanism is fundamentally ill-conditioned and is, therefore, uniquely dependent on skip connections for regularization. Additionally, we propose Token Graying -- a simple yet effective complement (to skip connections) that further improves the condition of input tokens. We validate our approach in both supervised and self-supervised training methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is pivotal in machine learning, especially for classification tasks, as it improves the robustness and reliability of models. We introduce a novel `Epistemic Wrapping' methodology aimed at improving uncertainty estimation in classification. Our approach uses Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) as a baseline and transforms their outputs into belief function posteriors, effectively capturing epistemic uncertainty and offering an efficient and general methodology for uncertainty quantification. Comprehensive experiments employing a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) baseline and an Interval Neural Network for inference on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that our Epistemic Wrapper significantly enhances generalisation and uncertainty quantification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prudhviraj Naidu, Zixian Wang, Leon Bergen, Ramamohan Paturi</p>
<p>Abstract: We train Transformer-based language models on ten foundational algorithmic tasks and observe pronounced phase transitions in their loss curves that deviate from established power-law scaling trends. Over large ranges of compute, the validation loss barely improves, then abruptly decreases. Probing the models' internal representations reveals that quiet features are learned prior to any decrease in task loss. These quiet features represent intermediate algorithmic computations that do not by themselves improve the output loss. Ablation experiments demonstrate that individual quiet features are causally necessary for task performance. Our results demonstrate that substantial representational progress can remain hidden beneath an apparently flat loss curve, challenging the prevailing use of cross-entropy as a proxy for learning and motivating richer diagnostics for monitoring model training.</p>

<p>Abstract: This position paper argues that achieving meaningful scientific and societal advances with artificial intelligence (AI) requires a responsible, application-driven approach (RAD) to AI research. As AI is increasingly integrated into society, AI researchers must engage with the specific contexts where AI is being applied. This includes being responsive to ethical and legal considerations, technical and societal constraints, and public discourse. We present the case for RAD-AI to drive research through a three-staged approach: (1) building transdisciplinary teams and people-centred studies; (2) addressing context-specific methods, ethical commitments, assumptions, and metrics; and (3) testing and sustaining efficacy through staged testbeds and a community of practice. We present a vision for the future of application-driven AI research to unlock new value through technically feasible methods that are adaptive to the contextual needs and values of the communities they ultimately serve.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthias Chung, Bas Peters, Michael Solomon</p>
<p>Abstract: In this book chapter, we discuss recent advances in data-driven approaches for inverse problems. In particular, we focus on the \emph{paired autoencoder} framework, which has proven to be a powerful tool for solving inverse problems in scientific computing. The paired autoencoder framework is a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both data-driven and model-based methods by projecting both the data and the quantity of interest into a latent space and mapping these latent spaces to provide surrogate forward and inverse mappings. We illustrate the advantages of this approach through numerical experiments, including seismic imaging and classical inpainting: nonlinear and linear inverse problems, respectively. Although the paired autoencoder framework is likelihood-free, it generates multiple data- and model-based reconstruction metrics that help assess whether examples are in or out of distribution. In addition to direct model estimates from data, the paired autoencoder enables latent-space refinement to fit the observed data accurately. Numerical experiments show that this procedure, combined with the latent-space initial guess, is essential for high-quality estimates, even when data noise exceeds the training regime. We also introduce two novel variants that combine variational and paired autoencoder ideas, maintaining the original benefits while enabling sampling for uncertainty analysis.</p>

Guerra (Polytechnique Montr\'eal, Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute), Thomas Garbay (Polytechnique Montr\'eal, Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute), Guillaume Lajoie (Universit\'e de Montr\'eal, Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute), Marco Bonizzato (Polytechnique Montr\'eal, Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute)</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical Gaussian Process (H-GP) models divide problems into different subtasks, allowing for different models to address each part, making them well-suited for problems with inherent hierarchical structure. However, typical H-GP models do not fully take advantage of this structure, only sending information up or down the hierarchy. This one-way coupling limits sample efficiency and slows convergence. We propose Bidirectional Information Flow (BIF), an efficient H-GP framework that establishes bidirectional information exchange between parent and child models in H-GPs for online training. BIF retains the modular structure of hierarchical models - the parent combines subtask knowledge from children GPs - while introducing top-down feedback to continually refine children models during online learning. This mutual exchange improves sample efficiency, enables robust training, and allows modular reuse of learned subtask models. BIF outperforms conventional H-GP Bayesian Optimization methods, achieving up to 4x and 3x higher $R^2$ scores for the parent and children respectively, on synthetic and real-world neurostimulation optimization tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across vision, language, and scientific domains. Despite their empirical success, prior theoretical analyses of the sample complexity suffer from poor scaling with input data dimension or rely on unrealistic assumptions such as access to exact empirical risk minimizers. In this work, we provide a principled analysis of score estimation, establishing a sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$. Our approach leverages a structured decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical, approximation, and optimization errors, enabling us to eliminate the exponential dependence on neural network parameters that arises in prior analyses. It is the first such result which achieves sample complexity bounds without assuming access to the empirical risk minimizer of score function estimation loss.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojun Guo, Ang Li, Yifei Wang, Stefanie Jegelka, Yisen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress, their proficiency in graph-related tasks remains notably limited, hindering the development of truly general-purpose models. Previous attempts, including pretraining graph foundation models or employing supervised fine-tuning, often face challenges such as the scarcity of large-scale, universally represented graph data. We introduce G1, a simple yet effective approach demonstrating that Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic graph-theoretic tasks can significantly scale LLMs' graph reasoning abilities. To enable RL training, we curate Erd\~os, the largest graph reasoning dataset to date comprising 50 diverse graph-theoretic tasks of varying difficulty levels, 100k training data and 5k test data, all drived from real-world graphs. With RL on Erd\~os, G1 obtains substantial improvements in graph reasoning, where our finetuned 3B model even outperforms Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (24x size). RL-trained models also show strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, domains, and graph encoding schemes, including other graph-theoretic benchmarks as well as real-world node classification and link prediction tasks, without compromising general reasoning abilities. Our findings offer an efficient, scalable path for building strong graph reasoners by finetuning LLMs with RL on graph-theoretic tasks, which combines the strengths of pretrained LLM capabilities with abundant, automatically generated synthetic data, suggesting that LLMs possess graph understanding abilities that RL can elicit successfully.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Dai, Haodong Deng, Mengfei Rong, Xinyu Yang, Hongyu Liu, Fangxin Liu, Hailong Yang, Qianwen Cao, Qingxiao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are popular around the world due to their powerful understanding capabilities. As the core component of LLMs, accelerating Transformer through parallelization has gradually become a hot research topic. Mask layers introduce sparsity into Transformer to reduce calculations. However, previous works rarely focus on the performance optimization of sparse Transformer. Moreover, rule-based mechanisms ignore the fusion opportunities of mixed-type operators and fail to adapt to various sequence lengths. To address the above problems, we propose STOF, a framework that incorporates optimizations for Sparse Transformer via flexible masking and operator fusion on GPU. We firstly unify the storage format and kernel implementation for the multi-head attention. Then, we map fusion schemes to compilation templates and determine the optimal parameter setting through a two-stage search engine. The experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art work, STOF achieves maximum speedups of 1.7x in MHA computation and 1.5x in end-to-end inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asit Mishra, Dusan Stosic, Simon Layton, Paulius Micikevicius</p>
<p>Abstract: Using fewer bits to represent model parameters and related tensors during pre-training has become a required technique for improving GPU efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Microscaling (MX) formats introduced in NVIDIA Blackwell generation of GPUs represent a major advancement of this technique, making it practical to combine narrow floating-point data types with finer granularity per-block scaling factors. In turn, this enables both quantization of more tensors than previous approaches and more efficient execution of operations on those tensors.
  Effective use of MX-formats requires careful choices of various parameters. In this paper we review these choices and show how MXFP8-E4M3 datatype and a specific number conversion algorithm result in training sessions that match those carried out in BF16. We present results using models with up to 8B parameters, trained on high-quality datasets of up to 15T tokens.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. Although current table-native ICL architectures are architecturally efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, their exclusive training on synthetic data limits their ability to fully leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular data. At the other end of the spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Nicolas Peccia, Frederik Haxel, Oliver Bringmann</p>
<p>Abstract: RISC-V provides a flexible and scalable platform for applications ranging from embedded devices to high-performance computing clusters. Particularly, its RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI workloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of RISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the autovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like muRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing the integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the efficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a workflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V vector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the RVV extension into TVM's MetaSchedule framework, a probabilistic program framework for tensor operation tuning. We implemented different RISC-V SoCs on an FPGA and tuned a wide range of AI workloads on them. We found that our proposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared against the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN. Moreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory footprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also evaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the RVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that are 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM. We open-sourced our proposal for the community to expand it to target other RISC-V extensions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) seeks to recover closed-form mathematical expressions that describe observed data. While existing methods have advanced the discovery of either explicit mappings (i.e., $y = f(\mathbf{x})$) or discovering implicit relations (i.e., $F(\mathbf{x}, y)=0$), few modern and accessible frameworks support both. Moreover, most approaches treat each expression candidate in isolation, without reusing recurring structural patterns that could accelerate search. We introduce SymMatika, a hybrid SR algorithm that combines multi-island genetic programming (GP) with a reusable motif library inspired by biological sequence analysis. SymMatika identifies high-impact substructures in top-performing candidates and reintroduces them to guide future generations. Additionally, it incorporates a feedback-driven evolutionary engine and supports both explicit and implicit relation discovery using implicit-derivative metrics. Across benchmarks, SymMatika achieves state-of-the-art recovery rates on the Nguyen and Feynman benchmark suites, an impressive recovery rate of 61\% on Nguyen-12 compared to the next best 2\%, and strong placement on the error-complexity Pareto fronts on the Feynman equations and on a subset of 57 SRBench Black-box problems. Our results demonstrate the power of structure-aware evolutionary search for scientific discovery. To support broader research in interpretable modeling and symbolic discovery, we have open-sourced the full SymMatika framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Li, Xiu Su, Jingyi Wu, Feng Yang, Yang Liu, Yi Chen, Shan You, Chang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements in numerous areas such as multimedia. However, hallucination issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential. Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation (\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeonghye Kim, Yongjae Shin, Whiyoung Jung, Sunghoon Hong, Deunsol Yoon, Youngchul Sung, Kanghoon Lee, Woohyung Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization (RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.</p>

<p>Abstract: User activity sequences have emerged as one of the most important signals in recommender systems. We present a foundational model, PinFM, for understanding user activity sequences across multiple applications at a billion-scale visual discovery platform. We pretrain a transformer model with 20B+ parameters using extensive user activity data, then fine-tune it for specific applications, efficiently coupling it with existing models. While this pretraining-and-fine-tuning approach has been popular in other domains, such as Vision and NLP, its application in industrial recommender systems presents numerous challenges. The foundational model must be scalable enough to score millions of items every second while meeting tight cost and latency constraints imposed by these systems. Additionally, it should capture the interactions between user activities and other features and handle new items that were not present during the pretraining stage.
  We developed innovative techniques to address these challenges. Our infrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on Pinterest internal data. We demonstrate that PinFM can learn interactions between user sequences and candidate items by altering input sequences, leading to a 20% increase in engagement with new items. PinFM is now deployed to help improve the experience of more than a half billion users across various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongze Tan, Yuchen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces two novel modifications to the Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm [1], approached from a mixed-policy perspective. Standard policy gradient methods can suffer from instability and sample inefficiency, particularly in sparse reward settings. To address this, we first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding policy ($\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the training of the target policy ($\pion$). This approach improves training stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size. Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods, demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning. The proposed mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and exploitation, promising more stable and efficient policy optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition plays an important role in developing adaptive brain-computer communication systems, yet faces two fundamental challenges in practical implementations: (1) effective integration of non-stationary spatial-temporal neural patterns, (2) robust adaptation to dynamic emotional intensity variations in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes SST-CL, a novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of complex and nonlinear time series remains a challenging problem across engineering and scientific disciplines. Reservoir computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG) technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study. We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency. Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) graph of the same size, spectral radius, and fixed density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG. An ER graph with density matched to the DyRC-VG can in some conditions outperform both approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aakash Gore, Prasanna Chaporkar</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a stochastic multi-armed bandit setting where arms are partitioned into known clusters, such that the mean rewards of arms within a cluster differ by at most a known threshold. While the clustering structure is known a priori, the arm means are unknown. We derive an asymptotic lower bound on the regret that improves upon the classical bound of Lai & Robbins (1985). We then propose Clus-UCB, an efficient algorithm that closely matches this lower bound asymptotically. Clus-UCB is designed to exploit the clustering structure and introduces a new index to evaluate an arm, which depends on other arms within the cluster. In this way, arms share information among each other. We present simulation results of our algorithm and compare its performance against KL-UCB and other wellknown algorithms for bandits with dependent arms. Finally, we address some limitations of this work and conclude by mentioning some possible future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lars Graf, Thomas Ortner, Stanis{\l}aw Wo\'zniak, Angeliki Pantazi</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient. We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model, FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to varying input sampling rates.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers, and early detection remains a major clinical challenge due to the absence of specific symptoms and reliable biomarkers. In this work, we propose a new multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series, pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new biomarkers.

<p>Abstract: Using more test-time computation during language model inference, such as generating more intermediate thoughts or sampling multiple candidate answers, has proven effective in significantly improving model performance. This paper takes an initial step toward bridging the gap between practical language model inference and theoretical transformer analysis by incorporating randomness and sampling. We focus on in-context linear regression with continuous/binary coefficients, where our framework simulates language model decoding through noise injection and binary coefficient sampling. Through this framework, we provide detailed analyses of widely adopted inference techniques. Supported by empirical results, our theoretical framework and analysis demonstrate the potential for offering new insights into understanding inference behaviors in real-world language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shugang Hao, Hongbo Li, Lingjie Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: The binary exponential backoff scheme is widely used in WiFi 7 and still incurs poor throughput performance under dynamic channel environments. Recent model-based approaches (e.g., non-persistent and $p$-persistent CSMA) simply optimize backoff strategies under a known and fixed node density, still leading to a large throughput loss due to inaccurate node density estimation. This paper is the first to propose LLM transformer-based in-context learning (ICL) theory for optimizing channel access. We design a transformer-based ICL optimizer to pre-collect collision-threshold data examples and a query collision case. They are constructed as a prompt as the input for the transformer to learn the pattern, which then generates a predicted contention window threshold (CWT). To train the transformer for effective ICL, we develop an efficient algorithm and guarantee a near-optimal CWT prediction within limited training steps. As it may be hard to gather perfect data examples for ICL in practice, we further extend to allow erroneous data input in the prompt. We prove that our optimizer maintains minimal prediction and throughput deviations from the optimal values. Experimental results on NS-3 further demonstrate our approach's fast convergence and near-optimal throughput over existing model-based and DRL-based approaches under unknown node densities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bing Han, Feifei Zhao, Dongcheng Zhao, Guobin Shen, Ping Wu, Yu Shi, Yi Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning as service injects domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs), while challenging the original alignment mechanisms and introducing safety risks. A series of defense strategies have been proposed for the alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most post-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These methods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and fine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and utility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN) with Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety risks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety layers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety neurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons. We then project the safety neuron parameters onto safety directions, improving model safety while aligning more closely with human preferences. Extensive experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal parameter modifications, while preserving the model's utility. Furthermore, by introducing a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron cluster optimization mechanism, we achieve continual defense and generalization capability against unforeseen emerging safety concerns.</p>

<p>Abstract: Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data, including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency, Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models for sustainable livestock management.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes that deviate from the majority within a graph, playing a crucial role in applications such as social networks and e-commerce. Despite the current advancements in deep learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically, it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware representations. Meanwhile, FreeGAD identifies anchor nodes as pseudo-normal and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any training or iterative optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Demographic shifts, influenced by globalization, economic conditions, geopolitical events, and environmental factors, pose significant challenges for policymakers and researchers. Accurate demographic forecasting is essential for informed decision-making in areas such as urban planning, healthcare, and economic policy. This study explores the application of time series foundation models to predict demographic changes in the United States using datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau and Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). We evaluate the performance of the Time Series Foundation Model (TimesFM) against traditional baselines including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Linear Regression. Our experiments across six demographically diverse states demonstrate that TimesFM achieves the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) in 86.67% of test cases, with particularly strong performance on minority populations with sparse historical data. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained foundation models to enhance demographic analysis and inform proactive policy interventions without requiring extensive task-specific fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emmanouil Kritharakis, Dusan Jakovetic, Antonios Makris, Konstantinos Tserpes</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing private data. We consider FL scenarios wherein FL clients are subject to adversarial (Byzantine) attacks, while the FL server is trusted (honest) and has a trustworthy side dataset. This may correspond to, e.g., cases where the server possesses trusted data prior to federation, or to the presence of a trusted client that temporarily assumes the server role. Our approach requires only two honest participants, i.e., the server and one client, to function effectively, without prior knowledge of the number of malicious clients. Theoretical analysis demonstrates bounded optimality gaps even under strong Byzantine attacks. Experimental results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms standard and robust FL baselines such as Mean, Trimmed Mean, Median, Krum, and Multi-Krum under various attack strategies including label flipping, sign flipping, and Gaussian noise addition across MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 benchmarks using the Flower framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Motivated by empirical observations of prolonged plateaus and stage-wise progression during training, we investigate the loss landscape of transformer models trained on in-context next-token prediction tasks. In particular, we focus on learning in-context $n$-gram language models under cross-entropy loss, and establish a sufficient condition for parameter configurations to be stationary points. We then construct a set of parameter configurations for a simplified transformer model that represent $k$-gram estimators (for $k \leq n$), and show that the gradient of the population loss at these solutions vanishes in the limit of infinite sequence length and parameter norm. This reveals a key property of the loss landscape: {sub-$n$-grams are near-stationary points of the population cross-entropy loss}, offering theoretical insight into widely observed phenomena such as stage-wise learning dynamics and emergent phase transitions. These insights are further supported by numerical experiments that illustrate the learning dynamics of $n$-grams, characterized by discrete transitions between near-stationary solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiancheng Zhang, Cheng Zhang, Shuren Liu, Xiaofei Wang, Shaoyuan Huang, Wenyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of streaming services, network load exhibits highly time-varying and bursty behavior, posing serious challenges for maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms (CCPs). While CCPs leverage Predict-then-Schedule architecture to improve QoS and profitability, accurate load forecasting remains challenging under traffic surges. Existing methods either minimize mean absolute error, resulting in underprovisioning and potential Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations during peak periods, or adopt conservative overprovisioning strategies, which mitigate SLA risks at the expense of increased resource expenditure. To address this dilemma, we propose HRS, a hybrid representation framework with scheduling awareness that integrates numerical and image-based representations to better capture extreme load dynamics. We further introduce a Scheduling-Aware Loss (SAL) that captures the asymmetric impact of prediction errors, guiding predictions that better support scheduling decisions. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that HRS consistently outperforms ten baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing SLA violation rates by 63.1% and total profit loss by 32.3%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Individual-level human mobility prediction has emerged as a significant topic of research with applications in infectious disease monitoring, child, and elderly care. Existing studies predominantly focus on the microscopic aspects of human trajectories: such as predicting short-term trajectories or the next location visited, while offering limited attention to macro-level mobility patterns and the corresponding life routines. In this paper, we focus on an underexplored problem in human mobility prediction: determining the best practices to train a machine learning model using historical data to forecast an individuals complete trajectory over the next days and weeks. In this experiment paper, we undertake a comprehensive experimental analysis of diverse models, parameter configurations, and training strategies, accompanied by an in-depth examination of the statistical distribution inherent in human mobility patterns. Our empirical evaluations encompass both Long Short-Term Memory and Transformer-based architectures, and further investigate how incorporating individual life patterns can enhance the effectiveness of the prediction. We show that explicitly including semantic information such as day-of-the-week and user-specific historical information can help the model better understand individual patterns of life and improve predictions. Moreover, since the absence of explicit user information is often missing due to user privacy, we show that the sampling of users may exacerbate data skewness and result in a substantial loss in predictive accuracy. To mitigate data imbalance and preserve diversity, we apply user semantic clustering with stratified sampling to ensure that the sampled dataset remains representative. Our results further show that small-batch stochastic gradient optimization improves model performance, especially when human mobility training data is limited.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shigang Li, Tal Ben-Nun, Salvatore Di Girolamo, Dan Alistarh, Torsten Hoefler</p>
<p>Abstract: Load imbalance pervasively exists in distributed deep learning training systems, either caused by the inherent imbalance in learned tasks or by the system itself. Traditional synchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) achieves good accuracy for a wide variety of tasks, but relies on global synchronization to accumulate the gradients at every training step. In this paper, we propose eager-SGD, which relaxes the global synchronization for decentralized accumulation. To implement eager-SGD, we propose to use two partial collectives: solo and majority. With solo allreduce, the faster processes contribute their gradients eagerly without waiting for the slower processes, whereas with majority allreduce, at least half of the participants must contribute gradients before continuing, all without using a central parameter server. We theoretically prove the convergence of the algorithms and describe the partial collectives in detail. Experimental results on load-imbalanced environments (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and UCF101 datasets) show that eager-SGD achieves 1.27x speedup over the state-of-the-art synchronous SGD, without losing accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shigang Li, Tal Ben-Nun, Giorgi Nadiradze, Salvatore Di Girolamo, Nikoli Dryden, Dan Alistarh, Torsten Hoefler</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning at scale is dominated by communication time. Distributing samples across nodes usually yields the best performance, but poses scaling challenges due to global information dissemination and load imbalance across uneven sample lengths. State-of-the-art decentralized optimizers mitigate the problem, but require more iterations to achieve the same accuracy as their globally-communicating counterparts. We present Wait-Avoiding Group Model Averaging (WAGMA) SGD, a wait-avoiding stochastic optimizer that reduces global communication via subgroup weight exchange. The key insight is a combination of algorithmic changes to the averaging scheme and the use of a group allreduce operation. We prove the convergence of WAGMA-SGD, and empirically show that it retains convergence rates similar to Allreduce-SGD. For evaluation, we train ResNet-50 on ImageNet; Transformer for machine translation; and deep reinforcement learning for navigation at scale. Compared with state-of-the-art decentralized SGD variants, WAGMA-SGD significantly improves training throughput (e.g., 2.1x on 1,024 GPUs for reinforcement learning), and achieves the fastest time-to-solution (e.g., the highest score using the shortest training time for Transformer).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shigang Li, Torsten Hoefler</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large deep learning models at scale is very challenging. This paper proposes Chimera, a novel pipeline parallelism scheme which combines bidirectional pipelines for efficiently training large-scale models. Chimera is a synchronous approach and therefore no loss of accuracy, which is more convergence-friendly than asynchronous approaches. Compared with the latest synchronous pipeline approach, Chimera reduces the number of bubbles by up to 50%; benefiting from the sophisticated scheduling of bidirectional pipelines, Chimera has a more balanced activation memory consumption. Evaluations are conducted on Transformer based language models. For a GPT-2 model with 1.3 billion parameters running on 2,048 GPU nodes of the Piz Daint supercomputer, Chimera improves the training throughput by 1.16x-2.34x over the state-of-the-art synchronous and asynchronous pipeline approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Senwei Liang, Haizhao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing efficient and accurate numerical solvers for high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a challenging and important topic in computational science and engineering, mainly due to the "curse of dimensionality" in designing numerical schemes that scale in dimension. This paper introduces a new methodology that seeks an approximate PDE solution in the space of functions with finitely many analytic expressions and, hence, this methodology is named the finite expression method (FEX). It is proved in approximation theory that FEX can avoid the curse of dimensionality. As a proof of concept, a deep reinforcement learning method is proposed to implement FEX for various high-dimensional PDEs in different dimensions, achieving high and even machine accuracy with a memory complexity polynomial in dimension and an amenable time complexity. An approximate solution with finite analytic expressions also provides interpretable insights into the ground truth PDE solution, which can further help to advance the understanding of physical systems and design postprocessing techniques for a refined solution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Clustering of time series is a well-studied problem, with applications ranging from quantitative, personalized models of metabolism obtained from metabolite concentrations to state discrimination in quantum information theory. We consider a variant, where given a set of trajectories and a number of parts, we jointly partition the set of trajectories and learn linear dynamical system (LDS) models for each part, so as to minimize the maximum error across all the models. We present globally convergent methods and EM heuristics, accompanied by promising computational results. The key highlight of this method is that it does not require a predefined hidden state dimension but instead provides an upper bound. Additionally, it offers guidance for determining regularization in the system identification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Painchaud, J\'er\'emie Stym-Popper, Pierre-Yves Courand, Nicolas Thome, Pierre-Marc Jodoin, Nicolas Duchateau, Olivier Bernard</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning enables automatic and robust extraction of cardiac function descriptors from echocardiographic sequences, such as ejection fraction or strain. These descriptors provide fine-grained information that physicians consider, in conjunction with more global variables from the clinical record, to assess patients' condition. Drawing on novel Transformer models applied to tabular data, we propose a method that considers all descriptors extracted from medical records and echocardiograms to learn the representation of a cardiovascular pathology with a difficult-to-characterize continuum, namely hypertension. Our method first projects each variable into its own representation space using modality-specific approaches. These standardized representations of multimodal data are then fed to a Transformer encoder, which learns to merge them into a comprehensive representation of the patient through the task of predicting a clinical rating. This stratification task is formulated as an ordinal classification to enforce a pathological continuum in the representation space. We observe the major trends along this continuum on a cohort of 239 hypertensive patients, providing unprecedented details in the description of hypertension's impact on various cardiac function descriptors. Our analysis shows that i) the XTab foundation model's architecture allows to reach outstanding performance (96.8% AUROC) even with limited data (less than 200 training samples), ii) stratification across the population is reproducible between trainings (within 5.7% mean absolute error), and iii) patterns emerge in descriptors, some of which align with established physiological knowledge about hypertension, while others could pave the way for a more comprehensive understanding of this pathology.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianxi Cai, Feiqing Huang, Ryumei Nakada, Linjun Zhang, Doudou Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic health record (EHR) systems contain a wealth of multimodal clinical data including structured data like clinical codes and unstructured data such as clinical notes. However, many existing EHR-focused studies has traditionally either concentrated on an individual modality or merged different modalities in a rather rudimentary fashion. This approach often results in the perception of structured and unstructured data as separate entities, neglecting the inherent synergy between them. Specifically, the two important modalities contain clinically relevant, inextricably linked and complementary health information. A more complete picture of a patient's medical history is captured by the joint analysis of the two modalities of data. Despite the great success of multimodal contrastive learning on vision-language, its potential remains under-explored in the realm of multimodal EHR, particularly in terms of its theoretical understanding. To accommodate the statistical analysis of multimodal EHR data, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal feature embedding generative model and design a multimodal contrastive loss to obtain the multimodal EHR feature representation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal learning compared to single-modality learning and connects the solution of the loss function to the singular value decomposition of a pointwise mutual information matrix. This connection paves the way for a privacy-preserving algorithm tailored for multimodal EHR feature representation learning. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithm performs well under a variety of configurations. We further validate the clinical utility of the proposed algorithm in real-world EHR data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aparajithan Venkateswaran, Anirudh Sankar, Arun G. Chandrasekhar, Tyler H. McCormick</p>
<p>Abstract: In both observational data and randomized control trials, researchers select statistical models to articulate how the outcome of interest varies with combinations of observable covariates. Choosing a model that is too simple can obfuscate important heterogeneity in outcomes between covariate groups, while too much complexity risks identifying spurious patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian framework for model uncertainty called Rashomon Partition Sets (RPSs). The RPS consists of all models that have posterior density close to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) model. We construct the RPS by enumeration, rather than sampling, which ensures that we explore all models models with high evidence in the data, even if they offer dramatically different substantive explanations. We use a l0 prior, which allows the allows us to capture complex heterogeneity without imposing strong assumptions about the associations between effects, showing this prior is minimax optimal from an information-theoretic perspective. We characterize the approximation error of (functions of) parameters computed conditional on being in the RPS relative to the entire posterior. We propose an algorithm to enumerate the RPS from the class of models that are interpretable and unique, then provide bounds on the size of the RPS. We give simulation evidence along with three empirical examples: price effects on charitable giving, heterogeneity in chromosomal structure, and the introduction of microfinance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anirudh Sundar, Christopher Richardson, Adar Avsian, Larry Heck</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Interactive Tables (iTBLS), a dataset of interactive conversations that focuses on natural-language manipulation of tabular information sourced from academic pre-prints on ArXiv. The iTBLS dataset consists of three types of tabular tasks -- interpretation, modification, and generation. Interpretation focuses on tabular understanding, modification focuses on manipulating tabular information, and generation focuses on the addition of new natural-language evidence. In addition, the paper presents a novel framework that reformulates tabular operations as question-answering, where an appropriate question is formulated based on the nature of interaction and the question is answered using the user request as evidence. The developed approach results in an improvement on all tasks on a sequence-to-sequence modeling baseline on iTBLS. In addition, the question-answering-based reformulation is applied to datasets from prior work for the text-to-table task where textual paragraphs are summarized into tables. The novel approach results in up to 13% improvement in Exact-Match accuracy and up to 16% improvement in BERTScores compared to the prior state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengran Zhang, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Relevance and utility are two frequently used measures to evaluate the effectiveness of an information retrieval (IR) system. Relevance emphasizes the aboutness of a result to a query, while utility refers to the result's usefulness or value to an information seeker. In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), high-utility results should be prioritized to feed to LLMs due to their limited input bandwidth. Re-examining RAG's three core components -- relevance ranking derived from retrieval models, utility judgments, and answer generation -- aligns with Schutz's philosophical system of relevances, which encompasses three types of relevance representing different levels of human cognition that enhance each other. These three RAG components also reflect three cognitive levels for LLMs in question-answering. Therefore, we propose an Iterative utiliTy judgmEnt fraMework (ITEM) to promote each step in RAG. We conducted extensive experiments on retrieval (TREC DL, WebAP), utility judgment task (GTI-NQ), and factoid question-answering (NQ) datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements of ITEM in utility judgments, ranking, and answer generation upon representative baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Cheng, Vaibhav Dixit, Melanie Weber</p>
<p>Abstract: Convex programming plays a fundamental role in machine learning, data science, and engineering. Testing convexity structure in nonlinear programs relies on verifying the convexity of objectives and constraints. Grant et al. (2006) introduced a framework, Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP), for automating this verification task for a wide range of convex functions that can be decomposed into basic convex functions (atoms) using convexity-preserving compositions and transformations (rules). Here, we extend this framework to functions defined on manifolds with non-positive curvature (Hadamard manifolds) by introducing Disciplined Geodesically Convex Programming (DGCP). In particular, this allows for verifying a broader range of convexity notions. For instance, many notable instances of statistical estimators and matrix-valued (sub)routines in machine learning applications are Euclidean non-convex, but exhibit geodesic convexity through a more general Riemannian lens. To define the DGCP framework, we determine convexity-preserving compositions and transformations for geodesically convex functions on general Hadamard manifolds, as well as for the special case of symmetric positive definite matrices, a common setting in matrix-valued optimization. For the latter, we also define a basic set of atoms. Our paper is accompanied by a Julia package SymbolicAnalysis.jl, which provides functionality for testing and certifying DGCP-compliant expressions. Our library interfaces with manifold optimization software, which allows for directly solving verified geodesically convex programs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joris Guerin, Shray Bansal, Amirreza Shaban, Paulo Mann, Harshvardhan Gazula</p>
<p>Abstract: Transfer learning has become an essential tool in modern computer vision, allowing practitioners to leverage backbones, pretrained on large datasets, to train successful models from limited annotated data. Choosing the right backbone is crucial, especially for small datasets, since final performance depends heavily on the quality of the initial feature representations. While prior work has conducted benchmarks across various datasets to identify universal top-performing backbones, we demonstrate that backbone effectiveness is highly dataset-dependent, especially in low-data scenarios where no single backbone consistently excels. To overcome this limitation, we introduce dataset-specific backbone selection as a new research direction and investigate its practical viability in low-data regimes. Since exhaustive evaluation is computationally impractical for large backbone pools, we formalize Vision Backbone Efficient Selection (VIBES) as the problem of searching for high-performing backbones under computational constraints. We define the solution space, propose several heuristics, and demonstrate VIBES feasibility for low-data image classification by performing experiments on four diverse datasets. Our results show that even simple search strategies can find well-suited backbones within a pool of over $1300$ pretrained models, outperforming generic benchmark recommendations within just ten minutes of search time on a single GPU (NVIDIA RTX A5000).</p>

<p>Abstract: Reconstructing large-scale latent networks from observed dynamics is crucial for understanding complex systems. However, the existing methods based on compressive sensing are often rendered infeasible in practice by prohibitive computational and memory costs. To address this challenge, we introduce a new distributed computing framework for efficient large-scale network reconstruction with parallel computing, namely PALMS (Parallel Adaptive Lasso with Multi-directional Signals). The core idea of PALMS is to decompose the complex global problem by partitioning network nodes, enabling the parallel estimation of sub-networks across multiple computing units. This strategy substantially reduces the computational complexity and storage requirements of classic methods. By using the adaptive multi-directional regularization on each computing unit, we also establish the consistency of PALMS estimator theoretically. Extensive simulation studies and empirical analyses on several large-scale real-world networks validate the computational efficiency and robust reconstruction accuracy of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformer-based pre-trained language models have dominated the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for quite some time now. However, the Nepali language, spoken by approximately 32 million people worldwide, remains significantly underrepresented in this domain. This underrepresentation is primarily attributed to the scarcity of monolingual data corpora and limited available resources for the Nepali language. While existing efforts have predominantly concentrated on basic encoder-based models, there is a notable gap in the exploration of decoder-based architectures. To address this gap, we have collected 27.5 GB of Nepali text data, approximately 2.4x larger than any previously available Nepali language corpus. Leveraging this data, we pre-trained three different models i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2, exclusively for the Nepali Language. Furthermore, we performed instruction tuning and explored its potential for monolingual Nepali data, providing a foundation for future research. Our models outperformed the existing best model by 2 points on Nep-gLUE benchmark, scoring 95.60 and also outperformed existing models on text generation tasks, demonstrating improvements in both understanding and generating Nepali text.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of tabular data from diverse sources is often hindered by inconsistencies in formatting and representation, posing significant challenges for data analysts and personal digital assistants. Existing methods for automating tabular data transformations are limited in scope, often focusing on specific types of transformations or lacking interpretability. In this paper, we introduce TabulaX, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-class column-level tabular transformations. TabulaX first classifies input columns into four transformation types (string-based, numerical, algorithmic, and general) and then applies tailored methods to generate human-interpretable transformation functions, such as numeric formulas or programming code. This approach enhances transparency and allows users to understand and modify the mappings. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets from various domains, we demonstrate that TabulaX outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, supports a broader class of transformations, and generates interpretable transformations that can be efficiently applied.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> SeungBum Ha, Taehwan Lee, Jiyoun Lim, Sung Whan Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training while preserving data privacy, yet existing FL benchmarks address relatively simple classification tasks, where each sample is annotated with a one-hot label. However, little attention has been paid to demonstrating an FL benchmark that handles complicated semantics, where each sample encompasses diverse semantic information, such as relations between objects. Because the existing benchmarks are designed to distribute data in a narrow view of a single semantic, managing the complicated semantic heterogeneity across clients when formalizing FL benchmarks is non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a benchmark process to establish an FL benchmark with controllable semantic heterogeneity across clients: two key steps are (i) data clustering with semantics and (ii) data distributing via controllable semantic heterogeneity across clients. As a proof of concept, we construct a federated PSG benchmark, demonstrating the efficacy of the existing PSG methods in an FL setting with controllable semantic heterogeneity of scene graphs. We also present the effectiveness of our benchmark by applying robust federated learning algorithms to data heterogeneity to show increased performance. To our knowledge, this is the first benchmark framework that enables federated learning and its evaluation for multi-semantic vision tasks under the controlled semantic heterogeneity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Deas, Adam Spannaus, Dakotah D. Maguire, Jodie Trafton, Anuj J. Kapadia, Vasileios Maroulas</p>
<p>Abstract: The opioid crisis remains a critical public health challenge in the United States. Despite national efforts which reduced opioid prescribing rates by nearly 45\% between 2011 and 2021, opioid-related overdose deaths more than tripled during the same period. This alarming trend reflects a major shift in the crisis, with illegal opioids now driving the majority of overdose deaths instead of prescription opioids. Although much attention has been given to supply-side factors fueling this transition, the underlying structural conditions that perpetuate and exacerbate opioid misuse remain less understood. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic intensified the opioid crisis through widespread social isolation and record-high unemployment; consequently, understanding the underlying drivers of this epidemic has become even more crucial in recent years. To address this need, our study examines the correlation between opioid-related mortality and thirteen county-level characteristics related to population traits, economic stability, and infrastructure. Leveraging a nationwide county-level dataset spanning consecutive years from 2010 to 2022, this study integrates empirical insights from exploratory data analysis with feature importance metrics derived from machine learning models. Our findings highlight critical regional characteristics strongly correlated with opioid-related mortality, emphasizing their potential roles in worsening the epidemic when their levels are high and mitigating it when their levels are low.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianang Zhou, Junhui Hou, Meiyi Yang, Yongjian Deng, Youfu Li, Junlin Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Current optical flow methods exploit the stable appearance of frame (or RGB) data to establish robust correspondences across time. Event cameras, on the other hand, provide high-temporal-resolution motion cues and excel in challenging scenarios. These complementary characteristics underscore the potential of integrating frame and event data for optical flow estimation. However, most cross-modal approaches fail to fully utilize the complementary advantages, relying instead on simply stacking information. This study introduces a novel approach that uses a spatially dense modality to guide the aggregation of the temporally dense event modality, achieving effective cross-modal fusion. Specifically, we propose an event-enhanced frame representation that preserves the rich texture of frames and the basic structure of events. We use the enhanced representation as the guiding modality and employ events to capture temporally dense motion information. The robust motion features derived from the guiding modality direct the aggregation of motion information from events. To further enhance fusion, we propose a transformer-based module that complements sparse event motion features with spatially rich frame information and enhances global information propagation. Additionally, a mix-fusion encoder is designed to extract comprehensive spatiotemporal contextual features from both modalities. Extensive experiments on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Leveraging the complementary strengths of frames and events, our method achieves leading performance on the DSEC-Flow dataset. Compared to the event-only model, frame guidance improves accuracy by 10\%. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion-based method with a 4\% accuracy gain and a 45\% reduction in inference time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Fertig, Lakshman Balasubramanian, Michael Botsch</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial to advance autonomous driving, improving safety, and efficiency. Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marina Sheshukova, Sergey Samsonov, Denis Belomestny, Eric Moulines, Qi-Man Shao, Zhuo-Song Zhang, Alexey Naumov</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we establish the non-asymptotic validity of the multiplier bootstrap procedure for constructing the confidence sets using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. Under appropriate regularity conditions, our approach avoids the need to approximate the limiting covariance of Polyak-Ruppert SGD iterates, which allows us to derive approximation rates in convex distance of order up to $1/\sqrt{n}$. Notably, this rate can be faster than the one that can be proven in the Polyak-Juditsky central limit theorem. To our knowledge, this provides the first fully non-asymptotic bound on the accuracy of bootstrap approximations in SGD algorithms. Our analysis builds on the Gaussian approximation results for nonlinear statistics of independent random variables.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxi Li, Yiwei Wang, Kai Zhang, Yujun Cai, Bryan Hooi, Nanyun Peng, Kai-Wei Chang, Jin Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in various downstream task domains. However, their abilities to directly recall and apply factual medical knowledge remains under-explored. Most existing medical QA benchmarks assess complex reasoning or multi-hop inference, making it difficult to isolate LLMs' inherent medical knowledge from their reasoning capabilities. Given the high-stakes nature of medical applications, where incorrect information can have critical consequences, it is essential to evaluate the factuality of LLMs to retain medical knowledge.
  To address this challenge, we introduce the Medical Knowledge Judgment Dataset (MKJ), a dataset derived from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), a comprehensive repository of standardized biomedical vocabularies and knowledge graphs. Through a binary classification framework, MKJ evaluates LLMs' grasp of fundamental medical facts by having them assess the validity of concise, one-hop statements, enabling direct measurement of their knowledge retention capabilities.
  Our experiments reveal that LLMs have difficulty accurately recalling medical facts, with performances varying substantially across semantic types and showing notable weakness in uncommon medical conditions. Furthermore, LLMs show poor calibration, often being overconfident in incorrect answers. To mitigate these issues, we explore retrieval-augmented generation, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving factual accuracy and reducing uncertainty in medical decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Plassier, Alexander Fishkov, Victor Dheur, Mohsen Guizani, Souhaib Ben Taieb, Maxim Panov, Eric Moulines</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a new method for generating confidence sets within the split conformal prediction framework. Our method performs a trainable transformation of any given conformity score to improve conditional coverage while ensuring exact marginal coverage. The transformation is based on an estimate of the conditional quantile of conformity scores. The resulting method is particularly beneficial for constructing adaptive confidence sets in multi-output problems where standard conformal quantile regression approaches have limited applicability. We develop a theoretical bound that captures the influence of the accuracy of the quantile estimate on the approximate conditional validity, unlike classical bounds for conformal prediction methods that only offer marginal coverage. We experimentally show that our method is highly adaptive to the local data structure and outperforms existing methods in terms of conditional coverage, improving the reliability of statistical inference in various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vibhas Vats, Md. Alimoor Reza, David Crandall, Soon-heung Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods primarily depend on photometric and geometric consistency constraints. In contrast, modern learning-based algorithms often rely on the plane sweep algorithm to infer 3D geometry, applying explicit geometric consistency (GC) checks only as a post-processing step, with no impact on the learning process itself. In this work, we introduce GC MVSNet plus plus, a novel approach that actively enforces geometric consistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views (multi view) and at various scales (multi scale) during the learning phase (see Fig. 1). This integrated GC check significantly accelerates the learning process by directly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, effectively halving the number of training iterations compared to other MVS methods. Furthermore, we introduce a densely connected cost regularization network with two distinct block designs simple and feature dense optimized to harness dense feature connections for enhanced regularization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a new state of the art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets and secures second place on the Tanks and Temples benchmark. To our knowledge, GC MVSNet plus plus is the first method to enforce multi-view, multi-scale supervised geometric consistency during learning. Our code is available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Huang, Jiazhao Zhang, Shilong Zou, Xinwang Liu, Ruizhen Hu, Kai Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazi Mahmudul Hassan, Xuyang Zhao, Hidenori Sugano, Toshihisa Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature engineering for generalized seizure detection models remains a significant challenge. Recently proposed models show variable performance depending on the training data and remain ineffective at accurately distinguishing artifacts from seizure data. In this study, we propose a novel end-to-end model, "Multiresolutional EEGWaveNet (MR-EEGWaveNet)," which efficiently distinguishes seizure events from background electroencephalogram (EEG) and artifacts/noise by capturing both temporal dependencies across different time frames and spatial relationships between channels. The model has three modules: convolution, feature extraction, and predictor. The convolution module extracts features through depth-wise and spatio-temporal convolution. The feature extraction module individually reduces the feature dimension extracted from EEG segments and their sub-segments. Subsequently, the extracted features are concatenated into a single vector for classification using a fully connected classifier called the predictor module. In addition, an anomaly score-based post-classification processing technique is introduced to reduce the false-positive rates of the model. Experimental results are reported and analyzed using different parameter settings and datasets (Siena (public) and Juntendo (private)). The proposed MR-EEGWaveNet significantly outperformed the conventional non-multiresolution approach, improving the F1 scores from 0.177 to 0.336 on Siena and 0.327 to 0.488 on Juntendo, with precision gains of 15.9% and 20.62%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isaiah A. Moses, Chen Chen, Joan M. Redwing, Wesley F. Reinhart</p>
<p>Abstract: The growth and characterization of materials using empirical optimization typically requires a significant amount of expert time, experience, and resources. Several complementary characterization methods are routinely performed to determine the quality and properties of a grown sample. Machine learning (ML) can support the conventional approaches by using historical data to guide and provide speed and efficiency to the growth and characterization of materials. Specifically, ML can provide quantitative information from characterization data that is typically obtained from a different modality. In this study, we have investigated the feasibility of projecting the quantitative metric from microscopy measurements, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), using data obtained from spectroscopy measurements, like Raman spectroscopy. Generative models were also trained to generate the full and specific features of the Raman and photoluminescence spectra from each other and the AFM images of the thin film MoS$_2$. The results are promising and have provided a foundational guide for the use of ML for the cross-modal characterization of materials for their accelerated, efficient, and cost-effective discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent, cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI collaboration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongwei Zhang, Ziqi Ye, Xinyuan Wang, Xin Guo, Zenglin Xu, Yuan Cheng, Zixin Hu, Yuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Network Automatic Relevance Determination (NARD), an extension of ARD for linearly probabilistic models, to simultaneously model sparse relationships between inputs $X \in \mathbb R^{d \times N}$ and outputs $Y \in \mathbb R^{m \times N}$, while capturing the correlation structure among the $Y$. NARD employs a matrix normal prior which contains a sparsity-inducing parameter to identify and discard irrelevant features, thereby promoting sparsity in the model. Algorithmically, it iteratively updates both the precision matrix and the relationship between $Y$ and the refined inputs. To mitigate the computational inefficiencies of the $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^3)$ cost per iteration, we introduce Sequential NARD, which evaluates features sequentially, and a Surrogate Function Method, leveraging an efficient approximation of the marginal likelihood and simplifying the calculation of determinant and inverse of an intermediate matrix. Combining the Sequential update with the Surrogate Function method further reduces computational costs. The computational complexity per iteration for these three methods is reduced to $\mathcal O(m^3+p^3)$, $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^2)$, $\mathcal O(m^3+p^2)$, respectively, where $p \ll d$ is the final number of features in the model. Our methods demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency with comparable performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luke Guerdan, Devansh Saxena, Stevie Chancellor, Zhiwei Steven Wu, Kenneth Holstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Data scientists often formulate predictive modeling tasks involving fuzzy, hard-to-define concepts, such as the "authenticity" of student writing or the "healthcare need" of a patient. Yet the process by which data scientists translate fuzzy concepts into a concrete, proxy target variable remains poorly understood. We interview fifteen data scientists in education (N=8) and healthcare (N=7) to understand how they construct target variables for predictive modeling tasks. Our findings suggest that data scientists construct target variables through a bricolage process, in which they use creative and pragmatic approaches to make do with the limited data at hand. Data scientists attempt to satisfy five major criteria for a target variable through bricolage: validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and resource requirements. To achieve this, data scientists adaptively apply problem (re)formulation strategies, such as swapping out one candidate target variable for another when the first fails to meet certain criteria (e.g., predictability), or composing multiple outcomes into a single target variable to capture a more holistic set of modeling objectives. Based on our findings, we present opportunities for future HCI, CSCW, and ML research to better support the art and science of target variable construction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Tang, Chengxu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huyu Wu, Duo Su, Junjie Hou, Guang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other degradation issues.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changyuan Qiu, Hangrui Cao, Qihan Ren, Ruiyu Li, Yuqing Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific scenario and make comparisons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Basit Azam, Sarangthem Ibotombi Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-invasive glucose monitoring remains a critical challenge in the management of diabetes. HRV during sleep shows promise for glucose prediction however, age-related autonomic changes significantly confound traditional HRV analyses. We analyzed 43 subjects with multi-modal data including sleep-stage specific ECG, HRV features, and clinical measurements. A novel age-normalization technique was applied to the HRV features by, dividing the raw values by age-scaled factors. BayesianRidge regression with 5-fold cross-validation was employed for log-glucose prediction. Age-normalized HRV features achieved R2 = 0.161 (MAE = 0.182) for log-glucose prediction, representing a 25.6% improvement over non-normalized features (R2 = 0.132). The top predictive features were hrv rem mean rr age normalized (r = 0.443, p = 0.004), hrv ds mean rr age normalized (r = 0.438, p = 0.005), and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.437, p = 0.005). Systematic ablation studies confirmed age-normalization as the critical component, with sleep-stage specific features providing additional predictive value. Age-normalized HRV features significantly enhance glucose prediction accuracy compared with traditional approaches. This sleep-aware methodology addresses fundamental limitations in autonomic function assessment and suggests a preliminary feasibility for non-invasive glucose monitoring applications. However, these results require validation in larger cohorts before clinical consideration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bioacoustics, the study of sounds produced by living organisms, plays a vital role in conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and behavioral studies. Many tasks in this field, such as species, individual, and behavior classification and detection, are well-suited to machine learning. However, they often suffer from limited annotated data, highlighting the need for a general-purpose bioacoustic encoder capable of extracting useful representations for diverse downstream tasks. Such encoders have been proposed before, but are often limited in scope due to a focus on a narrow range of species (typically birds), and a reliance on a single model architecture or training paradigm. Moreover, they are usually evaluated on a small set of tasks and datasets. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical study that covers aspects of bioacoustics that are relevant to research but have previously been scarcely considered: training data diversity and scale, model architectures and training recipes, and the breadth of evaluation tasks and datasets. We obtain encoders that are state-of-the-art on the existing and proposed benchmarks. We also identify what matters for training these encoders, such that this work can be extended when more data are available or better architectures are proposed. Specifically, across 26 datasets with tasks including species classification, detection, individual ID, and vocal repertoire discovery, we find self-supervised pre-training followed by supervised post-training on a mixed bioacoustics + general-audio corpus yields the strongest in- and out-of-distribution performance. We show the importance of data diversity in both stages. To support ongoing research and application, we will release the model checkpoints.</p>

<p>Abstract: Future prediction is a complex task for LLM agents, requiring a high level of analytical thinking, information gathering, contextual understanding, and decision-making under uncertainty. Agents must not only gather and interpret vast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources, weigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as human experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its importance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future prediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and retrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{FutureX}$, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically designed for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the largest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting real-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated pipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent models, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of external tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source Deep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive reasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide in-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in future-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the temporal validity. Our goal is to establish a dynamic, contamination-free evaluation standard that drives the development of LLM agents capable of performing at the level of professional human analysts in complex reasoning and predictive thinking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Hirt, Lukas Theiner, Maik Pfefferkorn, Rolf Findeisen</p>
<p>Abstract: Many control problems require repeated tuning and adaptation of controllers across distinct closed-loop tasks, where data efficiency and adaptability are critical. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian optimization (BO) framework that is tailored to efficient controller parameter learning in sequential decision-making and control scenarios for distinct tasks. Instead of treating the closed-loop cost as a black-box, our method exploits structural knowledge of the underlying problem, consisting of a dynamical system, a control law, and an associated closed-loop cost function. We construct a hierarchical surrogate model using Gaussian processes that capture the closed-loop state evolution under different parameterizations, while the task-specific weighting and accumulation into the closed-loop cost are computed exactly via known closed-form expressions. This allows knowledge transfer and enhanced data efficiency between different closed-loop tasks. The proposed framework retains sublinear regret guarantees on par with standard black-box BO, while enabling multi-task or transfer learning. Simulation experiments with model predictive control demonstrate substantial benefits in both sample efficiency and adaptability when compared to purely black-box BO approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyu Lu, Xinrong Sun, Yunting Tao, Tong Ji, Fanyu Kong, Guoqiang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained scenarios has driven the development of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) system. However, this approach is susceptible to privacy leakage, as the data sent from the client to the untrusted cloud server often contains sensitive information. Existing CNN privacy-preserving schemes, while effective in ensuring data confidentiality through homomorphic encryption and secret sharing, face efficiency bottlenecks, particularly in convolution operations. In this paper, we propose a novel verifiable privacy-preserving scheme tailored for CNN convolutional layers. Our scheme enables efficient encryption and decryption, allowing resource-constrained clients to securely offload computations to the untrusted cloud server. Additionally, we present a verification mechanism capable of detecting the correctness of the results with a success probability of at least $1-\frac{1}{\left|Z\right|}$. Extensive experiments conducted on 10 datasets and various CNN models demonstrate that our scheme achieves speedups ranging $26 \times$ ~ $\ 87\times$ compared to the original plaintext model while maintaining accuracy.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12942">Fully Automated Segmentation of Fiber Bundles in Anatomic Tracing Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyriaki-Margarita Bintsi, Ya\"el Balbastre, Jingjing Wu, Julia F. Lehman, Suzanne N. Haber, Anastasia Yendiki</p>
<p>Abstract: Anatomic tracer studies are critical for validating and improving diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography. However, large-scale analysis of data from such studies is hampered by the labor-intensive process of annotating fiber bundles manually on histological slides. Existing automated methods often miss sparse bundles or require complex post-processing across consecutive sections, limiting their flexibility and generalizability. We present a streamlined, fully automated framework for fiber bundle segmentation in macaque tracer data, based on a U-Net architecture with large patch sizes, foreground aware sampling, and semisupervised pre-training. Our approach eliminates common errors such as mislabeling terminals as bundles, improves detection of sparse bundles by over 20% and reduces the False Discovery Rate (FDR) by 40% compared to the state-of-the-art, all while enabling analysis of standalone slices. This new framework will facilitate the automated analysis of anatomic tracing data at a large scale, generating more ground-truth data that can be used to validate and optimize dMRI tractography methods.</p>
