<p><b>Authors:</b> Jon Kutasov, Chloe Loughridge, Yuqi Sun, Henry Sleight, Buck Shlegeris, Tyler Tracy, Joe Benton</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI systems become more capable and widely deployed as agents, ensuring their safe operation becomes critical. AI control offers one approach to mitigating the risk from untrusted AI agents by monitoring their actions and intervening or auditing when necessary. Evaluating the safety of these protocols requires understanding both their effectiveness against current attacks and their robustness to adaptive adversaries. In this work, we systematically evaluate a range of control protocols in SHADE-Arena, a dataset of diverse agentic environments. First, we evaluate blue team protocols, including deferral to trusted models, resampling, and deferring on critical actions, against a default attack policy. We find that resampling for incrimination and deferring on critical actions perform best, increasing safety from 50% to 96%. We then iterate on red team strategies against these protocols and find that attack policies with additional affordances, such as knowledge of when resampling occurs or the ability to simulate monitors, can substantially improve attack success rates against our resampling strategy, decreasing safety to 17%. However, deferring on critical actions is highly robust to even our strongest red team strategies, demonstrating the importance of denying attack policies access to protocol internals.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03023">PublicAgent: Multi-Agent Design Principles From an LLM-Based Open Data Analysis Framework</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sina Montazeri, Yunhe Feng, Kewei Sha</p>
<p>Abstract: Open data repositories hold potential for evidence-based decision-making, yet are inaccessible to non-experts lacking expertise in dataset discovery, schema mapping, and statistical analysis. Large language models show promise for individual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental limitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning patterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition into specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis, and reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent contexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models and 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems. First, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the strongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model scale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and conditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent effectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev 20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or analysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing report or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits persist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94% discovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning enhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96% for analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide when and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while enabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Zhang, Kehui Yao, Luyi Ma, Jiao Chen, Reza Yousefi Maragheh, Kai Zhao, Jianpeng Xu, Evren Korpeoglu, Sushant Kumar, Kannan Achan</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) as judges is increasingly critical for building scalable and trustworthy evaluation pipelines. We present ScalingEval, a large-scale benchmarking study that systematically compares 36 LLMs, including GPT, Gemini, Claude, and Llama, across multiple product categories using a consensus-driven evaluation protocol. Our multi-agent framework aggregates pattern audits and issue codes into ground-truth labels via scalable majority voting, enabling reproducible comparison of LLM evaluators without human annotation. Applied to large-scale complementary-item recommendation, the benchmark reports four key findings: (i) Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves the highest decision confidence; (ii) Gemini 1.5 Pro offers the best overall performance across categories; (iii) GPT-4o provides the most favorable latency-accuracy-cost tradeoff; and (iv) GPT-OSS 20B leads among open-source models. Category-level analysis shows strong consensus in structured domains (Electronics, Sports) but persistent disagreement in lifestyle categories (Clothing, Food). These results establish ScalingEval as a reproducible benchmark and evaluation protocol for LLMs as judges, with actionable guidance on scaling, reliability, and model family tradeoffs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03070">Epidemiology of Large Language Models: A Benchmark for Observational Distribution Knowledge</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Drago Plecko, Patrik Okanovic, Torsten Hoefler, Elias Bareinboim</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems hold great promise for advancing various scientific disciplines, and are increasingly used in real-world applications. Despite their remarkable progress, further capabilities are expected in order to achieve more general types of intelligence. A critical distinction in this context is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or false answers (e.g., "what is the capital of England?"), and probabilistic knowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., "what is the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?"). In this paper, our goal is to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of knowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they internalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful universal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time, classical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight fundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions, challenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we develop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating whether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world populations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social behavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not seem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the context of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that language models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer 1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional (Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also limited.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of 100B+ parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100k+ context length support have resulted in increasing demands for on-chip memory to support large KV caches. Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet, these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using frameworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be deployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real production setting. SnapStream enables $4\times$ improved on-chip memory usage and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and LiveCodeBench. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of sparse KV attention techniques deployed in a production inference system with static graphs and continuous batching.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03106">Large language models require a new form of oversight: capability-based monitoring</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Katherine C. Kellogg, Bingyang Ye, Yifan Hu, Guergana K. Savova, Byron Wallace, Danielle S. Bitterman</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has been accompanied by scrutiny of their oversight. Existing monitoring approaches, inherited from traditional machine learning (ML), are task-based and founded on assumed performance degradation arising from dataset drift. In contrast, with LLMs, inevitable model degradation due to changes in populations compared to the training dataset cannot be assumed, because LLMs were not trained for any specific task in any given population. We therefore propose a new organizing principle guiding generalist LLM monitoring that is scalable and grounded in how these models are developed and used in practice: capability-based monitoring. Capability-based monitoring is motivated by the fact that LLMs are generalist systems whose overlapping internal capabilities are reused across numerous downstream tasks. Instead of evaluating each downstream task independently, this approach organizes monitoring around shared model capabilities, such as summarization, reasoning, translation, or safety guardrails, in order to enable cross-task detection of systemic weaknesses, long-tail errors, and emergent behaviors that task-based monitoring may miss. We describe considerations for developers, organizational leaders, and professional societies for implementing a capability-based monitoring approach. Ultimately, capability-based monitoring will provide a scalable foundation for safe, adaptive, and collaborative monitoring of LLMs and future generalist artificial intelligence models in healthcare.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03108">miniF2F-Lean Revisited: Reviewing Limitations and Charting a Path Forward</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Azim Ospanov, Farzan Farnia, Roozbeh Yousefzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: We perform a thorough analysis of the formal and informal statements in the miniF2F benchmark from the perspective of an AI system that is tasked to participate in a math Olympiad consisting of the problems in miniF2F. In such setting, the model has to read and comprehend the problems in natural language, formalize them in Lean language, then proceed with proving the problems, and it will get credit for each problem if the formal proof corresponds to the original informal statement presented to the model. Our evaluation results reveal that the best accuracy of such pipeline can be about 36% using the SoTA models in the literature, considerably lower than the individual SoTA accuracies, 97% and 69% reported in the autoformalization and theorem proving literature. Analyzing the failure modes, we trace back a considerable portion of this drop to discrepancies between the formal and informal statements for more than half of the problems in miniF2F. We proceed with correcting all the errors, discrepancies and simplifications in formal and informal statements, and present the miniF2F-v2 with fully verified formal and informal statements and proofs. Evaluating the full theorem proving pipeline on miniF2F-v2 leads to the best accuracy of 70%, a significant improvement from the 40% on the original miniF2F, yet indicating considerable misalignment between the autoformalization models and theorem provers. Our deep analysis suggests that a higher quality benchmark can help the community better evaluate progress in the field of formal reasoning and also better diagnose the failure and success modes of autoformalization and theorem proving models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shipeng Cen, Ying Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: As optimization problems grow increasingly complex and diverse, advancements in optimization techniques and paradigm innovations hold significant importance. The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily manifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and other unfavorable characteristics. Traditional zero-order or first-order methods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient information, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are ill-equipped to address these challenges effectively. In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial improvements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities. Consequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language models has garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this study, we choose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel approach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large language model(MLLM). To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical Part(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further utilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the multi-modal characteristics of large language models. We focus on two specific tasks: the \textit{traveling salesman problem }(TSP) and \textit{electronic design automation problem} (EDA). The experimental results show that FWAs generated under our new framework have achieved or surpassed SOTA results on many problem instances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Li, Jianjun Xu, Pingtao Wei, Jiu Li, Peiqiang Zhao, Jiwei Shi, Xuan Zhang, Yanhui Yang, Xiaodong Hui, Peng Xu, Wenqin Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), their associated security issues have become increasingly prominent, severely constraining their trustworthy deployment in critical domains. This paper proposes a novel safety response framework designed to systematically safeguard LLMs at both the input and output levels. At the input level, the framework employs a supervised fine-tuning-based safety classification model. Through a fine-grained four-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused Attention), it performs precise risk identification and differentiated handling of user queries, significantly enhancing risk coverage and business scenario adaptability, and achieving a risk recall rate of 99.3%. At the output level, the framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a specifically fine-tuned interpretation model, ensuring all responses are grounded in a real-time, trustworthy knowledge base. This approach eliminates information fabrication and enables result traceability. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed safety control model achieves a significantly higher safety score on public safety evaluation benchmarks compared to the baseline model, TinyR1-Safety-8B. Furthermore, on our proprietary high-risk test set, the framework's components attained a perfect 100% safety score, validating their exceptional protective capabilities in complex risk scenarios. This research provides an effective engineering pathway for building high-security, high-trust LLM applications.</p>

However, little attention has been given to the validation of practical implementations of formal explainers. This paper develops a novel methodology for validating formal explainers and reports on the assessment of the publicly available formal explainer PyXAI. The paper documents the existence of incorrect explanations computed by PyXAI on most of the datasets analyzed in the experiments, thereby confirming the importance of the proposed novel methodology for the validation of formal explainers.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03179">Toward Autonomous Engineering Design: A Knowledge-Guided Multi-Agent Framework</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Varun Kumar, George Em Karniadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains, leading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements. Traditional methods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this, we formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework that integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces specialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine design candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the aerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of three key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems Engineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to construct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature. The Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical requirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer leverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose candidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and provides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge graph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the manager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics such as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how collaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Fei Liu, Yi-Long Lu, Di He, Hang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Psychological constructs within individuals are widely believed to be interconnected. We investigated whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs) can model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from minimal quantitative inputs. We prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality Scale responses from 816 human individuals to role-play their responses on nine other psychological scales. LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing human psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from LLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2 > 0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on semantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms trained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that LLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five responses into natural language personality summaries through information selection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics. Second, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these summaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality factors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item importance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely redundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to original scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent, second-order patterns of trait interplay. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can precisely predict individual participants' psychological traits from minimal data through a process of abstraction and reasoning, offering both a powerful tool for psychological simulation and valuable insights into their emergent reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Gu, Ziwei Wang, Sicen Lai, Zirui Gao, Sheng Zhou, Jiajun Bu</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring web accessibility is crucial for advancing social welfare, justice, and equality in digital spaces, yet the vast majority of website user interfaces remain non-compliant, due in part to the resource-intensive and unscalable nature of current auditing practices. While WCAG-EM offers a structured methodology for site-wise conformance evaluation, it involves great human efforts and lacks practical support for execution at scale. In this work, we present an auditing framework, AAA, which operationalizes WCAG-EM through a human-AI partnership model. AAA is anchored by two key innovations: GRASP, a graph-based multimodal sampling method that ensures representative page coverage via learned embeddings of visual, textual, and relational cues; and MaC, a multimodal large language model-based copilot that supports auditors through cross-modal reasoning and intelligent assistance in high-effort tasks. Together, these components enable scalable, end-to-end web accessibility auditing, empowering human auditors with AI-enhanced assistance for real-world impact. We further contribute four novel datasets designed for benchmarking core stages of the audit pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, providing insights that small-scale language models can serve as capable experts when fine-tuned.</p>

We address two principal types of explanation problems: abductive and contrastive, both in their local and global variants. Our analysis encompasses diverse ML models, including Decision Trees, Decision Sets, Decision Lists, Boolean Circuits, and ensembles thereof, each offering unique explanatory challenges. This research fills a significant gap in explainable AI (XAI) by providing a foundational understanding of the complexities of generating explanations for these models. This work provides insights vital for further research in the domain of XAI, contributing to the broader discourse on the necessity of transparency and accountability in AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Richard Dewey, Janos Botyanszki, Ciamac C. Moallemi, Andrew T. Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: AI researchers have long focused on poker-like games as a testbed for environments characterized by multi-player dynamics, imperfect information, and reasoning under uncertainty. While recent breakthroughs have matched elite human play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued: most hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple rounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to achieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized by extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played at an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and equity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also outperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning abilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies, randomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class human players.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sotirios Konstantakos, Sotirios Asparagkathos, Moatasim Mahmoud, Stamatia Rizou, Enrico Quagliarini, Gabriele Bernardini</p>
<p>Abstract: In the context of increasing urban risks, particularly from climate change-induced flooding, this paper presents an extended Reality (XR)-based framework to improve user risk training within urban built environments. The framework is designed to improve risk awareness and preparedness among various stakeholders, including citizens, local authorities, and emergency responders. Using immersive XR technologies, the training experience simulates real-world emergency scenarios, contributing to active participation and a deeper understanding of potential hazards and especially for floods. The framework highlights the importance of stakeholder participation in its development, ensuring that training modules are customized to address the specific needs of different user groups. The iterative approach of the framework supports ongoing refinement through user feedback and performance data, thus improving the overall effectiveness of risk training initiatives. This work outlines the methodological phases involved in the framework's implementation, including i) user flow mapping, ii) scenario selection, and iii) performance evaluation, with a focus on the pilot application in Senigallia, Italy. The findings underscore the potential of XR technologies to transform urban risk training, promoting a culture of preparedness and resilience against urban hazards.</p>

<p>Abstract: Objective: Radiology residents require timely, personalized feedback to develop accurate image analysis and reporting skills. Increasing clinical workload often limits attendings' ability to provide guidance. This study evaluates a HIPAA-compliant GPT-4o system that delivers automated feedback on breast imaging reports drafted by residents in real clinical settings.
  Methods: We analyzed 5,000 resident-attending report pairs from routine practice at a multi-site U.S. health system. GPT-4o was prompted with clinical instructions to identify common errors and provide feedback. A reader study using 100 report pairs was conducted. Four attending radiologists and four residents independently reviewed each pair, determined whether predefined error types were present, and rated GPT-4o's feedback as helpful or not. Agreement between GPT and readers was assessed using percent match. Inter-reader reliability was measured with Krippendorff's alpha. Educational value was measured as the proportion of cases rated helpful.
  Results: Three common error types were identified: (1) omission or addition of key findings, (2) incorrect use or omission of technical descriptors, and (3) final assessment inconsistent with findings. GPT-4o showed strong agreement with attending consensus: 90.5%, 78.3%, and 90.4% across error types. Inter-reader reliability showed moderate variability ({\alpha} = 0.767, 0.595, 0.567), and replacing a human reader with GPT-4o did not significantly affect agreement ({\Delta} = -0.004 to 0.002). GPT's feedback was rated helpful in most cases: 89.8%, 83.0%, and 92.0%.
  Discussion: ChatGPT-4o can reliably identify key educational errors. It may serve as a scalable tool to support radiology education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Zheng, Gokcen Yilmaz, Ji Han, Saeema Ahmed-Kristensen</p>
<p>Abstract: Many organisations pursue digital transformation to enhance operational efficiency, reduce manual efforts, and optimise processes by automation and digital tools. To achieve this, a comprehensive understanding of their unique needs is required. However, traditional methods, such as expert interviews, while effective, face several challenges, including scheduling conflicts, resource constraints, inconsistency, etc. To tackle these issues, we investigate the use of a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered chatbot to acquire organisations' digital transformation needs. Specifically, the chatbot integrates workflow-based instruction with LLM's planning and reasoning capabilities, enabling it to function as a virtual expert and conduct interviews. We detail the chatbot's features and its implementation. Our preliminary evaluation indicates that the chatbot performs as designed, effectively following predefined workflows and supporting user interactions with areas for improvement. We conclude by discussing the implications of employing chatbots to elicit user information, emphasizing their potential and limitations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Liu, Chiya Zhang, Yifeng Yuan, Chunlong He, Weizheng Zhang, Gaojie Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of next-generation Wi-Fi technology heavily relies on sensing capabilities, which play a pivotal role in enabling sophisticated applications. In response to the growing demand for large-scale deployments, contemporary Wi-Fi sensing systems strive to achieve high-precision perception while maintaining minimal bandwidth consumption and antenna count requirements. Remarkably, various AI-driven perception technologies have demonstrated the ability to surpass the traditional resolution limitations imposed by radar theory. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this phenomenon have not been thoroughly investigated in existing research. In this study, we found that under hardware-constrained conditions, the performance gains brought by AI to Wi-Fi sensing systems primarily originate from two aspects: prior information and temporal correlation. Prior information enables the AI to generate plausible details based on vague input, while temporal correlation helps reduce the upper bound of sensing error. We developed an AI-based Wi-Fi sensing system using a single transceiver pair and designed experiments focusing on human pose estimation and indoor localization to validate the theoretical claims. The results confirm the performance gains contributed by temporal correlation and prior information.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we present a deep learning framework that learns complex spatio-temporal correlation structures of EEG signals through a Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (STAN) for accurate predictions of onset of seizures for Epilepsy patients. Unlike existing methods, which rely on feature engineering and/or assume fixed preictal durations, our approach simultaneously models spatio-temporal correlations through STAN and employs an adversarial discriminator to distinguish preictal from interictal attention patterns, enabling patient-specific learning. Evaluation on CHB-MIT and MSSM datasets demonstrates 96.6\% sensitivity with 0.011/h false detection rate on CHB-MIT, and 94.2% sensitivity with 0.063/h FDR on MSSM, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The framework reliably detects preictal states at least 15 minutes before an onset, with patient-specific windows extending to 45 minutes, providing sufficient intervention time for clinical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shantanu Sarkar, Piotr Nabrzyski, Saurabh Prasad, Jose Luis Contreras-Vidal</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used non-invasive technique for monitoring brain activity, but low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) due to various artifacts often compromise its utility. Conventional artifact removal methods require manual intervention or risk suppressing critical neural features during filtering/reconstruction. Recent advances in generative models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown promise for EEG reconstruction; however, these approaches often lack integrated temporal-spectral-spatial sensitivity and are computationally intensive, limiting their suitability for real-time applications like brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). To overcome these challenges, we introduce EEGReXferNet, a lightweight Gen-AI framework for EEG subspace reconstruction via cross-subject transfer learning - developed using Keras TensorFlow (v2.15.1). EEGReXferNet employs a modular architecture that leverages volume conduction across neighboring channels, band-specific convolution encoding, and dynamic latent feature extraction through sliding windows. By integrating reference-based scaling, the framework ensures continuity across successive windows and generalizes effectively across subjects. This design improves spatial-temporal-spectral resolution (mean PSD correlation >= 0.95; mean spectrogram RV-Coefficient >= 0.85), reduces total weights by ~45% to mitigate overfitting, and maintains computational efficiency for robust, real-time EEG preprocessing in neurophysiological and BCI applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rushuang Zhou, Yuan-Ting Zhang, M. Jamal Deen, Yining Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying advanced cardiac artificial intelligence for daily cardiac monitoring is hindered by its reliance on extensive medical data and high computational resources. Low-cost cardiac intelligence (LCCI) offers a promising alternative by using wearable device data, such as 1-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), but it suffers from a significant diagnostic performance gap compared to high-cost cardiac intelligence (HCCI). To bridge this gap, we propose LiteHeart, a semi-supervised knowledge distillation framework. LiteHeart introduces a region-aware distillation module to mimic how cardiologists focus on diagnostically relevant ECG regions and a cross-layer mutual information module to align the decision processes of LCCI and HCCI systems. Using a semi-supervised training strategy, LiteHeart further improves model robustness under limited supervision. Evaluated on five datasets covering over 38 cardiovascular diseases, LiteHeart substantially reduces the performance gap between LCCI and HCCI, outperforming existing methods by 4.27% to 7.10% in macro F1 score. These results demonstrate that LiteHeart significantly enhances the diagnostic capabilities of low-cost cardiac intelligence systems, paving the way for scalable, affordable, and accurate daily cardiac healthcare using wearable technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Young-Seok Kweon, Gi-Hwan Shin, Ji-Yong Kim, Bokyeong Ryu, Seong-Whan Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Conscious state estimation is important in various medical settings, including sleep staging and anesthesia management, to ensure patient safety and optimize health outcomes. Traditional methods predominantly utilize electroencephalography (EEG), which faces challenges such as high sensitivity to noise and the requirement for controlled environments. In this study, we propose the consciousness-ECG transformer that leverages electrocardiography (ECG) signals for non-invasive and reliable conscious state estimation. Our approach employs a transformer with decoupled query attention to effectively capture heart rate variability features that distinguish between conscious and unconscious states. We implemented the conscious state estimation system with real-time monitoring and validated our system on datasets involving sleep staging and anesthesia level monitoring during surgeries. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline models, achieving accuracies of 0.877 on sleep staging and 0.880 on anesthesia level monitoring. Moreover, our model achieves the highest area under curve values of 0.786 and 0.895 on sleep staging and anesthesia level monitoring, respectively. The proposed system offers a practical and robust alternative to EEG-based methods, particularly suited for dynamic clinical environments. Our results highlight the potential of ECG-based consciousness monitoring to enhance patient safety and advance our understanding of conscious states.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixiang Chen, Tianshi Zheng, Shijue Huang, Zhitao He, Yi R. Fung</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time scaling without interpreter feedback is essential for real-world code generation scenarios where test cases are not readily available. While existing paradigms often rely on either greedy exploitation (i.e., iterative refinement) or stochastic exploration (i.e., relying on sample-based voting or reranking mechanisms), the balance between these two dimensions remains underexplored. To investigate the LLM's intrinsic ability to balance exploitation and exploration, we introduce SELF-REDRAFT, a framework built upon Self-Refine that encourages the model to propose new drafts for solutions that are fundamentally flawed. Our results show that SELF-REDRAFT consistently achieves better performance than Self-Refine when converged under the same maximum number of iterations. Still, we observe that significant room for improvement remains, largely due to two core aspects of current self-redraft capabilities: constrained capacity for generating instructive feedback and fragile discriminative judgment. We also find that balancing strategies vary notably across different LLMs, reflecting distinct, model-specific behaviors. Overall, our study establishes a baseline for intrinsic exploration-exploitation balancing in test-time scaling and identifies feedback and discrimination as key areas with potential for future advances.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in 2D large-scale and 3D volume electron microscopy have stimulated the rapid development of nanoscale functional analysis at the tissue and organ levels. Digitizing the cell by mapping the intricate organellar networks into its physiological and pathological textures will revolutionarize the contents of cell atlases. To meet the requirements of characterizing intracellular organelles and their interactions within defined cellular cohorts at tissue level, we have developed DeepOrganelle. It adopts a lightweighted Mask2Former frameworks as a universal segmentor and is capable of segmenting and extracting organelles within different cell types, performing statistical quantitative analysis, as well as visualizing and quantifying the spatial distribution of organelle morphologies and interactions across different cell types at tissue scales. Using DeepOrganelle, we systemically perform cross-scale quantification of membrane contact sites(MCSs) dynamics across the progression of the seminiferous epithelial cycle, covering 12 distinct developmental stages and 24 statuses of germ cells. DeepOrganelle uncovers the spatiotemporal gradient of the germ cell differentiation atlas according to different types of organelles and their interactions. Noticeably, it discovers a waved pattern of mitochondria(Mito)-endoplasmic reticulum(ER) contact with a significant increase specifically at Stage X pachytene preceding the transition to diplotene, which aligns well with a newly reported experiment that mitochondrial metabolic proteins like PDHA2 are essential for this transition by maintaining ATP supply for double-strand break(DSB) repair. DeepOrganelle also observes a dynamic restructuring of the blood-testis barrier and stage-specific reorganization of organelle topography in Sertoli cells from preleptotene to leptotene phases of prophase I.</p>

<p>Abstract: AlphaEvolve is a generic evolutionary coding agent that combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with automated evaluation in an iterative evolutionary framework that proposes, tests, and refines algorithmic solutions to challenging scientific and practical problems. In this paper we showcase AlphaEvolve as a tool for autonomously discovering novel mathematical constructions and advancing our understanding of long-standing open problems.
  To demonstrate its breadth, we considered a list of 67 problems spanning mathematical analysis, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. The system rediscovered the best known solutions in most of the cases and discovered improved solutions in several. In some instances, AlphaEvolve is also able to generalize results for a finite number of input values into a formula valid for all input values. Furthermore, we are able to combine this methodology with Deep Think and AlphaProof in a broader framework where the additional proof-assistants and reasoning systems provide automated proof generation and further mathematical insights.
  These results demonstrate that large language model-guided evolutionary search can autonomously discover mathematical constructions that complement human intuition, at times matching or even improving the best known results, highlighting the potential for significant new ways of interaction between mathematicians and AI systems. We present AlphaEvolve as a powerful new tool for mathematical discovery, capable of exploring vast search spaces to solve complex optimization problems at scale, often with significantly reduced requirements on preparation and computation time.</p>

Existing integrity approaches are often heavy or slow for modern LLMs. LM-Fix runs a short test-vector pass and uses hash-guided checks to detect bit-flip faults, then repairs them locally without a full reload. Across multiple models, it detects over 94% of single-bit flips at TVL=200 and nearly 100% of multi-bit flips with approximately 1% to 7.7% runtime overhead; recovery is more than 100x faster than reloading. These results show a practical, low-overhead solution to keep LLMs reliable in production</p>

<p>Abstract: Blockchain systems face persistent challenges of scalability, latency, and energy inefficiency. Existing consensus protocols such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) either consume excessive resources or risk centralization. This paper proposes \textit{Proof-of-Spiking-Neurons (PoSN)}, a neuromorphic consensus protocol inspired by spiking neural networks. PoSN encodes transactions as spike trains, elects leaders through competitive firing dynamics, and finalizes blocks via neural synchronization, enabling parallel and event-driven consensus with minimal energy overhead. A hybrid system architecture is implemented on neuromorphic platforms, supported by simulation frameworks such as Nengo and PyNN. Experimental results show significant gains in energy efficiency, throughput, and convergence compared to PoB and PoR. PoSN establishes a foundation for sustainable, adaptive blockchains suitable for IoT, edge, and large-scale distributed systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirreza Esmaeili, Fahd Seddik, Yongyi Ji, Fatemeh Fard, Fuxiang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Programming languages can benefit from one another by utilizing a language model for software engineering tasks. Full fine-tuning and Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of Code Language Models (Code-LMs) has been explored for multilingual knowledge transfer. AdapterFusion is a PEFT architecture that aims to enhance task performance by leveraging information from multiple programming languages, but primarily focuses on the target programming language.
  In our previous work, we proposed AdvFusion, a novel PEFT-based approach that effectively learns from other programming languages before adapting to the target task. Though previous experiments showed that AdvFusion outperformed AdapterFusion and LoRA, it was applied on pre-trained Code-LMs and was limited to only two tasks, code summarization and method name prediction. In this study, we expanded our work and investigated AdvFusion on Code Large Language Models (Code-LLMs), considering three new tasks: code generation, code translation, and commit message generation. We observed that different Code-LLMs/tasks exhibit different characteristics. In code generation, AdvFusion outperformed AdapterFusion but not other PEFT methods (LoRA, Compacter, and TaskAdapter). In commit message generation, AdapterFusion performed better than AdvFusion, and contrary to code generation, we found that the other PEFT methods do not have better performance. In code translation, AdvFusion performed worse than AdapterFusion overall, with the performance gap marginally widening as the model size increases. However, consistent with code generation, other PEFT methods showed better performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiedong Jiang, Wanyi He, Yuefeng Wang, Guoxiong Gao, Yongle Hu, Jingting Wang, Nailing Guan, Peihao Wu, Chunbo Dai, Liang Xiao, Bin Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in formal theorem proving, particularly on contest-based mathematical benchmarks like the IMO. However, these contests do not reflect the depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new benchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced mathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each with 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a difficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD qualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both PhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a stark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3% (pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals that models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their ability to formalize this reasoning. We systematically classify the common errors that arise during this formalization process. Furthermore, a comparative study shows that a specialized prover can exhibit less effective reflection than general-purpose models, reducing its accuracy at the natural-language stage. We believe FATE provides a robust and challenging benchmark that establishes essential checkpoints on the path toward research-level formal mathematical reasoning.</p>

The framework extracts empirical and epistemic signals from academics, yielding three filtered indicators of such voids: (1) AI-integrated assessment capacity (proxy) - within a three-signal screen (AI skill, perceived teaching benefit, detection confidence), the share who would fully allow AI in exams; (2) sector-level necessity (proxy) - among high output control users who still credit AI with high contribution, the proportion who judge AI capable of challenging established disciplines; and (3) ontological stance - among respondents who judge AI different in kind from prior tools, report practice change, and pass a metacognition gate, the split between material and immaterial views as an ontological map aligning procurement claims with evidence classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S. K. Laha</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting chaotic time series requires models that can capture the intrinsic geometry of the underlying attractor while remaining computationally efficient. We introduce a novel reservoir computing (RC) framework that integrates time-delay embedding with Random Fourier Feature (RFF) mappings to construct a dynamical reservoir without the need for traditional recurrent architectures. Unlike standard RC, which relies on high-dimensional recurrent connectivity, the proposed RFF-RC explicitly approximates nonlinear kernel transformations that uncover latent dynamical relations in the reconstructed phase space. This hybrid formulation offers two key advantages: (i) it provides a principled way to approximate complex nonlinear interactions among delayed coordinates, thereby enriching the effective dynamical representation of the reservoir, and (ii) it reduces reliance on manual reservoir hyperparameters such as spectral radius and leaking rate. We evaluate the framework on canonical chaotic systems-the Mackey-Glass equation, the Lorenz system, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. This novel formulation demonstrates that RFF-RC not only achieves superior prediction accuracy but also yields robust attractor reconstructions and long-horizon forecasts. These results show that the combination of delay embedding and RFF-based reservoirs reveals new dynamical structure by embedding the system in an enriched feature space, providing a computationally efficient and interpretable approach to modeling chaotic dynamics.</p>

DeepForm employs a lightweight GCN architecture that effectively captures high-order structural signals. Stochastic cluster learning enables adaptive group reconfiguration without retraining, while contrastive learning refines groups under dynamic conditions. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DeepForm achieves superior group formation quality, efficiency, and recommendation accuracy compared with various baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehui Zhan, Yaojun Hu, Jiajing Zhan, Wanchen Lian, Wanqing Wu, Jintai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) systems capture cardiac signals from a fixed set of anatomical viewpoints defined by lead placement. However, certain cardiac conditions (e.g., Brugada syndrome) require additional, non-standard viewpoints to reveal diagnostically critical patterns that may be absent in standard leads. To systematically overcome this limitation, Nef-Net was recently introduced to reconstruct a continuous electrocardiac field, enabling virtual observation of ECG signals from arbitrary views (termed Electrocardio Panorama). Despite its promise, Nef-Net operates under idealized assumptions and faces in-the-wild challenges, such as long-duration ECG modeling, robustness to device-specific signal artifacts, and suboptimal lead placement calibration. This paper presents NEF-NET+, an enhanced framework for realistic panoramic ECG synthesis that supports arbitrary-length signal synthesis from any desired view, generalizes across ECG devices, and com- pensates for operator-induced deviations in electrode placement. These capabilities are enabled by a newly designed model architecture that performs direct view transformation, incorporating a workflow comprising offline pretraining, device calibration tuning steps as well as an on-the-fly calibration step for patient-specific adaptation. To rigorously evaluate panoramic ECG synthesis, we construct a new Electrocardio Panorama benchmark, called Panobench, comprising 5367 recordings with 48-view per subject, capturing the full spatial variability of cardiac electrical activity. Experimental results show that NEF-NET+ delivers substantial improvements over Nef-Net, yielding an increase of around 6 dB in PSNR in real-world setting. The code and Panobench will be released in a subsequent publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gwendal Jouneaux, Jordi Cabot</p>
<p>Abstract: AI components are increasingly becoming a key element of all types of software systems to enhance their functionality. These AI components are often implemented as AI Agents, offering more autonomy than a plain integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), moving from a Model-as-a-Service paradigm to an Agent-as-a-Service one, bringing new challenges to the development of smart software systems. Indeed, while support for the design, implementation, and deployment of those agents exist, the specification of Quality of Service (QoS) and definition of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) aspects for those agents, important to ensure the quality of the resulting systems, remains an open challenge. Part of this is due to the difficulty to clearly define quality in the context of AI components, resulting in a lack of consensus on how to best approach Quality Assurance (QA) for these types of systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes both a quality model for AI agents based on the ISO/IEC 25010 standard, and a domain specific language to support the definition of SLAs for the services provided by these AI agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronan Killian McGovern</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior to the close of the 2025 ARC Prize competition, the leading open source approach - known as TRM, or Tiny Recursive Models - involved training a 7M parameter recursive neural network on augmented variants of ARC tasks. That approach scored approximately 7.8% on the public ARC AGI II evaluation set, but required a level of compute far in excess of what is allowed during the competition. This paper shows that, by starting from a tiny recursive model that has been pre-trained on public ARC tasks, one can efficiently fine-tune on competition tasks within the allowed compute limits. Specifically, a model was pre-trained on 1,280 public tasks for 700k+ optimizer steps over 48 hours on 4xH100 SXM GPUs to obtain a ~10% score on the public evaluation set. That model was then post-trained in just 12,500 gradient steps during the competition to reach a score of 6.67% on semi-private evaluation tasks. Notably, such post-training performance is achieved by full-fine tuning of the tiny model, not LoRA fine-tuning or fine-tuning of task embeddings alone.</p>

<p>Abstract: The North Indian Ocean, including the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, represents a vital source of livelihood for coastal communities, yet fishermen often face uncertainty in locating productive fishing grounds. To address this challenge, we present an AI-assisted framework for predicting Potential Fishing Zones (PFZs) using oceanographic parameters such as sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration. The approach is designed to enhance the accuracy of PFZ identification and provide region-specific insights for sustainable fishing practices. Preliminary results indicate that the framework can support fishermen by reducing search time, lowering fuel consumption, and promoting efficient resource utilization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongmin Li, Runze Ma, Jiahao Tan, Chengzi Tan, Shuangjia Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Nucleotide sequence variation can induce significant shifts in functional fitness. Recent nucleotide foundation models promise to predict such fitness effects directly from sequence, yet heterogeneous datasets and inconsistent preprocessing make it difficult to compare methods fairly across DNA and RNA families. Here we introduce NABench, a large-scale, systematic benchmark for nucleic acid fitness prediction. NABench aggregates 162 high-throughput assays and curates 2.6 million mutated sequences spanning diverse DNA and RNA families, with standardized splits and rich metadata. We show that NABench surpasses prior nucleotide fitness benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data quality. Under a unified evaluation suite, we rigorously assess 29 representative foundation models across zero-shot, few-shot prediction, transfer learning, and supervised settings. The results quantify performance heterogeneity across tasks and nucleic-acid types, demonstrating clear strengths and failure modes for different modeling choices and establishing strong, reproducible baselines. We release NABench to advance nucleic acid modeling, supporting downstream applications in RNA/DNA design, synthetic biology, and biochemistry.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02895">A Criminology of Machines</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Gian Maria Campedelli</p>
<p>Abstract: While the possibility of reaching human-like Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains controversial, the likelihood that the future will be characterized by a society with a growing presence of autonomous machines is high. Autonomous AI agents are already deployed and active across several industries and digital environments and alongside human-human and human-machine interactions, machine-machine interactions are poised to become increasingly prevalent. Given these developments, I argue that criminology must begin to address the implications of this transition for crime and social control. Drawing on Actor-Network Theory and Woolgar's decades-old call for a sociology of machines -- frameworks that acquire renewed relevance with the rise of generative AI agents -- I contend that criminologists should move beyond conceiving AI solely as a tool. Instead, AI agents should be recognized as entities with agency encompassing computational, social, and legal dimensions. Building on the literature on AI safety, I thus examine the risks associated with the rise of multi-agent AI systems, proposing a dual taxonomy to characterize the channels through which interactions among AI agents may generate deviant, unlawful, or criminal outcomes. I then advance and discuss four key questions that warrant theoretical and empirical attention: (1) Can we assume that machines will simply mimic humans? (2) Will crime theories developed for humans suffice to explain deviant or criminal behaviors emerging from interactions between autonomous AI agents? (3) What types of criminal behaviors will be affected first? (4) How might this unprecedented societal shift impact policing? These questions underscore the urgent need for criminologists to theoretically and empirically engage with the implications of multi-agent AI systems for the study of crime and play a more active role in debates on AI safety and governance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Clyde Meli, Vitezslav Nezval, Zuzana Kominkova Oplatkova, Victor Buttigieg, Anthony Spiteri Staines</p>
<p>Abstract: Different bitstring representations can yield varying computational performance. This work compares three bitstring implementations in C++: std::bitset, boost::dynamic_bitset, and a custom direct implementation. Their performance is benchmarked in the context of concatenation within a Linear Genetic Programming system. Benchmarks were conducted on three platforms (macOS, Linux, and Windows MSYS2) to assess platform specific performance variations. The results show that the custom direct implementation delivers the fastest performance on Linux and Windows, while std::bitset performs best on macOS. Although consistently slower, boost::dynamic_bitset remains a viable and flexible option. These findings highlight the influence of compiler optimisations and system architecture on performance, providing practical guidance for selecting the optimal method based on platform and application requirements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andy Dimnaku, Abdullah Yusuf Kavrano\u{g}lu, Yaser Abu-Mostafa</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation is widely used in vision to introduce variation and mitigate overfitting, through enabling models to learn invariant properties, such as spatial invariance. However, these properties are not fully captured by data augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on transformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a training methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire input space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training set to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which we refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce functional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the training dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised manner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled virtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across datasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently outperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property. On popular fine-grained visual classification benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.78% top-1 accuracy improvement (0.63% on average) over fine-tuned models with data augmentation and an average performance boost of 1.286% on the CheXpert X-ray dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neil Byers, Ali Zaidi, Valerie Skye, Chris Beecroft, Kjiersten Fagnan</p>
<p>Abstract: Efforts have increased in recent years to identify associations between specific datasets and the scientific literature that incorporates them. Knowing that a given publication cites a given dataset, the next logical step is to explore how or why that data was used. Advances in recent years with pretrained, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) offer potential means for scaling the description of data use cases in the published literature. This avoids expensive manual labeling and the development of training datasets for classical machine-learning (ML) systems. In this work we apply an open-source LLM, Llama 3.1-405B, to generate structured data use case labels for publications known to incorporate specific genomic datasets. We also introduce a novel evaluation framework for determining the efficacy of our methods. Our results demonstrate that the stock model can achieve an F1 score of .674 on a zero-shot data citation classification task with no previously defined categories. While promising, our results are qualified by barriers related to data availability, prompt overfitting, computational infrastructure, and the expense required to conduct responsible performance evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sepideh KhakzadGharamaleki, Hassan Rivaz, Brandon Helfield</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional pulse-echo ultrasound suffers when low-cost probes deliver only narrow fractional bandwidths, elongating pulses and erasing high-frequency detail. We address this limitation by learning a data-driven mapping from band-limited to broadband spectrogram of radio-frequency (RF) lines. To this end, a variation of Tiny Vision Transform (ViT) auto-encoder is trained on simulation data using a curriculum-weighted loss. On heterogeneous speckle-cyst phantoms, the network reduces image-domain MSE by 90 percent, boosts PSNR by 6.7 dB, and raises SSIM to 0.965 compared with the narrow-band input. It also sharpens point-target rows in a completely unseen resolution phantom, demonstrating strong out-of-distribution generalisation without sacrificing frame rate or phase information. These results indicate that a purely software upgrade can endow installed narrow-band probes with broadband-like performance, potentially widening access to high-resolution ultrasound in resource-constrained settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengxu Li, Stephanie M. Carpenter, Matthew P. Buman, Yonatan Mintz</p>
<p>Abstract: A common challenge for decision makers is selecting actions whose rewards are unknown and evolve over time based on prior policies. For instance, repeated use may reduce an action's effectiveness (habituation), while inactivity may restore it (recovery). These nonstationarities are captured by the Reducing or Gaining Unknown Efficacy (ROGUE) bandit framework, which models real-world settings such as behavioral health interventions. While existing algorithms can compute sublinear regret policies to optimize these settings, they may not provide sufficient exploration due to overemphasis on exploitation, limiting the ability to estimate population-level effects. This is a challenge of particular interest in micro-randomized trials (MRTs) that aid researchers in developing just-in-time adaptive interventions that have population-level effects while still providing personalized recommendations to individuals. In this paper, we first develop ROGUE-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm tailored to the ROGUE framework, and provide theoretical guarantees of sublinear regret. We then introduce a probability clipping procedure to balance personalization and population-level learning, with quantified trade-off that balances regret and minimum exploration probability. Validation on two MRT datasets concerning physical activity promotion and bipolar disorder treatment shows that our methods both achieve lower regret than existing approaches and maintain high statistical power through the clipping procedure without significantly increasing regret. This enables reliable detection of treatment effects while accounting for individual behavioral dynamics. For researchers designing MRTs, our framework offers practical guidance on balancing personalization with statistical validity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sadiq Layi Macaulay, Nimet Kaygusuz, Simon Hadfield</p>
<p>Abstract: Event cameras, with their high dynamic range (HDR) and low latency, offer a promising alternative for robust depth estimation in challenging environments. However, many event-based depth estimation approaches are constrained by small-scale annotated datasets, limiting their generalizability to real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce EvtSlowTV, a large-scale event camera dataset curated from publicly available YouTube footage, which contains more than 13B events across various environmental conditions and motions, including seasonal hiking, flying, scenic driving, and underwater exploration. EvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets, providing an unconstrained, naturalistic setting for event-based depth learning. This work shows the suitability of EvtSlowTV for a self-supervised learning framework to capitalise on the HDR potential of raw event streams. We further demonstrate that training with EvtSlowTV enhances the model's ability to generalise to complex scenes and motions. Our approach removes the need for frame-based annotations and preserves the asynchronous nature of event data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stergios Plataniotis, Charilaos Akasiadis, Georgios Chalkiadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient exploration in deep reinforcement learning remains a fundamental challenge, especially in environments characterized by high-dimensional states and sparse rewards. Traditional exploration strategies that rely on random local policy noise, such as $\epsilon$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration methods, often struggle to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation. In this paper, we integrate the notion of (expected) value of information (EVOI) within the well-known Bootstrapped DQN algorithmic framework, to enhance the algorithm's deep exploration ability. Specifically, we develop two novel algorithms that incorporate the expected gain from learning the value of information into Bootstrapped DQN. Our methods use value of information estimates to measure the discrepancies of opinions among distinct network heads, and drive exploration towards areas with the most potential. We evaluate our algorithms with respect to performance and their ability to exploit inherent uncertainty arising from random network initialization. Our experiments in complex, sparse-reward Atari games demonstrate increased performance, all the while making better use of uncertainty, and, importantly, without introducing extra hyperparameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Esther Sun, Zichu Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The design and application of LLM-based personas in AI companionship is a rapidly expanding but fragmented field, spanning from virtual emotional compan- ions and game NPCs to embodied functional robots. This diversity in objectives, modality, and technical stacks creates an urgent need for a unified framework. To address this gap, this paper systematizes the field by proposing a Four-Quadrant Technical Taxonomy for AI companion applications. The framework is structured along two critical axes: Virtual vs. Embodied and Emotional Companionship vs. Functional Augmentation. Quadrant I (Virtual Companionship) explores virtual idols, romantic companions, and story characters, introducing a four-layer technical framework to analyze their challenges in maintaining long-term emotional consistency. Quadrant II (Functional Virtual Assistants) analyzes AI applica- tions in work, gaming, and mental health, highlighting the shift from "feeling" to "thinking and acting" and pinpointing key technologies like enterprise RAG and on-device inference. Quadrants III & IV (Embodied Intelligence) shift from the virtual to the physical world, analyzing home robots and vertical-domain assistants, revealing core challenges in symbol grounding, data privacy, and ethical liability. This taxonomy provides not only a systematic map for researchers and developers to navigate the complex persona design space but also a basis for policymakers to identify and address the unique risks inherent in different application scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has achieved remarkable success across various downstream tasks, but such gains are largely driven by scaling up on training data. Yet, literature methods treat image-text pairs as isolated training examples; this neglects the rich relational structure naturally present in many domains, such as e-commerce product co-purchase graphs and social recommendation networks. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that human encodes knowledge as relationship cognitive maps, we introduce Structure-aware Language-Image Pretraining (SLIP). SLIP integrates a structural contrastive loss to align modalities while also modeling relationships between neighboring entities in a structured graph. To support this paradigm, we construct a large-scale Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset, enabling structured cross-modality supervision at scale. Experiment results show that SLIP consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, showing the value of relational supervision for cross-modal alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingqing Shen, Chi Heem Wong, Misaki Mito, Arnab Chakrabarti</p>
<p>Abstract: Monitoring the internal temperature and humidity of shipping containers is essential to preventing quality degradation during cargo transportation. Sensorless monitoring -- machine learning models that predict the internal conditions of the containers using exogenous factors -- shows promise as an alternative to monitoring using sensors. However, it does not incorporate telemetry information and correct for systematic errors, causing the predictions to differ significantly from the live data and confusing the users. In this paper, we introduce the residual correction method, a general framework for correcting for systematic biases in sensorless models after observing live telemetry data. We call this class of models ``adaptive-sensorless'' monitoring. We train and evaluate adaptive-sensorless models on the 3.48 million data points -- the largest dataset of container sensor readings ever used in academic research -- and show that they produce consistent improvements over the baseline sensorless models. When evaluated on the holdout set of the simulated data, they achieve average mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 2.24 $\sim$ 2.31$^\circ$C (vs 2.43$^\circ$C by sensorless) for temperature and 5.72 $\sim$ 7.09% for relative humidity (vs 7.99% by sensorless) and average root mean-squared errors (RMSEs) of 3.19 $\sim$ 3.26$^\circ$C for temperature (vs 3.38$^\circ$C by sensorless) and 7.70 $\sim$ 9.12% for relative humidity (vs 10.0% by sensorless). Adaptive-sensorless models enable more accurate cargo monitoring, early risk detection, and less dependence on full connectivity in global shipping.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conversational AI is constrained in many real-world settings where only one side of a dialogue can be recorded, such as telemedicine, call centers, and smart glasses. We formalize this as the one-sided conversation problem (1SC): inferring and learning from one side of a conversation. We study two tasks: (1) reconstructing the missing speaker's turns for real-time use cases, and (2) generating summaries from one-sided transcripts. Evaluating prompting and finetuned models on MultiWOZ, DailyDialog, and Candor with both human A/B testing and LLM-as-a-judge metrics, we find that access to one future turn and information about utterance length improves reconstruction, placeholder prompting helps to mitigate hallucination, and while large models generate promising reconstructions with prompting, smaller models require finetuning. Further, high-quality summaries can be generated without reconstructing missing turns. We present 1SC as a novel challenge and report promising results that mark a step toward privacy-aware conversational AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaia Grosso, Sai Sumedh R. Hindupur, Thomas Fel, Samuel Bright-Thonney, Philip Harris, Demba Ba</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence has revolutionized our ability to extract rich and versatile data representations across scientific disciplines. Yet, the statistical properties of these representations remain poorly controlled, causing misspecified anomaly detection (AD) methods to falter. Weak or rare signals can remain hidden within the apparent regularity of normal data, creating a gap in our ability to detect and interpret anomalies. We examine this gap and identify a set of structural desiderata for detection methods operating under minimal prior information: sparsity, to enforce parsimony; locality, to preserve geometric sensitivity; and competition, to promote efficient allocation of model capacity. These principles define a class of self-organizing local kernels that adaptively partition the representation space around regions of statistical imbalance. As an instantiation of these principles, we introduce SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained within a semi-supervised Neyman--Pearson framework to locally model the likelihood ratio between a sample that may contain anomalies and a nominal, anomaly-free reference. We provide theoretical insights into the mechanisms that drive detection and self-organization in the proposed model, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on realistic high-dimensional problems of scientific discovery, open-world novelty detection, intrusion detection, and generative-model validation. Our applications span both the natural- and computer-science domains. We demonstrate that ensembles containing only a handful of kernels can identify statistically significant anomalous locations within representation spaces of thousands of dimensions, underscoring both the interpretability, efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Xiang Li, Michael Amir, Amanda Prorok</p>
<p>Abstract: The agent-environment co-design paradigm jointly optimises agent policies and environment configurations in search of improved system performance. With application domains ranging from warehouse logistics to windfarm management, co-design promises to fundamentally change how we deploy multi-agent systems. However, current co-design methods struggle to scale. They collapse under high-dimensional environment design spaces and suffer from sample inefficiency when addressing moving targets inherent to joint optimisation. We address these challenges by developing Diffusion Co-Design (DiCoDe), a scalable and sample-efficient co-design framework pushing co-design towards practically relevant settings. DiCoDe incorporates two core innovations. First, we introduce Projected Universal Guidance (PUG), a sampling technique that enables DiCoDe to explore a distribution of reward-maximising environments while satisfying hard constraints such as spatial separation between obstacles. Second, we devise a critic distillation mechanism to share knowledge from the reinforcement learning critic, ensuring that the guided diffusion model adapts to evolving agent policies using a dense and up-to-date learning signal. Together, these improvements lead to superior environment-policy pairs when validated on challenging multi-agent environment co-design benchmarks including warehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding and wind farm optimisation. Our method consistently exceeds the state-of-the-art, achieving, for example, 39% higher rewards in the warehouse setting with 66% fewer simulation samples. This sets a new standard in agent-environment co-design, and is a stepping stone towards reaping the rewards of co-design in real world domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mental health disorders affect millions worldwide, yet early detection remains a major challenge, particularly for Arabic-speaking populations where resources are limited and mental health discourse is often discouraged due to cultural stigma. While substantial research has focused on English-language mental health detection, Arabic remains significantly underexplored, partly due to the scarcity of annotated datasets. We present CARMA, the first automatically annotated large-scale dataset of Arabic Reddit posts. The dataset encompasses six mental health conditions, such as Anxiety, Autism, and Depression, and a control group. CARMA surpasses existing resources in both scale and diversity. We conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses of lexical and semantic differences between users, providing insights into the linguistic markers of specific mental health conditions. To demonstrate the dataset's potential for further mental health analysis, we perform classification experiments using a range of models, from shallow classifiers to large language models. Our results highlight the promise of advancing mental health detection in underrepresented languages such as Arabic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael Jos\'e Moura, Maria Gizele Nascimento, Fumio Machida, Ermeson Andrade</p>
<p>Abstract: Software aging is a phenomenon that affects long-running systems, leading to progressive performance degradation and increasing the risk of failures. To mitigate this problem, this work proposes an adaptive approach based on machine learning for software aging detection in environments subject to dynamic workload conditions. We evaluate and compare a static model with adaptive models that incorporate adaptive detectors, specifically the Drift Detection Method (DDM) and Adaptive Windowing (ADWIN), originally developed for concept drift scenarios and applied in this work to handle workload shifts. Experiments with simulated sudden, gradual, and recurring workload transitions show that static models suffer a notable performance drop when applied to unseen workload profiles, whereas the adaptive model with ADWIN maintains high accuracy, achieving an F1-Score above 0.93 in all analyzed scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiameng Chen, Yida Xiong, Kun Li, Hongzhi Zhang, Xiantao Cai, Wenbin Hu, Jia Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational antibody design holds immense promise for therapeutic discovery, yet existing generative models are fundamentally limited by two core challenges: (i) a lack of dynamical consistency, which yields physically implausible structures, and (ii) poor generalization due to data scarcity and structural bias. We introduce FP-AbDiff, the first antibody generator to enforce Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) physics along the entire generative trajectory. Our method minimizes a novel FPE residual loss over the mixed manifold of CDR geometries (R^3 x SO(3)), compelling locally-learned denoising scores to assemble into a globally coherent probability flow. This physics-informed regularizer is synergistically integrated with deep biological priors within a state-of-the-art SE(3)-equivariant diffusion framework. Rigorous evaluation on the RAbD benchmark confirms that FP-AbDiff establishes a new state-of-the-art. In de novo CDR-H3 design, it achieves a mean Root Mean Square Deviation of 0.99 {\AA} when superposing on the variable region, a 25% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art model, AbX, and the highest reported Contact Amino Acid Recovery of 39.91%. This superiority is underscored in the more challenging six-CDR co-design task, where our model delivers consistently superior geometric precision, cutting the average full-chain Root Mean Square Deviation by ~15%, and crucially, achieves the highest full-chain Amino Acid Recovery on the functionally dominant CDR-H3 loop (45.67%). By aligning generative dynamics with physical laws, FP-AbDiff enhances robustness and generalizability, establishing a principled approach for physically faithful and functionally viable antibody design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Zhang, Yifei Wang, Yisen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, self-supervised contrastive learning has achieved great success on various tasks. However, its underlying working mechanism is yet unclear. In this paper, we first provide the tightest bounds based on the widely adopted assumption of conditional independence. Further, we relax the conditional independence assumption to a more practical assumption of augmentation overlap and derive the asymptotically closed bounds for the downstream performance. Our proposed augmentation overlap theory hinges on the insight that the support of different intra-class samples will become more overlapped under aggressive data augmentations, thus simply aligning the positive samples (augmented views of the same sample) could make contrastive learning cluster intra-class samples together. Moreover, from the newly derived augmentation overlap perspective, we develop an unsupervised metric for the representation evaluation of contrastive learning, which aligns well with the downstream performance almost without relying on additional modules.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Botong. Zhao, Xubin. Wang, Shujing. Lyu, Yue. Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrated circuit manufacturing is highly complex, comprising hundreds of process steps. Defects can arise at any stage, causing yield loss and ultimately degrading product reliability. Supervised methods require extensive human annotation and struggle with emergent categories and rare, data scarce defects. Clustering-based unsupervised methods often exhibit unstable performance due to missing priors. We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free framework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect detection and novel class discovery. We first develop Self Normal Information Guided IC Defect Detection, aggregating representative normal features via a learnable normal information extractor and using reconstruction residuals to coarsely localize defect regions. To handle saliency variations across defects, we introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages focused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information Guided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided attention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student model. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background interference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects. We validate the approach on a real world dataset spanning three key fabrication stages and covering 15 defect types. Experiments demonstrate robust performance on both defect detection and unseen defect classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuya Miyaoka, Masaki Inoue</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a control-based framework for aligning large language models (LLMs) by leveraging a control barrier function (CBF) to ensure user-desirable text generation. The presented framework applies the CBF safety filter to the predicted token generated from the baseline LLM, to intervene in the generated text. The safety filter includes two significant advantages: this safety filter is an add-on type, allowing it to be used for alignment purposes without fine-tuning the baseline LLM, and if there is an evaluation model regarding the desired alignment, it can be directly applied to the filter design. The overall text-generation system is implemented with open-source language models, aiming to generate positive text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seunghee Han, Yeonghun Kang, Taeun Bae, Varinia Bernales, Alan Aspuru-Guzik, Jihan Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing materials with targeted properties remains challenging due to the vastness of chemical space and the scarcity of property-labeled data. While recent advances in generative models offer a promising way for inverse design, most approaches require large datasets and must be retrained for every new target property. Here, we introduce the EGMOF (Efficient Generation of MOFs), a hybrid diffusion-transformer framework that overcomes these limitations through a modular, descriptor-mediated workflow. EGMOF decomposes inverse design into two steps: (1) a one-dimensional diffusion model (Prop2Desc) that maps desired properties to chemically meaningful descriptors followed by (2) a transformer model (Desc2MOF) that generates structures from these descriptors. This modular hybrid design enables minimal retraining and maintains high accuracy even under small-data conditions. On a hydrogen uptake dataset, EGMOF achieved over 95% validity and 84% hit rate, representing significant improvements of up to 57% in validity and 14% in hit rate compared to existing methods, while remaining effective with only 1,000 training samples. Moreover, our model successfully performed conditional generation across 29 diverse property datasets, including CoREMOF, QMOF, and text-mined experimental datasets, whereas previous models have not. This work presents a data-efficient, generalizable approach to the inverse design of diverse MOFs and highlights the potential of modular inverse design workflows for broader materials discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harbir Antil, Rainald L\"ohner, Felipe P\'erez</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a linear programming (LP) framework for steady-state diffusion and flux optimization on geometric networks. The state variable satisfies a discrete diffusion law on a weighted, oriented graph, where conductances are scaled by edge lengths to preserve geometric fidelity. Boundary potentials act as controls that drive interior fluxes according to a linear network Laplacian. The optimization problem enforces physically meaningful sign and flux-cap constraints at all boundary edges, derived directly from a gradient bound. This yields a finite-dimensional LP whose feasible set is polyhedral, and whose boundedness and solvability follow from simple geometric or algebraic conditions on the network data.
  We prove that under the absence of negative recession directions--automatically satisfied in the presence of finite box bounds, flux caps, or sign restrictions--the LP admits a global minimizer. Several sufficient conditions guaranteeing boundedness of the feasible region are identified, covering both full-rank and rank-deficient flux maps. The analysis connects classical results such as the Minkowski--Weyl decomposition, Hoffman's bound, and the fundamental theorem of linear programming with modern network-based diffusion modeling.
  Two large-scale examples illustrate the framework: (i) A typical large stadium in a major modern city, which forms a single connected component with relatively uniform corridor widths, and a (ii) A complex street network emanating from a large, historical city center, which forms a multi-component system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Manzini, Priyankari Perali, Robin R. Murphy</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the first AI/ML system for automating building damage assessment in uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery to be deployed operationally during federally declared disasters (Hurricanes Debby and Helene). In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect imagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters, teams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day, representing more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by subject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts. To alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and machine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed to automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has been confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice via the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment with sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known dataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage labels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners. The best performing model was deployed during the responses to Hurricanes Debby and Helene, where it assessed a combined 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes. This work contributes documentation of the actual use of AI/ML for damage assessment during a disaster and lessons learned to the benefit of the AI/ML research and user communities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erfan Shayegani, Jina Suh, Andy Wilson, Nagu Rangan, Javier Hernandez</p>
<p>Abstract: Empathy is a critical factor in fostering positive user experiences in conversational AI. While models can display empathy, it is often generic rather than tailored to specific tasks and contexts. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for developing and evaluating context-specific empathetic large language models (LLMs). We first analyze a real-world conversational dataset consisting of 672 multi-turn conversations across 8 tasks, revealing significant differences in terms of expected and experienced empathy before and after the conversations, respectively. To help minimize this gap, we develop a synthetic multi-turn conversational generation pipeline and steer responses toward our defined empathy patterns based on the context that more closely matches users' expectations. We then train empathetic expert adapters for context-specific empathy that specialize in varying empathy levels based on the recognized task. Our empirical results demonstrate a significant gap reduction of 72.66% between perceived and desired empathy with scores increasing by an average factor of 2.43 as measured by our metrics and reward models. Additionally, our trained empathetic expert adapters demonstrate superior effectiveness in preserving empathy patterns throughout conversation turns, outperforming system prompts, which tend to dramatically diminish in impact as conversations lengthen.</p>

<p>Abstract: Forecasting anomalies (anomaly prediction) in multivariate time series from different real-world, dynamic, and complex systems is vital for preempting critical failures, leading to a substantial minimization in operational costs and human labor. Yet, existing methods are limited to specific systems while failing to generalize to evolving anomaly patterns over time. In contrast, pretrained Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently demonstrated strong generalization and zero-shot forecasting capabilities. However, their potential remains untapped for anomaly prediction, a task fundamentally different from forecasting normal behavior. Thus, we present Forecast2Anomaly (F2A), a novel framework that empowers TSFMs with anomaly prediction abilities through two key innovations. First, we propose a joint forecast-anomaly loss that fine-tunes TSFMs to accurately forecast future signals even at anomalous time points. Second, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves historically relevant horizons and conditions predictions on them. This component dynamically adapts to distributional shifts at inference time, enabling F2A to track evolving anomalies without requiring model updates. By combining targeted fine-tuning with dynamic retrieval, F2A bridges the gap between robust TSFM zero-shot forecasting and zero-shot anomaly prediction. Extensive experiments across 16 diverse datasets and multiple TSFM backbones show that F2A consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a scalable, zero-shot anomaly prediction solution for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding how different stakeholders perceive risks in AI systems is essential for their responsible deployment. This paper presents a framework for stakeholder-grounded risk assessment by using LLMs, acting as judges to predict and explain risks. Using the Risk Atlas Nexus and GloVE explanation method, our framework generates stakeholder-specific, interpretable policies that shows how different stakeholders agree or disagree about the same risks. We demonstrate our method using three real-world AI use cases of medical AI, autonomous vehicles, and fraud detection domain. We further propose an interactive visualization that reveals how and why conflicts emerge across stakeholder perspectives, enhancing transparency in conflict reasoning. Our results show that stakeholder perspectives significantly influence risk perception and conflict patterns. Our work emphasizes the importance of these stakeholder-aware explanations needed to make LLM-based evaluations more transparent, interpretable, and aligned with human-centered AI governance goals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khouloud Oueslati, Maxime Lamothe, Foutse Khomh</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially influenced various software engineering tasks. Indeed, in the case of software refactoring, traditional LLMs have shown the ability to reduce development time and enhance code quality. However, these LLMs often rely on static, detailed instructions for specific tasks. In contrast, LLM-based agents can dynamically adapt to evolving contexts and autonomously make decisions by interacting with software tools and executing workflows. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLM-based agents in supporting refactoring activities. Specifically, we introduce RefAgent, a multi-agent LLM-based framework for end-to-end software refactoring. RefAgent consists of specialized agents responsible for planning, executing, testing, and iteratively refining refactorings using self-reflection and tool-calling capabilities. We evaluate RefAgent on eight open-source Java projects, comparing its effectiveness against a single-agent approach, a search-based refactoring tool, and historical developer refactorings. Our assessment focuses on: (1) the impact of generated refactorings on software quality, (2) the ability to identify refactoring opportunities, and (3) the contribution of each LLM agent through an ablation study. Our results show that RefAgent achieves a median unit test pass rate of 90%, reduces code smells by a median of 52.5%, and improves key quality attributes (e.g., reusability) by a median of 8.6%. Additionally, it closely aligns with developer refactorings and the search-based tool in identifying refactoring opportunities, attaining a median F1-score of 79.15% and 72.7%, respectively. Compared to single-agent approaches, RefAgent improves the median unit test pass rate by 64.7% and the median compilation success rate by 40.1%. These findings highlight the promise of multi-agent architectures in advancing automated software refactoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hajung Kim, Jueon Park, Junseok Choe, Sheunheun Baek, Hyeon Hwang, Jaewoo Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantitative structure-activity relationship assumes a smooth relationship between molecular structure and biological activity. However, activity cliffs defined as pairs of structurally similar compounds with large potency differences break this continuity. Recent benchmarks targeting activity cliffs have revealed that classical machine learning models with extended connectivity fingerprints outperform graph neural networks. Our analysis shows that graph embeddings fail to adequately separate structurally similar molecules in the embedding space, making it difficult to distinguish between structurally similar but functionally different molecules. Despite this limitation, molecular graph structures are inherently expressive and attractive, as they preserve molecular topology. To preserve the structural representation of molecules as graphs, we propose a new model, GraphCliff, which integrates short- and long-range information through a gating mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphCliff consistently improves performance on both non-cliff and cliff compounds. Furthermore, layer-wise node embedding analyses reveal reduced over-smoothing and enhanced discriminative power relative to strong baseline graph models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arsalan Muhammad, Wasiu Akande Ahmed, Omada Friday Ojonugwa, Paul Puspendu Biswas</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of cislunar activities, including lunar landings, the Lunar Gateway, and in-space refueling stations, requires advances in cost-efficient trajectory design and reliable integration of navigation and remote sensing. Traditional Earth-Moon transfers suffer from rigid launch windows and high propellant demands, while Earth-based GNSS systems provide little to no coverage beyond geostationary orbit. This limits autonomy and environmental awareness in cislunar space. This review compares four major transfer strategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel efficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic missions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is highlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition and digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables adaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and decision latency. The study also examines how GNSS-Reflectometry and advanced Positioning, Navigation, and Timing architectures can extend navigation capabilities beyond current limits. GNSS-R can act as a bistatic radar for mapping lunar ice, soil properties, and surface topography, while PNT systems support autonomous rendezvous, Lagrange point station-keeping, and coordinated satellite swarm operations. Combining these developments establishes a scalable framework for sustainable cislunar exploration and long-term human and robotic presence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingtao Zhang, Guoli Yang, Zhanxing Zhu, Mengzhu Wang, Xiaoying Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention mechanisms have been extensively employed in various applications, including time series modeling, owing to their capacity to capture intricate dependencies; however, their utility is often constrained by quadratic computational complexity, which impedes scalability for long sequences. In this work, we propose a novel linear attention mechanism designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical demonstration that entropy, as a strictly concave function on the probability simplex, implies that distributions with aligned probability rankings and similar entropy values exhibit structural resemblance. Building on this insight, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that computes the entropy of dot-product-derived distributions with only linear complexity, enabling the implementation of a linear attention mechanism based on entropy equality. Through rigorous analysis, we reveal that the effectiveness of attention in spatio-temporal time series modeling may not primarily stem from the non-linearity of softmax but rather from the attainment of a moderate and well-balanced weight distribution. Extensive experiments on four spatio-temporal datasets validate our method, demonstrating competitive or superior forecasting performance while achieving substantial reductions in both memory usage and computational time.</p>

<p>Abstract: In an effort to counter the increasing IoT botnet-based attacks, state-of-the-art deep learning methods have been proposed and have achieved impressive detection accuracy. However, their computational intensity restricts deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices, creating a critical need for lightweight detection models. A common solution to this challenge is model compression via quantization. This study proposes a VAE-MLP model framework where an MLP-based classifier is trained on 8-dimensional latent vectors derived from the high-dimensional train data using the encoder component of a pretrained variational autoencoder (VAE). Two widely used quantization strategies--Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)--are then systematically evaluated in terms of their impact on detection performance, storage efficiency, and inference latency using two benchmark IoT botnet datasets--N-BaIoT and CICIoT2022. The results revealed that, with respect to detection accuracy, the QAT strategy experienced a more noticeable decline,whereas PTQ incurred only a marginal reduction compared to the original unquantized model. Furthermore, PTQ yielded a 6x speedup and 21x reduction in size, while QAT achieved a 3x speedup and 24x compression, demonstrating the practicality of quantization for device-level IoT botnet detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuei-Chun Kao, Hsu Tzu-Yin, Yunqi Hong, Ruochen Wang, Cho-Jui Hsieh</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter two key issues in multi-image contexts: (1) a lack of fine-grained perception across disparate images, and (2) a diminished capability to effectively reason over and synthesize information from multiple visual inputs. However, while various prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings, we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions (QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henry Fraser, Zahra Stardust</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper examines the role of public interest litigation in promoting accountability for AI and automated decision-making (ADM) in Australia. Since ADM regulatio faces geopolitical headwinds, effective governance will have to rely at least in part on the enforcement of existing laws. Drawing on interviews with Australian public interest litigators, technology policy activists, and technology law scholars, the paper positions public interest litigation as part of a larger ecosystem for transparency, accountability and justice with respect to ADM. It builds on one participants's characterisation of litigation about ADM as an exercise in legal retrofitting: adapting old laws to new circumstances. The paper's primary contribution is to aggregate, organise and present original insights on pragmatic strategies and tactics for effective public interest litigation about ADM. Naturally, it also contends with the limits of these strategies, and of the legal system. Where limits are, however, capable of being overcome, the paper presents findings on urgent needs: the enabling institutional arrangements without which effective litigation and accountability will falter. The paper is relevant to law and technology scholars; individuals and groups harmed by ADM; public interest litigators and technology lawyers; civil society and advocacy organisations; and policymakers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong semantic understanding, yet struggle when user instructions involve ambiguous or conceptually misaligned terms. We propose the Language Graph Model (LGM) to enhance conceptual clarity by extracting meta-relations-inheritance, alias, and composition-from natural language. The model further employs a reflection mechanism to validate these meta-relations. Leveraging a Concept Iterative Retrieval Algorithm, these relations and related descriptions are dynamically supplied to the LLM, improving its ability to interpret concepts and generate accurate responses. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches that rely on extended context windows, our method enables large language models to process texts of any length without the need for truncation. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the LGM consistently outperforms existing RAG baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in generating fluent utterances but can lack reliable grounding in verified information. At the same time, knowledge-graph-based fact-checkers deliver precise and interpretable evidence, yet suffer from limited coverage or latency. By integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs and real-time search agents, we introduce a hybrid fact-checking approach that leverages the individual strengths of each component. Our system comprises three autonomous steps: 1) a Knowledge Graph (KG) Retrieval for rapid one - hop lookups in DBpedia, 2) an LM-based classification guided by a task-specific labeling prompt, producing outputs with internal rule-based logic, and 3) a Web Search Agent invoked only when KG coverage is insufficient. Our pipeline achieves an F1 score of 0.93 on the FEVER benchmark on the Supported/Refuted split without task- specific fine - tuning. To address Not enough information cases, we conduct a targeted reannotation study showing that our approach frequently uncovers valid evidence for claims originally labeled as Not Enough Information (NEI), as confirmed by both expert annotators and LLM reviewers. With this paper, we present a modular, opensource fact-checking pipeline with fallback strategies and generalization across datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Htet Kyaw, Lenin Ravindranath Sivalingam</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a node-based storytelling system for multimodal content generation. The system represents stories as graphs of nodes that can be expanded, edited, and iteratively refined through direct user edits and natural-language prompts. Each node can integrate text, images, audio, and video, allowing creators to compose multimodal narratives. A task selection agent routes between specialized generative tasks that handle story generation, node structure reasoning, node diagram formatting, and context generation. The interface supports targeted editing of individual nodes, automatic branching for parallel storylines, and node-based iterative refinement. Our results demonstrate that node-based editing supports control over narrative structure and iterative generation of text, images, audio, and video. We report quantitative outcomes on automatic story outline generation and qualitative observations of editing workflows. Finally, we discuss current limitations such as scalability to longer narratives and consistency across multiple nodes, and outline future work toward human-in-the-loop and user-centered creative AI tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhibin Wang, Zhixing Zhang, Shuqi Wang, Xuanting Xie, Zhao Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance on task-specific benchmarks, yet their ability to generalize across diverse domains and tasks remains limited. Existing approaches often struggle with negative transfer, scalability issues, and high adaptation costs. To address these challenges, we propose GMoPE (Graph Mixture of Prompt-Experts), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with prompt-based learning for graphs. GMoPE leverages expert-specific prompt vectors and structure-aware MoE routing to enable each expert to specialize in distinct subdomains and dynamically contribute to predictions. To promote diversity and prevent expert collapse, we introduce a soft orthogonality constraint across prompt vectors, encouraging expert specialization and facilitating a more balanced expert utilization. Additionally, we adopt a prompt-only fine-tuning strategy that significantly reduces spatiotemporal complexity during transfer. We validate GMoPE through extensive experiments under various pretraining strategies and multiple downstream tasks. Results show that GMoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves performance comparable to full parameter fine-tuning-while requiring only a fraction of the adaptation overhead. Our work provides a principled and scalable framework for advancing generalizable and efficient graph foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolina Tomic Roshni Bhatnagar, Sarthak Jain, Connor Lau, Tien-Yu Liu, Laura Gambini, Rima Arnaout</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has the potential to revolutionize image acquisition and interpretation across medicine, however, attention to data imbalance and missingness is required. Ultrasound data presents a particular challenge because in addition to different views and structures, it includes several sub-modalities-such as greyscale and color flow doppler (CFD)-that are often imbalanced in clinical studies. Image translation can help balance datasets but is challenging for ultrasound sub-modalities to date. Here, we present a generative method for ultrasound CFD-greyscale video translation, trained on 54,975 videos and tested on 8,368. The method developed leveraged pixel-wise, adversarial, and perceptual loses and utilized two networks: one for reconstructing anatomic structures and one for denoising to achieve realistic ultrasound imaging. Average pairwise SSIM between synthetic videos and ground truth was 0.91+/-0.04. Synthetic videos performed indistinguishably from real ones in DL classification and segmentation tasks and when evaluated by blinded clinical experts: F1 score was 0.9 for real and 0.89 for synthetic videos; Dice score between real and synthetic segmentation was 0.97. Overall clinician accuracy in distinguishing real vs synthetic videos was 54+/-6% (42-61%), indicating realistic synthetic videos. Although trained only on heart videos, the model worked well on ultrasound spanning several clinical domains (average SSIM 0.91+/-0.05), demonstrating foundational abilities. Together, these data expand the utility of retrospectively collected imaging and augment the dataset design toolbox for medical imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ranul Dayarathne, Uvini Ranaweera, Upeksha Ganegoda</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is emerging as a powerful technique to enhance the capabilities of Generative AI models by reducing hallucination. Thus, the increasing prominence of RAG alongside Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in comparing the performance of different LLMs in question-answering (QA) in diverse domains. This study compares the performance of four open-source LLMs, Mistral-7b-instruct, LLaMa2-7b-chat, Falcon-7b-instruct and Orca-mini-v3-7b, and OpenAI's trending GPT-3.5 over QA tasks within the computer science literature leveraging RAG support. Evaluation metrics employed in the study include accuracy and precision for binary questions and ranking by a human expert, ranking by Google's AI model Gemini, alongside cosine similarity for long-answer questions. GPT-3.5, when paired with RAG, effectively answers binary and long-answer questions, reaffirming its status as an advanced LLM. Regarding open-source LLMs, Mistral AI's Mistral-7b-instruct paired with RAG surpasses the rest in answering both binary and long-answer questions. However, among the open-source LLMs, Orca-mini-v3-7b reports the shortest average latency in generating responses, whereas LLaMa2-7b-chat by Meta reports the highest average latency. This research underscores the fact that open-source LLMs, too, can go hand in hand with proprietary models like GPT-3.5 with better infrastructure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mauro Cettolo, Marco Gaido, Matteo Negri, Sara Papi, Luisa Bentivogli</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic evaluation of speech-to-text translation (ST) systems is typically performed by comparing translation hypotheses with one or more reference translations. While effective to some extent, this approach inherits the limitation of reference-based evaluation that ignores valuable information from the source input. In machine translation (MT), recent progress has shown that neural metrics incorporating the source text achieve stronger correlation with human judgments. Extending this idea to ST, however, is not trivial because the source is audio rather than text, and reliable transcripts or alignments between source and references are often unavailable. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study of source-aware metrics for ST, with a particular focus on real-world operating conditions where source transcripts are not available. We explore two complementary strategies for generating textual proxies of the input audio, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, and back-translations of the reference translation, and introduce a novel two-step cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address the alignment mismatch between synthetic sources and reference translations. Our experiments, carried out on two ST benchmarks covering 79 language pairs and six ST systems with diverse architectures and performance levels, show that ASR transcripts constitute a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when word error rate is below 20%, while back-translations always represent a computationally cheaper but still effective alternative. Furthermore, our cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT metrics in ST evaluation, paving the way toward more accurate and principled evaluation methodologies for speech translation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix St\"orck, Fabian Hinder, Barbara Hammer</p>
<p>Abstract: With the on-going integration of machine learning systems into the everyday social life of millions the notion of fairness becomes an ever increasing priority in their development. Fairness notions commonly rely on protected attributes to assess potential biases. Here, the majority of literature focuses on discrete setups regarding both target and protected attributes. The literature on continuous attributes especially in conjunction with regression -- we refer to this as \emph{continuous fairness} -- is scarce. A common strategy is iterative null-space projection which as of now has only been explored for linear models or embeddings such as obtained by a non-linear encoder. We improve on this by generalizing to kernel methods, significantly extending the scope. This yields a model and fairness-score agnostic method for kernel embeddings applicable to continuous protected attributes. We demonstrate that our novel approach in conjunction with Support Vector Regression (SVR) provides competitive or improved performance across multiple datasets in comparisons to other contemporary methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: A recent advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) research is the emergence of "reasoning MLLMs" that offer explicit control over their internal thinking processes (normally referred as the "thinking mode") alongside the standard "non-thinking mode". This capability allows these models to engage in a step-by-step process of internal deliberation before generating a final response. With the rapid transition to and adoption of these "dual-state" MLLMs, this work rigorously evaluated how the enhanced reasoning processes of these MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical tasks. This paper evaluates the active "thinking mode" capabilities of two leading MLLMs, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, for medical applications. We assessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and ROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the thinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for the majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as open-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal, highlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced methods for medical knowledge integration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenghua Wang, Zhen Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of open-access (OA) publications has intensified the challenge of identifying relevant scientific papers. Due to privacy constraints and limited access to user interaction data, recent efforts have shifted toward content-based recommendation, which relies solely on textual information. However, existing models typically treat papers as unstructured text, neglecting their discourse organization and thereby limiting semantic completeness and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose OMRC-MR, a hierarchical framework that integrates QA-style OMRC (Objective, Method, Result, Conclusion) summarization, multi-level contrastive learning, and structure-aware re-ranking for scholarly recommendation. The QA-style summarization module converts raw papers into structured and discourse-consistent representations, while multi-level contrastive objectives align semantic representations across metadata, section, and document levels. The final re-ranking stage further refines retrieval precision through contextual similarity calibration. Experiments on DBLP, S2ORC, and the newly constructed Sci-OMRC dataset demonstrate that OMRC-MR consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 7.2% and 3.8% improvements in Precision@10 and Recall@10, respectively. Additional evaluations confirm that QA-style summarization produces more coherent and factually complete representations. Overall, OMRC-MR provides a unified and interpretable content-based paradigm for scientific paper recommendation, advancing trustworthy and privacy-aware scholarly information retrieval.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has become a transformative approach in bioinformatics that often enables advancements in genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, structural biology, and drug discovery. To systematically identify and evaluate these growing developments, this review proposed six research questions (RQs), according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis methods. The objective is to evaluate impactful GenAI strategies in methodological advancement, predictive performance, and specialization, and to identify promising approaches for advanced modeling, data-intensive discovery, and integrative biological analysis. RQ1 highlights diverse applications across multiple bioinformatics subfields (sequence analysis, molecular design, and integrative data modeling), which demonstrate superior performance over traditional methods through pattern recognition and output generation. RQ2 reveals that adapted specialized model architectures outperformed general-purpose models, an advantage attributed to targeted pretraining and context-aware strategies. RQ3 identifies significant benefits in the bioinformatics domains, focusing on molecular analysis and data integration, which improves accuracy and reduces errors in complex analysis. RQ4 indicates improvements in structural modeling, functional prediction, and synthetic data generation, validated by established benchmarks. RQ5 suggests the main constraints, such as the lack of scalability and biases in data that impact generalizability, and proposes future directions focused on robust evaluation and biologically grounded modeling. RQ6 examines that molecular datasets (such as UniProtKB and ProteinNet12), cellular datasets (such as CELLxGENE and GTEx) and textual resources (such as PubMedQA and OMIM) broadly support the training and generalization of GenAI models.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we present a new state-of-the-art Romanian Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system based on NVIDIA's FastConformer architecture--explored here for the first time in the context of Romanian. We train our model on a large corpus of, mostly, weakly supervised transcriptions, totaling over 2,600 hours of speech. Leveraging a hybrid decoder with both Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and Token-Duration Transducer (TDT) branches, we evaluate a range of decoding strategies including greedy, ALSD, and CTC beam search with a 6-gram token-level language model. Our system achieves state-of-the-art performance across all Romanian evaluation benchmarks, including read, spontaneous, and domain-specific speech, with up to 27% relative WER reduction compared to previous best-performing systems. In addition to improved transcription accuracy, our approach demonstrates practical decoding efficiency, making it suitable for both research and deployment in low-latency ASR applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gahyeon Kim, Sohee Kim, Seokju Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to significant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and CoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors, known as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these models often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While traditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data augmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based modifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely unexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations, particularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support and enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between these augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to improve generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such as CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that focus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations introduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This decoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually discriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct comprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and domain generalization settings.

<p>Abstract: We present a framework that combines Large Language Models with computational image analytics for non-invasive, zero-shot prediction of IDH mutation status in brain gliomas. For each subject, coregistered multi-parametric MRI scans and multi-class tumor segmentation maps were processed to extract interpretable semantic (visual) attributes and quantitative features, serialized in a standardized JSON file, and used to query GPT 4o and GPT 5 without fine-tuning. We evaluated this framework on six publicly available datasets (N = 1427) and results showcased high accuracy and balanced classification performance across heterogeneous cohorts, even in the absence of manual annotations. GPT 5 outperformed GPT 4o in context-driven phenotype interpretation. Volumetric features emerged as the most important predictors, supplemented by subtype-specific imaging markers and clinical information. Our results demonstrate the potential of integrating LLM-based reasoning with computational image analytics for precise, non-invasive tumor genotyping, advancing diagnostic strategies in neuro-oncology.

<p>Abstract: AlphaZero-like Monte Carlo Tree Search systems, originally introduced for two-player games, dynamically balance exploration and exploitation using neural network guidance. This combination makes them also suitable for classical search problems. However, the original method of training the network with simulation results is limited in sparse reward settings, especially in the early stages, where the network cannot yet give guidance. Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) addresses this issue by relabeling unsuccessful trajectories from the search tree as supervised learning signals. We introduce Adaptable HER (\ours{}), a flexible framework that integrates HER with AlphaZero, allowing easy adjustments to HER properties such as relabeled goals, policy targets, and trajectory selection. Our experiments, including equation discovery, show that the possibility of modifying HER is beneficial and surpasses the performance of pure supervised or reinforcement learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihai Wang, Tao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Elicited performance requirements need to be quantified for compliance in different engineering tasks, e.g., configuration tuning and performance testing. Much existing work has relied on manual quantification, which is expensive and error-prone due to the imprecision. In this paper, we present LQPR, a highly efficient automatic approach for performance requirements quantification.LQPR relies on a new theoretical framework that converts quantification as a classification problem. Despite the prevalent applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) for requirement analytics, LQPR takes a different perspective to address the classification: we observed that performance requirements can exhibit strong patterns and are often short/concise, therefore we design a lightweight linguistically induced matching mechanism. We compare LQPR against nine state-of-the-art learning-based approaches over diverse datasets, demonstrating that it is ranked as the sole best for 75% or more cases with two orders less cost. Our work proves that, at least for performance requirement quantification, specialized methods can be more suitable than the general LLM-driven approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Botao 'Amber' Hu, Helena Rong</p>
<p>Abstract: As the "agentic web" takes shape-billions of AI agents (often LLM-powered) autonomously transacting and collaborating-trust shifts from human oversight to protocol design. In 2025, several inter-agent protocols crystallized this shift, including Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), and Ethereum's ERC-8004 "Trustless Agents," yet their underlying trust assumptions remain under-examined. This paper presents a comparative study of trust models in inter-agent protocol design: Brief (self- or third-party verifiable claims), Claim (self-proclaimed capabilities and identity, e.g. AgentCard), Proof (cryptographic verification, including zero-knowledge proofs and trusted execution environment attestations), Stake (bonded collateral with slashing and insurance), Reputation (crowd feedback and graph-based trust signals), and Constraint (sandboxing and capability bounding). For each, we analyze assumptions, attack surfaces, and design trade-offs, with particular emphasis on LLM-specific fragilities-prompt injection, sycophancy/nudge-susceptibility, hallucination, deception, and misalignment-that render purely reputational or claim-only approaches brittle. Our findings indicate no single mechanism suffices. We argue for trustless-by-default architectures anchored in Proof and Stake to gate high-impact actions, augmented by Brief for identity and discovery and Reputation overlays for flexibility and social signals. We comparatively evaluate A2A, AP2, ERC-8004 and related historical variations in academic research under metrics spanning security, privacy, latency/cost, and social robustness (Sybil/collusion/whitewashing resistance). We conclude with hybrid trust model recommendations that mitigate reputation gaming and misinformed LLM behavior, and we distill actionable design guidelines for safer, interoperable, and scalable agent economies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Critical appraisal of scientific literature is an essential skill in the biomedical field. While large language models (LLMs) can offer promising support in this task, their reliability remains limited, particularly for critical reasoning in specialized domains. We introduce CareMedEval, an original dataset designed to evaluate LLMs on biomedical critical appraisal and reasoning tasks. Derived from authentic exams taken by French medical students, the dataset contains 534 questions based on 37 scientific articles. Unlike existing benchmarks, CareMedEval explicitly evaluates critical reading and reasoning grounded in scientific papers. Benchmarking state-of-the-art generalist and biomedical-specialized LLMs under various context conditions reveals the difficulty of the task: open and commercial models fail to exceed an Exact Match Rate of 0.5 even though generating intermediate reasoning tokens considerably improves the results. Yet, models remain challenged especially on questions about study limitations and statistical analysis. CareMedEval provides a challenging benchmark for grounded reasoning, exposing current LLM limitations and paving the way for future development of automated support for critical appraisal.</p>

<p>Abstract: The human hand plays a vital role in daily life and industrial applications, yet replicating its multifunctional capabilities-including motion, sensing, and coordinated manipulation-with robotic systems remains a formidable challenge. Developing a dexterous robotic hand requires balancing human-like agility with engineering constraints such as complexity, size-to-weight ratio, durability, and force-sensing performance. This letter presents Dex-Hand 021, a high-performance, cable-driven five-finger robotic hand with 12 active and 7 passive degrees of freedom (DoFs), achieving 19 DoFs dexterity in a lightweight 1 kg design. We propose a proprioceptive force-sensing-based admittance control method to enhance manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance: a single-finger load capacity exceeding 10 N, fingertip repeatability under 0.001 m, and force estimation errors below 0.2 N. Compared to PID control, joint torques in multi-object grasping are reduced by 31.19%, significantly improves force-sensing capability while preventing overload during collisions. The hand excels in both power and precision grasps, successfully executing 33 GRASP taxonomy motions and complex manipulation tasks. This work advances the design of lightweight, industrial-grade dexterous hands and enhances proprioceptive control, contributing to robotic manipulation and intelligent manufacturing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Fu, Sahar Salimpour, Leonardo Militano, Harry Edelman, Jorge Pe\~na Queralta, Giovanni Toffetti</p>
<p>Abstract: Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key research verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, with Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and enabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2 CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source (through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools available to the models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Spadon, Vaishnav Vaidheeswaran, Claudio DiBacco</p>
<p>Abstract: Marine invasive species spread through global shipping and generate substantial ecological and economic impacts. Traditional risk assessments require detailed records of ballast water and traffic patterns, which are often incomplete, limiting global coverage. This work advances a theoretical framework that quantifies invasion risk by combining environmental similarity across ports with observed and forecasted maritime mobility. Climate-based feature representations characterize each port's marine conditions, while mobility networks derived from Automatic Identification System data capture vessel flows and potential transfer pathways. Clustering and metric learning reveal climate analogues and enable the estimation of species survival likelihood along shipping routes. A temporal link prediction model captures how traffic patterns may change under shifting environmental conditions. The resulting fusion of environmental similarity and predicted mobility provides exposure estimates at the port and voyage levels, supporting targeted monitoring, routing adjustments, and management interventions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marc Martinez-Gost, Sara Pepe, Ana P\'erez-Neira, Miguel \'Angel Lagunas</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we extend our previous work on the Expressive Neural Network (ENN), a multilayer perceptron with adaptive activation functions parametrized using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Building upon previous work that demonstrated the strong expressiveness of ENNs with compact architectures, we now emphasize their efficiency, interpretability and pruning capabilities. The DCT-based parameterization provides a structured and decorrelated representation that reveals the functional role of each neuron and allows direct identification of redundant components. Leveraging this property, we propose an efficient pruning strategy that removes unnecessary DCT coefficients with negligible or no loss in performance. Experimental results across classification and implicit neural representation tasks confirm that ENNs achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining a low number of parameters. Furthermore, up to 40% of the activation coefficients can be safely pruned, thanks to the orthogonality and bounded nature of the DCT basis. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the ENN framework offers a principled integration of signal processing concepts into neural network design, achieving a balanced trade-off between expressiveness, compactness, and interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziv Nevo, Orna Raz, Karen Yorav</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the purpose of source code is a critical task in software maintenance, onboarding, and modernization. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating code explanations, they often lack grounding in the broader software engineering context. We propose a novel approach that leverages natural language artifacts from GitHub -- such as pull request descriptions, issue descriptions and discussions, and commit messages -- to enhance LLM-based code understanding. Our system consists of three components: one that extracts and structures relevant GitHub context, another that uses this context to generate high-level explanations of the code's purpose, and a third that validates the explanation. We implemented this as a standalone tool, as well as a server within the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling integration with other AI-assisted development tools. Our main use case is that of enhancing a standard LLM-based code explanation with code insights that our system generates. To evaluate explanations' quality, we conducted a small scale user study, with developers of several open projects, as well as developers of proprietary projects. Our user study indicates that when insights are generated they often are helpful and non trivial, and are free from hallucinations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sofie Helene Bruun, Dan Saattrup Smart</p>
<p>Abstract: Measuring the full abilities of large language models (LLMs) requires benchmarks representing multiple tasks. We aim to create large, high-quality datasets for comparison of logical reasoning skills across several languages and of suitable difficulty for LLMs of various reasoning ability. We explore multiple ways of increasing difficulty. We generate zebra puzzles in multiple languages, themes, sizes and including 14 different clue types and 8 red herring types (uninformative clues). We find puzzle sizes 2x3 and 4x5 are sufficiently challenging for GPT-4o mini (a non-reasoning model) and o3-mini (a reasoning model), respectively. Including 5 red herrings decreases o3-mini puzzle-level accuracy on 4x5 puzzles by 15$\pm$7 %. Scores of o3-mini on 4x5 puzzles are not significantly affected by use of English vs. Danish or the common houses theme vs. the country-specific smoerrebroed theme. We find no correlation between difficulty and the selected clue types. Datasets of 128+1024 puzzles are published as MultiZebraLogic in each of nine Germanic languages for sizes 2x3 and 4x5. We publish code for puzzle generation, designed for adaptablity into more languages and themes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joachim Diederich</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the first empirical demonstration of controllable locality in transformer language models, a novel architectural framework that enables continuous control over the degree of representation localization through a tunable locality dial parameter. Unlike traditional language models that rely exclusively on distributed representations, our approach allows dynamic interpolation between highly interpretable localist encodings and efficient distributed representations without requiring model retraining. We conducted experiments on the WikiText corpus using a two-layer transformer architecture, systematically varying the locality parameter {\lambda} across the full spectrum from 1.0 (fully localist) to 0.0 (fully distributed). Our results demonstrate that localist configurations achieve dramatically lower attention entropy, with {\lambda} = 1.0 yielding 5.36 bits compared to 7.18 bits at {\lambda} = 0.0, while maintaining substantially higher pointer fidelity scores reflecting stronger alignment with rule-specified targets. Prediction experiments reveal that intermediate locality values optimize the tradeoff between interpretability and performance, with {\lambda} = 0.6 achieving test perplexity of 4.65 and accuracy of 84.7%. These findings establish that localist language models provide a practical framework for applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability, offering precise mathematical control over the interpretability-performance spectrum through explicit penalty thresholds and information-theoretic design principles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iason Chrysomallis, Georgios Chalkiadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables agents to acquire skills by observing and replicating the behavior of one or multiple experts. In recent years, advances in deep learning have significantly expanded the capabilities and scalability of imitation learning across a range of domains, where expert data can range from full state-action trajectories to partial observations or unlabeled sequences. Alongside this growth, novel approaches have emerged, with new methodologies being developed to address longstanding challenges such as generalization, covariate shift, and demonstration quality. In this survey, we review the latest advances in imitation learning research, highlighting recent trends, methodological innovations, and practical applications. We propose a novel taxonomy that is distinct from existing categorizations to better reflect the current state of the IL research stratum and its trends. Throughout the survey, we critically examine the strengths, limitations, and evaluation practices of representative works, and we outline key challenges and open directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniol Civit, Antonio Andriella, Carles Sierra, Guillem Aleny\`a</p>
<p>Abstract: While personalisation in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has advanced significantly, most existing approaches focus on single-user adaptation, overlooking scenarios involving multiple stakeholders with potentially conflicting preferences. To address this, we propose the Multi-User Preferences Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (MUP-QBAF), a novel multi-user personalisation framework based on Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs) that explicitly models and resolves multi-user preference conflicts. Unlike prior work in Argumentation Frameworks, which typically assumes static inputs, our approach is tailored to robotics: it incorporates both users' arguments and the robot's dynamic observations of the environment, allowing the system to adapt over time and respond to changing contexts. Preferences, both positive and negative, are represented as arguments whose strength is recalculated iteratively based on new information. The framework's properties and capabilities are presented and validated through a realistic case study, where an assistive robot mediates between the conflicting preferences of a caregiver and a care recipient during a frailty assessment task. This evaluation further includes a sensitivity analysis of argument base scores, demonstrating how preference outcomes can be shaped by user input and contextual observations. By offering a transparent, structured, and context-sensitive approach to resolving competing user preferences, this work advances the field of multi-user HRI. It provides a principled alternative to data-driven methods, enabling robots to navigate conflicts in real-world environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mainak Singha</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks can approximate solutions to partial differential equations, but they often break the very laws they are meant to model-creating mass from nowhere, drifting shocks, or violating conservation and entropy. We address this by training within the laws of physics rather than beside them. Our framework, called Constraint-Projected Learning (CPL), keeps every update physically admissible by projecting network outputs onto the intersection of constraint sets defined by conservation, Rankine-Hugoniot balance, entropy, and positivity. The projection is differentiable and adds only about 10% computational overhead, making it fully compatible with back-propagation. We further stabilize training with total-variation damping (TVD) to suppress small oscillations and a rollout curriculum that enforces consistency over long prediction horizons. Together, these mechanisms eliminate both hard and soft violations: conservation holds at machine precision, total-variation growth vanishes, and entropy and error remain bounded. On Burgers and Euler systems, CPL produces stable, physically lawful solutions without loss of accuracy. Instead of hoping neural solvers will respect physics, CPL makes that behavior an intrinsic property of the learning process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrei Ivanov, Siyuan Shen, Gioele Gottardo, Marcin Chrapek, Afif Boudaoud, Timo Schneider, Luca Benini, Torsten Hoefler</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity of machine learning models and the proliferation of diverse hardware architectures (CPUs, GPUs, accelerators) make achieving optimal performance a significant challenge. Heterogeneity in instruction sets, specialized kernel requirements for different data types and model features (e.g., sparsity, quantization), and architecture-specific optimizations complicate performance tuning. Manual optimization is resource-intensive, while existing automatic approaches often rely on complex hardware-specific heuristics and uninterpretable intermediate representations, hindering performance portability. We introduce PerfLLM, a novel automatic optimization methodology leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Central to this is PerfDojo, an environment framing optimization as an RL game using a human-readable, mathematically-inspired code representation that guarantees semantic validity through transformations. This allows effective optimization without prior hardware knowledge, facilitating both human analysis and RL agent training. We demonstrate PerfLLM's ability to achieve significant performance gains across diverse CPU (x86, Arm, RISC-V) and GPU architectures.</p>

This large-margin learning approach enables both iterative control and high expressivity across voices, and represents a fundamental pivot from the conventional focus on representation-level disentanglement.

<p>Abstract: We evaluate how visualizations can influence the judgment of MLLMs about the presence or absence of bridges in a network. We show that the inclusion of visualization improves confidence over a structured text-based input that could theoretically be helpful for answering the question. On the other hand, we observe that standard visualization techniques create a strong bias towards accepting or refuting the presence of a bridge -- independently of whether or not a bridge actually exists in the network. While our results indicate that the inclusion of visualization techniques can effectively influence the MLLM's judgment without compromising its self-reported confidence, they also imply that practitioners must be careful of allowing users to include visualizations in generative AI applications so as to avoid undesired hallucinations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haofei Yu, Fenghai Li, Jiaxuan You</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across benchmarks--from knowledge quizzes and math reasoning to web-agent tasks--but these tests occur in static settings, lacking real dynamics and uncertainty. Consequently, they evaluate isolated reasoning or problem-solving rather than decision-making under uncertainty. To address this, we introduce LiveTradeBench, a live trading environment for evaluating LLM agents in realistic and evolving markets. LiveTradeBench follows three design principles: (i) Live data streaming of market prices and news, eliminating dependence on offline backtesting and preventing information leakage while capturing real-time uncertainty; (ii) a portfolio-management abstraction that extends control from single-asset actions to multi-asset allocation, integrating risk management and cross-asset reasoning; and (iii) multi-market evaluation across structurally distinct environments--U.S. stocks and Polymarket prediction markets--differing in volatility, liquidity, and information flow. At each step, an agent observes prices, news, and its portfolio, then outputs percentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we run 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs across families. Results show that (1) high LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display distinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and (3) some LLMs effectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions. These findings expose a gap between static evaluation and real-world competence, motivating benchmarks that test sequential decision making and consistency under live uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Souverain</p>
<p>Abstract: To foster trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the European Union, the AI Act requires providers to mark and detect the outputs of their general-purpose models. The Article 50 and Recital 133 call for marking methods that are ''sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust''. Yet, the rapidly evolving and heterogeneous landscape of watermarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult to determine how these four standards can be translated into concrete and measurable evaluations. Our paper addresses this challenge, anchoring the normativity of European requirements in the multiplicity of watermarking techniques. Introducing clear and distinct concepts on LLM watermarking, our contribution is threefold. (1) Watermarking Categorisation: We propose an accessible taxonomy of watermarking methods according to the stage of the LLM lifecycle at which they are applied - before, during, or after training, and during next-token distribution or sampling. (2) Watermarking Evaluation: We interpret the EU AI Act's requirements by mapping each criterion with state-of-the-art evaluations on robustness and detectability of the watermark, and of quality of the LLM. Since interoperability remains largely untheorised in LLM watermarking research, we propose three normative dimensions to frame its assessment. (3) Watermarking Comparison: We compare current watermarking methods for LLMs against the operationalised European criteria and show that no approach yet satisfies all four standards. Encouraged by emerging empirical tests, we recommend further research into watermarking directly embedded within the low-level architecture of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter DiBerardino, Britt Anderson</p>
<p>Abstract: When people pursue rewards in stochastic environments, they often match their choice frequencies to the observed target frequencies, even when this policy is demonstrably sub-optimal. We used a ``hide and seek'' task to evaluate this behavior under conditions where pursuit (seeking) could be toggled to avoidance (hiding), while leaving the probability distribution fixed, or varying complexity by changing the number of possible choices. We developed a model for participant choice built from choice frequency histograms treated as vectors. We posited the existence of a probability antimatching strategy for avoidance (hiding) rounds, and formalized this as a vector reflection of probability matching. We found that only two basis policies: matching/antimatching and maximizing/minimizing were sufficient to account for participant choices across a range of room numbers and opponent probability distributions. This schema requires only that people have the ability to remember the relative frequency of the different outcomes. With this knowledge simple operations can construct the maximizing and minimizing policies as well as matching and antimatching strategies. A mixture of these two policies captures human choice patterns in a stochastic environment.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of natural language processing (NLP) technologies, the demand for high-quality Chinese document question-answering datasets is steadily growing. To address this issue, we present the Chinese Multi-Document Question Answering Dataset(ChiMDQA), specifically designed for downstream business scenarios across prevalent domains including academic, education, finance, law, medical treatment, and news. ChiMDQA encompasses long-form documents from six distinct fields, consisting of 6,068 rigorously curated, high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs further classified into ten fine-grained categories. Through meticulous document screening and a systematic question-design methodology, the dataset guarantees both diversity and high quality, rendering it applicable to various NLP tasks such as document comprehension, knowledge extraction, and intelligent QA systems. Additionally, this paper offers a comprehensive overview of the dataset's design objectives, construction methodologies, and fine-grained evaluation system, supplying a substantial foundation for future research and practical applications in Chinese QA.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geoff McDonald, Jonathan Bar Or</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains including healthcare, legal services, and confidential communications, where privacy is paramount. This paper introduces Whisper Leak, a side-channel attack that infers user prompt topics from encrypted LLM traffic by analyzing packet size and timing patterns in streaming responses. Despite TLS encryption protecting content, these metadata patterns leak sufficient information to enable topic classification. We demonstrate the attack across 28 popular LLMs from major providers, achieving near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC) and high precision even at extreme class imbalance (10,000:1 noise-to-target ratio). For many models, we achieve 100% precision in identifying sensitive topics like "money laundering" while recovering 5-20% of target conversations. This industry-wide vulnerability poses significant risks for users under network surveillance by ISPs, governments, or local adversaries. We evaluate three mitigation strategies - random padding, token batching, and packet injection - finding that while each reduces attack effectiveness, none provides complete protection. Through responsible disclosure, we have collaborated with providers to implement initial countermeasures. Our findings underscore the need for LLM providers to address metadata leakage as AI systems handle increasingly sensitive information.</p>

<p>Abstract: Post-hoc recalibration methods are widely used to ensure that classifiers provide faithful probability estimates. We argue that parametric recalibration functions based on logistic regression can be motivated from a simple theoretical setting for both binary and multiclass classification. This insight motivates the use of more expressive calibration methods beyond standard temperature scaling. For multi-class calibration however, a key challenge lies in the increasing number of parameters introduced by more complex models, often coupled with limited calibration data, which can lead to overfitting. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting bias-variance tradeoff can be effectively managed by structured regularization, robust preprocessing and efficient optimization. The resulting methods lead to substantial gains over existing logistic-based calibration techniques. We provide efficient and easy-to-use open-source implementations of our methods, making them an attractive alternative to common temperature, vector, and matrix scaling implementations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyao Wang, Simon Rosenberg, Juan Michelini, Calvin Smith, Hoang Tran, Engel Nyst, Rohit Malhotra, Xuhui Zhou, Valerie Chen, Robert Brennan, Graham Neubig</p>
<p>Abstract: Agents are now used widely in the process of software development, but building production-ready software engineering agents is a complex task. Deploying software agents effectively requires flexibility in implementation and experimentation, reliable and secure execution, and interfaces for users to interact with agents. In this paper, we present the OpenHands Software Agent SDK, a toolkit for implementing software development agents that satisfy these desiderata. This toolkit is a complete architectural redesign of the agent components of the popular OpenHands framework for software development agents, which has 64k+ GitHub stars. To achieve flexibility, we design a simple interface for implementing agents that requires only a few lines of code in the default case, but is easily extensible to more complex, full-featured agents with features such as custom tools, memory management, and more. For security and reliability, it delivers seamless local-to-remote execution portability, integrated REST/WebSocket services. For interaction with human users, it can connect directly to a variety of interfaces, such as visual workspaces (VS Code, VNC, browser), command-line interfaces, and APIs. Compared with existing SDKs from OpenAI, Claude, and Google, OpenHands uniquely integrates native sandboxed execution, lifecycle control, model-agnostic multi-LLM routing, and built-in security analysis. Empirical results on SWE-Bench Verified and GAIA benchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Put together, these elements allow the OpenHands Software Agent SDK to provide a practical foundation for prototyping, unlocking new classes of custom applications, and reliably deploying agents at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohsen Ahmadzadeh, Kaichang Chen, Georges Gielen</p>
<p>Abstract: Analog/mixed-signal circuits are key for interfacing electronics with the physical world. Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process, resulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of AI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to automate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical bottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of explainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of the tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for sample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs a multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design goals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the target goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation strategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency. The AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity and is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from pure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system learns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate convergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog design space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents serve as transparent design assistants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Li, Albert Gatt, Massimo Poesio</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaborative dialogue relies on participants incrementally establishing common ground, yet in asymmetric settings they may believe they agree while referring to different entities. We introduce a perspectivist annotation scheme for the HCRC MapTask corpus (Anderson et al., 1991) that separately captures speaker and addressee grounded interpretations for each reference expression, enabling us to trace how understanding emerges, diverges, and repairs over time. Using a scheme-constrained LLM annotation pipeline, we obtain 13k annotated reference expressions with reliability estimates and analyze the resulting understanding states. The results show that full misunderstandings are rare once lexical variants are unified, but multiplicity discrepancies systematically induce divergences, revealing how apparent grounding can mask referential misalignment. Our framework provides both a resource and an analytic lens for studying grounded misunderstanding and for evaluating (V)LLMs' capacity to model perspective-dependent grounding in collaborative dialogue.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiyi Yang, Hao Xue, Imran Razzak, Hakim Hacid, Flora D. Salim</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has proven highly effective in enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on tasks that require external knowledge. By leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs), GraphRAG improves information retrieval for complex reasoning tasks, providing more precise and comprehensive retrieval and generating more accurate responses to QAs. However, most RAG methods fall short in addressing multi-step reasoning, particularly when both information extraction and inference are necessary. To address this limitation, this paper presents Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-IRAG), a novel framework that integrates KGs with iterative reasoning to improve LLMs' ability to handle queries involving temporal and logical dependencies. Through iterative retrieval steps, KG-IRAG incrementally gathers relevant data from external KGs, enabling step-by-step reasoning. The proposed approach is particularly suited for scenarios where reasoning is required alongside dynamic temporal data extraction, such as determining optimal travel times based on weather conditions or traffic patterns. Experimental results show that KG-IRAG improves accuracy in complex reasoning tasks by effectively integrating external knowledge with iterative, logic-based retrieval. Additionally, three new datasets: weatherQA-Irish, weatherQA-Sydney, and trafficQA-TFNSW, are formed to evaluate KG-IRAG's performance, demonstrating its potential beyond traditional RAG applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Zhang, Qi Wang, Mingyi Li, Yuan Yuan, Mengbai Xiao, Fuzhen Zhuang, Dongxiao Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Implementing large language models (LLMs)-driven root cause analysis (RCA) in cloud-native systems has become a key topic of modern software operations and maintenance. However, existing LLM-based approaches face three key challenges: multi-modality input constraint, context window limitation, and dynamic dependence graph. To address these issues, we propose a tool-assisted LLM agent with multi-modality observation data for fine-grained RCA, namely TAMO, including multimodality alignment tool, root cause localization tool, and fault types classification tool. In detail, TAMO unifies multi-modal observation data into time-aligned representations for cross-modal feature consistency. Based on the unified representations, TAMO then invokes its specialized root cause localization tool and fault types classification tool for further identifying root cause and fault type underlying system context. This approach overcomes the limitations of LLMs in processing real-time raw observational data and dynamic service dependencies, guiding the model to generate repair strategies that align with system context through structured prompt design. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAMO outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches with comparable performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew T. Dearing, Yiheng Tao, Xingfu Wu, Zhiling Lan, Valerie Taylor</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for generating parallel scientific codes, most efforts emphasize functional correctness, often overlooking performance, especially energy efficiency. We propose LASSI-EE, an automated LLM-based refactoring framework that generates energy-efficient parallel codes through a multi-stage, iterative approach integrating runtime power profiling, energy-aware prompting, self-correcting feedback loops, and an LLM-as-a-Judge agent for automated screening of code solutions. We introduce energy-reduction@k, a novel metric that quantifies expected energy reduction when generating k code candidates and selecting the most energy-efficient, enabling systematic evaluation of multi-attempt generation strategies. Evaluating 20 HeCBench applications and two miniApps on NVIDIA A100 and AMD MI100 GPUs, a single run (k=1) with LASSI-EE delivers refactored parallel codes with an average 29% expected energy reduction at an 81% pass rate, representing a 2.8x improvement over vanilla LLM prompting. Multiple runs (k=3) achieve an average 48% expected energy reduction at a 97% pass rate. These results are consistent across devices, demonstrating LASSI-EE's effectiveness across diverse hardware architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Wu, Jie Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot relational learning on knowledge graph (KGs) aims to perform reasoning over relations with only a few training examples. While current methods have focused primarily on leveraging specific relational information, rich semantics inherent in KGs have been largely overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose PromptMeta, a novel prompted meta-learning framework that seamlessly integrates meta-semantics with relational information for few-shot relational learning. PromptMeta introduces two core innovations: (1) a Meta-Semantic Prompt (MSP) pool that learns and consolidates high-level meta-semantics shared across tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer and adaptation to newly emerging relations; and (2) a learnable fusion mechanism that dynamically combines meta-semantics with task-specific relational information tailored to different few-shot tasks. Both components are optimized jointly with model parameters within a meta-learning framework. Extensive experiments and analyses on two real-world KG benchmarks validate the effectiveness of PromptMeta in adapting to new relations with limited supervision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiyi Yang, Hao Xue, Imran Razzak, Shirui Pan, Hakim Hacid, Flora D. Salim</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems empower large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, yet struggle with efficiency-accuracy trade-offs when scaling to large knowledge graphs. Existing approaches often rely on monolithic graph retrieval, incurring unnecessary latency for simple queries and fragmented reasoning for complex multi-hop questions. To address these challenges, this paper propose SPLIT-RAG, a multi-agent RAG framework that addresses these limitations with question-driven semantic graph partitioning and collaborative subgraph retrieval. The innovative framework first create Semantic Partitioning of Linked Information, then use the Type-Specialized knowledge base to achieve Multi-Agent RAG. The attribute-aware graph segmentation manages to divide knowledge graphs into semantically coherent subgraphs, ensuring subgraphs align with different query types, while lightweight LLM agents are assigned to partitioned subgraphs, and only relevant partitions are activated during retrieval, thus reduce search space while enhancing efficiency. Finally, a hierarchical merging module resolves inconsistencies across subgraph-derived answers through logical verifications. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates considerable improvements compared to existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengcheng Jiang, Xueqiang Xu, Jiacheng Lin, Jinfeng Xiao, Zifeng Wang, Jimeng Sun, Jiawei Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems empower large language models (LLMs) to access external knowledge during inference. Recent advances have enabled LLMs to act as search agents via reinforcement learning (RL), improving information acquisition through multi-turn interactions with retrieval engines. However, existing approaches either optimize retrieval using search-only metrics (e.g., NDCG) that ignore downstream utility or fine-tune the entire LLM to jointly reason and retrieve-entangling retrieval with generation and limiting the real search utility and compatibility with frozen or proprietary models. In this work, we propose s3, a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that decouples the searcher from the generator and trains the searcher using a Gain Beyond RAG reward: the improvement in generation accuracy over naive RAG. s3 requires only 2.4k training samples to outperform baselines trained on over 70x more data, consistently delivering stronger downstream performance across six general QA and five medical QA benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamad A. Hady, Siyi Hu, Mahardhika Pratama, Jimmy Cao, Ryszard Kowalczyk</p>
<p>Abstract: The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring, disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination. The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy learning in decentralised EO missions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Poole</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence seems to be taking over the world with systems that model pixels, words, and phonemes. The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning, statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Hou, Xin Tan, Kai Zheng, Fang Liu, Yinghao Zhu, Li Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Atomic commits, which address a single development concern, are a best practice in software development. In practice, however, developers often produce tangled commits that mix unrelated changes, complicating code review and maintenance. Prior untangling approaches (rule-based, feature-based, or graph-based) have made progress but typically rely on shallow signals and struggle to distinguish explicit dependencies (e.g., control/data flow) from implicit ones (e.g., semantic or conceptual relationships). In this paper, we propose ColaUntangle, a new collaborative consultation framework for commit untangling that models both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes. ColaUntangle integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in a multi-agent architecture: one agent specializes in explicit dependencies, another in implicit ones, and a reviewer agent synthesizes their perspectives through iterative consultation. To capture structural and contextual information, we construct Explicit and Implicit Contexts, enabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and semantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C# and 14k Java tangled commits). Experimental results show that ColaUntangle outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an improvement of 44% on the C# dataset and 82% on the Java dataset. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based collaborative frameworks for advancing automated commit untangling tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxin Mao, Zhitao Wang, Long Wang, Sirong Chen, Cuiyun Gao, Luyang Cao, Ziming Liu, Qiming Zhang, Jun Zhou, Zhi Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language (NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjun Li, Zhi Chen, Jingru Lin, Hannan Cao, Wei Han, Sheng Liang, Zhi Zhang, Kuicai Dong, Dexun Li, Chen Zhang, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator, and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback. Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent, off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration, recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence on such human priors and rater biases.
  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations of deep research systems. It systematizes recent work along three axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii) agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA, VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soheil Zibakhsh Shabgahi, Pedram Aghazadeh, Azalia Mirhoseini, Farinaz Koushanfar</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing reliance on generative AI models is rapidly increasing the volume of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most available new data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the models ineffective. While the causes of model collapse are increasingly understood, effective mitigation strategies remain scarce. We address this challenge by leveraging a key insight: auto-regressive models tend to generate text sequences to which they assign high confidence (i.e., high log-likelihood). Based on this observation, we introduce the Truncated-Cross-Entropy (TCE) loss function. TCE mitigates collapse by selectively ignoring high-confidence tokens during training, effectively filtering out likely machine-generated artifacts from the learning process. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with TCE not only learn effectively but also exhibit significantly increased resilience, tolerating over 2.3x more synthetic data before the onset of collapse. In addition, we provide an open-source benchmark for collapse dynamics in mixed-data settings. Our results demonstrate that confidence-aware training objectives can substantially delay collapse onset, offering a practical and generalizable tool for model robustness under synthetic-data exposure.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks. However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwei Deng, Mian Deng, Chenjing Liang, Zeming Gao, Chennan Ma, Chenxing Lin, Haipeng Zhang, Songzhu Mei, Siqi Shen, Cheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored across a range of reasoning tasks. However, LLMs sometimes struggle with reasoning tasks under uncertainty that are relatively easy for humans, such as planning actions in stochastic environments. The adoption of LLMs for reasoning is impeded by uncertainty challenges, such as LLM uncertainty and environmental uncertainty. LLM uncertainty arises from the stochastic sampling process inherent to LLMs. Most LLM-based Decision-Making (LDM) approaches address LLM uncertainty through multiple reasoning chains or search trees. However, these approaches overlook environmental uncertainty, which leads to poor performance in environments with stochastic state transitions. Some recent LDM approaches deal with uncertainty by forecasting the probability of unknown variables. However, they are not designed for multi-step reasoning tasks that require interaction with the environment. To address uncertainty in LLM decision-making, we introduce PlanU, an LLM-based planning method that captures uncertainty within Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). PlanU models the return of each node in the MCTS as a quantile distribution, which uses a set of quantiles to represent the return distribution. To balance exploration and exploitation during tree search, PlanU introduces an Upper Confidence Bounds with Curiosity (UCC) score which estimates the uncertainty of MCTS nodes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PlanU in LLM-based reasoning tasks under uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofeng Zhu, Yunshen Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Microsoft Copilot suites serve as the universal entry point for various agents skilled in handling important tasks, ranging from assisting a customer with product purchases to detecting vulnerabilities in corporate programming code. Each agent can be powered by language models, software engineering operations, such as database retrieval, and internal \& external knowledge. The repertoire of a copilot can expand dynamically with new agents. This requires a robust orchestrator that can distribute tasks from user prompts to the right agents. In this work, we propose an Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) for handling multiple tasks and scalable agents in copilot services, which can provide both natural language and action responses. We will also demonstrate the planning that leverages meta-learning, i.e., a trained decision tree model for deciding the best inference strategy among various agents/models. We showcase the effectiveness of our AMO through two production use cases: Microsoft 365 (M365) E-Commerce Copilot and code compliance copilot. M365 E-Commerce Copilot advertises Microsoft products to external customers to promote sales success. The M365 E-Commerce Copilot provides up-to-date product information and connects to multiple agents, such as relational databases and human customer support. The code compliance copilot scans the internal DevOps code to detect known and new compliance issues in pull requests (PR).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robyn Wyrick</p>
<p>Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances toward superhuman capabilities, aligning these systems with human values becomes increasingly critical. Current alignment strategies rely largely on externally specified constraints that may prove insufficient against future super-intelligent AI capable of circumventing top-down controls.
  This research investigates whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) can develop patterns analogous to biological mirror neurons cells that activate both when performing and observing actions, and how such patterns might contribute to intrinsic alignment in AI. Mirror neurons play a crucial role in empathy, imitation, and social cognition in humans. The study therefore asks: (1) Can simple ANNs develop mirror-neuron patterns? and (2) How might these patterns contribute to ethical and cooperative decision-making in AI systems?
  Using a novel Frog and Toad game framework designed to promote cooperative behaviors, we identify conditions under which mirror-neuron patterns emerge, evaluate their influence on action circuits, introduce the Checkpoint Mirror Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation strength and consistency, and propose a theoretical framework for further study.
  Our findings indicate that appropriately scaled model capacities and self/other coupling foster shared neural representations in ANNs similar to biological mirror neurons. These empathy-like circuits support cooperative behavior and suggest that intrinsic motivations modeled through mirror-neuron dynamics could complement existing alignment techniques by embedding empathy-like mechanisms directly within AI architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changjiang Jiang, Fengchang Yu, Haihua Chen, Wei Lu, Jin Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex reasoning over tabular data is crucial in real-world data analysis, yet large language models (LLMs) often underperform due to complex queries, noisy data, and limited numerical capabilities. To address these issues, we propose TabDSR, a framework consisting of: (1) a query decomposer that breaks down complex questions, (2) a table sanitizer that cleans and filters noisy tables, and (3) a program-of-thoughts (PoT)-based reasoner that generates executable code to derive the final answer from the sanitized table. To ensure unbiased evaluation and mitigate data leakage, we introduce a new dataset, CalTab151, specifically designed for complex numerical reasoning over tables. Experimental results demonstrate that TabDSR consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 8.79%, 6.08%, and 19.87% accuracy improvement on TAT-QA, TableBench, and TabDSR, respectively. Moreover, our framework integrates seamlessly with mainstream LLMs, providing a robust solution for complex tabular numerical reasoning. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing LLM performance for complex tabular numerical reasoning. Data and code are available upon request.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present ORCA (Omni Research on Calculation in AI) Benchmark - a novel benchmark that evaluates large language models (LLMs) on multi-domain, real-life quantitative reasoning using verified outputs from Omni's calculator engine. In 500 natural-language tasks across domains such as finance, physics, health, and statistics, the five state-of-the-art systems (ChatGPT-5, Gemini~2.5~Flash, Claude~Sonnet~4.5, Grok~4, and DeepSeek~V3.2) achieved only $45\text{--}63\,\%$ accuracy, with errors mainly related to rounding ($35\,\%$) and calculation mistakes ($33\,\%$). Results in specific domains indicate strengths in mathematics and engineering, but weaknesses in physics and natural sciences. Correlation analysis ($r \approx 0.40\text{--}0.65$) shows that the models often fail together but differ in the types of errors they make, highlighting their partial complementarity rather than redundancy. Unlike standard math datasets, ORCA evaluates step-by-step reasoning, numerical precision, and domain generalization across real problems from finance, physics, health, and statistics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data-driven scientific discovery requires iterative cycles of literature search, hypothesis generation, and data analysis. Substantial progress has been made towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such agents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing coherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos, an AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended objective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of parallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before synthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos uses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis agent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to coherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively executing an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run. Kosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature, ensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of statements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a single 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own research time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number of valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles (tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that span metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics. Three discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or unpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four make novel contributions to the scientific literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huawei Lin, Yunzhi Shi, Tong Geng, Weijie Zhao, Wei Wang, Ravender Pal Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but remain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with large aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image, audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models become available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Mahbubur Rahman, Shaila Sharmin</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the last few years, social media has evolved into a medium for expressing personal views, emotions, and even business and political proposals, recommendations, and advertisements. We address the topic of identifying emotions from text data obtained from social media posts like Twitter in this research. We have deployed different traditional machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, as well as deep neural network models such as LSTM, CNN, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU to classify these tweets into four emotion categories (Fear, Anger, Joy, and Sadness). Furthermore, we have constructed a BiLSTM and BiGRU ensemble model. The evaluation result shows that the deep neural network models(BiGRU, to be specific) produce the most promising results compared to traditional machine learning models, with an 87.53 % accuracy rate. The ensemble model performs even better (87.66 %), albeit the difference is not significant. This result will aid in the development of a decision-making tool that visualizes emotional fluctuations.</p>

<p>Abstract: The past decade has observed a significant advancement in AI with deep learning-based models being deployed in diverse scenarios, including safety-critical applications. As these AI systems become deeply embedded in our societal infrastructure, the repercussions of their decisions and actions have significant consequences, making the ethical implications of AI deployment highly relevant and essential. The ethical concerns associated with AI are multifaceted, including challenging issues of fairness, privacy and data protection, responsibility and accountability, safety and robustness, transparency and explainability, and environmental impact. These principles together form the foundations of ethical AI considerations that concern every stakeholder in the AI system lifecycle. In light of the present ethical and future x-risk concerns, governments have shown increasing interest in establishing guidelines for the ethical deployment of AI. This work unifies the current and future ethical concerns of deploying AI into society. While we acknowledge and appreciate the technical surveys for each of the ethical principles concerned, in this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview that not only addresses each principle from a technical point of view but also discusses them from a social perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyang Chen, Claire E. Heaney, Christopher C. Pain</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerical discretisations of partial differential equations (PDEs) can be written as discrete convolutions, which, themselves, are a key tool in AI libraries and used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We therefore propose to implement numerical discretisations as convolutional layers of a neural network, where the weights or filters are determined analytically rather than by training. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these systems can be solved entirely by functions in AI libraries, either by using Jacobi iteration or multigrid methods, the latter realised through a U-Net architecture. Some advantages of the Neural Physics approach are that (1) the methods are platform agnostic; (2) the resulting solvers are fully differentiable, ideal for optimisation tasks; and (3) writing CFD solvers as (untrained) neural networks means that they can be seamlessly integrated with trained neural networks to form hybrid models. We demonstrate the proposed approach on a number of test cases of increasing complexity from advection-diffusion problems, the non-linear Burgers equation to the Navier-Stokes equations. We validate the approach by comparing our results with solutions obtained from traditionally written code and common benchmarks from the literature. We show that the proposed methodology can solve all these problems using repurposed AI libraries in an efficient way, without training, and presents a new avenue to explore in the development of methods to solve PDEs with implicit methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph-structured data exhibits universality and widespread applicability across diverse domains, such as social network analysis, biochemistry, financial fraud detection, and network security. Significant strides have been made in leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to achieve remarkable success in these areas. However, in real-world scenarios, the training environment for models is often far from ideal, leading to substantial performance degradation of GNN models due to various unfavorable factors, including imbalance in data distribution, the presence of noise in erroneous data, privacy protection of sensitive information, and generalization capability for out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To tackle these issues, substantial efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of GNN models in practical real-world scenarios, as well as enhancing their reliability and robustness. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey that systematically reviews existing GNN models, focusing on solutions to the four mentioned real-world challenges including imbalance, noise, privacy, and OOD in practical scenarios that many existing reviews have not considered. Specifically, we first highlight the four key challenges faced by existing GNNs, paving the way for our exploration of real-world GNN models. Subsequently, we provide detailed discussions on these four aspects, dissecting how these solutions contribute to enhancing the reliability and robustness of GNN models. Last but not least, we outline promising directions and offer future perspectives in the field.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning updates machine learning models to remove information from specific training samples, complying with data protection regulations that allow individuals to request the removal of their personal data. Despite the recent development of numerous unlearning algorithms, reliable evaluation of these algorithms remains an open research question. In this work, we focus on membership inference attack (MIA) based evaluation, one of the most common approaches for evaluating unlearning algorithms, and address various pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics lacking theoretical understanding and reliability. Specifically, by modeling the proposed evaluation process as a \emph{cryptographic game} between unlearning algorithms and MIA adversaries, the naturally induced evaluation metric measures the data removal efficacy of unlearning algorithms and enjoys provable guarantees that existing evaluation metrics fail to satisfy. Furthermore, we propose a practical and efficient approximation of the induced evaluation metric and demonstrate its effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. Overall, this work presents a novel and reliable approach to empirically evaluating unlearning algorithms, paving the way for the development of more effective unlearning techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robotic assistance for experimental manipulation in the life sciences is expected to enable favorable outcomes, regardless of the skill of the scientist. Experimental specimens in the life sciences are subject to individual variability and hence require intricate algorithms for successful autonomous robotic control. As a use case, we are studying the cranial window creation in mice. This operation requires the removal of an 8-mm circular patch of the skull, which is approximately 300 um thick, but the shape and thickness of the mouse skull significantly varies depending on the strain of the mouse, sex, and age. In this work, we develop an autonomous robotic drilling system with no offline planning, consisting of a trajectory planner with execution-time feedback with drilling completion level recognition based on image and force information. In the experiments, we first evaluate the image-and-force-based drilling completion level recognition by comparing it with other state-of-the-art deep learning image processing methods and conduct an ablation study in eggshell drilling to evaluate the impact of each module on system performance. Finally, the system performance is further evaluated in postmortem mice, achieving a success rate of 70% (14/20 trials) with an average drilling time of 9.3 min.</p>

<p>Abstract: Few-shot Semantic Segmentation addresses the challenge of segmenting objects in query images with only a handful of annotated examples. However, many previous state-of-the-art methods either have to discard intricate local semantic features or suffer from high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a new Few-shot Semantic Segmentation framework based on the Transformer architecture. Our approach introduces the spatial transformer decoder and the contextual mask generation module to improve the relational understanding between support and query images. Moreover, we introduce a multi scale decoder to refine the segmentation mask by incorporating features from different resolutions in a hierarchical manner. Additionally, our approach integrates global features from intermediate encoder stages to improve contextual understanding, while maintaining a lightweight structure to reduce complexity. This balance between performance and efficiency enables our method to achieve competitive results on benchmark datasets such as PASCAL-5^i and COCO-20^i in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings. Notably, our model with only 1.5 million parameters demonstrates competitive performance while overcoming limitations of existing methodologies. https://github.com/amirrezafateh/MSDNet</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikhail Persiianov, Arip Asadulaev, Nikita Andreev, Nikita Starodubcev, Dmitry Baranchuk, Anastasis Kratsios, Evgeny Burnaev, Alexander Korotin</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning conditional distributions $\pi^*(\cdot|x)$ is a central problem in machine learning, which is typically approached via supervised methods with paired data $(x,y) \sim \pi^*$. However, acquiring paired data samples is often challenging, especially in problems such as domain translation. This necessitates the development of $\textit{semi-supervised}$ models that utilize both limited paired data and additional unpaired i.i.d. samples $x \sim \pi^*_x$ and $y \sim \pi^*_y$ from the marginal distributions. The usage of such combined data is complex and often relies on heuristic approaches. To tackle this issue, we propose a new learning paradigm that integrates both paired and unpaired data $\textbf{seamlessly}$ using the data likelihood maximization techniques. We demonstrate that our approach also connects intriguingly with inverse entropic optimal transport (OT). This finding allows us to apply recent advances in computational OT to establish an $\textbf{end-to-end}$ learning algorithm to get $\pi^*(\cdot|x)$. In addition, we derive the universal approximation property, demonstrating that our approach can theoretically recover true conditional distributions with arbitrarily small error. Furthermore, we demonstrate through empirical tests that our method effectively learns conditional distributions using paired and unpaired data simultaneously.</p>

This work presents a novel hybrid robotic platform that integrates a rigid manipulator with a fully developed soft arm. This system is equipped with the intelligence necessary to perform flexible and generalizable tasks through imitation learning autonomously. The physical softness and machine learning enable our platform to achieve highly generalizable skills, while the rigid components ensure precision and repeatability.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent wave of artificial intelligence, epitomized by large language models (LLMs),has presented opportunities and challenges for methodological innovation in political science,sparking discussions on a potential paradigm shift in the social sciences. However, how can weunderstand the impact of LLMs on knowledge production and paradigm transformation in thesocial sciences from a comprehensive perspective that integrates technology and methodology? What are LLMs' specific applications and representative innovative methods in political scienceresearch? These questions, particularly from a practical methodological standpoint, remainunderexplored. This paper proposes the "Intelligent Computing Social Modeling" (ICSM) methodto address these issues by clarifying the critical mechanisms of LLMs. ICSM leverages thestrengths of LLMs in idea synthesis and action simulation, advancing intellectual exploration inpolitical science through "simulated social construction" and "simulation validation." Bysimulating the U.S. presidential election, this study empirically demonstrates the operationalpathways and methodological advantages of ICSM. By integrating traditional social scienceparadigms, ICSM not only enhances the quantitative paradigm's capability to apply big data toassess the impact of factors but also provides qualitative paradigms with evidence for socialmechanism discovery at the individual level, offering a powerful tool that balances interpretabilityand predictability in social science research. The findings suggest that LLMs will drivemethodological innovation in political science through integration and improvement rather thandirect substitution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in many graph machine learning tasks but face challenges when scaling to large networks. GNN transferability allows training on smaller graphs and applying the model to larger ones, but existing methods often rely on random subsampling, leading to disconnected subgraphs and reduced model expressivity. We propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that leverages feature homophily to preserve graph structure. By minimizing the trace of the data correlation matrix, our method better preserves the graph Laplacian trace -- a proxy for the graph connectivity -- than random sampling, while achieving lower complexity than spectral methods. Experiments on citation networks show improved performance in preserving Laplacian trace and GNN transferability compared to random sampling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive generative abilities of black-box large language models (LLMs), their inherent opacity hinders further advancements in capabilities such as reasoning, planning, and personalization. Existing works aim to enhance LLM capabilities via domain-specific adaptation, which require additional training on accessible model parameters, an infeasible option for black-box LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce Matryoshka Pilot (M-Pilot), a lightweight white-box LLM controller that guides a large-scale black-box LLM generator by decomposing complex tasks into a series of intermediate outputs. Specifically, we consider the black-box LLM as an environment, with M-Pilot serving as a policy to provide intermediate guidance through prompts for driving the black-box LLM. M-Pilot is trained to pivot the outputs of the black-box LLM aligning with preferences during iterative interaction, which enables controllable multi-turn generation and self-improvement in optimizing intermediate guidance. Empirical evaluations on diverse tasks demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the capabilities of black-box LLMs in complex, long-horizon tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanjana Ramprasad, Byron C. Wallace</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern LLMs can now produce highly readable abstractive summaries, to the point that traditional automated metrics for evaluating summary quality, such as ROUGE, have saturated. However, LLMs still sometimes introduce inaccuracies into summaries, i.e., information inconsistent with or unsupported by the corresponding source. Measuring the occurrence of these often subtle factual inconsistencies automatically has proved challenging. This in turn has motivated development of metrics intended to measure the factual consistency of generated summaries against sources. But are these approaches measuring what they purport to? Or are they mostly exploiting artifacts? In this work, we stress test a range of automatic factuality metrics, including specialized models and LLM-based prompting methods, to probe what they actually capture. Using a shallow classifier to separate ``easy'' examples for factual evaluation where surface features suffice from ``hard'' cases requiring deeper reasoning, we find that all metrics show substantial performance drops on the latter. Furthermore, some metrics are more sensitive to benign, fact-preserving edits than to factual corrections. Building on this observation, we demonstrate that most automatic factuality metrics can be gamed, i.e., their scores can be artificially inflated by appending innocuous, content-free sentences to summaries. Among the metrics tested, the prompt based ChatGPT-DA approach is the most robust and reliable. However, this comes with a notable caveat: Prompting LLMs to assess factuality may overly rely on their parametric knowledge rather than the provided reference when making judgments. Taken together, our findings call into question the reliability of current factuality metrics and prompt a broader reflection on what these metrics are truly measuring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Van-Duc Le, Hai-Thien To</p>
<p>Abstract: Financial analysis relies heavily on the interpretation of earnings reports to assess company performance and guide decision-making. Traditional methods for generating such analyses demand significant financial expertise and are often time-consuming. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), domain-specific adaptations have emerged for financial tasks such as sentiment analysis and entity recognition. This paper introduces RAG-IT (Retrieval-Augmented Instruction Tuning), a novel framework designed to automate the generation of earnings report analyses through an LLM fine-tuned specifically for the financial domain. Our approach integrates retrieval augmentation with instruction-based fine-tuning to enhance factual accuracy, contextual relevance, and domain adaptability. We construct a comprehensive financial instruction dataset derived from extensive financial documents and earnings reports to guide the LLM's adaptation to specialized financial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that RAG-IT outperforms general-purpose open-source models and achieves performance comparable to commercial systems like GPT-3.5 on financial report generation tasks. This research highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented instruction tuning to streamline and elevate financial analysis automation, advancing the broader field of intelligent financial reporting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taneesh Gupta, Rahul Madhavan, Xuchao Zhang, Chetan Bansal, Saravan Rajmohan</p>
<p>Abstract: To mitigate reward hacking from response verbosity, modern preference optimization methods are increasingly adopting length normalization (e.g., SimPO, ORPO, LN-DPO). While effective against this bias, we demonstrate that length normalization itself introduces a failure mode: the URSLA shortcut. Here models learn to satisfy the alignment objective by prematurely truncating low-quality responses rather than learning from their semantic content. To address this, we introduce REFA, a new alignment framework that proposes probabilistic control on a structural token that controls termination. Our core innovation is a new class of regularizers that operate directly on the probability of the End-of-Sequence (EOS) token, a previously unexploited control lever. This token-level intervention provides a principled solution to the URSLA shortcut, ensuring genuine quality improvements. Furthermore, it unlocks a versatile mechanism for managing the alignment-efficiency tradeoff, enabling practitioners to fine-tune models that adhere to specific token budgets. Empirically, REFA achieves a 60.29% win rate and a 52.17% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2 with Llama-3-8B-Instruct, demonstrating the power of our token-level control paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Vandemoortele, Bram Steenwinckel, Femke Ongenae, Sofie Van Hoecke</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Label Space Reduction (LSR), a novel method for improving zero-shot classification performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). LSR iteratively refines the classification label space by systematically ranking and reducing candidate classes, enabling the model to concentrate on the most relevant options. By leveraging unlabeled data with the statistical learning capabilities of data-driven models, LSR dynamically optimizes the label space representation at test time. Our experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that LSR improves macro-F1 scores by an average of 7.0% (up to 14.2%) with Llama-3.1-70B and 3.3% (up to 11.1%) with Claude-3.5-Sonnet compared to standard zero-shot classification baselines. To reduce the computational overhead of LSR, which requires an additional LLM call at each iteration, we propose distilling the model into a probabilistic classifier, allowing for efficient inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Chen, Jiachun Li, Alexander Rakhlin, David Simchi-Levi</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the statistical complexity of private linear regression under an unknown, potentially ill-conditioned covariate distribution. Somewhat surprisingly, under privacy constraints the intrinsic complexity is \emph{not} captured by the usual covariance matrix but rather its $L_1$ analogues. Building on this insight, we establish minimax convergence rates for both the central and local privacy models and introduce an Information-Weighted Regression method that attains the optimal rates.
  As application, in private linear contextual bandits, we propose an efficient algorithm that achieves rate-optimal regret bounds of order $\sqrt{T}+\frac{1}{\alpha}$ and $\sqrt{T}/\alpha$ under joint and local $\alpha$-privacy models, respectively. Notably, our results demonstrate that joint privacy comes at almost no additional cost, addressing the open problems posed by Azize and Basu (2024).</p>

<p>Abstract: The impact of random seeds in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has been largely overlooked despite its potential influence on model performance.In this study, we systematically evaluate the effects of random seeds on LLMs using the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks. We analyze the macro-level impact through traditional metrics like accuracy and F1, calculating their mean and variance to quantify performance fluctuations. To capture the micro-level effects, we introduce a novel metric, consistency, measuring the stability of individual predictions across runs. Our experiments reveal significant variance at both macro and micro levels, underscoring the need for careful consideration of random seeds in fine-tuning and evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ping Zhang, Zheda Mai, Quang-Huy Nguyen, Wei-Lun Chao</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) leverages abundant unlabeled data alongside limited labeled data to enhance learning. As vision foundation models (VFMs) increasingly serve as the backbone of vision applications, it remains unclear how SSL interacts with these pre-trained models. To address this gap, we develop new SSL benchmark datasets where frozen VFMs underperform and systematically evaluate representative SSL methods. We make a surprising observation: parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using only labeled data often matches SSL performance, even without leveraging unlabeled data. This motivates us to revisit self-training, a conceptually simple SSL baseline, where we use the supervised PEFT model to pseudo-label unlabeled data for further training. To overcome the notorious issue of noisy pseudo-labels, we propose ensembling multiple PEFT approaches and VFM backbones to produce more robust pseudo-labels. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful approach, providing actionable insights into SSL with VFMs and paving the way for more scalable and practical semi-supervised learning in the era of foundation models.</p>

SecRepoBench has 318 code completion tasks in 27 C/C++ repositories, covering 15 CWEs. We evaluate 28 standalone LLMs and 13 code agents across 3 state-of-the-art agent frameworks using our benchmark. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with generating correct and secure code completions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danial Ramezani, Tai Dinh</p>
<p>Abstract: Fantasy football is a billion-dollar industry with millions of participants. Under a fixed budget, managers select squads to maximize future Fantasy Premier League (FPL) points. This study formulates lineup selection as data-driven optimization and develops deterministic and robust mixed-integer linear programs that choose the starting eleven, bench, and captain under budget, formation, and club-quota constraints (maximum three players per club). The objective is parameterized by a hybrid scoring metric that combines realized FPL points with predictions from a linear regression model trained on match-performance features identified using exploratory data analysis techniques. The study benchmarks alternative objectives and cost estimators, including simple and recency-weighted averages, exponential smoothing, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and Monte Carlo simulation. Experiments on the 2023/24 Premier League season show that ARIMA with a constrained budget and a rolling window yields the most consistent out-of-sample performance; weighted averages and Monte Carlo are also competitive. Robust variants improve some objectives but are not uniformly superior. The framework provides transparent decision support for fantasy roster construction and extends to FPL chips, multi-week rolling-horizon transfer planning, and week-by-week dynamic captaincy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Somrita Banerjee, Abhishek Cauligi, Marco Pavone</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory optimization is a cornerstone of modern robot autonomy, enabling systems to compute trajectories and controls in real-time while respecting safety and physical constraints. However, it has seen limited usage in spaceflight applications due to its heavy computational demands that exceed the capability of most flight computers. In this work, we provide results on the first in-space demonstration of using machine learning-based warm starts for accelerating trajectory optimization for the Astrobee free-flying robot onboard the International Space Station (ISS). We formulate a data-driven optimal control approach that trains a neural network to learn the structure of the trajectory generation problem being solved using sequential convex programming (SCP). Onboard, this trained neural network predicts solutions for the trajectory generation problem and relies on using the SCP solver to enforce safety constraints for the system. Our trained network reduces the number of solver iterations required for convergence in cases including rotational dynamics by 60% and in cases with obstacles drawn from the training distribution of the warm start model by 50%. This work represents a significant milestone in the use of learning-based control for spaceflight applications and a stepping stone for future advances in the use of machine learning for autonomous guidance, navigation, & control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yepeng Weng, Qiao Hu, Xujie Chen, Li Liu, Dianwen Mei, Huishi Qiu, Jiang Tian, Zhongchao Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding is a promising approach for accelerating large language models. The primary idea is to use a lightweight draft model to speculate the output of the target model for multiple subsequent timesteps, and then verify them in parallel to determine whether the drafted tokens should be accepted or rejected. To enhance acceptance rates, existing frameworks typically construct token trees containing multiple candidates in each timestep. However, their reliance on token-level verification mechanisms introduces two critical limitations: First, the probability distribution of a sequence differs from that of individual tokens, leading to suboptimal acceptance length. Second, current verification schemes begin from the root node and proceed layer by layer in a top-down manner. Once a parent node is rejected, all its child nodes should be discarded, resulting in inefficient utilization of speculative candidates. This paper introduces Traversal Verification, a novel speculative decoding algorithm that fundamentally rethinks the verification paradigm through leaf-to-root traversal. Our approach considers the acceptance of the entire token sequence from the current node to the root, and preserves potentially valid subsequences that would be prematurely discarded by existing methods. We theoretically prove that the probability distribution obtained through Traversal Verification is identical to that of the target model, guaranteeing lossless inference while achieving substantial acceleration gains. Experimental results across different large language models and multiple tasks show that our method consistently improves acceptance length and throughput over existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo El-Hariry, Antoine Richard, Ricard M. Castan, Luis F. W. Batista, Matthieu Geist, Cedric Pradalier, Miguel Olivares-Mendez</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous robots must navigate and operate in diverse environments, from terrestrial and aquatic settings to aerial and space domains. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in training policies for specific autonomous robots, existing frameworks and benchmarks are often constrained to unique platforms, limiting generalization and fair comparisons across different mobility systems. In this paper, we present a multi-domain framework for training, evaluating and deploying RL-based navigation policies across diverse robotic platforms and operational environments. Our work presents four key contributions: (1) a scalable and modular framework, facilitating seamless robot-task interchangeability and reproducible training pipelines; (2) sim-to-real transfer demonstrated through real-world experiments with multiple robots, including a satellite robotic simulator, an unmanned surface vessel, and a wheeled ground vehicle; (3) the release of the first open-source API for deploying Isaac Lab-trained policies to real robots, enabling lightweight inference and rapid field validation; and (4) uniform tasks and metrics for cross-medium evaluation, through a unified evaluation testbed to assess performance of navigation tasks in diverse operational conditions (aquatic, terrestrial and space). By ensuring consistency between simulation and real-world deployment, RoboRAN lowers the barrier to developing adaptable RL-based navigation strategies. Its modular design enables straightforward integration of new robots and tasks through predefined templates, fostering reproducibility and extension to diverse domains. To support the community, we release RoboRAN as open-source.</p>

Toto uses a modern decoder-only architecture coupled with architectural innovations designed to account for specific challenges found in multivariate observability time series data. Toto's pre-training corpus is a mixture of observability data, open datasets, and synthetic data, and is 4-10$\times$ larger than those of leading time series foundation models. Additionally, we introduce BOOM, a large-scale benchmark consisting of 350 million observations across 2,807 real-world time series.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minki Kang, Jongwon Jeong, Seanie Lee, Jaewoong Cho, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but remain computationally expensive, limiting their practical deployment. To address this, recent works have focused on distilling reasoning capabilities into smaller language models (sLMs) using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from teacher LLMs. However, this approach struggles in scenarios requiring rare factual knowledge or precise computation, where sLMs often hallucinate due to limited capability. In this work, we propose Agent Distillation, a framework for transferring not only reasoning capability but full task-solving behavior from LLM-based agents into sLMs with retrieval and code tools. We improve agent distillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method called first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated trajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for improving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight reasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small as 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier larger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the potential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small agents.

<p>Abstract: Recent interest in Multi-Agent Systems of Large Language Models (MAS LLMs) has led to an increase in frameworks leveraging multiple LLMs to tackle complex tasks. However, much of this literature appropriates the terminology of MAS without engaging with its foundational principles. In this position paper, we highlight critical discrepancies between MAS theory and current MAS LLMs implementations, focusing on four key areas: the social aspect of agency, environment design, coordination and communication protocols, and measuring emergent behaviours. Our position is that many MAS LLMs lack multi-agent characteristics such as autonomy, social interaction, and structured environments, and often rely on oversimplified, LLM-centric architectures. The field may slow down and lose traction by revisiting problems the MAS literature has already addressed. Therefore, we systematically analyse this issue and outline associated research opportunities; we advocate for better integrating established MAS concepts and more precise terminology to avoid mischaracterisation and missed opportunities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Fu, Yi Ge, Yichen You, Enshu Liu, Zhihang Yuan, Guohao Dai, Shengen Yan, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities at the cost of substantial inference overhead, posing substantial deployment challenges. Although distilled Small Language Models (SLMs) significantly enhance efficiency, their performance suffers as they fail to follow LLMs' reasoning paths. Luckily, we reveal that only a small fraction of tokens genuinely diverge reasoning paths between LLMs and SLMs. Most generated tokens are either identical or exhibit neutral differences, such as minor variations in abbreviations or expressions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce **Roads to Rome (R2R)**, a neural token routing method that selectively utilizes LLMs only for these critical, path-divergent tokens, while leaving the majority of token generation to the SLM. We also develop an automatic data generation pipeline that identifies divergent tokens and generates token-level routing labels to train the lightweight router. We apply R2R to combine R1-1.5B and R1-32B models from the DeepSeek family, and evaluate on challenging math, coding, and QA benchmarks. With an average activated parameter size of 5.6B, R2R surpasses the average accuracy of R1-7B by 1.6x, outperforming even the R1-14B model. Compared to R1-32B, it delivers a 2.8x wall-clock speedup with comparable performance, advancing the Pareto frontier of test-time scaling efficiency.

<p>Abstract: The growing gap between the increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) and the limited computational budgets of edge devices poses a key challenge for efficient on-device inference, despite gradual improvements in hardware capabilities. Existing strategies, such as aggressive quantization, pruning, or remote inference, trade accuracy for efficiency or lead to substantial cost burdens. This position paper introduces a new framework that leverages speculative decoding, previously viewed primarily as a decoding acceleration technique for autoregressive generation of LLMs, as a promising approach specifically adapted for edge computing by orchestrating computation across heterogeneous devices. We propose \acronym, a framework that allows lightweight edge devices to draft multiple candidate tokens locally using diverse draft models, while a single, shared edge server verifies the tokens utilizing a more precise target model. To further increase the efficiency of verification, the edge server batch the diverse verification requests from devices. This approach supports device heterogeneity and reduces server-side memory footprint by sharing the same upstream target model across multiple devices. Our initial experiments with Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 4B/5, and an edge server equipped with 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs indicate substantial benefits: 2.2 more system throughput, 2.8 more system capacity, and better cost efficiency, all without sacrificing model accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets) confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.</p>

<p>Abstract: Weight decay is a standard regularization technique for training large language models (LLMs). While it is common to assign a uniform decay rate to every layer, this approach overlooks the structural diversity of LLMs and the varying spectral properties across modules. In this paper, we introduce AlphaDecay, a simple yet effective method that adaptively assigns different weight decay strengths to each module of an LLM. Our approach is guided by Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) theory, which analyzes the empirical spectral density (ESD) of weight correlation matrices to quantify "heavy-tailedness." Modules exhibiting more pronounced heavy-tailed ESDs, reflecting stronger feature learning, are assigned weaker decay, while modules with lighter-tailed spectra receive stronger decay. Our method leverages tailored weight decay assignments to balance the module-wise differences in spectral properties, leading to improved performance. Extensive pre-training tasks with various model sizes from 60M to 1B demonstrate that AlphaDecay achieves better perplexity and generalization than conventional uniform decay and other adaptive decay baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoqing Sun, Alessandro Stolfo, Joshua Engels, Ben Wu, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Mrinmaya Sachan, Max Tegmark</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful. However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding, entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be dismissed as training noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filippo Ruffini, Elena Mulero Ayllon, Linlin Shen, Paolo Soda, Valerio Guarrasi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the significant potential of Foundation Models (FMs) in medical imaging, their application to prognosis prediction remains challenging due to data scarcity, class imbalance, and task complexity, which limit their clinical adoption. This study introduces the first structured benchmark to assess the robustness and efficiency of transfer learning strategies for FMs compared with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in predicting COVID-19 patient outcomes from chest X-rays. The goal is to systematically compare finetuning strategies, both classical and parameter efficient, under realistic clinical constraints related to data scarcity and class imbalance, offering empirical guidance for AI deployment in clinical workflows. Four publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray datasets were used, covering mortality, severity, and ICU admission, with varying sample sizes and class imbalances. CNNs pretrained on ImageNet and FMs pretrained on general or biomedical datasets were adapted using full finetuning, linear probing, and parameter-efficient methods. Models were evaluated under full data and few shot regimes using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and Precision Recall AUC (PR-AUC), with cross validation and class weighted losses. CNNs with full fine-tuning performed robustly on small, imbalanced datasets, while FMs with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), particularly LoRA and BitFit, achieved competitive results on larger datasets. Severe class imbalance degraded PEFT performance, whereas balanced data mitigated this effect. In few-shot settings, FMs showed limited generalization, with linear probing yielding the most stable results. No single fine-tuning strategy proved universally optimal: CNNs remain dependable for low-resource scenarios, whereas FMs benefit from parameter-efficient methods when data are sufficient.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aadim Nepal, Safal Shrestha, Anubhav Shrestha, Minwu Kim, Jalal Naghiyev, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, Keith Ross</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models improve at math after instruction tuning, reinforcement learning, or knowledge distillation. We ask whether these gains come from major changes in the transformer layers or from smaller adjustments that keep the original structure. Using layer-wise ablation on base and trained variants, we find that math reasoning depends on a few critical layers, which stay important across all post- training methods. Removing these layers reduces math accuracy by as much as 80%, whereas factual recall tasks only show relatively smaller drops. This suggests that specialized layers for mathematical tasks form during pre-training and remain stable afterward. As measured by Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), we find that near these critical layers, tokens drift from their original syntactic clusters toward representations aligned with tokens less syntactically related but potentially more useful for downstream task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taehwan Yoon, Bongjun Choi, Wesley De Neve</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) collaboratively trains artificial intelligence (AI) models to ensure user data privacy. Sharing only model updates generated from local training on client data with the server enhances user data privacy. However, model performance may suffer due to data and system heterogeneity among clients in FL scenarios. Previous studies have proposed model optimization, fine-tuning, and personalization to achieve improved model performance. Despite these efforts, models resulting from FL scenarios often exhibit catastrophic forgetting, which increases the communication and computational costs of clients for model optimization and raises energy consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a reference model-based fine-tuning method for federated learning that overcomes catastrophic forgetting in each round. Our method is derived from Bayesian parameter-efficient transfer learning and includes an proximal term. It employs a reference model that incorporates previous model parameters and reviews previous global features in the model optimization step to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. As a result, our method achieves higher model performance and lower communication and computational costs for clients than existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijin Gu, Tatiana Likhomanenko, Navdeep Jaitly</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have expanded from language modeling to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional MoE methods, such as the Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call this model Omni-router Transformer. Extensive experiments on a large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse, out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%, respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness to diverse data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Wang, Yu Rong, Tingyang Xu, Zhenyi Zhong, Zhiyuan Liu, Pengju Wang, Deli Zhao, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang, Yang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation from spectra is a fundamental challenge in molecular science. Conventional approaches rely heavily on expert interpretation and lack scalability, while retrieval-based machine learning approaches remain constrained by limited reference libraries. Generative models offer a promising alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive architectures that overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that formulates molecular structure elucidation as a conditional generation process, directly inferring 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectra using diffusion models. Its denoising network is parameterized by the Diffusion Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture for geometric modeling, conditioned by SpecFormer, a Transformer-based spectral encoder capturing multi-modal spectral dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffSpectra accurately elucidates molecular structures, achieving 40.76% top-1 and 99.49% top-10 accuracy. Its performance benefits substantially from 3D geometric modeling, SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is the first framework that unifies multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ping Tuo, Jiale Chen, Ju Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Elucidating reaction mechanisms hinges on efficiently generating transition states (TSs), products, and complete reaction networks. Recent generative models, such as diffusion models for TS sampling and sequence-based architectures for product generation, offer faster alternatives to quantum-chemistry searches. But diffusion models remain constrained by their stochastic differential equation (SDE) dynamics, which suffer from inefficiency and limited controllability. We show that flow matching, a deterministic ordinary differential (ODE) formulation, can replace SDE-based diffusion for molecular and reaction generation. We introduce MolGEN, a conditional flow-matching framework that learns an optimal transport path to transport Gaussian priors to target chemical distributions. On benchmarks used by TSDiff and OA-ReactDiff, MolGEN surpasses TS geometry accuracy and barrier-height prediction while reducing sampling to sub-second inference. MolGEN also supports open-ended product generation with competitive top-k accuracy and avoids mass/electron-balance violations common to sequence models. In a realistic test on the $\gamma$-ketohydroperoxide decomposition network, MolGEN yields higher fractions of valid and intended TSs with markedly fewer quantum-chemistry evaluations than string-based baselines. These results demonstrate that deterministic flow matching provides a unified, accurate, and computationally efficient foundation for molecular generative modeling, signaling that flow matching is the future for molecular generation across chemistry.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has become a rapid and non-destructive solution for road subsurface distress (RSD) detection. Deep learning-based automatic RSD recognition, though ameliorating the burden of data processing, suffers from data scarcity and insufficient capability to recognize defects. In this study, a rigorously validated 3D GPR dataset containing 2134 samples of diverse types was constructed through field scanning. A novel cross-verification strategy was proposed to fully exploit the complementary abilities of region proposal networks in object recognition from different views of GPR images. The method achieves outstanding accuracy with a recall over 98.6% in field tests. The approach, integrated into an online RSD detection system, can reduce the human labor of inspection by around 90%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luobin Cui, Yanlai Wu, Tang Ying, Weikai Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Fatigue detection for human operators plays a key role in safety critical applications such as aviation, mining, and long haul transport. While numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of high fidelity sensors in controlled laboratory environments, their performance often degrades when ported to real world settings due to noise, lighting conditions, and field of view constraints, thereby limiting their practicality. This paper formalizes a deployment oriented setting for real world fatigue detection, where high quality sensors are often unavailable in practical applications. To address this challenge, we propose leveraging knowledge from heterogeneous source domains, including high fidelity sensors that are difficult to deploy in the field but commonly used in controlled environments, to assist fatigue detection in the real world target domain. Building on this idea, we design a heterogeneous and multiple source fatigue detection framework that adaptively utilizes the available modalities in the target domain while exploiting diverse configurations in the source domains through alignment across domains and modality imputation. Our experiments, conducted using a field deployed sensor setup and two publicly available human fatigue datasets, demonstrate the practicality, robustness, and improved generalization of our approach across subjects and domains. The proposed method achieves consistent gains over strong baselines in sensor constrained scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: The discipline of physics stands as a cornerstone of human intellect, driving the evolution of technology and deepening our understanding of the fundamental principles of the cosmos. Contemporary literature includes some works centered on the task of solving physics problems - a crucial domain of natural language reasoning. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of frontier LLMs in solving physics problems, both mathematical and descriptive. We also employ a plethora of inference-time techniques and agentic frameworks to improve the performance of the models. This includes the verification of proposed solutions in a cumulative fashion by other, smaller LLM agents, and we perform a comparative analysis of the performance that the techniques entail. There are significant improvements when the multi-agent framework is applied to problems that the models initially perform poorly on. Furthermore, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark for physics problems, ${\rm P{\small HYSICS}E{\small VAL}}$, consisting of 19,609 problems sourced from various physics textbooks and their corresponding correct solutions scraped from physics forums and educational websites.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Qi, Chao-Han Yang, Pin-Yu Chen, Min-Hsiu Hsieh</p>
<p>Abstract: Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental scalability barriers, primarily due to the presence of barren plateaus and its sensitivity to quantum noise. To address these challenges, we introduce TensorHyper-VQC, a novel tensor-train (TT)-guided hypernetwork framework that significantly improves the robustness and scalability of VQC. Our framework fully delegates the generation of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Grounded in Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum simulation tasks demonstrate that TensorHyper-VQC consistently achieves superior performance and robust noise tolerance, including hardware-level validation on a 156-qubit IBM Heron processor. These results position TensorHyper-VQC as a scalable and noise-resilient framework for advancing practical quantum machine learning on near-term devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jack Zeng, Andreu Matoses Gimenez, Eugene Vinitsky, Javier Alonso-Mora, Sihao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the first decentralized method to enable real-world 6-DoF manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a team of Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states, inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition, we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller, enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete in-flight loss of one MAV.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jueon Park, Yein Park, Minju Song, Soyon Park, Donghyeon Lee, Seungheun Baek, Jaewoo Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Drug toxicity remains a major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale. To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO) terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with physiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the potential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support early-stage drug safety assessment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Zhang, LuLu Yu, Lei Gao, QuanJiang Guo, Jing Liu, Hui Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: During reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), false positive (FP) reasoning occurs when a model produces the correct answer but follows an incorrect reasoning path, resulting in undermined reasoning reliability. Existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering, knowledge distillation or reinforcement learning to improve reasoning reliability, both of which require large amounts of high-quality data and thus limit practical applicability. Few approaches have focused on directly detecting and correcting FPs. To address these issues, we propose ViFP, a framework for Visual False Positive Detection to Enhance Reasoning Reliability in VLMs. ViFP builds effective reasoning paths through multi-turn QA and dynamically analyzes the consistency of the reasoning path to identify potential FPs. It also introduces a targeted reasoning chain correction mechanism to modify FP reasoning, thereby improving logical consistency and accuracy. Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric, VoC, which integrates answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess whether a VLM not only answers correctly but also reasons reliably. Our experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OK-VQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in enhancing reasoning reliability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Virtual try-on aims to synthesize a realistic image of a person wearing a target garment, but accurately modeling garment-body correspondence remains a persistent challenge, especially under pose and appearance variation. In this paper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns virtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such 2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained (e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence of natural and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-time rendering with global illumination is crucial to afford the user realistic experience in virtual environments. We present a learning-based estimator to predict diffuse indirect illumination in screen space, which then is combined with direct illumination to synthesize globally-illuminated high dynamic range (HDR) results. Our approach tackles the challenges of capturing long-range/long-distance indirect illumination when employing neural networks and is generalized to handle complex lighting and scenarios.
  From the neural network thinking of the solver to the rendering equation, we present a novel network architecture to predict indirect illumination. Our network is equipped with a modified attention mechanism that aggregates global information guided by spacial geometry features, as well as a monochromatic design that encodes each color channel individually.
  We conducted extensive evaluations, and the experimental results demonstrate our superiority over previous learning-based techniques. Our approach excels at handling complex lighting such as varying-colored lighting and environment lighting. It can successfully capture distant indirect illumination and simulates the interreflections between textured surfaces well (i.e., color bleeding effects); it can also effectively handle new scenes that are not present in the training dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advances in image registration and machine learning have recently enabled volumetric analysis of postmortem brain tissue from conventional photographs of coronal slabs, which are routinely collected in brain banks and neuropathology laboratories worldwide. One caveat of this methodology is the requirement of segmentation of the tissue from photographs, which currently requires costly manual intervention. In this article, we present a deep learning model to automate this process. The automatic segmentation tool relies on a U-Net architecture that was trained with a combination of 1,414 manually segmented images of both fixed and fresh tissue, from specimens with varying diagnoses, photographed at two different sites. Automated model predictions on a subset of photographs not seen in training were analyzed to estimate performance compared to manual labels, including both inter- and intra-rater variability.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose AnalogSeeker, an effort toward an open-source foundation language model for analog circuit design, with the aim of integrating domain knowledge and giving design assistance. To overcome the scarcity of data in this field, we employ a corpus collection strategy based on the domain knowledge framework of analog circuits. High-quality, accessible textbooks across relevant subfields are systematically curated and cleaned into a textual domain corpus. To address the complexity of knowledge of analog circuits, we introduce a granular domain knowledge distillation method. Raw, unlabeled domain corpus is decomposed into typical, granular learning nodes, where a multi-agent framework distills implicit knowledge embedded in unstructured text into question-answer data pairs with detailed reasoning processes, yielding a fine-grained, learnable dataset for fine-tuning. To address the unexplored challenges in training analog circuit foundation models, we explore and share our training methods through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation. We finally establish a fine-tuning-centric training paradigm, customizing and implementing a neighborhood self-constrained supervised fine-tuning algorithm. This approach enhances training outcomes by constraining the perturbation magnitude between the model's output distributions before and after training. In practice, we train the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model to obtain AnalogSeeker, which achieves 85.04% accuracy on AMSBench-TQA, the analog circuit knowledge evaluation benchmark, with a 15.67% point improvement over the original model and is competitive with mainstream commercial models. Furthermore, AnalogSeeker also shows effectiveness in the downstream operational amplifier design task.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanika Moharana, Cynthia L. Bennett, Erin Buehler, Michael Madaio, Vinita Tibdewal, Shaun K. Kane</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid emergence of generative AI has changed the way that technology is designed, constructed, maintained, and evaluated. Decisions made when creating AI-powered systems may impact some users disproportionately, such as people with disabilities. In this paper, we report on an interview study with 25 AI practitioners across multiple roles (engineering, research, UX, and responsible AI) about how their work processes and artifacts may impact end users with disabilities. We found that practitioners experienced friction when triaging problems at the intersection of responsible AI and accessibility practices, navigated contradictions between accessibility and responsible AI guidelines, identified gaps in data about users with disabilities, and gathered support for addressing the needs of disabled stakeholders by leveraging informal volunteer and community groups within their company. Based on these findings, we offer suggestions for new resources and process changes to better support people with disabilities as end users of AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrzej Szablewski, Marek Masiak</p>
<p>Abstract: The residual stream mediates communication between transformer decoder layers via linear reads and writes of non-linear computations. While sparse-dictionary learning-based methods locate features in the residual stream, and activation patching methods discover circuits within the model, the mechanism by which features flow through the residual stream remains understudied. Understanding this dynamic can better inform jailbreaking protections, enable early detection of model mistakes, and their correction. In this work, we propose Activation Transport Operators (ATO), linear maps from upstream to downstream residuals $k$ layers later, evaluated in feature space using downstream SAE decoder projections. We empirically demonstrate that these operators can determine whether a feature has been linearly transported from a previous layer or synthesised from non-linear layer computation. We develop the notion of transport efficiency, for which we provide an upper bound, and use it to estimate the size of the residual stream subspace that corresponds to linear transport. We empirically demonstrate the linear transport, report transport efficiency and the size of the residual stream's subspace involved in linear transport. This compute-light (no finetuning, <50 GPU-h) method offers practical tools for safety, debugging, and a clearer picture of where computation in LLMs behaves linearly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Borun Shi, Ioannis Panagiotas</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them. However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We introduce new benchmarks that evaluate intermediate tool calls as well as final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iqbal H. Sarker, Helge Janicke, Ahmad Mohsin, Leandros Maglaras</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing today's business practices; however, their adoption within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) raises serious trust, ethical, and technical issues. In this perspective paper, we introduce a structured, multi-phased framework, "SME-TEAM" for the secure and responsible use of these technologies in SMEs. Based on a conceptual structure of four key pillars, i.e., Data, Algorithms, Human Oversight, and Model Architecture, SME-TEAM bridges theoretical ethical principles with operational practice, enhancing AI capabilities across a wide range of applications in SMEs. Ultimately, this paper provides a structured roadmap for the adoption of these emerging technologies, positioning trust and ethics as a driving force for resilience, competitiveness, and sustainable innovation within the area of business analytics and SMEs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jay Patel, Hrudayangam Mehta, Jeremy Blackburn</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting hateful content is a challenging and important problem. Automated tools, like machine-learning models, can help, but they require continuous training to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of social media. In this work, we evaluate eight open-source LLMs' capability to detect antisemitic content, specifically leveraging in-context definition. We also study how LLMs understand and explain their decisions given a moderation policy as a guideline. First, we explore various prompting techniques and design a new CoT-like prompt, Guided-CoT, and find that injecting domain-specific thoughts increases performance and utility. Guided-CoT handles the in-context policy well, improving performance and utility by reducing refusals across all evaluated models, regardless of decoding configuration, model size, or reasoning capability. Notably, Llama 3.1 70B outperforms fine-tuned GPT-3.5. Additionally, we examine LLM errors and introduce metrics to quantify semantic divergence in model-generated rationales, revealing notable differences and paradoxical behaviors among LLMs. Our experiments highlight the differences observed across LLMs' utility, explainability, and reliability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangchi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper synthesizes a series of formal proofs to construct a unified theory on the logical limits of the Symbol Grounding Problem. We demonstrate through a four-stage argument that meaning within a formal system must arise from a process that is external, dynamic, and non-algorithmic. First, we prove that any purely symbolic system, devoid of external connections, cannot internally establish a consistent foundation for meaning due to self-referential paradoxes. Second, we extend this limitation to systems with any finite, static set of pre-established meanings, proving they are inherently incomplete. Third, we demonstrate that the grounding process is logically incomplete; specifically, the 'act' of connecting internal symbols to novel, emergent external meanings cannot be a product of logical inference within the system but must be an axiomatic, meta-level update. Finally, we prove that any attempt to automate this update process using a fixed, external "judgment" algorithm will inevitably construct a larger, yet equally incomplete, symbolic system. Together, these conclusions formally establish that the grounding of meaning is a necessarily open-ended, non-algorithmic process, revealing a fundamental, G\"odel-style limitation for any self-contained intelligent system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pavan Karjol, Vivek V Kashyap, Rohan Kashyap, Prathosh A P</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for the automatic discovery of one-parameter subgroups ($H_{\gamma}$) of $SO(3)$ and, more generally, $SO(n)$. One-parameter subgroups of $SO(n)$ are crucial in a wide range of applications, including robotics, quantum mechanics, and molecular structure analysis. Our method utilizes the standard Jordan form of skew-symmetric matrices, which define the Lie algebra of $SO(n)$, to establish a canonical form for orbits under the action of $H_{\gamma}$. This canonical form is then employed to derive a standardized representation for $H_{\gamma}$-invariant functions. By learning the appropriate parameters, the framework uncovers the underlying one-parameter subgroup $H_{\gamma}$. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through tasks such as double pendulum modeling, moment of inertia prediction, top quark tagging and invariant polynomial regression, where it successfully recovers meaningful subgroup structure and produces interpretable, symmetry-aware representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vaskar Chakma, Ju Xiaolin, Heling Cao, Xue Feng, Ji Xiaodong, Pan Haiyan, Gao Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: This study aims to develop and evaluate an ensemble machine learning-based framework for the automatic detection of Wide QRS Complex Tachycardia (WCT) from ECG signals, emphasizing diagnostic accuracy and interpretability using Explainable AI. The proposed system integrates ensemble learning techniques, i.e., an optimized Random Forest known as CardioForest, and models like XGBoost and LightGBM. The models were trained and tested on ECG data from the publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset. The testing was carried out with the assistance of accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and error rate (RMSE, MAE) measures. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to ascertain model explainability and clinical relevance. The CardioForest model performed best on all metrics, achieving a test accuracy of 95.19%, a balanced accuracy of 88.76%, a precision of 95.26%, a recall of 78.42%, and an ROC-AUC of 0.8886. SHAP analysis confirmed the model's ability to rank the most relevant ECG features, such as QRS duration, in accordance with clinical intuitions, thereby fostering trust and usability in clinical practice. The findings recognize CardioForest as an extremely dependable and interpretable WCT detection model. Being able to offer accurate predictions and transparency through explainability makes it a valuable tool to help cardiologists make timely and well-informed diagnoses, especially for high-stakes and emergency scenarios.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04263">Efficient Latent Variable Causal Discovery: Combining Score Search and Targeted Testing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Ramsey, Bryan Andrews, Peter Spirtes</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is especially challenging when latent variables or selection bias are present. The Fast Causal Inference (FCI) algorithm addresses this setting but performs exhaustive conditional independence tests across many subsets, often leading to spurious independences, missing or extra edges, and unreliable orientations. We present a family of score-guided mixed-strategy causal search algorithms that extend this framework. First, we introduce BOSS-FCI and GRaSP-FCI, variants of GFCI (Greedy Fast Causal Inference) that substitute BOSS (Best Order Score Search) or GRaSP (Greedy Relaxations of Sparsest Permutation) for FGES (Fast Greedy Equivalence Search), preserving correctness while trading off scalability and conservativeness. Second, we develop FCI Targeted-Testing (FCIT), a novel hybrid method that replaces exhaustive testing with targeted, score-informed tests guided by BOSS. FCIT guarantees well-formed PAGs and achieves higher precision and efficiency across sample sizes. Finally, we propose a lightweight heuristic, LV-Dumb (Latent Variable "Dumb"), which returns the PAG of the BOSS DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). Though not strictly sound for latent confounding, LV-Dumb often matches FCIT's accuracy while running substantially faster. Simulations and real-data analyses show that BOSS-FCI and GRaSP-FCI provide robust baselines, FCIT yields the best balance of precision and reliability, and LV-Dumb offers a fast, near-equivalent alternative. Together, these methods demonstrate that targeted and score-guided strategies can dramatically improve the efficiency and correctness of latent-variable causal discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Xie, Zexi Tan, Haoyi Xiao, Binbin Sun, Yiqun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Early Time Series Classification (ETSC) is critical in time-sensitive medical applications such as sepsis, yet it presents an inherent trade-off between accuracy and earliness. This trade-off arises from two core challenges: 1) models should effectively model inherently weak and noisy early-stage snippets, and 2) they should resolve the complex, dual requirement of simultaneously capturing local, subject-specific variations and overarching global temporal patterns. Existing methods struggle to overcome these underlying challenges, often forcing a severe compromise: sacrificing accuracy to achieve earliness, or vice-versa. We propose \textbf{DE3S}, a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{S}oft-\textbf{S}parse \textbf{S}equence Learning framework, which systematically solves these challenges. A dual enhancement mechanism is proposed to enhance the modeling of weak, early signals. Then, an attention-based patch module is introduced to preserve discriminative information while reducing noise and complexity. A dual-path fusion architecture is designed, using a sparse mixture of experts to model local, subject-specific variations. A multi-scale inception module is also employed to capture global dependencies. Experiments on six real-world medical datasets show the competitive performance of DE3S, particularly in early prediction windows. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in addressing its targeted challenge. The source code is available \href{https://github.com/kuxit/DE3S}{\textbf{here}}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating the factuality of long-form generations from Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging due to efficiency bottlenecks and reliability concerns. Prior efforts attempt this by decomposing text into claims, searching for evidence, and verifying claims, but suffer from critical drawbacks: (1) inefficiency due to overcomplicated pipeline components, and (2) ineffectiveness stemming from inaccurate claim sets and insufficient evidence. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{FaStfact}, an evaluation framework that achieves the highest alignment with human evaluation and time/token efficiency among existing baselines. FaStfact first employs chunk-level claim extraction integrated with confidence-based pre-verification, significantly reducing the time and token cost while ensuring reliability. For searching and verification, it collects document-level evidence from crawled web-pages and selectively retrieves it during verification. Extensive experiments based on an annotated benchmark \textbf{FaStfact-Bench} demonstrate the reliability of FaStfact in both efficiently and effectively evaluating long-form factuality.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across domains and applications but face challenges such as high fine-tuning costs, inference latency, limited edge deployability, and reliability concerns. Small language models (SLMs), with compact, efficient, and adaptable features, offer promising solutions. Building on this potential, recent research explores collaborative frameworks that integrate their complementary strengths, leveraging SLMs' specialization and efficiency with LLMs' generalization and reasoning to address diverse objectives across tasks and deployment scenarios. Motivated by these developments, this paper presents a systematic survey of SLM-LLM collaboration from the perspective of collaboration objectives. We propose a taxonomy covering four goals: performance enhancement, cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Under this framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient and secure SLM-LLM collaboration.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wang Zixian</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard for aligning models with human feedback, yet its reliance on hard, pairwise preferences makes it brittle to annotator noise and distribution shift. We propose Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO), a theoretically grounded framework that extends preference learning to soft, listwise supervision through reference anchoring. Our key theoretical contributions are threefold: (1) we establish that ADPO unifies major learning paradigms, including supervised fine-tuning, knowledge distillation, maximum-entropy reinforcement learning, and DPO, as special cases through different choices of target distribution, anchor policy, and temperature; (2) we prove that anchoring induces an implicit trust region governed by the softmax Fisher metric; and (3) we formalize the stability of dynamic anchor updates. Empirically, we discover a task-dependent tradeoff: dynamic anchors suit online exploration, while fixed anchors excel at offline distillation, reducing teacher-student KL divergence by two to three orders of magnitude (170 to 5000 times).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianheng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Over 70 million people worldwide experience stuttering, yet most automatic speech systems misinterpret disfluent utterances or fail to transcribe them accurately. Existing methods for stutter correction rely on handcrafted feature extraction or multi-stage automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) pipelines, which separate transcription from audio reconstruction and often amplify distortions. This work introduces StutterZero and StutterFormer, the first end-to-end waveform-to-waveform models that directly convert stuttered speech into fluent speech while jointly predicting its transcription. StutterZero employs a convolutional-bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder with attention, whereas StutterFormer integrates a dual-stream Transformer with shared acoustic-linguistic representations. Both architectures are trained on paired stuttered-fluent data synthesized from the SEP-28K and LibriStutter corpora and evaluated on unseen speakers from the FluencyBank dataset. Across all benchmarks, StutterZero had a 24% decrease in Word Error Rate (WER) and a 31% improvement in semantic similarity (BERTScore) compared to the leading Whisper-Medium model. StutterFormer achieved better results, with a 28% decrease in WER and a 34% improvement in BERTScore. The results validate the feasibility of direct end-to-end stutter-to-fluent speech conversion, offering new opportunities for inclusive human-computer interaction, speech therapy, and accessibility-oriented AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianyang Liu, Yilin Liu, Shuai Wang, Hao Cheng, Andrew Estornell, Yuzhi Zhao, Jiaheng Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: The creation of high-quality datasets to improve Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning remains a significant challenge, as current methods often suffer from generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from available data sources. To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness, without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than large-scale, low-quality alternatives.</p>

<p>Abstract: The analysis and control of stochastic dynamical systems rely on probabilistic models such as (continuous-space) Markov decision processes, but large or continuous state spaces make exact analysis intractable and call for principled quantitative abstraction. This work develops a unified theory of such abstraction by integrating category theory, coalgebra, quantitative logic, and optimal transport, centred on a canonical $\varepsilon$-quotient of the behavioral pseudo-metric with a universal property: among all abstractions that collapse behavioral differences below $\varepsilon$, it is the most detailed, and every other abstraction achieving the same discounted value-loss guarantee factors uniquely through it. Categorically, a quotient functor $Q_\varepsilon$ from a category of probabilistic systems to a category of metric specifications admits, via the Special Adjoint Functor Theorem, a right adjoint $R_\varepsilon$, yielding an adjunction $Q_\varepsilon \dashv R_\varepsilon$ that formalizes a duality between abstraction and realization; logically, a quantitative modal $\mu$-calculus with separate reward and transition modalities is shown, for a broad class of systems, to be expressively complete for the behavioral pseudo-metric, with a countable fully abstract fragment suitable for computation. The theory is developed coalgebraically over Polish spaces and the Giry monad and validated on finite-state models using optimal-transport solvers, with experiments corroborating the predicted contraction properties and structural stability and aligning with the theoretical value-loss bounds, thereby providing a rigorous foundation for quantitative state abstraction and representation learning in probabilistic domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bentley DeVilling (Course Correct Labs, Independent Research Group)</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are often described as capable of reflective reasoning, yet recursive self-evaluation without external feedback frequently yields reformulation rather than progress. We test this prediction in a cross-provider study of 144 reasoning sequences across three models (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) and four task families (arithmetic, code, explanation, reflection), each iterated ten times under two conditions: ungrounded self-critique and a minimal grounding intervention (a single verification step at iteration three). Mean informational change (delta I, measured via normalized edit distance) declined by 55% from early (0.193) to late (0.087) iterations in ungrounded runs, with consistent patterns across all three providers. Grounded runs showed a +28% rebound in informational change immediately after the intervention and sustained non-zero variance thereafter. Complementary measures-n-gram novelty, embedding drift, and character-level entropy-converged on the same pattern: reflection without contact tends toward informational closure. We interpret this as evidence for a structural limit on self-correction in generative reasoning: without an exchange of information with an independent verifier or environment, recursive inference approaches an attractor state of epistemic stasis. Minimal grounding functions as dissipative coupling, reintroducing informational flux. The cross-architecture consistency suggests the mirror loop arises from shared autoregressive training objectives rather than provider-specific alignment schemes. The results delineate when reflection is performative rather than epistemic and motivate design principles for grounded, cooperative reasoning. Materials and code are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddharth Chaudhary</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models display in-context learning as an emergent effect of scale, but they rely on static weights during inference. In contrast, biological systems continually adapt via synaptic plasticity. We investigate whether explicit, biologically inspired plasticity can endow Transformers with faster in-sequence adaptation. To this end, we augment decoder-only Transformers with fast-weight modules updated either by (i) a neuromodulated Hebbian rule or (ii) the gradient-based plasticity mechanism of Duan et al. (2023). Across copying, regression, and few-shot classification tasks (CIFAR-FS, Omniglot), Hebbian plasticity consistently achieves lower loss and stronger few-shot generalization, while gradient-based updates perform best on long-horizon credit assignment. When associations are short and linearly separable, static weights suffice, defining a clear boundary condition for when plasticity helps. Analysis of learned modulatory signals reveals that gradient-based rules maintain large, persistent updates, whereas Hebbian plasticity is sharply gated around salient events. Together, these results show that explicit plasticity complements attention by enabling rapid, task-specific adaptation, and clarify when different plasticity mechanisms are most effective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Yue, Sheng Xu, Kui Jia, Guiliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Humanoid robots represent a central frontier in embodied intelligence, as their anthropomorphic form enables natural deployment in humans' workspace. Brain-body co-design for humanoids presents a promising approach to realizing this potential by jointly optimizing control policies and physical morphology. Within this context, fall recovery emerges as a critical capability. It not only enhances safety and resilience but also integrates naturally with locomotion systems, thereby advancing the autonomy of humanoids. In this paper, we propose RoboCraft, a scalable humanoid co-design framework for fall recovery that iteratively improves performance through the coupled updates of control policy and morphology. A shared policy pretrained across multiple designs is progressively finetuned on high-performing morphologies, enabling efficient adaptation without retraining from scratch. Concurrently, morphology search is guided by human-inspired priors and optimization algorithms, supported by a priority buffer that balances reevaluation of promising candidates with the exploration of novel designs. Experiments show that RoboCraft achieves an average performance gain of 44.55% on seven public humanoid robots, with morphology optimization drives at least 40% of improvements in co-designing four humanoid robots, underscoring the critical role of humanoid co-design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guozhong Li, Muhannad Alhumaidi, Spiros Skiadopoulos, Panos Kalnis</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution scientific simulations and observation systems is generating massive spatiotemporal datasets, making efficient, error-bounded compression increasingly important. Meanwhile, decoder-only large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling complex sequential data. In this paper, we propose LLMCOMP, a novel lossy compression paradigm that leverages decoder-only large LLMs to model scientific data. LLMCOMP first quantizes 3D fields into discrete tokens, arranges them via Z-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling to enhance training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer is then trained with spatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions. During compression, the model performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback corrections to ensure strict error bounds. Experiments on multiple reanalysis datasets show that LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art compressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error bounds. These results highlight the potential of LLMs as general-purpose compressors for high-fidelity scientific data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many rare diseases offer limited established treatment options, leading patients to switch therapies when new medications emerge. To analyze the impact of such treatment switches within the low sample size limitations of rare disease trials, it is important to use all available data sources. This, however, is complicated when usage of measurement instruments change during the observation period, for example when instruments are adapted to specific age ranges. The resulting disjoint longitudinal data trajectories, complicate the application of traditional modeling approaches like mixed-effects regression. We tackle this by mapping observations of each instrument to a aligned low-dimensional temporal trajectory, enabling longitudinal modeling across instruments. Specifically, we employ a set of variational autoencoder architectures to embed item values into a shared latent space for each time point. Temporal disease dynamics and treatment switch effects are then captured through a mixed-effects regression model applied to latent representations. To enable statistical inference, we present a novel statistical testing approach that accounts for the joint parameter estimation of mixed-effects regression and variational autoencoders. The methodology is applied to quantify the impact of treatment switches for patients with spinal muscular atrophy. Here, our approach aligns motor performance items from different measurement instruments for mixed-effects regression and maps estimated effects back to the observed item level to quantify the treatment switch effect. Our approach allows for model selection as well as for assessing effects of treatment switching. The results highlight the potential of modeling in joint latent representations for addressing small data challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runsheng Xu, Hubert Lin, Wonseok Jeon, Hao Feng, Yuliang Zou, Liting Sun, John Gorman, Kate Tolstaya, Sarah Tang, Brandyn White, Ben Sapp, Mingxing Tan, Jyh-Jing Hwang, Dragomir Anguelov</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021 driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8 surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge. Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of handling complex real-world situations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Musfiqur Rahman, SayedHassan Khatoonabadi, Emad Shihab</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on function-level code generation benchmarks, yet real-world software development increasingly demands class-level implementations that integrate multiple methods, attributes, and dependencies within authentic project contexts. This gap between benchmark performance and practical utility raises critical questions about LLMs' readiness for production code assistance, particularly regarding their ability to generalize across familiar and novel codebases.
  We introduce a benchmark derived from real-world open-source repositories, comprising classes divided into seen and unseen partitions to evaluate generalization under practical conditions. We systematically examine how input specification completeness and retrieval-augmented generation affect class-level correctness across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs.
  Our evaluation reveals a substantial performance gap: while LLMs achieve 84 to 89% correctness on synthetic benchmarks, they attain only 25 to 34% on real-world class tasks, with minimal distinction between familiar and novel codebases. Comprehensive documentation provides marginal improvements (1 to 3%), whereas retrieval augmentation yields greater gains (4 to 7%) by supplying concrete implementation patterns. Error analysis identifies AttributeError, TypeError, and AssertionError as dominant failure modes, with distinct patterns between synthetic and real-world scenarios.
  These findings provide actionable insights for enhancing context modelling, documentation strategies, and retrieval integration in production code assistance tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Botao 'Amber' Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Improvisation-the art of spontaneous creation that unfolds moment-to-moment without a scripted outcome-requires practitioners to continuously sense, adapt, and create anew. It is a fundamental mode of human creativity spanning music, dance, and everyday life. The open-ended nature of improvisation produces a stream of novel, unrepeatable moments-an aspect highly valued in artistic creativity. In parallel, open-endedness (OE)-a system's capacity for unbounded novelty and endless "interestingness"-is exemplified in natural or cultural evolution and has been considered "the last grand challenge" in artificial life (ALife). The rise of generative AI now raises the question in computational creativity (CC) research: What makes a "good" improvisation for AI? Can AI learn to improvise in a genuinely open-ended way? In this work-in-progress paper, we report insights from in-depth interviews with 6 experts in improvisation across dance, music, and contact improvisation. We draw systemic connections between human improvisational arts and the design of future experiential AI agents that could improvise alone or alongside humans-or even with other AI agents-embodying qualities of improvisation drawn from practice: active listening (umwelt and awareness), being in the time (mindfulness and ephemerality), embracing the unknown (source of randomness and serendipity), non-judgmental flow (acceptance and dynamical stability, balancing structure and surprise (unpredictable criticality at edge of chaos), imaginative metaphor (synaesthesia and planning), empathy, trust, boundary, and care (mutual theory of mind), and playfulness and intrinsic motivation (maintaining interestingness).</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a retrospective analysis of anonymized candidate-evaluation data collected during pilot hiring campaigns conducted through AlteraSF, an AI-native resume-verification platform. The system evaluates resume claims, generates context-sensitive verification questions, and measures performance along quantitative axes of factual validity and job fit, complemented by qualitative integrity detection. Across six job families and 1,700 applications, the platform achieved a 90-95% reduction in screening time and detected measurable linguistic patterns consistent with AI-assisted or copied responses. The analysis demonstrates that candidate truthfulness can be assessed not only through factual accuracy but also through patterns of linguistic authenticity. The results suggest that a multi-dimensional verification framework can improve both hiring efficiency and trust in AI-mediated evaluation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Shi, Hao Li, Bram Adams, Ahmed E. Hassan</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated program repair (APR) has recently shifted toward large language models and agent-based systems, yet most systems rely on local snapshot context, overlooking repository history. Prior work shows that repository history helps repair single-line bugs, since the last commit touching the buggy line is often the bug-introducing one. In this paper, we investigate whether repository history can also improve agentic APR systems at scale, especially for complex multi-hunk bugs. We present HAFixAgent, a History-Aware Bug-Fixing Agent that injects blame-derived repository heuristics into its repair loop. A preliminary study of all 854 real-world bugs from Defects4J motivates our design, showing that bug-relevant history is both widely available and highly concentrated. Empirical comparison of HAFixAgent with two state-of-the-art baselines shows: (1) Effectiveness: HAFixAgent significantly improves over the agent-based baseline (by 212.3%) and the multi-hunk baseline (by 29.9%). (2) Efficiency: history does not significantly increase agent steps and keeps token costs comparable, with notably lower median costs for complex multi-file-multi-hunk bugs. (3) Practicality: combining different historical heuristics repairs more bugs, offering a clear cost-benefit trade-off. HAFixAgent offers a practical recipe for history-aware agentic APR: ground the agent in version control history, prioritize diff-based historical context, and integrate complementary heuristics when needed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lekshmi Murali Rani, Richard Berntsson Svensson, Robert Feldt</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of AI for Requirements Engineering (RE) presents significant benefits but also poses real challenges. Although RE is fundamental to software engineering, limited research has examined AI adoption in RE. We surveyed 55 software practitioners to map AI usage across four RE phases: Elicitation, Analysis, Specification, and Validation, and four approaches for decision making: human-only decisions, AI validation, Human AI Collaboration (HAIC), and full AI automation. Participants also shared their perceptions, challenges, and opportunities when applying AI for RE tasks. Our data show that 58.2% of respondents already use AI in RE, and 69.1% view its impact as positive or very positive. HAIC dominates practice, accounting for 54.4% of all RE techniques, while full AI automation remains minimal at 5.4%. Passive AI validation (4.4 to 6.2%) lags even further behind, indicating that practitioners value AI's active support over passive oversight. These findings suggest that AI is most effective when positioned as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement for human expertise. It also highlights the need for RE-specific HAIC frameworks along with robust and responsible AI governance as AI adoption in RE grows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Du, Xinyu Gong, Qingshan Tan, Wen Li, Yangming Cheng, Weitao Wang, Chenlu Zhan, Suhui Wu, Hao Zhang, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have identified Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as an efficient and reward-free approach to improving video generation quality. However, existing methods largely follow image-domain paradigms and are mainly developed on small-scale models (approximately 2B parameters), limiting their ability to address the unique challenges of video tasks, such as costly data construction, unstable training, and heavy memory consumption. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a GT-Pair that automatically builds high-quality preference pairs by using real videos as positives and model-generated videos as negatives, eliminating the need for any external annotation. We further present Reg-DPO, which incorporates the SFT loss as a regularization term into the DPO loss to enhance training stability and generation fidelity. Additionally, by combining the FSDP framework with multiple memory optimization techniques, our approach achieves nearly three times higher training capacity than using FSDP alone. Extensive experiments on both I2V and T2V tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches, delivering superior video generation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Zhang, Rong Wang, Shiyang Li, Yuebo Luo, Mingyi Hong, Caiwen Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing efficient CUDA kernels is increasingly critical for AI applications such as large-scale LLM training. However, manual kernel design is both costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage LLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation, however, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational overhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose CudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and optimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human experts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing correctness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More specifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that iteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating hardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive evaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3, achieves 97.6\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\times$ speedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art models including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench.Beyond accuracy and speed, CudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090, 3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4, QwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an optimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \$ 0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that costs 6 H100 hours and \$ 5 API cost per kernel. Our results highlight that multi-agent, training-free workflows can enable cost-effective, generalizable, and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization.

<p>Abstract: Diagnosing rare diseases often requires connecting variant-bearing genes to evidence that is written as unstructured clinical prose, which the current established pipelines still leave for clinicians to reconcile manually. To this end, we introduce LA-MARRVEL, a knowledge-grounded and language-aware reranking layer that operates on top of AI-MARRVEL: it supplies expert-engineered context, queries a large language model multiple times, and aggregates the resulting partial rankings with a ranked voting method to produce a stable, explainable gene ranking. Evaluated on three real-world cohorts (BG, DDD, UDN), LA-MARRVEL consistently improves Recall@K over AI-MARRVEL and established phenotype-driven tools such as Exomiser and LIRICAL, with especially large gains on cases where the first-stage ranker placed the causal gene lower. Each ranked gene is accompanied by LLM-generated reasoning that integrates phenotypic, inheritance, and variant-level evidence, thereby making the output more interpretable and facilitating clinical review.</p>

The theoretical motivation for our use of sketching as a regularizer is presented via a simple Johnson-Lindenstrauss-informed result. While our methods may be of wider interest in the field of continual learning, we specifically target in situ neural compression using implicit neural representation-based hypernetworks. We evaluate our method on a variety of complex simulation data in two and three dimensions, over long time horizons, and across unstructured grids and non-Cartesian geometries. On these tasks, we show strong reconstruction performance at high compression rates. Most importantly, we demonstrate that sketching enables the presented in situ scheme to approximately match the performance of the equivalent offline method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giacomo Camposampiero, Pietro Barbiero, Michael Hersche, Roger Wattenhofer, Abbas Rahimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Compositional generalization-a key open challenge in modern machine learning-requires models to predict unknown combinations of known concepts. However, assessing compositional generalization remains a fundamental challenge due to the lack of standardized evaluation protocols and the limitations of current benchmarks, which often favor efficiency over rigor. At the same time, general-purpose vision architectures lack the necessary inductive biases, and existing approaches to endow them compromise scalability. As a remedy, this paper introduces: 1) a rigorous evaluation framework that unifies and extends previous approaches while reducing computational requirements from combinatorial to constant; 2) an extensive and modern evaluation on the status of compositional generalization in supervised vision backbones, training more than 5000 models; 3) Attribute Invariant Networks, a class of models establishing a new Pareto frontier in compositional generalization, achieving a 23.43% accuracy improvement over baselines while reducing parameter overhead from 600% to 16% compared to fully disentangled counterparts.

<p>Abstract: Tabular foundation models represent a growing paradigm in structured data learning, extending the benefits of large-scale pretraining to tabular domains. However, their adoption remains limited due to heterogeneous preprocessing pipelines, fragmented APIs, inconsistent fine-tuning procedures, and the absence of standardized evaluation for deployment-oriented metrics such as calibration and fairness. We present TabTune, a unified library that standardizes the complete workflow for tabular foundation models through a single interface. TabTune provides consistent access to seven state-of-the-art models supporting multiple adaptation strategies, including zero-shot inference, meta-learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). The framework automates model-aware preprocessing, manages architectural heterogeneity internally, and integrates evaluation modules for performance, calibration, and fairness. Designed for extensibility and reproducibility, TabTune enables consistent benchmarking of adaptation strategies of tabular foundation models.</p>
