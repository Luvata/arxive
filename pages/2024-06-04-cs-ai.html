<p><b>Authors:</b> Katherine Van Koevering, Jon Kleinberg</p>
<p>Abstract: One uniquely human trait is our inability to be random. We see and produce patterns where there should not be any and we do so in a predictable way. LLMs are supplied with human data and prone to human biases. In this work, we explore how LLMs approach randomness and where and how they fail through the lens of the well studied phenomena of generating binary random sequences. We find that GPT 4 and Llama 3 exhibit and exacerbate nearly every human bias we test in this context, but GPT 3.5 exhibits more random behavior. This dichotomy of randomness or humaness is proposed as a fundamental question of LLMs and that either behavior may be useful in different circumstances.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00154">A Novel Ranking Scheme for the Performance Analysis of Stochastic Optimization Algorithms using the Principles of Severity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sowmya Chandrasekaran, Thomas Bartz-Beielstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic optimization algorithms have been successfully applied in several domains to find optimal solutions. Because of the ever-growing complexity of the integrated systems, novel stochastic algorithms are being proposed, which makes the task of the performance analysis of the algorithms extremely important. In this paper, we provide a novel ranking scheme to rank the algorithms over multiple single-objective optimization problems. The results of the algorithms are compared using a robust bootstrapping-based hypothesis testing procedure that is based on the principles of severity. Analogous to the football league scoring scheme, we propose pairwise comparison of algorithms as in league competition. Each algorithm accumulates points and a performance metric of how good or bad it performed against other algorithms analogous to goal differences metric in football league scoring system. The goal differences performance metric can not only be used as a tie-breaker but also be used to obtain a quantitative performance of each algorithm. The key novelty of the proposed ranking scheme is that it takes into account the performance of each algorithm considering the magnitude of the achieved performance improvement along with its practical relevance and does not have any distributional assumptions. The proposed ranking scheme is compared to classical hypothesis testing and the analysis of the results shows that the results are comparable and our proposed ranking showcases many additional benefits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michail Mamalakis, H\'elo\"ise de Vareilles, Graham Murray, Pietro Lio, John Suckling</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainability is often critical to the acceptable implementation of artificial intelligence (AI). Nowhere is this more important than healthcare where decision-making directly impacts patients and trust in AI systems is essential. This trust is often built on the explanations and interpretations the AI provides. Despite significant advancements in AI interpretability, there remains the need for clear guidelines on when and to what extent explanations are necessary in the medical context. We propose a novel categorization system with four distinct classes of explanation necessity, guiding the level of explanation required: patient or sample (local) level, cohort or dataset (global) level, or both levels. We introduce a mathematical formulation that distinguishes these categories and offers a practical framework for researchers to determine the necessity and depth of explanations required in medical AI applications. Three key factors are considered: the robustness of the evaluation protocol, the variability of expert observations, and the representation dimensionality of the application. In this perspective, we address the question: When does an AI medical application need to be explained, and at what level of detail?</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Jiang, Yangxinyu Xie, Xiaomeng Wang, Weijie J. Su, Camillo J. Taylor, Tanwi Mallick</p>
<p>Abstract: Rationality is the quality of being guided by reason, characterized by logical thinking and decision-making that align with evidence and logical rules. This quality is essential for effective problem-solving, as it ensures that solutions are well-founded and systematically derived. Despite the advancements of large language models (LLMs) in generating human-like text with remarkable accuracy, they present biases inherited from the training data, inconsistency across different contexts, and difficulty understanding complex scenarios involving multiple layers of context. Therefore, recent research attempts to leverage the strength of multiple agents working collaboratively with various types of data and tools for enhanced consistency and reliability. To that end, this paper aims to understand whether multi-modal and multi-agent systems are advancing toward rationality by surveying the state-of-the-art works, identifying advancements over single-agent and single-modal systems in terms of rationality, and discussing open problems and future directions. We maintain an open repository at https://github.com/bowen-upenn/MMMA_Rationality.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00392">Artificial Generational Intelligence: Cultural Accumulation in Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Cook, Chris Lu, Edward Hughes, Joel Z. Leibo, Jakob Foerster</p>
<p>Abstract: Cultural accumulation drives the open-ended and diverse progress in capabilities spanning human history. It builds an expanding body of knowledge and skills by combining individual exploration with inter-generational information transmission. Despite its widespread success among humans, the capacity for artificial learning agents to accumulate culture remains under-explored. In particular, approaches to reinforcement learning typically strive for improvements over only a single lifetime. Generational algorithms that do exist fail to capture the open-ended, emergent nature of cultural accumulation, which allows individuals to trade-off innovation and imitation. Building on the previously demonstrated ability for reinforcement learning agents to perform social learning, we find that training setups which balance this with independent learning give rise to cultural accumulation. These accumulating agents outperform those trained for a single lifetime with the same cumulative experience. We explore this accumulation by constructing two models under two distinct notions of a generation: episodic generations, in which accumulation occurs via in-context learning and train-time generations, in which accumulation occurs via in-weights learning. In-context and in-weights cultural accumulation can be interpreted as analogous to knowledge and skill accumulation, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to present general models that achieve emergent cultural accumulation in reinforcement learning, opening up new avenues towards more open-ended learning systems, as well as presenting new opportunities for modelling human culture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Wu, Di Wang, Lijie Wen, Yubin Xiao, Chunguo Wu, Yuesong Wu, Chaoyu Yu, Douglas L. Maskell, You Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Although several surveys on Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) solvers specifically designed to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) have been conducted. These existing surveys did not cover the state-of-the-art (SOTA) NCO solvers emerged recently. More importantly, to provide a comprehensive taxonomy of NCO solvers with up-to-date coverage, based on our thorough review of relevant publications and preprints, we divide all NCO solvers into four distinct categories, namely Learning to Construct, Learning to Improve, Learning to Predict-Once, and Learning to Predict-Multiplicity solvers. Subsequently, we present the inadequacies of the SOTA solvers, including poor generalization, incapability to solve large-scale VRPs, inability to address most types of VRP variants simultaneously, and difficulty in comparing these NCO solvers with the conventional Operations Research algorithms. Simultaneously, we propose promising and viable directions to overcome these inadequacies. In addition, we compare the performance of representative NCO solvers from the Reinforcement, Supervised, and Unsupervised Learning paradigms across both small- and large-scale VRPs. Finally, following the proposed taxonomy, we provide an accompanying web page as a live repository for NCO solvers. Through this survey and the live repository, we hope to make the research community of NCO solvers for VRPs more thriving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samita Bai, Sidra Nasir, Rizwan Ahmed Khan, Sheeraz Arif, Alexandre Meyer, Hubert Konik</p>
<p>Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) stands as one of the most common malignancies affecting women worldwide, necessitating advancements in diagnostic methodologies for better clinical outcomes. This article provides a comprehensive exploration of the application of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques in the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies continue to permeate the healthcare sector, particularly in oncology, the need for transparent and interpretable models becomes imperative to enhance clinical decision-making and patient care. This review discusses the integration of various XAI approaches, such as SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM, and others, with machine learning and deep learning models utilized in breast cancer detection and classification. By investigating the modalities of breast cancer datasets, including mammograms, ultrasounds and their processing with AI, the paper highlights how XAI can lead to more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment plans. It also examines the challenges in implementing these techniques and the importance of developing standardized metrics for evaluating XAI's effectiveness in clinical settings. Through detailed analysis and discussion, this article aims to highlight the potential of XAI in bridging the gap between complex AI models and practical healthcare applications, thereby fostering trust and understanding among medical professionals and improving patient outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Valadares Vieira, Mara Abel, Fabricio Henrique Rodrigues, Tiago Prince Sales, Claudenir M. Fonseca</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an ontology of portions of matter with practical implications across scientific and industrial domains. The ontology is developed under the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO), which uses the concept of quantity to represent topologically maximally self-connected portions of matter. The proposed ontology introduces the granuleOf parthood relation, holding between objects and portions of matter. It also discusses the constitution of quantities by collections of granules, the representation of sub-portions of matter, and the tracking of matter provenance between quantities using historical relations. Lastly, a case study is presented to demonstrate the use of the portion of matter ontology in the geology domain for an Oil & Gas industry application. In the case study, we model how to represent the historical relation between an original portion of rock and the sub-portions created during the industrial process. Lastly, future research directions are outlined, including investigating granularity levels and defining a taxonomy of events.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, as machine learning, particularly for vision and language understanding, has been improved, research in embedded AI has also evolved. VOYAGER is a well-known LLM-based embodied AI that enables autonomous exploration in the Minecraft world, but it has issues such as underutilization of visual data and insufficient functionality as a world model. In this research, the possibility of utilizing visual data and the function of LLM as a world model were investigated with the aim of improving the performance of embodied AI. The experimental results revealed that LLM can extract necessary information from visual data, and the utilization of the information improves its performance as a world model. It was also suggested that devised prompts could bring out the LLM's function as a world model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Zhang, Qiang He, Zhou Yuan, Elvis S. Liu, Hong Wang, Jian Zhao, Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents have demonstrated impressive success in a wide range of game genres. However, existing research primarily focuses on optimizing DRL competence rather than addressing the challenge of prolonged player interaction. In this paper, we propose a practical DRL agent system for fighting games named Sh\=ukai, which has been successfully deployed to Naruto Mobile, a popular fighting game with over 100 million registered users. Sh\=ukai quantifies the state to enhance generalizability, introducing Heterogeneous League Training (HELT) to achieve balanced competence, generalizability, and training efficiency. Furthermore, Sh\=ukai implements specific rewards to align the agent's behavior with human expectations. Sh\=ukai's ability to generalize is demonstrated by its consistent competence across all characters, even though it was trained on only 13% of them. Additionally, HELT exhibits a remarkable 22% improvement in sample efficiency. Sh\=ukai serves as a valuable training partner for players in Naruto Mobile, enabling them to enhance their abilities and skills.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pius von D\"aniken, Jan Deriu, Don Tuggener, Mark Cieliebak</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI systems have become ubiquitous for all kinds of modalities, which makes the issue of the evaluation of such models more pressing. One popular approach is preference ratings, where the generated outputs of different systems are shown to evaluators who choose their preferences. In recent years the field shifted towards the development of automated (trained) metrics to assess generated outputs, which can be used to create preference ratings automatically. In this work, we investigate the evaluation of the metrics themselves, which currently rely on measuring the correlation to human judgments or computing sign accuracy scores.
  These measures only assess how well the metric agrees with the human ratings. However, our research shows that this does not tell the whole story. Most metrics exhibit a disagreement with human system assessments which is often skewed in favor of particular text generation systems, exposing a degree of favoritism in automated metrics. This paper introduces a formal definition of favoritism in preference metrics, and derives the Favi-Score, which measures this phenomenon. In particular we show that favoritism is strongly related to errors in final system rankings. Thus, we propose that preference-based metrics ought to be evaluated on both sign accuracy scores and favoritism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Bolander, Alessandro Burigana, Marco Montali</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for epistemic planning based on dynamic epistemic logic (DEL). The novelty is that we limit the depth of reasoning of the planning agent to an upper bound b, meaning that the planning agent can only reason about higher-order knowledge to at most (modal) depth b. The algorithm makes use of a novel type of canonical b-bisimulation contraction guaranteeing unique minimal models with respect to b-bisimulation. We show our depth-bounded planning algorithm to be sound. Additionally, we show it to be complete with respect to planning tasks having a solution within bound b of reasoning depth (and hence the iterative bound-deepening variant is complete in the standard sense). For bound b of reasoning depth, the algorithm is shown to be (b + 1)-EXPTIME complete, and furthermore fixed-parameter tractable in the number of agents and atoms. We present both a tree search and a graph search variant of the algorithm, and we benchmark an implementation of the tree search version against a baseline epistemic planner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinggang Zhang, Keyu Duan, Junnan Dong, Pai Zheng, Xiao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Inductive knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer the missing relation for a set of newly-coming entities that never appeared in the training set. Such a setting is more in line with reality, as real-world KGs are constantly evolving and introducing new knowledge. Recent studies have shown promising results using message passing over subgraphs to embed newly-coming entities for inductive KGC. However, the inductive capability of these methods is usually limited by two key issues. (i) KGC always suffers from data sparsity, and the situation is even exacerbated in inductive KGC where new entities often have few or no connections to the original KG. (ii) Cold-start problem. It is over coarse-grained for accurate KG reasoning to generate representations for new entities by gathering the local information from few neighbors. To this end, we propose a novel iNfOmax RelAtion Network, namely NORAN, for inductive KG completion. It aims to mine latent relation patterns for inductive KG completion. Specifically, by centering on relations, NORAN provides a hyper view towards KG modeling, where the correlations between relations can be naturally captured as entity-independent logical evidence to conduct inductive KGC. Extensive experiment results on five benchmarks show that our framework substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art KGC methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inner Interpretability is a promising emerging field tasked with uncovering the inner mechanisms of AI systems, though how to develop these mechanistic theories is still much debated. Moreover, recent critiques raise issues that question its usefulness to advance the broader goals of AI. However, it has been overlooked that these issues resemble those that have been grappled with in another field: Cognitive Neuroscience. Here we draw the relevant connections and highlight lessons that can be transferred productively between fields. Based on these, we propose a general conceptual framework and give concrete methodological strategies for building mechanistic explanations in AI inner interpretability research. With this conceptual framework, Inner Interpretability can fend off critiques and position itself on a productive path to explain AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel transfer learning framework for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning. The approach automatically combines goal-conditioned policies with temporal contrastive learning to discover meaningful sub-goals. The approach involves pre-training a goal-conditioned agent, finetuning it on the target domain, and using contrastive learning to construct a planning graph that guides the agent via sub-goals. Experiments on multi-agent coordination Overcooked tasks demonstrate improved sample efficiency, the ability to solve sparse-reward and long-horizon problems, and enhanced interpretability compared to baselines. The results highlight the effectiveness of integrating goal-conditioned policies with unsupervised temporal abstraction learning for complex multi-agent transfer learning. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method achieves the same or better performances while requiring only 21.7% of the training samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rhys Howard, Lars Kunze</p>
<p>Abstract: Much work has been done to develop causal reasoning techniques across a number of domains, however the utilisation of causality within autonomous systems is still in its infancy. Autonomous systems would greatly benefit from the integration of causality through the use of representations such as structural causal models (SCMs). The system would be afforded a higher level of transparency, it would enable post-hoc explanations of outcomes, and assist in the online inference of exogenous variables. These qualities are either directly beneficial to the autonomous system or a valuable step in building public trust and informing regulation. To such an end we present a case study in which we describe a module-based autonomous driving system comprised of SCMs. Approaching this task requires considerations of a number of challenges when dealing with a system of great complexity and size, that must operate for extended periods of time by itself. Here we describe these challenges, and present solutions. The first of these is SCM contexts, with the remainder being three new variable categories -- two of which are based upon functional programming monads. Finally, we conclude by presenting an example application of the causal capabilities of the autonomous driving system. In this example, we aim to attribute culpability between vehicular agents in a hypothetical road collision incident.</p>

<p>Abstract: This position paper argues for, and offers, a critical lens through which to examine the current AI frenzy in the landscape architecture profession. In it, the authors propose five archetypes or mental modes that landscape architects might inhabit when thinking about AI. Rather than limiting judgments of AI use to a single axis of acceleration, these archetypes and corresponding narratives exist along a relational spectrum and are permeable, allowing LAs to take on and switch between them according to context. We model these relationships between the archetypes and their contributions to AI advancement using a causal loop diagram (CLD), and with those interactions argue that more nuanced ways of approaching AI might also open new modes of practice in the new digital economy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mudit Chopra, Abhinav Barnawal, Harshil Vagadia, Tamajit Banerjee, Shreshth Tuli, Souvik Chakraborty, Rohan Paul</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the task of positioning a ball-like object to a goal region beyond direct reach, humans can often throw, slide, or rebound objects against the wall to attain the goal. However, enabling robots to reason similarly is non-trivial. Existing methods for physical reasoning are data-hungry and struggle with complexity and uncertainty inherent in the real world. This paper presents PhyPlan, a novel physics-informed planning framework that combines physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enable embodied agents to perform dynamic physical tasks. PhyPlan leverages PINNs to simulate and predict outcomes of actions in a fast and accurate manner and uses MCTS for planning. It dynamically determines whether to consult a PINN-based simulator (coarse but fast) or engage directly with the actual environment (fine but slow) to determine optimal policy. Given an unseen task, PhyPlan can infer the sequence of actions and learn the latent parameters, resulting in a generalizable approach that can rapidly learn to perform novel physical tasks. Evaluation with robots in simulated 3D environments demonstrates the ability of our approach to solve 3D-physical reasoning tasks involving the composition of dynamic skills. Quantitatively, PhyPlan excels in several aspects: (i) it achieves lower regret when learning novel tasks compared to the state-of-the-art, (ii) it expedites skill learning and enhances the speed of physical reasoning, (iii) it demonstrates higher data efficiency compared to a physics un-informed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Li, Guodong Long</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the integration of federated learning (FL) and recommendation systems (RSs), known as Federated Recommendation Systems (FRSs), has attracted attention for preserving user privacy by keeping private data on client devices. However, FRS faces inherent limitations such as data heterogeneity and scarcity, due to the privacy requirements of FL and the typical data sparsity issues of RSs. Foundation models (FMs), such as diffusion models (DMs) and large language models (LLMs), which are widely recognized for producing high-quality content in the image and NLP domains, focus on understanding and mimicking the underlying distribution of the training data. Unlike discriminative models, which learn the boundaries between categories, FMs aim to learn the entire probability distribution of the input data. Thus, the achievements of FMs inspire the design of FRS and suggest a promising research direction: integrating foundation models to address the above limitations. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review of FRSs with FMs. Specifically, we: 1) summarise the common approaches of current FRSs and FMs; 2) review the challenges posed by FRSs and FMs; 3) discuss potential future research directions; and 4) introduce some common benchmarks and evaluation metrics in the FRS field. We hope that this survey provides the necessary background and guidance to explore this interesting and emerging topic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Congbo Ma, Wei Emma Zhang, Hu Wang, Haojie Zhuang, Mingyu Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-document summarization (MDS) generates a summary from a document set. Each document in a set describes topic-relevant concepts, while per document also has its unique contents. However, the document specificity receives little attention from existing MDS approaches. Neglecting specific information for each document limits the comprehensiveness of the generated summaries. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose to disentangle the specific content from documents in one document set. The document-specific representations, which are encouraged to be distant from each other via a proposed orthogonal constraint, are learned by the specific representation learner. We provide extensive analysis and have interesting findings that specific information and document set representations contribute distinctive strengths and their combination yields a more comprehensive solution for the MDS. Also, we find that the common (i.e. shared) information could not contribute much to the overall performance under the MDS settings.

<p>Abstract: This paper describes the KnowledgeHub tool, a scientific literature Information Extraction (IE) and Question Answering (QA) pipeline. This is achieved by supporting the ingestion of PDF documents that are converted to text and structured representations. An ontology can then be constructed where a user defines the types of entities and relationships they want to capture. A browser-based annotation tool enables annotating the contents of the PDF documents according to the ontology. Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Classification (RC) models can be trained on the resulting annotations and can be used to annotate the unannotated portion of the documents. A knowledge graph is constructed from these entity and relation triples which can be queried to obtain insights from the data. Furthermore, we integrate a suite of Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be used for QA and summarisation that is grounded in the included documents via a retrieval component. KnowledgeHub is a unique tool that supports annotation, IE and QA, which gives the user full insight into the knowledge discovery pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kounianhua Du, Jizheng Chen, Jianghao Lin, Yunjia Xi, Hangyu Wang, Xinyi Dai, Bo Chen, Ruiming Tang, Weinan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender systems play important roles in various applications such as e-commerce, social media, etc. Conventional recommendation methods usually model the collaborative signals within the tabular representation space. Despite the personalization modeling and the efficiency, the latent semantic dependencies are omitted. Methods that introduce semantics into recommendation then emerge, injecting knowledge from the semantic representation space where the general language understanding are compressed. However, existing semantic-enhanced recommendation methods focus on aligning the two spaces, during which the representations of the two spaces tend to get close while the unique patterns are discarded and not well explored. In this paper, we propose DisCo to Disentangle the unique patterns from the two representation spaces and Collaborate the two spaces for recommendation enhancement, where both the specificity and the consistency of the two spaces are captured. Concretely, we propose 1) a dual-side attentive network to capture the intra-domain patterns and the inter-domain patterns, 2) a sufficiency constraint to preserve the task-relevant information of each representation space and filter out the noise, and 3) a disentanglement constraint to avoid the model from discarding the unique information. These modules strike a balance between disentanglement and collaboration of the two representation spaces to produce informative pattern vectors, which could serve as extra features and be appended to arbitrary recommendation backbones for enhancement. Experiment results validate the superiority of our method against different models and the compatibility of DisCo over different backbones. Various ablation studies and efficiency analysis are also conducted to justify each model component.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kounianhua Du, Jizheng Chen, Jianghao Lin, Menghui Zhu, Bo Chen, Shuai Li, Ruiming Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender models play a vital role in various industrial scenarios, while often faced with the catastrophic forgetting problem caused by the fast shifting data distribution, e.g., the evolving user interests, click signals fluctuation during sales promotions, etc. To alleviate this problem, a common approach is to reuse knowledge from the historical data. However, preserving the vast and fast-accumulating data is hard, which causes dramatic storage overhead. Memorizing old data through a parametric knowledge base is then proposed, which compresses the vast amount of raw data into model parameters. Despite the flexibility, how to improve the memorization and generalization capabilities of the parametric knowledge base is challenging. In this paper, we propose two constraints to extract Essential and Disentangled Knowledge from past data for rational and generalized recommendation enhancement, which improves the capabilities of the parametric knowledge base without increasing the size of it. The essential principle helps to compress the input into representative vectors that capture the task-relevant information and filter out the noisy information. The disentanglement principle reduces the redundancy of stored information and pushes the knowledge base to focus on capturing the disentangled invariant patterns. These two rules together promote rational compression of information for robust and generalized knowledge representations. Extensive experiments on two datasets justify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jayaprakash Sundararaj</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic summarization is the process of reducing a text document in order to generate a summary that retains the most important points of the original document. In this work, we study two problems - i) summarizing a text document as set of keywords/caption, for image recommedation, ii) generating opinion summary which good mix of relevancy and sentiment with the text document. Intially, we present our work on an recommending images for enhancing a substantial amount of existing plain text news articles. We use probabilistic models and word similarity heuristics to generate captions and extract Key-phrases which are re-ranked using a rank aggregation framework with relevance feedback mechanism. We show that such rank aggregation and relevant feedback which are typically used in Tagging Documents, Text Information Retrieval also helps in improving image retrieval. These queries are fed to the Yahoo Search Engine to obtain relevant images 1. Our proposed method is observed to perform better than all existing baselines. Additonally, We propose a set of submodular functions for opinion summarization. Opinion summarization has built in it the tasks of summarization and sentiment detection. However, it is not easy to detect sentiment and simultaneously extract summary. The two tasks conflict in the sense that the demand of compression may drop sentiment bearing sentences, and the demand of sentiment detection may bring in redundant sentences. However, using submodularity we show how to strike a balance between the two requirements. Our functions generate summaries such that there is good correlation between document sentiment and summary sentiment along with good ROUGE score. We also compare the performances of the proposed submodular functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hajung Kim, Chanhwi Kim, Hoonick Lee, Kyochul Jang, Jiwoo Lee, Kyungjae Lee, Gangwoo Kim, Jaewoo Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Transforming natural language questions into SQL queries is crucial for precise data retrieval from electronic health record (EHR) databases. A significant challenge in this process is detecting and rejecting unanswerable questions that request information beyond the database's scope or exceed the system's capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel text-to-SQL framework that robustly handles out-of-domain questions and verifies the generated queries with query execution.Our framework begins by standardizing the structure of questions into a templated format. We use a powerful large language model (LLM), fine-tuned GPT-3.5 with detailed prompts involving the table schemas of the EHR database system. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on the EHRSQL-2024 benchmark benchmark, a shared task in the ClinicalNLP workshop. Although a straightforward fine-tuning of GPT shows promising results on the development set, it struggled with the out-of-domain questions in the test set. With our framework, we improve our system's adaptability and achieve competitive performances in the official leaderboard of the EHRSQL-2024 challenge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shezheng Song, Shasha Li, Shan Zhao, Chengyu Wang, Xiaopeng Li, Jie Yu, Qian Wan, Jun Ma, Tianwei Yan, Wentao Ma, Xiaoguang Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA) aims to understand opinions in a granular manner, advancing human-computer interaction and other fields. Traditionally, MABSA methods use a joint prediction approach to identify aspects and sentiments simultaneously. However, we argue that joint models are not always superior. Our analysis shows that joint models struggle to align relevant text tokens with image patches, leading to misalignment and ineffective image utilization.
  In contrast, a pipeline framework first identifies aspects through MATE (Multimodal Aspect Term Extraction) and then aligns these aspects with image patches for sentiment classification (MASC: Multimodal Aspect-Oriented Sentiment Classification). This method is better suited for multimodal scenarios where effective image use is crucial. We present three key observations: (a) MATE and MASC have different feature requirements, with MATE focusing on token-level features and MASC on sequence-level features; (b) the aspect identified by MATE is crucial for effective image utilization; and (c) images play a trivial role in previous MABSA methods due to high noise.
  Based on these observations, we propose a pipeline framework that first predicts the aspect and then uses translation-based alignment (TBA) to enhance multimodal semantic consistency for better image utilization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on widely used MABSA datasets Twitter-15 and Twitter-17. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the pipeline approach and its potential to provide valuable insights for future MABSA research.
  For reproducibility, the code and checkpoint will be released.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce EHR-SeqSQL, a novel sequential text-to-SQL dataset for Electronic Health Record (EHR) databases. EHR-SeqSQL is designed to address critical yet underexplored aspects in text-to-SQL parsing: interactivity, compositionality, and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, EHR-SeqSQL is not only the largest but also the first medical text-to-SQL dataset benchmark to include sequential and contextual questions. We provide a data split and the new test set designed to assess compositional generalization ability. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of a multi-turn approach over a single-turn approach in learning compositionality. Additionally, our dataset integrates specially crafted tokens into SQL queries to improve execution efficiency. With EHR-SeqSQL, we aim to bridge the gap between practical needs and academic research in the text-to-SQL domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for training large language models (LLMs) to adhere to objectives defined within a latent embedding space. Our method leverages reinforcement learning (RL), treating a pre-trained LLM as an environment. Our embedding-aligned guided language (EAGLE) agent is trained to iteratively steer the LLM's generation towards optimal regions of the latent embedding space, w.r.t. some predefined criterion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the EAGLE agent using the MovieLens 25M dataset to surface content gaps that satisfy latent user demand. We also demonstrate the benefit of using an optimal design of a state-dependent action set to improve EAGLE's efficiency. Our work paves the way for controlled and grounded text generation using LLMs, ensuring consistency with domain-specific knowledge and data representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular, transforming a wide range of applications across various domains. However, the real-world effectiveness of their query cache systems has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we for the first time conducted an analysis on real-world human-to-LLM interaction data, identifying key challenges in existing caching solutions for LLM-based chat services. Our findings reveal that current caching methods fail to leverage semantic connections, leading to inefficient cache performance and extra token costs. To address these issues, we propose SCALM, a new cache architecture that emphasizes semantic analysis and identifies significant cache entries and patterns. We also detail the implementations of the corresponding cache storage and eviction strategies. Our evaluations show that SCALM increases cache hit ratios and reduces operational costs for LLMChat services. Compared with other state-of-the-art solutions in GPTCache, SCALM shows, on average, a relative increase of 63% in cache hit ratio and a relative improvement of 77% in tokens savings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Akesson, Frances A. Santos</p>
<p>Abstract: Providing external knowledge to Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key point for using these models in real-world applications for several reasons, such as incorporating up-to-date content in a real-time manner, providing access to domain-specific knowledge, and contributing to hallucination prevention. The vector database-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach has been widely adopted to this end. Thus, any part of external knowledge can be retrieved and provided to some LLM as the input context. Despite RAG approach's success, it still might be unfeasible for some applications, because the context retrieved can demand a longer context window than the size supported by LLM. Even when the context retrieved fits into the context window size, the number of tokens might be expressive and, consequently, impact costs and processing time, becoming impractical for most applications. To address these, we propose CRAG, a novel approach able to effectively reduce the number of prompting tokens without degrading the quality of the response generated compared to a solution using RAG. Through our experiments, we show that CRAG can reduce the number of tokens by at least 46\%, achieving more than 90\% in some cases, compared to RAG. Moreover, the number of tokens with CRAG does not increase considerably when the number of reviews analyzed is higher, unlike RAG, where the number of tokens is almost 9x higher when there are 75 reviews compared to 4 reviews.</p>

<p>Abstract: We surely enjoy the larger the better models for their superior performance in the last couple of years when both the hardware and software support the birth of such extremely huge models. The applied fields include text mining and others. In particular, the success of LLMs on text understanding and text generation draws attention from researchers who have worked on NLP and related areas for years or even decades. On the side, LLMs may suffer from problems like model overfitting, hallucination, and device limitation to name a few. In this work, we suggest a model pruning technique specifically focused on LLMs. The proposed methodology emphasizes the explainability of deep learning models. By having the theoretical foundation, we obtain a trustworthy deep model so that huge models with a massive number of model parameters become not quite necessary. A mutual information-based estimation is adopted to find neurons with redundancy to eliminate. Moreover, an estimator with well-tuned parameters helps to find precise estimation to guide the pruning procedure. At the same time, we also explore the difference between pruning on large-scale models vs. pruning on small-scale models. The choice of pruning criteria is sensitive in small models but not for large-scale models. It is a novel finding through this work. Overall, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model to the state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Notable people's life trajectories have been a focus of study -- the locations and times of various activities, such as birth, death, education, marriage, competition, work, delivering a speech, making a scientific discovery, finishing a masterpiece, and fighting a battle, and how these people interact with others, carry important messages for the broad research related to human dynamics. However, the scarcity of trajectory data in terms of volume, density, and inter-person interactions, limits relevant studies from being comprehensive and interactive. We mine millions of biography pages from Wikipedia and tackle the generalization problem stemming from the variety and heterogeneity of the trajectory descriptions. Our ensemble model COSMOS, which combines the idea of semi-supervised learning and contrastive learning, achieves an F1 score of 85.95%. For this task, we also create a hand-curated dataset, WikiLifeTrajectory, consisting of 8,852 (person, time, location) triplets as ground truth. Besides, we perform an empirical analysis on the trajectories of 8,272 historians to demonstrate the validity of the extracted results. To facilitate the research on trajectory extractions and help the analytical studies to construct grand narratives, we make our code, the million-level extracted trajectories, and the WikiLifeTrajectory dataset publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Kemper, Justin Cui, Kai Dicarlantonio, Kathy Lin, Danjie Tang, Anton Korikov, Scott Sanner</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational recommendation (ConvRec) systems must understand rich and diverse natural language (NL) expressions of user preferences and intents, often communicated in an indirect manner (e.g., "I'm watching my weight"). Such complex utterances make retrieving relevant items challenging, especially if only using often incomplete or out-of-date metadata. Fortunately, many domains feature rich item reviews that cover standard metadata categories and offer complex opinions that might match a user's interests (e.g., "classy joint for a date"). However, only recently have large language models (LLMs) let us unlock the commonsense connections between user preference utterances and complex language in user-generated reviews. Further, LLMs enable novel paradigms for semi-structured dialogue state tracking, complex intent and preference understanding, and generating recommendations, explanations, and question answers. We thus introduce a novel technology RA-Rec, a Retrieval-Augmented, LLM-driven dialogue state tracking system for ConvRec, showcased with a video, open source GitHub repository, and interactive Google Colab notebook.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent studies have indicated that Large Language Models (LLMs) harbor an inherent understanding of truthfulness, yet often fail to express fully and generate false statements. This gap between "knowing" and "telling" poses a challenge for ensuring the truthfulness of generated content. To address this, we introduce Adaptive Activation Steering (ACT), a tuning-free method that adaptively shift LLM's activations in "truthful" direction during inference. ACT addresses diverse categories of hallucinations by utilizing diverse steering vectors and adjusting the steering intensity adaptively. Applied as an add-on across various models, ACT significantly improves truthfulness in LLaMA ($\uparrow$ 142\%), LLaMA2 ($\uparrow$ 24\%), Alpaca ($\uparrow$ 36\%), Vicuna ($\uparrow$ 28\%), and LLaMA2-Chat ($\uparrow$ 19\%). Furthermore, we verify ACT's scalability across larger models (13B, 33B, 65B), underscoring the adaptability of ACT to large-scale language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of multimodal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data has notably advanced clinical predictive capabilities. However, current models that utilize clinical notes and multivariate time-series EHR data often lack the necessary medical context for precise clinical tasks. Previous methods using knowledge graphs (KGs) primarily focus on structured knowledge extraction. To address this, we propose EMERGE, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) driven framework aimed at enhancing multimodal EHR predictive modeling. Our approach extracts entities from both time-series data and clinical notes by prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) and aligns them with professional PrimeKG to ensure consistency. Beyond triplet relationships, we include entities' definitions and descriptions to provide richer semantics. The extracted knowledge is then used to generate task-relevant summaries of patients' health statuses. These summaries are fused with other modalities utilizing an adaptive multimodal fusion network with cross-attention. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets for in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the EMERGE framework compared to baseline models. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses underscore the efficacy of each designed module and the framework's robustness to data sparsity. EMERGE significantly enhances the use of multimodal EHR data in healthcare, bridging the gap with nuanced medical contexts crucial for informed clinical predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyu Yang, Liyang He, Min Hou, Shuanghong Shen, Rui Li, Jiahui Hou, Jianhui Ma, Junda Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Code Community Question Answering (CCQA) seeks to tackle programming-related issues, thereby boosting productivity in both software engineering and academic research. Recent advancements in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have transformed the fine-tuning process of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce responses that closely mimic human behavior. Leveraging LLMs with RLHF for practical CCQA applications has thus emerged as a promising area of study. Unlike standard code question-answering tasks, CCQA involves multiple possible answers, with varying user preferences for each response. Additionally, code communities often show a preference for new APIs. These challenges prevent LLMs from generating responses that cater to the diverse preferences of users in CCQA tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Aligning LLMs through Multi-perspective User Preference Ranking-based Feedback for Programming Question Answering (ALMupQA) to create user-focused responses. Our approach starts with Multi-perspective Preference Ranking Alignment (MPRA), which synthesizes varied user preferences based on the characteristics of answers from code communities. We then introduce a Retrieval-augmented In-context Learning (RIL) module to mitigate the problem of outdated answers by retrieving responses to similar questions from a question bank. Due to the limited availability of high-quality, multi-answer CCQA datasets, we also developed a dataset named StaCCQA from real code communities. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the ALMupQA framework in terms of accuracy and user preference. Compared to the base model, ALMupQA showed nearly an 11% improvement in BLEU, with increases of 20% and 17.5% in BERTScore and CodeBERTScore, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Liu, Pinxin Liu, Hangfeng He</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we investigate the capabilities and inherent biases of advanced large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in the context of debate evaluation. We discover that LLM's performance exceeds humans and surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods fine-tuned on extensive datasets in debate evaluation. We additionally explore and analyze biases present in LLMs, including positional bias, lexical bias, order bias, which may affect their evaluative judgments. Our findings reveal a consistent bias in both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 towards the second candidate response presented, attributed to prompt design. We also uncover lexical biases in both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, especially when label sets carry connotations such as numerical or sequential, highlighting the critical need for careful label verbalizer selection in prompt design. Additionally, our analysis indicates a tendency of both models to favor the debate's concluding side as the winner, suggesting an end-of-discussion bias.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Megan Flynn, Alexander Wang, Dean Edward Alvarez, Christopher De Sa, Anil Damle</p>
<p>Abstract: We present STAT: a simple algorithm to prune transformer models without any fine-tuning. STAT eliminates both attention heads and neurons from the network, while preserving accuracy by calculating a correction to the weights of the next layer. Each layer block in the network is compressed using a series of principled matrix factorizations that preserve the network structure. Our entire algorithm takes minutes to compress BERT, and less than three hours to compress models with 7B parameters using a single GPU. Using only several hundred data examples, STAT preserves the output of the network and improves upon existing gradient-free pruning methods. It is even competitive with methods that include significant fine-tuning. We demonstrate our method on both encoder and decoder architectures, including BERT, DistilBERT, and Llama-2 using benchmarks such as GLUE, Squad, WikiText2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Pissarra, Isabel Curioso, Jo\~ao Alveira, Duarte Pereira, Bruno Ribeiro, Tom\'as Souper, Vasco Gomes, Andr\'e V. Carreiro, Vitor Rolla</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated clinical text anonymization has the potential to unlock the widespread sharing of textual health data for secondary usage while assuring patient privacy and safety. Despite the proposal of many complex and theoretically successful anonymization solutions in literature, these techniques remain flawed. As such, clinical institutions are still reluctant to apply them for open access to their data. Recent advances in developing Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a promising opportunity to further the field, given their capability to perform various tasks. This paper proposes six new evaluation metrics tailored to the challenges of generative anonymization with LLMs. Moreover, we present a comparative study of LLM-based methods, testing them against two baseline techniques. Our results establish LLM-based models as a reliable alternative to common approaches, paving the way toward trustworthy anonymization of clinical text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Xue, Mengxin Zheng, Yebowen Hu, Fei Liu, Xun Chen, Qian Lou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are constrained by outdated information and a tendency to generate incorrect data, commonly referred to as "hallucinations." Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses these limitations by combining the strengths of retrieval-based methods and generative models. This approach involves retrieving relevant information from a large, up-to-date dataset and using it to enhance the generation process, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate responses. Despite its benefits, RAG introduces a new attack surface for LLMs, particularly because RAG databases are often sourced from public data, such as the web. In this paper, we propose \TrojRAG{} to identify the vulnerabilities and attacks on retrieval parts (RAG database) and their indirect attacks on generative parts (LLMs). Specifically, we identify that poisoning several customized content passages could achieve a retrieval backdoor, where the retrieval works well for clean queries but always returns customized poisoned adversarial queries. Triggers and poisoned passages can be highly customized to implement various attacks. For example, a trigger could be a semantic group like "The Republican Party, Donald Trump, etc." Adversarial passages can be tailored to different contents, not only linked to the triggers but also used to indirectly attack generative LLMs without modifying them. These attacks can include denial-of-service attacks on RAG and semantic steering attacks on LLM generations conditioned by the triggers. Our experiments demonstrate that by just poisoning 10 adversarial passages can induce 98.2\% success rate to retrieve the adversarial passages. Then, these passages can increase the reject ratio of RAG-based GPT-4 from 0.01\% to 74.6\% or increase the rate of negative responses from 0.22\% to 72\% for targeted queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyi Sun, Tong Wu, Pan Zhang, Yuhang Zang, Xiaoyi Dong, Yuanjun Xiong, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in multi-view diffusion models for 3D content creation. However, there remains a significant gap in image quality and prompt-following ability compared to 2D diffusion models. A critical bottleneck is the scarcity of high-quality 3D assets with detailed captions. To address this challenge, we propose Bootstrap3D, a novel framework that automatically generates an arbitrary quantity of multi-view images to assist in training multi-view diffusion models. Specifically, we introduce a data generation pipeline that employs (1) 2D and video diffusion models to generate multi-view images based on constructed text prompts, and (2) our fine-tuned 3D-aware MV-LLaVA for filtering high-quality data and rewriting inaccurate captions. Leveraging this pipeline, we have generated 1 million high-quality synthetic multi-view images with dense descriptive captions to address the shortage of high-quality 3D data. Furthermore, we present a Training Timestep Reschedule (TTR) strategy that leverages the denoising process to learn multi-view consistency while maintaining the original 2D diffusion prior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Bootstrap3D can generate high-quality multi-view images with superior aesthetic quality, image-text alignment, and maintained view consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew C. Li, Zizhao Chen, Toryn Q. Klassen, Pashootan Vaezipoor, Rodrigo Toro Icarte, Sheila A. McIlraith</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward Machines provide an automata-inspired structure for specifying instructions, safety constraints, and other temporally extended reward-worthy behaviour. By exposing complex reward function structure, they enable counterfactual learning updates that have resulted in impressive sample efficiency gains. While Reward Machines have been employed in both tabular and deep RL settings, they have typically relied on a ground-truth interpretation of the domain-specific vocabulary that form the building blocks of the reward function. Such ground-truth interpretations can be elusive in many real-world settings, due in part to partial observability or noisy sensing. In this paper, we explore the use of Reward Machines for Deep RL in noisy and uncertain environments. We characterize this problem as a POMDP and propose a suite of RL algorithms that leverage task structure under uncertain interpretation of domain-specific vocabulary. Theoretical analysis exposes pitfalls in naive approaches to this problem, while experimental results show that our algorithms successfully leverage task structure to improve performance under noisy interpretations of the vocabulary. Our results provide a general framework for exploiting Reward Machines in partially observable environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predicting the spatiotemporal variation in streamflow along with uncertainty quantification enables decision-making for sustainable management of scarce water resources. Process-based hydrological models (aka physics-based models) are based on physical laws, but using simplifying assumptions which can lead to poor accuracy. Data-driven approaches offer a powerful alternative, but they require large amount of training data and tend to produce predictions that are inconsistent with physical laws. This paper studies a constrained reasoning and learning (CRL) approach where physical laws represented as logical constraints are integrated as a layer in the deep neural network. To address small data setting, we develop a theoretically-grounded training approach to improve the generalization accuracy of deep models. For uncertainty quantification, we combine the synergistic strengths of Gaussian processes (GPs) and deep temporal models (i.e., deep models for time-series forecasting) by passing the learned latent representation as input to a standard distance-based kernel. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of both CRL and GP with deep kernel approaches over strong baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Biometric identification is a reliable method to verify individuals based on their unique physical or behavioral traits, offering a secure alternative to traditional methods like passwords or PINs. This study focuses on ear biometric identification, exploiting its distinctive features for enhanced accuracy, reliability, and usability. While past studies typically investigate face recognition and fingerprint analysis, our research demonstrates the effectiveness of ear biometrics in overcoming limitations such as variations in facial expressions and lighting conditions. We utilized two datasets: AMI (700 images from 100 individuals) and EarNV1.0 (28,412 images from 164 individuals). To improve the accuracy and robustness of our ear biometric identification system, we applied various techniques including data preprocessing and augmentation. Our models achieved a testing accuracy of 99.35% on the AMI Dataset and 98.1% on the EarNV1.0 dataset, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach in precisely identifying individuals based on ear biometric characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshay Badagabettu, Sai Sravan Yarlagadda, Amir Barati Farimani</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer Aided Design (CAD) engineers typically do not achieve their best prototypes in a single attempt. Instead, they iterate and refine their designs to achieve an optimal solution through multiple revisions. This traditional approach, though effective, is time-consuming and relies heavily on the expertise of skilled engineers. To address these challenges, we introduce Query2CAD, a novel framework to generate CAD designs. The framework uses a large language model to generate executable CAD macros. Additionally, Query2CAD refines the generation of the CAD model with the help of its self-refinement loops. Query2CAD operates without supervised data or additional training, using the LLM as both a generator and a refiner. The refiner leverages feedback generated by the BLIP2 model, and to address false negatives, we have incorporated human-in-the-loop feedback into our system. Additionally, we have developed a dataset that encompasses most operations used in CAD model designing and have evaluated our framework using this dataset. Our findings reveal that when we used GPT-4 Turbo as our language model, the architecture achieved a success rate of 53.6\% on the first attempt. With subsequent refinements, the success rate increased by 23.1\%. In particular, the most significant improvement in the success rate was observed with the first iteration of the refinement. With subsequent refinements, the accuracy of the correct designs did not improve significantly. We have open-sourced our data, model, and code (github.com/akshay140601/Query2CAD).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali ArjomandBigdeli, Andrew Mata, Stanley Bak</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural network controllers are currently being proposed for use in many safety-critical tasks. Most analysis methods for neural network control systems assume a fixed control period. In control theory, higher frequency usually improves performance. However, for current analysis methods, increasing the frequency complicates verification. In the limit, when actuation is performed continuously, no existing neural network control systems verification methods are able to analyze the system. In this work, we develop the first verification method for continuously-actuated neural network control systems. We accomplish this by adding a level of abstraction to model the neural network controller. The abstraction is a piecewise linear model with added noise to account for local linearization error. The soundness of the abstraction can be checked using open-loop neural network verification tools, although we demonstrate bottlenecks in existing tools when handling the required specifications. We demonstrate the approach's efficacy by applying it to a vision-based autonomous airplane taxiing system and compare with a fixed frequency analysis baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huixin Zhan, Zijun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical variant classification of pathogenic versus benign genetic variants remains a challenge in clinical genetics. Recently, the proposition of genomic foundation models has improved the generic variant effect prediction (VEP) accuracy via weakly-supervised or unsupervised training. However, these VEPs are not disease-specific, limiting their adaptation at the point of care. To address this problem, we propose DYNA: Disease-specificity fine-tuning via a Siamese neural network broadly applicable to all genomic foundation models for more effective variant effect predictions in disease-specific contexts. We evaluate DYNA in two distinct disease-relevant tasks. For coding VEPs, we focus on various cardiovascular diseases, where gene-disease relationships of loss-of-function vs. gain-of-function dictate disease-specific VEP. For non-coding VEPs, we apply DYNA to an essential post-transcriptional regulatory axis of RNA splicing, the most common non-coding pathogenic mechanism in established clinical VEP guidelines. In both cases, DYNA fine-tunes various pre-trained genomic foundation models on small, rare variant sets. The DYNA fine-tuned models show superior performance in the held-out rare variant testing set and are further replicated in large, clinically-relevant variant annotations in ClinVAR. Thus, DYNA offers a potent disease-specific variant effect prediction method, excelling in intra-gene generalization and generalization to unseen genetic variants, making it particularly valuable for disease associations and clinical applicability.</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore the use of long-context capabilities in large language models to create synthetic reading comprehension data from entire books. Previous efforts to construct such datasets relied on crowd-sourcing, but the emergence of transformers with a context size of 1 million or more tokens now enables entirely automatic approaches. Our objective is to test the capabilities of LLMs to analyze, understand, and reason over problems that require a detailed comprehension of long spans of text, such as questions involving character arcs, broader themes, or the consequences of early actions later in the story. We propose a holistic pipeline for automatic data generation including question generation, answering, and model scoring using an ``Evaluator''. We find that a relative approach, comparing answers between models in a pairwise fashion and ranking with a Bradley-Terry model, provides a more consistent and differentiating scoring mechanism than an absolute scorer that rates answers individually. We also show that LLMs from different model families produce moderate agreement in their ratings. We ground our approach using the manually curated NarrativeQA dataset, where our evaluator shows excellent agreement with human judgement and even finds errors in the dataset. Using our automatic evaluation approach, we show that using an entire book as context produces superior reading comprehension performance compared to baseline no-context (parametric knowledge only) and retrieval-based approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: While AI-generated content has garnered significant attention, achieving photo-realistic video synthesis remains a formidable challenge. Despite the promising advances in diffusion models for video generation quality, the complex model architecture and substantial computational demands for both training and inference create a significant gap between these models and real-world applications. This paper presents SNED, a superposition network architecture search method for efficient video diffusion model. Our method employs a supernet training paradigm that targets various model cost and resolution options using a weight-sharing method. Moreover, we propose the supernet training sampling warm-up for fast training optimization. To showcase the flexibility of our method, we conduct experiments involving both pixel-space and latent-space video diffusion models. The results demonstrate that our framework consistently produces comparable results across different model options with high efficiency. According to the experiment for the pixel-space video diffusion model, we can achieve consistent video generation results simultaneously across 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 resolutions with a large range of model sizes from 640M to 1.6B number of parameters for pixel-space video diffusion models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) aligned through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) have quickly become one of the dominant paradigms for building intelligent conversational assistant agents. However, despite their strong performance across many benchmarks, LLM-based agents still lack conversational skills such as disambiguation: when generalized assistants are faced with ambiguity, they often overhedge or implicitly guess users' ground-truth intents rather than asking clarification questions, and under task-specific settings, high-quality conversation samples are often limited, affecting models' ability to learn optimal dialogue action policies. We propose Action-Based Contrastive Self-Training (henceforth ACT), a quasi-online preference optimization algorithm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) which allows for sample-efficient dialogue policy learning in multi-turn conversation. We demonstrate ACT's efficacy under sample-efficient conditions in three difficult conversational tasks: tabular-grounded question-answering, machine reading comprehension, and AmbigSQL, a novel task for disambiguating information-seeking requests for text-to-SQL generation. Additionally, we propose evaluating LLMs' ability to function as conversational agents by examining whether they can implicitly recognize and reason about ambiguity in conversation. ACT demonstrates substantial conversation modeling improvements over standard approaches to supervised fine-tuning and DPO.</p>

A common approach is to sort the ranking list by prompting LLMs for pairwise comparison. However, sorting-based methods require consistent comparisons to correctly sort the passages, which we show that LLMs often violate. We identify two kinds of intrinsic inconsistency in LLM-based pairwise comparisons: order inconsistency which leads to conflicting results when switching the passage order, and transitive inconsistency which leads to non-transitive triads among all preference pairs. In this paper, we propose LLM-RankFusion, an LLM-based ranking framework that mitigates these inconsistencies and produces a robust ranking list. LLM-RankFusion mitigates order inconsistency using in-context learning (ICL) to demonstrate order-agnostic comparisons and calibration to estimate the underlying preference probability between two passages. We then address transitive inconsistency by aggregating the ranking results from multiple rankers. In our experiments, we empirically show that LLM-RankFusion can significantly reduce inconsistent pairwise comparison results, and improve the ranking quality by making the final ranking list more robust.</p>

<p>Abstract: High relevance of retrieved and re-ranked items to the search query is the cornerstone of successful product search, yet measuring relevance of items to queries is one of the most challenging tasks in product information retrieval, and quality of product search is highly influenced by the precision and scale of available relevance-labelled data. In this paper, we present an array of techniques for leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating the relevance judgment of query-item pairs (QIPs) at scale. Using a unique dataset of multi-million QIPs, annotated by human evaluators, we test and optimize hyper parameters for finetuning billion-parameter LLMs with and without Low Rank Adaption (LoRA), as well as various modes of item attribute concatenation and prompting in LLM finetuning, and consider trade offs in item attribute inclusion for quality of relevance predictions. We demonstrate considerable improvement over baselines of prior generations of LLMs, as well as off-the-shelf models, towards relevance annotations on par with the human relevance evaluators. Our findings have immediate implications for the growing field of relevance judgment automation in product search.</p>

<p>Abstract: Videos carry rich visual information including object description, action, interaction, etc., but the existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) fell short in referential understanding scenarios such as video-based referring. In this paper, we present Artemis, an MLLM that pushes video-based referential understanding to a finer level. Given a video, Artemis receives a natural-language question with a bounding box in any video frame and describes the referred target in the entire video. The key to achieving this goal lies in extracting compact, target-specific video features, where we set a solid baseline by tracking and selecting spatiotemporal features from the video. We train Artemis on the newly established VideoRef45K dataset with 45K video-QA pairs and design a computationally efficient, three-stage training procedure. Results are promising both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally, we show that \model can be integrated with video grounding and text summarization tools to understand more complex scenarios.

<p>Abstract: Invariant-based Contrastive Learning (ICL) methods have achieved impressive performance across various domains. However, the absence of latent space representation for distortion (augmentation)-related information in the latent space makes ICL sub-optimal regarding training efficiency and robustness in downstream tasks. Recent studies suggest that introducing equivariance into Contrastive Learning (CL) can improve overall performance. In this paper, we rethink the roles of augmentation strategies and equivariance in improving CL efficacy. We propose a novel Equivariant-based Contrastive Learning (ECL) framework, CLeVER (Contrastive Learning Via Equivariant Representation), compatible with augmentation strategies of arbitrary complexity for various mainstream CL methods and model frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate that CLeVER effectively extracts and incorporates equivariant information from data, thereby improving the training efficiency and robustness of baseline models in downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Manufacturing complexities and uncertainties have impeded the transition from material prototypes to commercial batteries, making prototype verification critical to quality assessment. A fundamental challenge involves deciphering intertwined chemical processes to characterize degradation patterns and their quantitative relationship with battery performance. Here we show that a physics-informed machine learning approach can quantify and visualize temporally resolved losses concerning thermodynamics and kinetics only using electric signals. Our method enables non-destructive degradation pattern characterization, expediting temperature-adaptable predictions of entire lifetime trajectories, rather than end-of-life points. The verification speed is 25 times faster yet maintaining 95.1% accuracy across temperatures. Such advances facilitate more sustainable management of defective prototypes before massive production, establishing a 19.76 billion USD scrap material recycling market by 2060 in China. By incorporating stepwise charge acceptance as a measure of the initial manufacturing variability of normally identical batteries, we can immediately identify long-term degradation variations. We attribute the predictive power to interpreting machine learning insights using material-agnostic featurization taxonomy for degradation pattern decoupling. Our findings offer new possibilities for dynamic system analysis, such as battery prototype degradation, demonstrating that complex pattern evolutions can be accurately predicted in a non-destructive and data-driven fashion by integrating physics-informed machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jintai Chen, Zhen Lin, Qiyuan Chen, Jimeng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular data from different tables exhibit significant diversity due to varied definitions and types of features, as well as complex inter-feature and feature-target relationships. Cross-dataset pretraining, which learns reusable patterns from upstream data to support downstream tasks, have shown notable success in various fields. Yet, when applied to tabular data prediction, this paradigm faces challenges due to the limited reusable patterns among diverse tabular datasets (tables) and the general scarcity of tabular data available for fine-tuning. In this study, we fill this gap by introducing a cross-table pretrained Transformer, XTFormer, for versatile downstream tabular prediction tasks. Our methodology insight is pretraining XTFormer to establish a "meta-function" space that encompasses all potential feature-target mappings. In pre-training, a variety of potential mappings are extracted from pre-training tabular datasets and are embedded into the "meta-function" space, and suited mappings are extracted from the "meta-function" space for downstream tasks by a specified coordinate positioning approach. Experiments show that, in 190 downstream tabular prediction tasks, our cross-table pretrained XTFormer wins both XGBoost and Catboost on 137 (72%) tasks, and surpasses representative deep learning models FT-Transformer and the tabular pre-training approach XTab on 144 (76%) and 162 (85%) tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale palmprint databases poses a significant bottleneck to advancements in contactless palmprint recognition. To address this, researchers have turned to synthetic data generation. While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely used, they suffer from instability and mode collapse. Recently, diffusion probabilistic models have emerged as a promising alternative, offering stable training and better distribution coverage. This paper introduces a novel palmprint generation method using diffusion probabilistic models, develops an end-to-end framework for synthesizing multiple palm identities, and validates the realism and utility of the generated palmprints. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating palmprint images which enhance contactless palmprint recognition performance across several test databases utilizing challenging cross-database and time-separated evaluation protocols.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyang Zhao, Linnan Wang, Tian Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying deep learning models requires taking into consideration neural network metrics such as model size, inference latency, and #FLOPs, aside from inference accuracy. This results in deep learning model designers leveraging multi-objective optimization to design effective deep neural networks in multiple criteria. However, applying multi-objective optimizations to neural architecture search (NAS) is nontrivial because NAS tasks usually have a huge search space, along with a non-negligible searching cost. This requires effective multi-objective search algorithms to alleviate the GPU costs. In this work, we implement a novel multi-objectives optimizer based on a recently proposed meta-algorithm called LaMOO on NAS tasks. In a nutshell, LaMOO speedups the search process by learning a model from observed samples to partition the search space and then focusing on promising regions likely to contain a subset of the Pareto frontier. Using LaMOO, we observe an improvement of more than 200% sample efficiency compared to Bayesian optimization and evolutionary-based multi-objective optimizers on different NAS datasets. For example, when combined with LaMOO, qEHVI achieves a 225% improvement in sample efficiency compared to using qEHVI alone in NasBench201. For real-world tasks, LaMOO achieves 97.36% accuracy with only 1.62M #Params on CIFAR10 in only 600 search samples. On ImageNet, our large model reaches 80.4% top-1 accuracy with only 522M #FLOPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangwon Ryu, Heejin Do, Yunsu Kim, Gary Geunbae Lee, Jungseul Ok</p>
<p>Abstract: The evaluation of summary quality encompasses diverse dimensions such as consistency, coherence, relevance, and fluency. However, existing summarization methods often target a specific dimension, facing challenges in generating well-balanced summaries across multiple dimensions. In this paper, we propose multi-objective reinforcement learning tailored to generate balanced summaries across all four dimensions. We introduce two multi-dimensional optimization (MDO) strategies for adaptive learning: 1) MDO_min, rewarding the current lowest dimension score, and 2) MDO_pro, optimizing multiple dimensions similar to multi-task learning, resolves conflicting gradients across dimensions through gradient projection. Unlike prior ROUGE-based rewards relying on reference summaries, we use a QA-based reward model that aligns with human preferences. Further, we discover the capability to regulate the length of summaries by adjusting the discount factor, seeking the generation of concise yet informative summaries that encapsulate crucial points. Our approach achieved substantial performance gains compared to baseline models on representative summarization datasets, particularly in the overlooked dimensions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The limited availability of psychologists necessitates efficient identification of individuals requiring urgent mental healthcare. This study explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines to analyze text data from online mental health forums used for consultations. By analyzing forum posts, these pipelines can flag users who may require immediate professional attention. A crucial challenge in this domain is data privacy and scarcity. To address this, we propose utilizing readily available curricular texts used in institutes specializing in mental health for pre-training the NLP pipelines. This helps us mimic the training process of a psychologist. Our work presents two models: a discriminative BERT-based model called CASE-BERT that flags potential mental health disorders based on forum text, and a generative model called CASE-Gemma that extracts key features for a preliminary diagnosis. CASE-BERT demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving an f1 score of 0.91 for Depression and 0.88 for Anxiety, two of the most commonly reported mental health disorders. CASE-Gemma can achieve a BERT Score of 0.849 on generating diagnoses based on forum text. The effectiveness of CASE-Gemma is evaluated through both human evaluation and qualitative methods, with the collaboration of clinical psychologists who provide us with a set of annotated data for fine-tuning and evaluation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunseung Kim, Byungkun Lee, Hojoon Lee, Dongyoon Hwang, Donghu Kim, Jaegul Choo</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery is a learning paradigm that aims to acquire diverse behaviors without explicit rewards. However, it faces challenges in learning complex behaviors and often leads to learning unsafe or undesirable behaviors. For instance, in various continuous control tasks, current unsupervised skill discovery methods succeed in learning basic locomotions like standing but struggle with learning more complex movements such as walking and running. Moreover, they may acquire unsafe behaviors like tripping and rolling or navigate to undesirable locations such as pitfalls or hazardous areas. In response, we present DoDont (Do's and Don'ts), an instruction-based skill discovery algorithm composed of two stages. First, in an instruction learning stage, DoDont leverages action-free instruction videos to train an instruction network to distinguish desirable transitions from undesirable ones. Then, in the skill learning stage, the instruction network adjusts the reward function of the skill discovery algorithm to weight the desired behaviors. Specifically, we integrate the instruction network into a distance-maximizing skill discovery algorithm, where the instruction network serves as the distance function. Empirically, with less than 8 instruction videos, DoDont effectively learns desirable behaviors and avoids undesirable ones across complex continuous control tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fahimeh Fakour, Ali Mosleh, Ramin Ramezani</p>
<p>Abstract: The adaptation and use of Machine Learning (ML) in our daily lives has led to concerns in lack of transparency, privacy, reliability, among others. As a result, we are seeing research in niche areas such as interpretability, causality, bias and fairness, and reliability. In this survey paper, we focus on a critical concern for adaptation of ML in risk-sensitive applications, namely understanding and quantifying uncertainty. Our paper approaches this topic in a structured way, providing a review of the literature in the various facets that uncertainty is enveloped in the ML process. We begin by defining uncertainty and its categories (e.g., aleatoric and epistemic), understanding sources of uncertainty (e.g., data and model), and how uncertainty can be assessed in terms of uncertainty quantification techniques (Ensembles, Bayesian Neural Networks, etc.). As part of our assessment and understanding of uncertainty in the ML realm, we cover metrics for uncertainty quantification for a single sample, dataset, and metrics for accuracy of the uncertainty estimation itself. This is followed by discussions on calibration (model and uncertainty), and decision making under uncertainty. Thus, we provide a more complete treatment of uncertainty: from the sources of uncertainty to the decision-making process. We have focused the review of uncertainty quantification methods on Deep Learning (DL), while providing the necessary background for uncertainty discussion within ML in general. Key contributions in this review are broadening the scope of uncertainty discussion, as well as an updated review of uncertainty quantification methods in DL.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing interest in satellite imagery has triggered the need for efficient mechanisms to extract valuable information from these vast data sources, providing deeper insights. Even though deep learning has shown significant progress in satellite image classification. Nevertheless, in the literature, only a few results can be found on weight initialization techniques. These techniques traditionally involve initializing the networks' weights before training on extensive datasets, distinct from fine-tuning the weights of pre-trained networks. In this study, a novel weight initialization method is proposed in the context of satellite image classification. The proposed weight initialization method is mathematically detailed during the forward and backward passes of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Extensive experiments are carried out using six real-world datasets. Comparative analyses with existing weight initialization techniques made on various well-known CNN models reveal that the proposed weight initialization technique outperforms the previous competitive techniques in classification accuracy.

<p>Abstract: Effectively analyzing the comments to uncover latent intentions holds immense value in making strategic decisions across various domains. However, several challenges hinder the process of sentiment analysis including the lexical diversity exhibited in comments, the presence of long dependencies within the text, encountering unknown symbols and words, and dealing with imbalanced datasets. Moreover, existing sentiment analysis tasks mostly leveraged sequential models to encode the long dependent texts and it requires longer execution time as it processes the text sequentially. In contrast, the Transformer requires less execution time due to its parallel processing nature. In this work, we introduce a novel hybrid deep learning model, RoBERTa-BiLSTM, which combines the Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. RoBERTa is utilized to generate meaningful word embedding vectors, while BiLSTM effectively captures the contextual semantics of long-dependent texts. The RoBERTa-BiLSTM hybrid model leverages the strengths of both sequential and Transformer models to enhance performance in sentiment analysis. We conducted experiments using datasets from IMDb, Twitter US Airline, and Sentiment140 to evaluate the proposed model against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the RoBERTa-BiLSTM model surpasses baseline models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa-base, RoBERTa-GRU, and RoBERTa-LSTM), achieving accuracies of 80.74%, 92.36%, and 82.25% on the Twitter US Airline, IMDb, and Sentiment140 datasets, respectively. Additionally, the model achieves F1-scores of 80.73%, 92.35%, and 82.25% on the same datasets, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chujie Gao, Qihui Zhang, Dongping Chen, Yue Huang, Siyuan Wu, Zhengyan Fu, Yao Wan, Xiangliang Zhang, Lichao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various industries due to their exceptional generative capabilities. However, for safe and effective real-world deployments, ensuring honesty and helpfulness is critical. This paper addresses the question: Can we prioritize the helpfulness of LLMs while preserving their honesty? To begin with, we establish exhaustive principles aimed at guaranteeing the honesty of LLM. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset, referred to as HoneSet, comprising 930 queries spanning six categories meticulously crafted to assess an LLM's capacity for maintaining honesty. Subsequently, we present two approaches to augmenting honesty and helpfulness in LLMs: a training-free enhancement and a fine-tuning-based improvement. The training-free approach, which is based on curiosity-driven prompting, empowers LLMs to articulate internal confusion and uncertainty regarding queries, thereby optimizing their responses. Conversely, the fine-tuning-based method employs a two-stage process inspired by curriculum learning: initially instructing LLMs to discern between honest and dishonest responses, then refining their training to enhance helpfulness. Experiments conducted on nine prominent LLMs demonstrate a significant improvement in alignment with honesty across all models through the implementation of our proposed enhancements. Particularly noteworthy is the 65.3% enhancement observed in Llama3-8b and the remarkable 124.7% improvement in Mistral-7b, as measured by the H$^{2}$ (honest and helpful) assessment. We believe that our work can pave the way for developing more trustworthy LLMs for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Massidda, Sara Magliacane, Davide Bacciu</p>
<p>Abstract: The need for modelling causal knowledge at different levels of granularity arises in several settings. Causal Abstraction provides a framework for formalizing this problem by relating two Structural Causal Models at different levels of detail. Despite increasing interest in applying causal abstraction, e.g. in the interpretability of large machine learning models, the graphical and parametrical conditions under which a causal model can abstract another are not known. Furthermore, learning causal abstractions from data is still an open problem. In this work, we tackle both issues for linear causal models with linear abstraction functions. First, we characterize how the low-level coefficients and the abstraction function determine the high-level coefficients and how the high-level model constrains the causal ordering of low-level variables. Then, we apply our theoretical results to learn high-level and low-level causal models and their abstraction function from observational data. In particular, we introduce Abs-LiNGAM, a method that leverages the constraints induced by the learned high-level model and the abstraction function to speedup the recovery of the larger low-level model, under the assumption of non-Gaussian noise terms. In simulated settings, we show the effectiveness of learning causal abstractions from data and the potential of our method in improving scalability of causal discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngkyoung Bae, Yeongwoo Song, Hawoong Jeong</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite its prevalence, giving up and starting over may seem wasteful in many situations such as searching for a target or training deep neural networks (DNNs). Our study, though, demonstrates that restarting from a checkpoint can significantly improve generalization performance when training DNNs with noisy labels. In the presence of noisy labels, DNNs initially learn the general patterns of the data but then gradually overfit to the noisy labels. To combat this overfitting phenomenon, we developed a method based on stochastic restarting, which has been actively explored in the statistical physics field for finding targets efficiently. By approximating the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent into Langevin dynamics, we theoretically show that restarting can provide great improvements as the batch size and the proportion of corrupted data increase. We then empirically validate our theory, confirming the significant improvements achieved by restarting. An important aspect of our method is its ease of implementation and compatibility with other methods, while still yielding notably improved performance. We envision it as a valuable tool that can complement existing methods for handling noisy labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zelin Yao, Chuang Liu, Xueqi Ma, Mukun Chen, Jia Wu, Xiantao Cai, Bo Du, Wenbin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is a popular method for leaning graph representations by maximizing the consistency of features across augmented views. Traditional GCL methods utilize single-perspective i.e. data or model-perspective) augmentation to generate positive samples, restraining the diversity of positive samples. In addition, these positive samples may be unreliable due to uncontrollable augmentation strategies that potentially alter the semantic information. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a innovative framework termed dual-perspective cross graph contrastive learning (DC-GCL), which incorporates three modifications designed to enhance positive sample diversity and reliability: 1) We propose dual-perspective augmentation strategy that provide the model with more diverse training data, enabling the model effective learning of feature consistency across different views. 2) From the data perspective, we slightly perturb the original graphs using controllable data augmentation, effectively preserving their semantic information. 3) From the model perspective, we enhance the encoder by utilizing more powerful graph transformers instead of graph neural networks. Based on the model's architecture, we propose three pruning-based strategies to slightly perturb the encoder, providing more reliable positive samples. These modifications collectively form the DC-GCL's foundation and provide more diverse and reliable training inputs, offering significant improvements over traditional GCL methods. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that DC-GCL consistently outperforms different baselines on various datasets and tasks.</p>

However, existing SNNs predominantly rely on the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model and are primarily suited for simple, static tasks. They lack the ability to effectively model long-term temporal dependencies and facilitate spatial information interaction, which is crucial for tackling complex, dynamic spatio-temporal prediction tasks. To tackle these challenges, this paper draws inspiration from the concept of autaptic synapses in biology and proposes a novel Spatio-Temporal Circuit (STC) model. The STC model integrates two learnable adaptive pathways, enhancing the spiking neurons' temporal memory and spatial coordination. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the dynamic parameters in the STC model, highlighting their contribution in establishing long-term memory and mitigating the issue of gradient vanishing. Through extensive experiments on multiple spatio-temporal prediction datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms other adaptive models. Furthermore, our model is compatible with existing spiking neuron models, thereby augmenting their dynamic representations. In essence, our work enriches the specificity and topological complexity of SNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mazen Balat, Youssef Mohamed, Ahmed Heakl, Ahmed Zaky</p>
<p>Abstract: This study thoroughly investigates how well deep learning models can recognize Arabic handwritten text for person biometric identification. It compares three advanced architectures -- ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB7 -- using three widely recognized datasets: AHAWP, Khatt, and LAMIS-MSHD. Results show that EfficientNetB7 outperforms the others, achieving test accuracies of 98.57\%, 99.15\%, and 99.79\% on AHAWP, Khatt, and LAMIS-MSHD datasets, respectively. EfficientNetB7's exceptional performance is credited to its innovative techniques, including compound scaling, depth-wise separable convolutions, and squeeze-and-excitation blocks. These features allow the model to extract more abstract and distinctive features from handwritten text images. The study's findings hold significant implications for enhancing identity verification and authentication systems, highlighting the potential of deep learning in Arabic handwritten text recognition for person biometric identification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaeseung Heo, Moonjeong Park, Dongwoo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Soft labels can improve the generalization of a neural network classifier in many domains, such as image classification. Despite its success, the current literature has overlooked the efficiency of label smoothing in node classification with graph-structured data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective label smoothing for the transductive node classification task. We design the soft label to encapsulate the local context of the target node through the neighborhood label distribution. We apply the smoothing method for seven baseline models to show its effectiveness. The label smoothing methods improve the classification accuracy in 10 node classification datasets in most cases. In the following analysis, we find that incorporating global label statistics in posterior computation is the key to the success of label smoothing. Further investigation reveals that the soft labels mitigate overfitting during training, leading to better generalization performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Zheng, Qian Feng, Hang Li, Alois Knoll, Jianxiang Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable performance as zero-shot task planners for robotic manipulation tasks. However, the open-loop nature of previous works makes LLM-based planning error-prone and fragile. On the other hand, failure detection approaches for closed-loop planning are often limited by task-specific heuristics or following an unrealistic assumption that the prediction is trustworthy all the time. As a general-purpose reasoning machine, LLMs or Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are promising for detecting failures. However, However, the appropriateness of the aforementioned assumption diminishes due to the notorious hullucination problem. In this work, we attempt to mitigate these issues by introducing a framework for closed-loop LLM-based planning called KnowLoop, backed by an uncertainty-based MLLMs failure detector, which is agnostic to any used MLLMs or LLMs. Specifically, we evaluate three different ways for quantifying the uncertainty of MLLMs, namely token probability, entropy, and self-explained confidence as primary metrics based on three carefully designed representative prompting strategies. With a self-collected dataset including various manipulation tasks and an LLM-based robot system, our experiments demonstrate that token probability and entropy are more reflective compared to self-explained confidence. By setting an appropriate threshold to filter out uncertain predictions and seek human help actively, the accuracy of failure detection can be significantly enhanced. This improvement boosts the effectiveness of closed-loop planning and the overall success rate of tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minsu Kim, Walid Saad, Merouane Debbah, Choong Seon Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: The large communication and computation overhead of federated learning (FL) is one of the main challenges facing its practical deployment over resource-constrained clients and systems. In this work, SpaFL: a communication-efficient FL framework is proposed to optimize sparse model structures with low computational overhead. In SpaFL, a trainable threshold is defined for each filter/neuron to prune its all connected parameters, thereby leading to structured sparsity. To optimize the pruning process itself, only thresholds are communicated between a server and clients instead of parameters, thereby learning how to prune. Further, global thresholds are used to update model parameters by extracting aggregated parameter importance. The generalization bound of SpaFL is also derived, thereby proving key insights on the relation between sparsity and performance. Experimental results show that SpaFL improves accuracy while requiring much less communication and computing resources compared to sparse baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bumju Kwak, Jeonghee Jo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent SO(3)-equivariant models embedded a molecule as a set of single atoms fixed in the three-dimensional space, which is analogous to a ball-and-stick view. This perspective provides a concise view of atom arrangements, however, the surrounding electron density cannot be represented and its polarization effects may be underestimated. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textit{Neural Polarization}, a novel method extending equivariant network by embedding each atom as a pair of fixed and moving points. Motivated by density functional theory, Neural Polarization represents molecules as a space-filling view which includes an electron density, in contrast with a ball-and-stick view. Neural Polarization can flexibly be applied to most type of existing equivariant models. We showed that Neural Polarization can improve prediction performances of existing models over a wide range of targets. Finally, we verified that our method can improve the expressiveness and equivariance in terms of mathematical aspects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feiyu Zhu, Yuming Zhang, Changpeng Cai, Guinan Guo, Jiao Li, Xiuyuan Guo, Quanwei Zhang, Peizhe Wang, Chenghao He, Junhao Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional deep neural networks typically use end-to-end backpropagation, which often places a big burden on GPU memory. Another promising training method is local learning, which involves splitting the network into blocks and training them in parallel with the help of an auxiliary network. Local learning has been widely studied and applied to image classification tasks, and its performance is comparable to that of end-to-end method. However, different image tasks often rely on different feature representations, which is difficult for typical auxiliary networks to adapt to. To solve this problem, we propose the construction method of Global-Local Collaborative Auxiliary Network (GLCAN), which provides a macroscopic design approach for auxiliary networks. This is the first demonstration that local learning methods can be successfully applied to other tasks such as object detection and super-resolution. GLCAN not only saves a lot of GPU memory, but also has comparable performance to an end-to-end approach on data sets for multiple different tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Fang, Ming Gu, Sheng Zhou, Jiawei Chen, Qiaoyu Tan, Haishuai Wang, Jiajun Bu</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) plays a crucial role in identifying abnormal patterns within data without labeled examples, holding significant practical implications across various domains. Although the individual contributions of representation learning and clustering to anomaly detection are well-established, their interdependencies remain under-explored due to the absence of a unified theoretical framework. Consequently, their collective potential to enhance anomaly detection performance remains largely untapped. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic mixture model for anomaly detection to establish a theoretical connection among representation learning, clustering, and anomaly detection. By maximizing a novel anomaly-aware data likelihood, representation learning and clustering can effectively reduce the adverse impact of anomalous data and collaboratively benefit anomaly detection. Meanwhile, a theoretically substantiated anomaly score is naturally derived from this framework. Lastly, drawing inspiration from gravitational analysis in physics, we have devised an improved anomaly score that more effectively harnesses the combined power of representation learning and clustering. Extensive experiments, involving 17 baseline methods across 30 diverse datasets, validate the effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed method, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijie Zhong, Hanwen Liu, Xiaoya Cui, Xiaofan Zhang, Zengchang Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating information from different reference data sources is a major challenge for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems because each knowledge source adopts a unique data structure and follows different conventions. Retrieving from multiple knowledge sources with one fixed strategy usually leads to under-exploitation of information. To mitigate this drawback, inspired by Mix-of-Expert, we introduce Mix-of-Granularity (MoG), a method that dynamically determines the optimal granularity of a knowledge database based on input queries using a router. The router is efficiently trained with a newly proposed loss function employing soft labels. We further extend MoG to Mix-of-Granularity-Graph (MoGG), where reference documents are pre-processed into graphs, enabling the retrieval of relevant information from distantly situated chunks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both MoG and MoGG effectively predict optimal granularity levels, significantly enhancing the performance of the RAG system in downstream tasks. The code of both MoG and MoGG will be made public.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) paired with Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) to improve pedestrian detection in adverse weather, a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles. Utilizing the high temporal resolution and low latency of DVS, which excels in dynamic, low-light, and high-contrast environments, we assess the efficiency of SNNs compared to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  Our experiments involved testing across diverse weather scenarios using a custom dataset from the CARLA simulator, mirroring real-world variability. SNN models, enhanced with Temporally Effective Batch Normalization, were trained and benchmarked against state-of-the-art CNNs to demonstrate superior accuracy and computational efficiency in complex conditions such as rain and fog.
  The results indicate that SNNs, integrated with DVS, significantly reduce computational overhead and improve detection accuracy in challenging conditions compared to CNNs. This highlights the potential of DVS combined with bio-inspired SNN processing to enhance autonomous vehicle perception and decision-making systems, advancing intelligent transportation systems' safety features in varying operational environments.
  Additionally, our research indicates that SNNs perform more efficiently in handling long perception windows and prediction tasks, rather than simple pedestrian detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider a weakly supervised learning problem called Learning from Label Proportions (LLP), where examples are grouped into ``bags'' and only the average label within each bag is revealed to the learner. We study various learning rules for LLP that achieve PAC learning guarantees for classification loss. We establish that the classical Empirical Proportional Risk Minimization (EPRM) learning rule (Yu et al., 2014) achieves fast rates under realizability, but EPRM and similar proportion matching learning rules can fail in the agnostic setting. We also show that (1) a debiased proportional square loss, as well as (2) a recently proposed EasyLLP learning rule (Busa-Fekete et al., 2023) both achieve ``optimistic rates'' (Panchenko, 2002); in both the realizable and agnostic settings, their sample complexity is optimal (up to log factors) in terms of $\epsilon, \delta$, and VC dimension.</p>

This paper offers a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in SimulST research, focusing on four major challenges. Firstly, the complexities associated with processing lengthy and continuous speech streams pose significant hurdles. Secondly, satisfying real-time requirements presents inherent difficulties due to the need for immediate translation output. Thirdly, striking a balance between translation quality and latency constraints remains a critical challenge. Finally, the scarcity of annotated data adds another layer of complexity to the task. Through our exploration of these challenges and the proposed solutions, we aim to provide valuable insights into the current landscape of SimulST research and suggest promising directions for future exploration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capacity to improve summary quality by mirroring a human-like iterative process of critique and refinement starting from the initial draft. Two strategies are designed to perform this iterative process: Prompt Chaining and Stepwise Prompt. Prompt chaining orchestrates the drafting, critiquing, and refining phases through a series of three discrete prompts, while Stepwise prompt integrates these phases within a single prompt. However, the relative effectiveness of the two methods has not been extensively studied. This paper is dedicated to examining and comparing these two methods in the context of text summarization to ascertain which method stands out as the most effective. Experimental results show that the prompt chaining method can produce a more favorable outcome. This might be because stepwise prompt might produce a simulated refinement process according to our various experiments. Since refinement is adaptable to diverse tasks, our conclusions have the potential to be extrapolated to other applications, thereby offering insights that may contribute to the broader development of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the process of learning in neural networks is crucial for improving their performance and interpreting their behavior. This can be approximately understood by asking how a model's output is influenced when we fine-tune on a new training sample. There are desiderata for such influences, such as decreasing influence with semantic distance, sparseness, noise invariance, transitive causality, and logical consistency. Here we use the empirical influence measured using fine-tuning to demonstrate how individual training samples affect outputs. We show that these desiderata are violated for both for simple convolutional networks and for a modern LLM. We also illustrate how prompting can partially rescue this failure. Our paper presents an efficient and practical way of quantifying how well neural networks learn from fine-tuning stimuli. Our results suggest that popular models cannot generalize or perform logic in the way they appear to.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered remarkable advancements across diverse code-related tasks, known as Code LLMs, particularly in code generation that generates source code with LLM from natural language descriptions. This burgeoning field has captured significant interest from both academic researchers and industry professionals due to its practical significance in software development, e.g., GitHub Copilot. Despite the active exploration of LLMs for a variety of code tasks, either from the perspective of natural language processing (NLP) or software engineering (SE) or both, there is a noticeable absence of a comprehensive and up-to-date literature review dedicated to LLM for code generation. In this survey, we aim to bridge this gap by providing a systematic literature review that serves as a valuable reference for researchers investigating the cutting-edge progress in LLMs for code generation. We introduce a taxonomy to categorize and discuss the recent developments in LLMs for code generation, covering aspects such as data curation, latest advances, performance evaluation, and real-world applications. In addition, we present a historical overview of the evolution of LLMs for code generation and offer an empirical comparison using the widely recognized HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks to highlight the progressive enhancements in LLM capabilities for code generation. We identify critical challenges and promising opportunities regarding the gap between academia and practical development. Furthermore, we have established a dedicated resource website (https://codellm.github.io) to continuously document and disseminate the most recent advances in the field.</p>

The robotic manipulator is interfaced using continuous high-level actions for position-based control in the Cartesian plane while having partial observability of the environment with stochastic transitions. We demonstrate that agents are prone to overfitting when trained solely against a single playstyle, highlighting the importance of self-play for generalization to novel strategies of unseen opponents. Furthermore, the impact of the imagination horizon is explored in the competitive setting of the highly dynamic game of air hockey, with longer horizons resulting in more stable learning and better overall performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The quality of Machine Learning (ML) models strongly depends on the input data, as such Feature Engineering (FE) is often required in ML. In addition, with the proliferation of ML-powered systems, especially in critical contexts, the need for interpretability and explainability becomes increasingly important. Since manual FE is time-consuming and requires case specific knowledge, we propose KRAFT, an AutoFE framework that leverages a knowledge graph to guide the generation of interpretable features. Our hybrid AI approach combines a neural generator to transform raw features through a series of transformations and a knowledge-based reasoner to evaluate features interpretability using Description Logics (DL). The generator is trained through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to maximize the prediction accuracy and the interpretability of the generated features. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that KRAFT significantly improves accuracy while ensuring a high level of interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyue Chen, Miaojing Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of supervised semantic segmentation methods highly relies on the availability of large-scale training data. To alleviate this dependence, few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) is introduced to leverage the model trained on base classes with sufficient data into the segmentation of novel classes with few data. FSS methods face the challenge of model generalization on novel classes due to the distribution shift between base and novel classes. To overcome this issue, we propose a class-shared memory (CSM) module consisting of a set of learnable memory vectors. These memory vectors learn elemental object patterns from base classes during training whilst re-encoding query features during both training and inference, thereby improving the distribution alignment between base and novel classes. Furthermore, to cope with the performance degradation resulting from the intra-class variance across images, we introduce an uncertainty-based feature augmentation (UFA) module to produce diverse query features during training for improving the model's robustness. We integrate CSM and UFA into representative FSS works, with experimental results on the widely-used PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrating the superior performance of ours over state of the art.</p>

<p>Abstract: A common type of zero-inflated data has certain true values incorrectly replaced by zeros due to data recording conventions (rare outcomes assumed to be absent) or details of data recording equipment (e.g. artificial zeros in gene expression data).
  Existing methods for zero-inflated data either fit the observed data likelihood via parametric mixture models that explicitly represent excess zeros, or aim to replace excess zeros by imputed values. If the goal of the analysis relies on knowing true data realizations, a particular challenge with zero-inflated data is identifiability, since it is difficult to correctly determine which observed zeros are real and which are inflated.
  This paper views zero-inflated data as a general type of missing data problem, where the observability indicator for a potentially censored variable is itself unobserved whenever a zero is recorded. We show that, without additional assumptions, target parameters involving a zero-inflated variable are not identified. However, if a proxy of the missingness indicator is observed, a modification of the effect restoration approach of Kuroki and Pearl allows identification and estimation, given the proxy-indicator relationship is known.
  If this relationship is unknown, our approach yields a partial identification strategy for sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we show that only certain proxy-indicator relationships are compatible with the observed data distribution. We give an analytic bound for this relationship in cases with a categorical outcome, which is sharp in certain models. For more complex cases, sharp numerical bounds may be computed using methods in Duarte et al.[2023].
  We illustrate our method via simulation studies and a data application on central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phoebe J. Wang, Max Kreminski</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating stories in response to open-ended user requests, but the resulting stories tend to be limited in their diversity. Older, symbolic approaches to story generation (such as planning) can generate substantially more diverse plot outlines, but are limited to producing stories that recombine a fixed set of hand-engineered character action templates. Can we combine the strengths of these approaches while mitigating their weaknesses? We propose to do so by using a higher-level and more abstract symbolic specification of high-level story structure -- implemented via answer set programming (ASP) -- to guide and diversify LLM-based story generation. Via semantic similarity analysis, we demonstrate that our approach produces more diverse stories than an unguided LLM, and via code excerpts, we demonstrate the improved compactness and flexibility of ASP-based outline generation over full-fledged narrative planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nurbek Tastan, Samar Fares, Toluwani Aremu, Samuel Horvath, Karthik Nandakumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a pivotal approach in machine learning, enabling multiple participants to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. While FL finds applications in various domains such as healthcare and finance, it is challenging to ensure global model convergence when participants do not contribute equally and/or honestly. To overcome this challenge, principled mechanisms are required to evaluate the contributions made by individual participants in the FL setting. Existing solutions for contribution assessment rely on general accuracy evaluation, often failing to capture nuanced dynamics and class-specific influences. This paper proposes a novel contribution assessment method called ShapFed for fine-grained evaluation of participant contributions in FL. Our approach uses Shapley values from cooperative game theory to provide a granular understanding of class-specific influences. Based on ShapFed, we introduce a weighted aggregation method called ShapFed-WA, which outperforms conventional federated averaging, especially in class-imbalanced scenarios. Personalizing participant updates based on their contributions further enhances collaborative fairness by delivering differentiated models commensurate with the participant contributions. Experiments on CIFAR-10, Chest X-Ray, and Fed-ISIC2019 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving utility, efficiency, and fairness in FL systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Denis Gudovskiy, Tomoyuki Okuno, Yohei Nakata</p>
<p>Abstract: Normalizing flow-based generative models have been widely used in applications where the exact density estimation is of major importance. Recent research proposes numerous methods to improve their expressivity. However, conditioning on a context is largely overlooked area in the bijective flow research. Conventional conditioning with the vector concatenation is limited to only a few flow types. More importantly, this approach cannot support a practical setup where a set of context-conditioned (specialist) models are trained with the fixed pretrained general-knowledge (generalist) model. We propose ContextFlow++ approach to overcome these limitations using an additive conditioning with explicit generalist-specialist knowledge decoupling. Furthermore, we support discrete contexts by the proposed mixed-variable architecture with context encoders. Particularly, our context encoder for discrete variables is a surjective flow from which the context-conditioned continuous variables are sampled. Our experiments on rotated MNIST-R, corrupted CIFAR-10C, real-world ATM predictive maintenance and SMAP unsupervised anomaly detection benchmarks show that the proposed ContextFlow++ offers faster stable training and achieves higher performance metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanlin Feng, Sajjadur Rahman, Aaron Feng, Vincent Chen, Eser Kandogan</p>
<p>Abstract: Compound AI systems (CASs) that employ LLMs as agents to accomplish knowledge-intensive tasks via interactions with tools and data retrievers have garnered significant interest within database and AI communities. While these systems have the potential to supplement typical analysis workflows of data analysts in enterprise data platforms, unfortunately, CASs are subject to the same data discovery challenges that analysts have encountered over the years -- silos of multimodal data sources, created across teams and departments within an organization, make it difficult to identify appropriate data sources for accomplishing the task at hand. Existing data discovery benchmarks do not model such multimodality and multiplicity of data sources. Moreover, benchmarks of CASs prioritize only evaluating end-to-end task performance. To catalyze research on evaluating the data discovery performance of multimodal data retrievers in CASs within a real-world setting, we propose CMDBench, a benchmark modeling the complexity of enterprise data platforms. We adapt existing datasets and benchmarks in open-domain -- from question answering and complex reasoning tasks to natural language querying over structured data -- to evaluate coarse- and fine-grained data discovery and task execution performance. Our experiments reveal the impact of data retriever design on downstream task performance -- a 46% drop in task accuracy on average -- across various modalities, data sources, and task difficulty. The results indicate the need to develop optimization strategies to identify appropriate LLM agents and retrievers for efficient execution of CASs over enterprise data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities surpassing conventional NLP challenges, creating opportunities for use in production use cases. Towards this goal, there is a notable shift to building compound AI systems, wherein LLMs are integrated into an expansive software infrastructure with many components like models, retrievers, databases and tools. In this paper, we introduce a blueprint architecture for compound AI systems to operate in enterprise settings cost-effectively and feasibly. Our proposed architecture aims for seamless integration with existing compute and data infrastructure, with ``stream'' serving as the key orchestration concept to coordinate data and instructions among agents and other components. Task and data planners, respectively, break down, map, and optimize tasks and data to available agents and data sources defined in respective registries, given production constraints such as accuracy and latency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Zhang, Zifan Wang, Mihir Dhamankar, Matt Fredrikson, Yuvraj Agarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Many Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices rely on cloud computation resources to perform machine learning inferences. This is expensive and may raise privacy concerns for users. Consumers of these devices often have hardware such as gaming consoles and PCs with graphics accelerators that are capable of performing these computations, which may be left idle for significant periods of time. While this presents a compelling potential alternative to cloud offloading, concerns about the integrity of inferences, the confidentiality of model parameters, and the privacy of users' data mean that device vendors may be hesitant to offload their inferences to a platform managed by another manufacturer.
  We propose VeriSplit, a framework for offloading machine learning inferences to locally-available devices that address these concerns. We introduce masking techniques to protect data privacy and model confidentiality, and a commitment-based verification protocol to address integrity. Unlike much prior work aimed at addressing these issues, our approach does not rely on computation over finite field elements, which may interfere with floating-point computation supports on hardware accelerators and require modification to existing models. We implemented a prototype of VeriSplit and our evaluation results show that, compared to performing computation locally, our secure and private offloading solution can reduce inference latency by 28%--83%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuang Qi, Junlin Zhang, Xin Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual tracking fundamentally involves regressing the state of the target in each frame of a video. Despite significant progress, existing regression-based trackers still tend to experience failures and inaccuracies. To enhance the precision of target estimation, this paper proposes a tracking technique based on robust regression. Firstly, we introduce a novel robust linear regression estimator, which achieves favorable performance when the error vector follows i.i.d Gaussian-Laplacian distribution. Secondly, we design an iterative process to quickly solve the problem of outliers. In fact, the coefficients are obtained by Iterative Gradient Descent and Threshold Selection algorithm (IGDTS). In addition, we expend IGDTS to a generative tracker, and apply IGDTS-distance to measure the deviation between the sample and the model. Finally, we propose an update scheme to capture the appearance changes of the tracked object and ensure that the model is updated correctly. Experimental results on several challenging image sequences show that the proposed tracker outperformance existing trackers.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00592">Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning: A Unified Framework Based on Dynamic Programming</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitri P. Bertsekas</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we describe a new conceptual framework that connects approximate Dynamic Programming (DP), Model Predictive Control (MPC), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). This framework centers around two algorithms, which are designed largely independently of each other and operate in synergy through the powerful mechanism of Newton's method. We call them the off-line training and the on-line play algorithms. The names are borrowed from some of the major successes of RL involving games; primary examples are the recent (2017) AlphaZero program (which plays chess, [SHS17], [SSS17]), and the similarly structured and earlier (1990s) TD-Gammon program (which plays backgammon, [Tes94], [Tes95], [TeG96]). In these game contexts, the off-line training algorithm is the method used to teach the program how to evaluate positions and to generate good moves at any given position, while the on-line play algorithm is the method used to play in real time against human or computer opponents.
  Significantly, the synergy between off-line training and on-line play also underlies MPC (as well as other major classes of sequential decision problems), and indeed the MPC design architecture is very similar to the one of AlphaZero and TD-Gammon. This conceptual insight provides a vehicle for bridging the cultural gap between RL and MPC, and sheds new light on some fundamental issues in MPC. These include the enhancement of stability properties through rollout, the treatment of uncertainty through the use of certainty equivalence, the resilience of MPC in adaptive control settings that involve changing system parameters, and the insights provided by the superlinear performance bounds implied by Newton's method.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the canonical fair clustering problem where each cluster is constrained to have close to population-level representation of each group. Despite significant attention, the salient issue of having incomplete knowledge about the group membership of each point has been superficially addressed. In this paper, we consider a setting where errors exist in the assigned group memberships. We introduce a simple and interpretable family of error models that require a small number of parameters to be given by the decision maker. We then present an algorithm for fair clustering with provable robustness guarantees. Our framework enables the decision maker to trade off between the robustness and the clustering quality. Unlike previous work, our algorithms are backed by worst-case theoretical guarantees. Finally, we empirically verify the performance of our algorithm on real world datasets and show its superior performance over existing baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this research, we propose the first approach for integrating the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with various pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for remote sensing (RS) scene classification tasks using the EuroSAT dataset. Our novel methodology, named KCN, aims to replace traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with KAN to enhance classification performance. We employed multiple CNN-based models, including VGG16, MobileNetV2, EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, ResNet101, and Vision Transformer (ViT), and evaluated their performance when paired with KAN. Our experiments demonstrated that KAN achieved high accuracy with fewer training epochs and parameters. Specifically, ConvNeXt paired with KAN showed the best performance, achieving 94% accuracy in the first epoch, which increased to 96% and remained consistent across subsequent epochs. The results indicated that KAN and MLP both achieved similar accuracy, with KAN performing slightly better in later epochs. By utilizing the EuroSAT dataset, we provided a robust testbed to investigate whether KAN is suitable for remote sensing classification tasks. Given that KAN is a novel algorithm, there is substantial capacity for further development and optimization, suggesting that KCN offers a promising alternative for efficient image analysis in the RS field.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce LongSkywork, a long-context Large Language Model (LLM) capable of processing up to 200,000 tokens. We provide a training recipe for efficiently extending context length of LLMs. We identify that the critical element in enhancing long-context processing capability is to incorporate a long-context SFT stage following the standard SFT stage. A mere 200 iterations can convert the standard SFT model into a long-context model. To reduce the effort in collecting and annotating data for long-context language modeling, we develop two novel methods for creating synthetic data. These methods are applied during the continual pretraining phase as well as the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase, greatly enhancing the training efficiency of our long-context LLMs. Our findings suggest that synthetic long-context SFT data can surpass the performance of data curated by humans to some extent. LongSkywork achieves outstanding performance on a variety of long-context benchmarks. In the Needle test, a benchmark for long-context information retrieval, our models achieved perfect accuracy across multiple context spans. Moreover, in realistic application scenarios, LongSkywork-13B demonstrates performance on par with Claude2.1, the leading long-context model, underscoring the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a simple, modular, and generic method that upsamples coarse 3D models by adding geometric and appearance details. While generative 3D models now exist, they do not yet match the quality of their counterparts in image and video domains. We demonstrate that it is possible to directly repurpose existing (pretrained) video models for 3D super-resolution and thus sidestep the problem of the shortage of large repositories of high-quality 3D training models. We describe how to repurpose video upsampling models, which are not 3D consistent, and combine them with 3D consolidation to produce 3D-consistent results. As output, we produce high quality Gaussian Splat models, which are object centric and effective. Our method is category agnostic and can be easily incorporated into existing 3D workflows. We evaluate our proposed SuperGaussian on a variety of 3D inputs, which are diverse both in terms of complexity and representation (e.g., Gaussian Splats or NeRFs), and demonstrate that our simple method significantly improves the fidelity of the final 3D models.

<p>Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has showcased its efficacy across a broad spectrum of decision-making problems. However, its performance often degrades under vast combinatorial action space, especially where an action is composed of multiple sub-actions. In this work, we propose an action abstraction based on the compositional structure between a state and sub-actions for improving the efficiency of MCTS under a factored action space. Our method learns a latent dynamics model with an auxiliary network that captures sub-actions relevant to the transition on the current state, which we call state-conditioned action abstraction. Notably, it infers such compositional relationships from high-dimensional observations without the known environment model. During the tree traversal, our method constructs the state-conditioned action abstraction for each node on-the-fly, reducing the search space by discarding the exploration of redundant sub-actions. Experimental results demonstrate the superior sample efficiency of our method compared to vanilla MuZero, which suffers from expansive action space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jewel Rana Palit, Osama A Osman</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic flow forecasting is a crucial first step in intelligent and proactive traffic management. Traffic flow parameters are volatile and uncertain, making traffic flow forecasting a difficult task if the appropriate forecasting model is not used. Additionally, the non-Euclidean data structure of traffic flow parameters is challenging to analyze from both spatial and temporal perspectives. State-of-the-art deep learning approaches use pure convolution, recurrent neural networks, and hybrid methods to achieve this objective efficiently. However, many of the approaches in the literature rely on complex architectures that can be difficult to train. This complexity also adds to the black-box nature of deep learning. This study introduces a novel deep learning architecture, referred to as the multigraph convolution neural network (MGCNN), for turning movement prediction at intersections. The proposed architecture combines a multigraph structure, built to model temporal variations in traffic data, with a spectral convolution operation to support modeling the spatial variations in traffic data over the graphs. The proposed model was tested using twenty days of flow and traffic control data collected from an arterial in downtown Chattanooga, TN, with ten signalized intersections. The model's ability to perform short-term predictions over 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 minutes into the future was evaluated against four baseline state-of-the-art models. The results showed that our proposed model is superior to the other baseline models in predicting turning movements with a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.9</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingrui Wang, Wufei Ma, Angtian Wang, Shuo Chen, Adam Kortylewski, Alan Yuille</p>
<p>Abstract: For vision-language models (VLMs), understanding the dynamic properties of objects and their interactions within 3D scenes from video is crucial for effective reasoning. In this work, we introduce a video question answering dataset SuperCLEVR-Physics that focuses on the dynamics properties of objects. We concentrate on physical concepts -- velocity, acceleration, and collisions within 4D scenes, where the model needs to fully understand these dynamics properties and answer the questions built on top of them. From the evaluation of a variety of current VLMs, we find that these models struggle with understanding these dynamic properties due to the lack of explicit knowledge about the spatial structure in 3D and world dynamics in time variants. To demonstrate the importance of an explicit 4D dynamics representation of the scenes in understanding world dynamics, we further propose NS-4Dynamics, a Neural-Symbolic model for reasoning on 4D Dynamics properties under explicit scene representation from videos. Using scene rendering likelihood combining physical prior distribution, the 4D scene parser can estimate the dynamics properties of objects over time to and interpret the observation into 4D scene representation as world states. By further incorporating neural-symbolic reasoning, our approach enables advanced applications in future prediction, factual reasoning, and counterfactual reasoning. Our experiments show that our NS-4Dynamics suppresses previous VLMs in understanding the dynamics properties and answering questions about factual queries, future prediction, and counterfactual reasoning. Moreover, based on the explicit 4D scene representation, our model is effective in reconstructing the 4D scenes and re-simulate the future or counterfactual events.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have become the \textit{de-facto} approach for generating visual data, which are trained to match the distribution of the training dataset. In addition, we also want to control generation to fulfill desired properties such as alignment to a text description, which can be specified with a black-box reward function. Prior works fine-tune pretrained diffusion models to achieve this goal through reinforcement learning-based algorithms. Nonetheless, they suffer from issues including slow credit assignment as well as low quality in their generated samples. In this work, we explore techniques that do not directly maximize the reward but rather generate high-reward images with relatively high probability -- a natural scenario for the framework of generative flow networks (GFlowNets). To this end, we propose the \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{A}lignment with \textbf{G}FlowNet (DAG) algorithm to post-train diffusion models with black-box property functions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion and various reward specifications corroborate that our method could effectively align large-scale text-to-image diffusion models with given reward information.</p>

<p>Abstract: For reconstructing high-fidelity human 3D models from monocular videos, it is crucial to maintain consistent large-scale body shapes along with finely matched subtle wrinkles. This paper explores the observation that the per-frame rendering results can be factorized into a pose-independent component and a corresponding pose-dependent equivalent to facilitate frame consistency. Pose adaptive textures can be further improved by restricting frequency bands of these two components. In detail, pose-independent outputs are expected to be low-frequency, while highfrequency information is linked to pose-dependent factors. We achieve a coherent preservation of both coarse body contours across the entire input video and finegrained texture features that are time variant with a dual-branch network with distinct frequency components. The first branch takes coordinates in canonical space as input, while the second branch additionally considers features outputted by the first branch and pose information of each frame. Our network integrates the information predicted by both branches and utilizes volume rendering to generate photo-realistic 3D human images. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our network surpasses the neural radiance fields (NeRF) based state-of-the-art methods in preserving high-frequency details and ensuring consistent body contours.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we investigate how to leverage pre-trained visual-language models (VLM) for online Reinforcement Learning (RL). In particular, we focus on sparse reward tasks with pre-defined textual task descriptions. We first identify the problem of reward misalignment when applying VLM as a reward in RL tasks. To address this issue, we introduce a lightweight fine-tuning method, named Fuzzy VLM reward-aided RL (FuRL), based on reward alignment and relay RL. Specifically, we enhance the performance of SAC/DrQ baseline agents on sparse reward tasks by fine-tuning VLM representations and using relay RL to avoid local minima. Extensive experiments on the Meta-world benchmark tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. Code is available at: {\footnotesize\url{https://github.com/fuyw/FuRL}}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayun Wu, Jiashuo Liu, Peng Cui, Zhiwei Steven Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: We establish a new model-agnostic optimization framework for out-of-distribution generalization via multicalibration, a criterion that ensures a predictor is calibrated across a family of overlapping groups. Multicalibration is shown to be associated with robustness of statistical inference under covariate shift. We further establish a link between multicalibration and robustness for prediction tasks both under and beyond covariate shift. We accomplish this by extending multicalibration to incorporate grouping functions that consider covariates and labels jointly. This leads to an equivalence of the extended multicalibration and invariance, an objective for robust learning in existence of concept shift. We show a linear structure of the grouping function class spanned by density ratios, resulting in a unifying framework for robust learning by designing specific grouping functions. We propose MC-Pseudolabel, a post-processing algorithm to achieve both extended multicalibration and out-of-distribution generalization. The algorithm, with lightweight hyperparameters and optimization through a series of supervised regression steps, achieves superior performance on real-world datasets with distribution shift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Towle, Xin Chen, Ke Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The recently released Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown powerful zero-shot segmentation capabilities through a semi-automatic annotation setup in which the user can provide a prompt in the form of clicks or bounding boxes. There is growing interest around applying this to medical imaging, where the cost of obtaining expert annotations is high, privacy restrictions may limit sharing of patient data, and model generalisation is often poor. However, there are large amounts of inherent uncertainty in medical images, due to unclear object boundaries, low-contrast media, and differences in expert labelling style. Currently, SAM is known to struggle in a zero-shot setting to adequately annotate the contours of the structure of interest in medical images, where the uncertainty is often greatest, thus requiring significant manual correction. To mitigate this, we introduce \textbf{Sim}ulated Interaction for \textbf{S}egment \textbf{A}nything \textbf{M}odel (\textsc{\textbf{SimSAM}}), an approach that leverages simulated user interaction to generate an arbitrary number of candidate masks, and uses a novel aggregation approach to output the most compatible mask. Crucially, our method can be used during inference directly on top of SAM, without any additional training requirement. Quantitatively, we evaluate our method across three publicly available medical imaging datasets, and find that our approach leads to up to a 15.5\% improvement in contour segmentation accuracy compared to zero-shot SAM.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sulaiman Khan, Md. Rafiul Biswas, Alina Murad, Hazrat Ali, Zubair Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have spurred significant interest in their potential applications across various medical imaging domains. On the one hand, there is a temptation to use these generative models to synthesize realistic-looking medical image data, while on the other hand, the ability to identify synthetic image data in a pool of data is also significantly important. In this study, we explore the potential of the Gemini (\textit{gemini-1.0-pro-vision-latest}) and GPT-4V (gpt-4-vision-preview) models for medical image analysis using two modalities of medical image data. Utilizing synthetic and real imaging data, both Gemini AI and GPT-4V are first used to classify real versus synthetic images, followed by an interpretation and analysis of the input images. Experimental results demonstrate that both Gemini and GPT-4 could perform some interpretation of the input images. In this specific experiment, Gemini was able to perform slightly better than the GPT-4V on the classification task. In contrast, responses associated with GPT-4V were mostly generic in nature. Our early investigation presented in this work provides insights into the potential of MLLMs to assist with the classification and interpretation of retinal fundoscopy and lung X-ray images. We also identify key limitations associated with the early investigation study on MLLMs for specialized tasks in medical image analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Masoud Rahmani, Amir Haider, Parisa Khoshvaght, Mohammad Adeli, Entesar Gemeay, Yazeed Alkhrijah, Mokhtar Mohammadi, Mehdi Hosseinzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the efficacy of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) in detecting abnormal phonocardiograms using two classification strategies: a single-classifier and an ensemble-classifier approach. Phonocardiograms were segmented into S1, systole, S2, and diastole intervals, with thirteen MFCCs estimated from each segment, yielding 52 MFCCs per beat. In the single-classifier strategy, the MFCCs from nine consecutive beats were averaged to classify phonocardiograms. Conversely, the ensemble-classifier strategy employed nine classifiers to individually assess beats as normal or abnormal, with the overall classification based on the majority vote. Both methods were tested on a publicly available phonocardiogram database. Results demonstrated that the ensemble-classifier strategy achieved higher accuracy compared to the single-classifier approach, establishing MFCCs as more effective than other features, including time, time-frequency, and statistical features, evaluated in similar studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ylva Gr{\o}nnings{\ae}ter, Halvor S. Sm{\o}rvik, Ole-Christoffer Granmo</p>
<p>Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) has achieved competitive results on several image classification benchmarks, including MNIST, K-MNIST, F-MNIST, and CIFAR-2. However, color image classification is arguably still in its infancy for TMs, with CIFAR-10 being a focal point for tracking progress. Over the past few years, TM's CIFAR-10 accuracy has increased from around 61% in 2020 to 75.1% in 2023 with the introduction of Drop Clause. In this paper, we leverage the recently proposed TM Composites architecture and introduce a range of TM Specialists that use various image processing techniques. These include Canny edge detection, Histogram of Oriented Gradients, adaptive mean thresholding, adaptive Gaussian thresholding, Otsu's thresholding, color thermometers, and adaptive color thermometers. In addition, we conduct a rigorous hyperparameter search, where we uncover optimal hyperparameters for several of the TM Specialists. The result is a toolbox that provides new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 for TMs with an accuracy of 82.8%. In conclusion, our toolbox of TM Specialists forms a foundation for new TM applications and a landmark for further research on TM Composites in image analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahan Li, Chaoran Cheng, Zuofan Wu, Ruihan Guo, Shitong Luo, Zhizhou Ren, Jian Peng, Jianzhu Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Peptides, short chains of amino acid residues, play a vital role in numerous biological processes by interacting with other target molecules, offering substantial potential in drug discovery. In this work, we present PepFlow, the first multi-modal deep generative model grounded in the flow-matching framework for the design of full-atom peptides that target specific protein receptors. Drawing inspiration from the crucial roles of residue backbone orientations and side-chain dynamics in protein-peptide interactions, we characterize the peptide structure using rigid backbone frames within the $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ manifold and side-chain angles on high-dimensional tori. Furthermore, we represent discrete residue types in the peptide sequence as categorical distributions on the probability simplex. By learning the joint distributions of each modality using derived flows and vector fields on corresponding manifolds, our method excels in the fine-grained design of full-atom peptides. Harnessing the multi-modal paradigm, our approach adeptly tackles various tasks such as fix-backbone sequence design and side-chain packing through partial sampling. Through meticulously crafted experiments, we demonstrate that PepFlow exhibits superior performance in comprehensive benchmarks, highlighting its significant potential in computational peptide design and analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naveen Raman, Ryan Shi, Fei Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) extend multi-armed bandits so pulling an arm impacts future states. Despite the success of RMABs, a key limiting assumption is the separability of rewards into a sum across arms. We address this deficiency by proposing restless-multi-armed bandit with global rewards (RMAB-G), a generalization of RMABs to global non-separable rewards. To solve RMAB-G, we develop the Linear- and Shapley-Whittle indices, which extend Whittle indices from RMABs to RMAB-Gs. We prove approximation bounds but also point out how these indices could fail when reward functions are highly non-linear. To overcome this, we propose two sets of adaptive policies: the first computes indices iteratively, and the second combines indices with Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed policies outperform baselines and index-based policies with synthetic data and real-world data from food rescue.</p>

This expansion has given rise to the Industrial IoT initiative where industries are utilizing IoT technology to enhance communication and connectivity through innovative solutions such as data analytics and cloud computing. However this widespread adoption of IoT is demanding of algorithms that provide better efficiency for the same training environment without speed being a factor.

Building upon the existing FedProx technique our implementation introduces slight modifications to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness. By leveraging FTL our proposed system aims to improve the accuracy of model obtained after the training dataset with the help of normalization techniques such that it performs better on real time devices and heterogeneous networks Our results indicate a significant increase in the throughput of approximately 90% better convergence compared to existing model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Po-Shao Lin, Jia-Fong Yeh, Yi-Ting Chen, Winston H. Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: We observe that current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods suffer from the performance imbalance issue when performing multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) tasks. While these methods may achieve impressive performance on average, they perform extremely poorly on a few tasks. To address this, we propose a new and effective method called STARS, which consists of two novel strategies: a shared-unique feature extractor and task-aware prioritized sampling. First, the shared-unique feature extractor learns both shared and task-specific features to enable better synergy of knowledge between different tasks. Second, the task-aware sampling strategy is combined with the prioritized experience replay for efficient learning on tasks with poor performance. The effectiveness and stability of our STARS are verified through experiments on the mainstream Meta-World benchmark. From the results, our STARS statistically outperforms current SOTA methods and alleviates the performance imbalance issue. Besides, we visualize the learned features to support our claims and enhance the interpretability of STARS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Ji, Boyong He, Chenyuan Qu, Zhuoyue Tan, Chuan Qin, Liaoni Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in synthesizing images across a wide range of scenarios with customizable prompts, indicating their effective capacity to capture universal features. Motivated by this, our study delves into the utilization of the implicit knowledge embedded within diffusion models to address challenges in cross-domain semantic segmentation. This paper investigates the approach that leverages the sampling and fusion techniques to harness the features of diffusion models efficiently. Contrary to the simplistic migration applications characterized by prior research, our finding reveals that the multi-step diffusion process inherent in the diffusion model manifests more robust semantic features. We propose DIffusion Feature Fusion (DIFF) as a backbone use for extracting and integrating effective semantic representations through the diffusion process. By leveraging the strength of text-to-image generation capability, we introduce a new training framework designed to implicitly learn posterior knowledge from it. Through rigorous evaluation in the contexts of domain generalization semantic segmentation, we establish that our methodology surpasses preceding approaches in mitigating discrepancies across distinct domains and attains the state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmark. Within the synthetic-to-real (syn-to-real) context, our method significantly outperforms ResNet-based and transformer-based backbone methods, achieving an average improvement of $3.84\%$ mIoU across various datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niccolo Anceschi, Federico Ferrari, David B. Dunson, Himel Mallick</p>
<p>Abstract: It is increasingly common in a wide variety of applied settings to collect data of multiple different types on the same set of samples. Our particular focus in this article is on studying relationships between such multiview features and responses. A motivating application arises in the context of precision medicine where multi-omics data are collected to correlate with clinical outcomes. It is of interest to infer dependence within and across views while combining multimodal information to improve the prediction of outcomes. The signal-to-noise ratio can vary substantially across views, motivating more nuanced statistical tools beyond standard late and early fusion. This challenge comes with the need to preserve interpretability, select features, and obtain accurate uncertainty quantification. We propose a joint additive factor regression model (JAFAR) with a structured additive design, accounting for shared and view-specific components. We ensure identifiability via a novel dependent cumulative shrinkage process (D-CUSP) prior. We provide an efficient implementation via a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler and extend our approach to allow flexible feature and outcome distributions. Prediction of time-to-labor onset from immunome, metabolome, and proteome data illustrates performance gains against state-of-the-art competitors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeonsung Jung, Heecheol Yun, Joonhyung Park, Jin-Hwa Kim, Eunho Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable performance in learning 3D scenes. However, NeRF exhibits vulnerability when confronted with distractors in the training images -- unexpected objects are present only within specific views, such as moving entities like pedestrians or birds. Excluding distractors during dataset construction is a straightforward solution, but without prior knowledge of their types and quantities, it becomes prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose PruNeRF, a segment-centric dataset pruning framework via 3D spatial consistency, that effectively identifies and prunes the distractors. We first examine existing metrics for measuring pixel-wise distraction and introduce Influence Functions for more accurate measurements. Then, we assess 3D spatial consistency using a depth-based reprojection technique to obtain 3D-aware distraction. Furthermore, we incorporate segmentation for pixel-to-segment refinement, enabling more precise identification. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PruNeRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robustness against distractors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aozhong Zhang, Naigang Wang, Yanxia Deng, Xin Li, Zi Yang, Penghang Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple optimization-based preprocessing technique called Weight Magnitude Reduction (MagR) to improve the performance of post-training quantization. For each linear layer, we adjust the pre-trained floating-point weights by solving an $\ell_\infty$-regularized optimization problem. This process greatly diminishes the maximum magnitude of the weights and smooths out outliers, while preserving the layer's output. The preprocessed weights are centered more towards zero, which facilitates the subsequent quantization process. To implement MagR, we address the $\ell_\infty$-regularization by employing an efficient proximal gradient descent algorithm. Unlike existing preprocessing methods that involve linear transformations and subsequent post-processing steps, which can introduce significant overhead at inference time, MagR functions as a non-linear transformation, eliminating the need for any additional post-processing. This ensures that MagR introduces no overhead whatsoever during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that MagR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Llama family of models. For example, we achieve a Wikitext2 perplexity of 5.95 on the LLaMA2-70B model for per-channel INT2 weight quantization without incurring any inference overhead.</p>

For roughly 25% of these students, AI has begun to substitute for attending office hours and completing required readings. Half of students are concerned that AI will negatively impact their job prospects, and over half of students wish that Harvard had more classes on the future impacts of AI. We also investigate students' outlook on the broader social implications of AI, finding that half of students are worried that AI will increase economic inequality, and 40% believe that extinction risk from AI should be treated as a global priority with the same urgency as pandemics and nuclear war. Around half of students who have taken a class on AI expect AI to exceed human capabilities on almost all tasks within 30 years. We make some recommendations to the Harvard community in light of these results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixin Lan, Tao Fang, Derek F. Wong, Yabo Xu, Lidia S. Chao, Cecilia G. Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have shown impressive results in various Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, such as powering chatbots and generating stories. However, an ethical concern arises due to their potential to produce verbatim copies of paragraphs from their training data. This is problematic as PLMs are trained on corpora constructed by human authors. As such, there is a pressing need for research to promote the generation of original content by these models. In this study, we introduce a unique "self-plagiarism" contrastive decoding strategy, aimed at boosting the originality of text produced by PLMs. Our method entails modifying prompts in LLMs to develop an amateur model and a professional model. Specifically, the amateur model is urged to plagiarize using three plagiarism templates we have designed, while the professional model maintains its standard language model status. This strategy employs prompts to stimulate the model's capacity to identify non-original candidate token combinations and subsequently impose penalties. The application of this strategy is integrated prior to the model's final layer, ensuring smooth integration with most existing PLMs (T5, GPT, LLaMA) without necessitating further adjustments. Implementing our strategy, we observe a significant decline in non-original sequences comprised of more than three words in the academic AASC dataset and the story-based ROCStories dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores the formality style transfer in Persian, particularly relevant in the face of the increasing prevalence of informal language on digital platforms, which poses challenges for existing Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools. The aim is to transform informal text into formal while retaining the original meaning, addressing both lexical and syntactic differences. We introduce a novel model, Fa-BERT2BERT, based on the Fa-BERT architecture, incorporating consistency learning and gradient-based dynamic weighting. This approach improves the model's understanding of syntactic variations, balancing loss components effectively during training. Our evaluation of Fa-BERT2BERT against existing methods employs new metrics designed to accurately measure syntactic and stylistic changes. Results demonstrate our model's superior performance over traditional techniques across various metrics, including BLEU, BERT score, Rouge-l, and proposed metrics underscoring its ability to adeptly navigate the complexities of Persian language style transfer. This study significantly contributes to Persian language processing by enhancing the accuracy and functionality of NLP models and thereby supports the development of more efficient and reliable NLP applications, capable of handling language style transformation effectively, thereby streamlining content moderation, enhancing data mining results, and facilitating cross-cultural communication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timothy Ossowski, Junjie Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent generalist vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities across diverse multimodal tasks. However, these models still struggle with fine-grained object-level understanding and grounding. In terms of modeling, existing VLMs implicitly align text tokens with image patch tokens, which is ineffective for embedding alignment at the same granularity and inevitably introduces noisy spurious background features. Additionally, these models struggle when generalizing to unseen visual concepts and may not be reliable for domain-specific tasks without further fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method to prompt large language models with in-context visual object vectors, thereby enabling controllable object-level reasoning. This eliminates the necessity of fusing a lengthy array of image patch features and significantly speeds up training. Furthermore, we propose region-level retrieval using our object representations, facilitating rapid adaptation to new objects without additional training. Our experiments reveal that our method achieves competitive referring object classification and captioning performance, while also offering zero-shot generalization and robustness to visually challenging contexts.</p>

Data splitting is crucial for the reliable benchmarking of such AI models. Traditional random data splits produce similar molecules between training and test sets, conflicting with the reality of VS libraries which mostly contain structurally distinct compounds. Scaffold split, grouping molecules by shared core structure, is widely considered to reflect this real-world scenario. However, here we show that this split also overestimates VS performance. Our study examined three representative AI models on 60 datasets from NCI-60 using scaffold split and a more realistic Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)-based clustering split. We found models perform substantially worse under UMAP splits. These results highlight the need for improved benchmarks to tune, compare, and select models for VS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Roberts, Samuel Guo, Zhiqi Gao, Satya Sai Srinath Namburi GNVV, Sonia Cromp, Chengjun Wu, Chengyu Duan, Frederic Sala</p>
<p>Abstract: While Transformers underpin modern large language models (LMs), there is a growing list of alternative architectures with new capabilities, promises, and tradeoffs. This makes choosing the right LM architecture challenging. Recently-proposed $\textit{hybrid architectures}$ seek a best-of-all-worlds approach that reaps the benefits of all architectures. Hybrid design is difficult for two reasons: it requires manual expert-driven search, and new hybrids must be trained from scratch. We propose $\textbf{Manticore}$, a framework that addresses these challenges. Manticore $\textit{automates the design of hybrid architectures}$ while reusing pretrained models to create $\textit{pretrained}$ hybrids. Our approach augments ideas from differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) by incorporating simple projectors that translate features between pretrained blocks from different architectures. We then fine-tune hybrids that combine pretrained models from different architecture families -- such as the GPT series and Mamba -- end-to-end. With Manticore, we enable LM selection without training multiple models, the construction of pretrained hybrids from existing pretrained models, and the ability to $\textit{program}$ pretrained hybrids to have certain capabilities. Manticore hybrids outperform existing manually-designed hybrids, achieve strong performance on Long Range Arena (LRA) tasks, and can improve on pretrained transformers and state space models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahsa Kadkhodaei Elyaderani, Shahram Shirani</p>
<p>Abstract: The process of reconstructing missing parts of speech audio from context is called speech in-painting. Human perception of speech is inherently multi-modal, involving both audio and visual (AV) cues. In this paper, we introduce and study a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) speech in-painting model that incorporates AV features. Our approach extends AV speech in-painting techniques to scenarios where both audio and visual data may be jointly corrupted. To achieve this, we employ a multi-modal training paradigm that boosts the robustness of our model across various conditions involving acoustic and visual distortions. This makes our distortion-aware model a plausible solution for real-world challenging environments. We compare our method with existing transformer-based and recurrent neural network-based models, which attempt to reconstruct missing speech gaps ranging from a few milliseconds to over a second. Our experimental results demonstrate that our novel seq2seq architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art transformer solution by 38.8% in terms of enhancing speech quality and 7.14% in terms of improving speech intelligibility. We exploit a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously performs lip-reading (transcribing video components to text) while reconstructing missing parts of the associated speech.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyue Stella Li, Vidhisha Balachandran, Shangbin Feng, Jonathan Ilgen, Emma Pierson, Pang Wei Koh, Yulia Tsvetkov</p>
<p>Abstract: In high-stakes domains like medical reasoning, AI assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) are yet to be reliable and safe. We identify a key obstacle towards reliability: existing LLMs are trained to answer any question, even with incomplete context in the prompt or insufficient parametric knowledge. We propose to change this paradigm to develop more careful LLMs that ask follow-up questions to gather necessary and sufficient information and respond reliably. We introduce MEDIQ, a framework to simulate realistic clinical interactions, which incorporates a Patient System and an adaptive Expert System. The Patient may provide incomplete information in the beginning; the Expert refrains from making diagnostic decisions when unconfident, and instead elicits missing details from the Patient via follow-up questions. To evaluate MEDIQ, we convert MEDQA and CRAFT-MD -- medical benchmarks for diagnostic question answering -- into an interactive setup. We develop a reliable Patient system and prototype several Expert systems, first showing that directly prompting state-of-the-art LLMs to ask questions degrades the quality of clinical reasoning, indicating that adapting LLMs to interactive information-seeking settings is nontrivial. We then augment the Expert with a novel abstention module to better estimate model confidence and decide whether to ask more questions, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy by 20.3%; however, performance still lags compared to an (unrealistic in practice) upper bound when full information is given upfront. Further analyses reveal that interactive performance can be improved by filtering irrelevant contexts and reformatting conversations. Overall, our paper introduces a novel problem towards LLM reliability, a novel MEDIQ framework, and highlights important future directions to extend the information-seeking abilities of LLM assistants in critical domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alice Bizzarri, Chung-En Yu, Brian Jalaian, Fabrizio Riguzzi, Nathaniel D. Bastian</p>
<p>Abstract: The prevailing approaches in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are often hampered by issues such as high resource consumption, significant computational demands, and poor interpretability. Furthermore, these systems generally struggle to identify novel, rapidly changing cyber threats. This paper delves into the potential of incorporating Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence (NSAI) into NIDS, combining deep learning's data-driven strengths with symbolic AI's logical reasoning to tackle the dynamic challenges in cybersecurity, which also includes detailed NSAI techniques introduction for cyber professionals to explore the potential strengths of NSAI in NIDS. The inclusion of NSAI in NIDS marks potential advancements in both the detection and interpretation of intricate network threats, benefiting from the robust pattern recognition of neural networks and the interpretive prowess of symbolic reasoning. By analyzing network traffic data types and machine learning architectures, we illustrate NSAI's distinctive capability to offer more profound insights into network behavior, thereby improving both detection performance and the adaptability of the system. This merging of technologies not only enhances the functionality of traditional NIDS but also sets the stage for future developments in building more resilient, interpretable, and dynamic defense mechanisms against advanced cyber threats. The continued progress in this area is poised to transform NIDS into a system that is both responsive to known threats and anticipatory of emerging, unseen ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jintang Li, Ruofan Wu, Xinzhou Jin, Boqun Ma, Liang Chen, Zibin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past few years, research on deep graph learning has shifted from static graphs to temporal graphs in response to real-world complex systems that exhibit dynamic behaviors. In practice, temporal graphs are formalized as an ordered sequence of static graph snapshots observed at discrete time points. Sequence models such as RNNs or Transformers have long been the predominant backbone networks for modeling such temporal graphs. Yet, despite the promising results, RNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are burdened by quadratic computational complexity. Recently, state space models (SSMs), which are framed as discretized representations of an underlying continuous-time linear dynamical system, have garnered substantial attention and achieved breakthrough advancements in independent sequence modeling. In this work, we undertake a principled investigation that extends SSM theory to temporal graphs by integrating structural information into the online approximation objective via the adoption of a Laplacian regularization term. The emergent continuous-time system introduces novel algorithmic challenges, thereby necessitating our development of GraphSSM, a graph state space model for modeling the dynamics of temporal graphs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our GraphSSM framework across various temporal graph benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shicheng Xu, Liang Pang, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) utilizes retrieved texts to enhance large language models (LLMs). However, studies show that RAG is not consistently effective and can even mislead LLMs due to noisy or incorrect retrieved texts. This suggests that RAG possesses a duality including both benefit and detriment. Although many existing methods attempt to address this issue, they lack a theoretical explanation for the duality in RAG. The benefit and detriment within this duality remain a black box that cannot be quantified or compared in an explainable manner. This paper takes the first step in theoretically giving the essential explanation of benefit and detriment in RAG by: (1) decoupling and formalizing them from RAG prediction, (2) approximating the gap between their values by representation similarity and (3) establishing the trade-off mechanism between them, to make them explainable, quantifiable, and comparable. We demonstrate that the distribution difference between retrieved texts and LLMs' knowledge acts as double-edged sword, bringing both benefit and detriment. We also prove that the actual effect of RAG can be predicted at token level. Based on our theory, we propose a practical novel method, X-RAG, which achieves collaborative generation between pure LLM and RAG at token level to preserve benefit and avoid detriment. Experiments in real-world tasks based on LLMs including OPT, LLaMA-2, and Mistral show the effectiveness of our method and support our theoretical results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqi Liu, Sannyuya Liu, Lele Sha, Zijie Zeng, Dragan Gasevic, Zhi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Various machine learning approaches have gained significant popularity for the automated classification of educational text to identify indicators of learning engagement -- i.e. learning engagement classification (LEC). LEC can offer comprehensive insights into human learning processes, attracting significant interest from diverse research communities, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Learning Analytics, and Educational Data Mining. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated remarkable performance in various NLP tasks. However, their comprehensive evaluation and improvement approaches in LEC tasks have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we propose the Annotation Guidelines-based Knowledge Augmentation (AGKA) approach to improve LLMs. AGKA employs GPT 4.0 to retrieve label definition knowledge from annotation guidelines, and then applies the random under-sampler to select a few typical examples. Subsequently, we conduct a systematic evaluation benchmark of LEC, which includes six LEC datasets covering behavior classification (question and urgency level), emotion classification (binary and epistemic emotion), and cognition classification (opinion and cognitive presence). The study results demonstrate that AGKA can enhance non-fine-tuned LLMs, particularly GPT 4.0 and Llama 3 70B. GPT 4.0 with AGKA few-shot outperforms full-shot fine-tuned models such as BERT and RoBERTa on simple binary classification datasets. However, GPT 4.0 lags in multi-class tasks that require a deep understanding of complex semantic information. Notably, Llama 3 70B with AGKA is a promising combination based on open-source LLM, because its performance is on par with closed-source GPT 4.0 with AGKA. In addition, LLMs struggle to distinguish between labels with similar names in multi-class classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinglin Chen, Yishuai Cai, Yunxin Mao, Minglong Li, Zhou Yang, Wen Shanghua, Wenjing Yang, Weixia Xu, Ji Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Behavior Tree (BT) planning is crucial for autonomous robot behavior control, yet its application in complex scenarios is hampered by long planning times. Pruning and heuristics are common techniques to accelerate planning, but it is difficult to design general pruning strategies and heuristic functions for BT planning problems. This paper proposes improving BT planning efficiency for everyday service robots leveraging commonsense reasoning provided by Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to model-free pre-planning action space pruning and heuristic generation. This approach takes advantage of the modularity and interpretability of BT nodes, represented by predicate logic, to enable LLMs to predict the task-relevant action predicates and objects, and even the optimal path, without an explicit action model. We propose the Heuristic Optimal Behavior Tree Expansion Algorithm (HOBTEA) with two heuristic variants and provide a formal comparison and discussion of their efficiency and optimality. We introduce a learnable and transferable commonsense library to enhance the LLM's reasoning performance without fine-tuning. The action space expansion based on the commonsense library can further increase the success rate of planning. Experiments show the theoretical bounds of commonsense pruning and heuristic, and demonstrate the actual performance of LLM learning and reasoning with the commonsense library. Results in four datasets showcase the practical effectiveness of our approach in everyday service robot applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retriever Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become pivotal in enhancing the capabilities of language models by incorporating external knowledge retrieval mechanisms. However, a significant challenge in deploying these systems in industry applications is the detection and mitigation of hallucinations: instances where the model generates information that is not grounded in the retrieved context. Addressing this issue is crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of responses generated by large language models (LLMs) in diverse industry settings. Current hallucination detection techniques fail to deliver accuracy, low latency, and low cost simultaneously. We introduce Luna: a DeBERTA-large (440M) encoder, finetuned for hallucination detection in RAG settings. We demonstrate that Luna outperforms GPT-3.5 and commercial evaluation frameworks on the hallucination detection task, with 97% and 96% reduction in cost and latency, respectively. Luna is lightweight and generalizes across multiple industry verticals and out-of-domain data, making it an ideal candidate for industry LLM applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kezhen Chen, Rahul Thapa, Rahul Chalamala, Ben Athiwaratkun, Shuaiwen Leon Song, James Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) suggest that higher image resolution enhances the fine-grained understanding of image details, crucial for tasks such as visual commonsense reasoning and analyzing biomedical images. However, increasing input resolution poses two main challenges: 1) It extends the context length required by the language model, leading to inefficiencies and hitting the model's context limit; 2) It increases the complexity of visual features, necessitating more training data or more complex architecture. We introduce Dragonfly, a new LMM architecture that enhances fine-grained visual understanding and reasoning about image regions to address these challenges. Dragonfly employs two key strategies: multi-resolution visual encoding and zoom-in patch selection. These strategies allow the model to process high-resolution images efficiently while maintaining reasonable context length. Our experiments on eight popular benchmarks demonstrate that Dragonfly achieves competitive or better performance compared to other architectures, highlighting the effectiveness of our design. Additionally, we finetuned Dragonfly on biomedical instructions, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple biomedical tasks requiring fine-grained visual understanding, including 92.3% accuracy on the Path-VQA dataset (compared to 83.3% for Med-Gemini) and the highest reported results on biomedical image captioning. To support model training, we curated a visual instruction-tuning dataset with 5.5 million image-instruction samples in the general domain and 1.4 million samples in the biomedical domain. We also conducted ablation studies to characterize the impact of various architectural designs and image resolutions, providing insights for future research on visual instruction alignment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyu Lu, Bo Xu, Xiaokun Zhang, Kaiyuan Liu, Dongyu Zhang, Liang Yang, Hongfei Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Current methods of toxic language detection (TLD) typically rely on specific tokens to conduct decisions, which makes them suffer from lexical bias, leading to inferior performance and generalization. Lexical bias has both "useful" and "misleading" impacts on understanding toxicity. Unfortunately, instead of distinguishing between these impacts, current debiasing methods typically eliminate them indiscriminately, resulting in a degradation in the detection accuracy of the model. To this end, we propose a Counterfactual Causal Debiasing Framework (CCDF) to mitigate lexical bias in TLD. It preserves the "useful impact" of lexical bias and eliminates the "misleading impact". Specifically, we first represent the total effect of the original sentence and biased tokens on decisions from a causal view. We then conduct counterfactual inference to exclude the direct causal effect of lexical bias from the total effect. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the debiased TLD model incorporating CCDF achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and fairness compared to competitive baselines applied on several vanilla models. The generalization capability of our model outperforms current debiased models for out-of-distribution data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangruibo Ding, Jinjun Peng, Marcus J. Min, Gail Kaiser, Junfeng Yang, Baishakhi Ray</p>
<p>Abstract: Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have excelled at tasks like code completion but often miss deeper semantics such as execution effects and dynamic states. This paper aims to bridge the gap between Code LLMs' reliance on static text data and the need for thorough semantic understanding for complex tasks like debugging and program repair. We introduce a novel strategy to train Code LLMs with comprehensive semantics, encompassing high-level functional descriptions, local execution effects of individual statements, and overall input/output behavior, thereby linking static code text with dynamic execution states. We begin by collecting PyX, a clean code corpus of fully executable samples with functional descriptions and execution tracing. We propose training Code LLMs to write code and represent and reason about execution behaviors using natural language, mimicking human verbal debugging. This approach led to the development of SemCoder, a Code LLM with only 6.7B parameters, which shows competitive performance with GPT-3.5-turbo on code generation and execution reasoning tasks. SemCoder achieves 81.1% on HumanEval (GPT-3.5-turbo: 76.8%) and 54.5% on CRUXEval-I (GPT-3.5-turbo: 50.3%). We also study the effectiveness of SemCoder's monologue-style execution reasoning compared to concrete scratchpad reasoning, showing that our approach integrates semantics from multiple dimensions more smoothly. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of applying learned semantics to improve Code LLMs' debugging and self-refining capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective tracking of surrounding traffic participants allows for an accurate state estimation as a necessary ingredient for prediction of future behavior and therefore adequate planning of the ego vehicle trajectory. One approach for detecting and tracking surrounding traffic participants is the combination of a learning based object detector with a classical tracking algorithm. Learning based object detectors have been shown to work adequately on lidar and camera data, while learning based object detectors using standard radar data input have proven to be inferior. Recently, with the improvements to radar sensor technology in the form of imaging radars, the object detection performance on radar was greatly improved but is still limited compared to lidar sensors due to the sparsity of the radar point cloud. This presents a unique challenge for the task of multi-object tracking. The tracking algorithm must overcome the limited detection quality while generating consistent tracks. To this end, a comparison between different multi-object tracking methods on imaging radar data is required to investigate its potential for downstream tasks. The work at hand compares multiple approaches and analyzes their limitations when applied to imaging radar data. Furthermore, enhancements to the presented approaches in the form of probabilistic association algorithms are considered for this task.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent research, Tensor Product Representation (TPR) is applied for the systematic generalization task of deep neural networks by learning the compositional structure of data. However, such prior works show limited performance in discovering and representing the symbolic structure from unseen test data because their decomposition to the structural representations was incomplete. In this work, we propose an Attention-based Iterative Decomposition (AID) module designed to enhance the decomposition operations for the structured representations encoded from the sequential input data with TPR. Our AID can be easily adapted to any TPR-based model and provides enhanced systematic decomposition through a competitive attention mechanism between input features and structured representations. In our experiments, AID shows effectiveness by significantly improving the performance of TPR-based prior works on the series of systematic generalization tasks. Moreover, in the quantitative and qualitative evaluations, AID produces more compositional and well-bound structural representations than other works.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate analysis of 3D myocardium deformation using high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) datasets with ground truth (GT) annotations is crucial for advancing cardiovascular imaging research. However, the scarcity of such datasets poses a significant challenge for developing robust myocardium deformation analysis models. To address this, we propose a novel approach to synthetic data generation for enriching cardiovascular imaging datasets.

We outline the data preparation from a cardiac four-dimensional (4D) CT scan, selection of parameters, and the subsequent creation of synthetic data from the same or other sources of 3D cardiac CT data for training.
  Our work contributes to overcoming the limitations imposed by the scarcity of high-resolution CT datasets with precise annotations, thereby facilitating the development of accurate and reliable myocardium deformation analysis algorithms for clinical applications and diagnostics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fatemeh Shiri, Van Nguyen, Farhad Moghimifar, John Yoo, Gholamreza Haffari, Yuan-Fang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant capabilities in processing natural language data, promising efficient knowledge extraction from diverse textual sources to enhance situational awareness and support decision-making. However, concerns arise due to their susceptibility to hallucination, resulting in contextually inaccurate content. This work focuses on harnessing LLMs for automated Event Extraction, introducing a new method to address hallucination by decomposing the task into Event Detection and Event Argument Extraction. Moreover, the proposed method integrates dynamic schema-aware augmented retrieval examples into prompts tailored for each specific inquiry, thereby extending and adapting advanced prompting techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Evaluation findings on prominent event extraction benchmarks and results from a synthesized benchmark illustrate the method's superior performance compared to baseline approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficient resource utilization and perfect user experience usually conflict with each other in cloud computing platforms. Great efforts have been invested in increasing resource utilization but trying not to affect users' experience for cloud computing platforms. In order to better utilize the remaining pieces of computing resources spread over the whole platform, deferrable jobs are provided with a discounted price to users. For this type of deferrable jobs, users are allowed to submit jobs that will run for a specific uninterrupted duration in a flexible range of time in the future with a great discount. With these deferrable jobs to be scheduled under the remaining capacity after deploying those on-demand jobs, it remains a challenge to achieve high resource utilization and meanwhile shorten the waiting time for users as much as possible in an online manner. In this paper, we propose an online deferrable job scheduling method called \textit{Online Scheduling for DEferrable jobs in Cloud} (\OSDEC{}), where a deep reinforcement learning model is adopted to learn the scheduling policy, and several auxiliary tasks are utilized to provide better state representations and improve the performance of the model. With the integrated reinforcement learning framework, the proposed method can well plan the deployment schedule and achieve a short waiting time for users while maintaining a high resource utilization for the platform. The proposed method is validated on a public dataset and shows superior performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuehui Yu, Yi Guan, Rujia Shen, Xin Li, Chen Tang, Jingchi Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Model-based offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) allows agents to fully utilise pre-collected datasets without requiring additional or unethical explorations. However, applying model-based offline RL to online systems presents challenges, primarily due to the highly suboptimal (noise-filled) and diverse nature of datasets generated by online systems. To tackle these issues, we introduce the Causal Prompting Reinforcement Learning (CPRL) framework, designed for highly suboptimal and resource-constrained online scenarios. The initial phase of CPRL involves the introduction of the Hidden-Parameter Block Causal Prompting Dynamic (Hip-BCPD) to model environmental dynamics. This approach utilises invariant causal prompts and aligns hidden parameters to generalise to new and diverse online users. In the subsequent phase, a single policy is trained to address multiple tasks through the amalgamation of reusable skills, circumventing the need for training from scratch. Experiments conducted across datasets with varying levels of noise, including simulation-based and real-world offline datasets from the Dnurse APP, demonstrate that our proposed method can make robust decisions in out-of-distribution and noisy environments, outperforming contemporary algorithms. Additionally, we separately verify the contributions of Hip-BCPDs and the skill-reuse strategy to the robustness of performance. We further analyse the visualised structure of Hip-BCPD and the interpretability of sub-skills. We released our source code and the first ever real-world medical dataset for precise medical decision-making tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaxin Li, Qi Xu, Jiangrong Shen, Hongming Xu, Long Chen, Gang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of deep and large-scale spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibiting high performance across diverse complex datasets has led to a need for compressing network models due to the presence of a significant number of redundant structural units, aiming to more effectively leverage their low-power consumption and biological interpretability advantages. Currently, most model compression techniques for SNNs are based on unstructured pruning of individual connections, which requires specific hardware support. Hence, we propose a structured pruning approach based on the activity levels of convolutional kernels named Spiking Channel Activity-based (SCA) network pruning framework. Inspired by synaptic plasticity mechanisms, our method dynamically adjusts the network's structure by pruning and regenerating convolutional kernels during training, enhancing the model's adaptation to the current target task. While maintaining model performance, this approach refines the network architecture, ultimately reducing computational load and accelerating the inference process. This indicates that structured dynamic sparse learning methods can better facilitate the application of deep SNNs in low-power and high-efficiency scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a framework for global-scale canopy height estimation based on satellite data. Our model leverages advanced data preprocessing techniques, resorts to a novel loss function designed to counter geolocation inaccuracies inherent in the ground-truth height measurements, and employs data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission to effectively filter out erroneous labels in mountainous regions, enhancing the reliability of our predictions in those areas. A comparison between predictions and ground-truth labels yields an MAE / RMSE of 2.43 / 4.73 (meters) overall and 4.45 / 6.72 (meters) for trees taller than five meters, which depicts a substantial improvement compared to existing global-scale maps. The resulting height map as well as the underlying framework will facilitate and enhance ecological analyses at a global scale, including, but not limited to, large-scale forest and biomass monitoring.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advancements in egocentric video datasets like Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens, and Ego-Exo4D have enriched the study of first-person human interactions, which is crucial for applications in augmented reality and assisted living. Despite these advancements, current Online Action Detection methods, which efficiently detect actions in streaming videos, are predominantly designed for exocentric views and thus fail to capitalize on the unique perspectives inherent to egocentric videos. To address this gap, we introduce an Object-Aware Module that integrates egocentric-specific priors into existing OAD frameworks, enhancing first-person footage interpretation. Utilizing object-specific details and temporal dynamics, our module improves scene understanding in detecting actions. Validated extensively on the Epic-Kitchens 100 dataset, our work can be seamlessly integrated into existing models with minimal overhead and bring consistent performance enhancements, marking an important step forward in adapting action detection systems to egocentric video analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanlin Gu, Jiahuan Luo, Yan Kang, Yuan Yao, Gongxi Zhu, Bowen Li, Lixin Fan, Qiang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a collaborative approach that allows multiple clients to jointly learn a machine learning model without sharing their private data. The concern about privacy leakage, albeit demonstrated under specific conditions, has triggered numerous follow-up research in designing powerful attacking methods and effective defending mechanisms aiming to thwart these attacking methods. Nevertheless, privacy-preserving mechanisms employed in these defending methods invariably lead to compromised model performances due to a fixed obfuscation applied to private data or gradients. In this article, we, therefore, propose a novel adaptive obfuscation mechanism, coined FedAdOb, to protect private data without yielding original model performances. Technically, FedAdOb utilizes passport-based adaptive obfuscation to ensure data privacy in both horizontal and vertical federated learning settings. The privacy-preserving capabilities of FedAdOb, specifically with regard to private features and labels, are theoretically proven through Theorems 1 and 2. Furthermore, extensive experimental evaluations conducted on various datasets and network architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of FedAdOb by manifesting its superior trade-off between privacy preservation and model performance, surpassing existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Having large amounts of annotated data significantly impacts the effectiveness of deep neural networks. However, the annotation task can be very expensive in some domains, such as medical data. Thus, it is important to select the data to be annotated wisely, which is known as the subset selection problem. We investigate the relationship between subset selection and neural network pruning, which is more widely studied, and establish a correspondence between them. Leveraging insights from network pruning, we propose utilizing the norm criterion of neural network features to improve subset selection methods. We empirically validate our proposed strategy on various networks and datasets, demonstrating enhanced accuracy. This shows the potential of employing pruning tools for subset selection.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the Lagrange Policy for Continuous Actions (LPCA), a reinforcement learning algorithm specifically designed for weakly coupled MDP problems with continuous action spaces. LPCA addresses the challenge of resource constraints dependent on continuous actions by introducing a Lagrange relaxation of the weakly coupled MDP problem within a neural network framework for Q-value computation. This approach effectively decouples the MDP, enabling efficient policy learning in resource-constrained environments. We present two variations of LPCA: LPCA-DE, which utilizes differential evolution for global optimization, and LPCA-Greedy, a method that incrementally and greadily selects actions based on Q-value gradients. Comparative analysis against other state-of-the-art techniques across various settings highlight LPCA's robustness and efficiency in managing resource allocation while maximizing rewards.</p>

In this article, we develop a method for extracting immediately human interpretable classifiers from tabular data. The classifiers are given in the form of short Boolean formulas built with propositions that can either be directly extracted from categorical attributes or dynamically computed from numeric ones. Our method is implemented using Answer Set Programming. We investigate seven datasets and compare our results to ones obtainable by state-of-the-art classifiers for tabular data, namely, XGBoost and random forests. Over all datasets, the accuracies obtainable by our method are similar to the reference methods. The advantage of our classifiers in all cases is that they are very short and immediately human intelligible as opposed to the black-box nature of the reference methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eros Fan\`i, Raffaello Camoriano, Barbara Caputo, Marco Ciccone</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) methods often struggle in highly statistically heterogeneous settings. Indeed, non-IID data distributions cause client drift and biased local solutions, particularly pronounced in the final classification layer, negatively impacting convergence speed and accuracy. To address this issue, we introduce Federated Recursive Ridge Regression (Fed3R). Our method fits a Ridge Regression classifier computed in closed form leveraging pre-trained features. Fed3R is immune to statistical heterogeneity and is invariant to the sampling order of the clients. Therefore, it proves particularly effective in cross-device scenarios. Furthermore, it is fast and efficient in terms of communication and computation costs, requiring up to two orders of magnitude fewer resources than the competitors. Finally, we propose to leverage the Fed3R parameters as an initialization for a softmax classifier and subsequently fine-tune the model using any FL algorithm (Fed3R with Fine-Tuning, Fed3R+FT). Our findings also indicate that maintaining a fixed classifier aids in stabilizing the training and learning more discriminative features in cross-device settings.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have performed remarkably well in various natural language processing tasks by benchmarking, including in the Western medical domain. However, the professional evaluation benchmarks for LLMs have yet to be covered in the traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) domain, which has a profound history and vast influence. To address this research gap, we introduce TCM-Bench, an comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM performance in TCM. It comprises the TCM-ED dataset, consisting of 5,473 questions sourced from the TCM Licensing Exam (TCMLE), including 1,300 questions with authoritative analysis. It covers the core components of TCMLE, including TCM basis and clinical practice. To evaluate LLMs beyond accuracy of question answering, we propose TCMScore, a metric tailored for evaluating the quality of answers generated by LLMs for TCM related questions. It comprehensively considers the consistency of TCM semantics and knowledge. After conducting comprehensive experimental analyses from diverse perspectives, we can obtain the following findings: (1) The unsatisfactory performance of LLMs on this benchmark underscores their significant room for improvement in TCM. (2) Introducing domain knowledge can enhance LLMs' performance. However, for in-domain models like ZhongJing-TCM, the quality of generated analysis text has decreased, and we hypothesize that their fine-tuning process affects the basic LLM capabilities. (3) Traditional metrics for text generation quality like Rouge and BertScore are susceptible to text length and surface semantic ambiguity, while domain-specific metrics such as TCMScore can further supplement and explain their evaluation results. These findings highlight the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in the TCM and aim to provide a more profound assistance to medical research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avishek Ghosh, Arya Mazumdar</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixed linear regression is a well-studied problem in parametric statistics and machine learning. Given a set of samples, tuples of covariates and labels, the task of mixed linear regression is to find a small list of linear relationships that best fit the samples. Usually it is assumed that the label is generated stochastically by randomly selecting one of two or more linear functions, applying this chosen function to the covariates, and potentially introducing noise to the result. In that situation, the objective is to estimate the ground-truth linear functions up to some parameter error. The popular expectation maximization (EM) and alternating minimization (AM) algorithms have been previously analyzed for this.
  In this paper, we consider the more general problem of agnostic learning of mixed linear regression from samples, without such generative models. In particular, we show that the AM and EM algorithms, under standard conditions of separability and good initialization, lead to agnostic learning in mixed linear regression by converging to the population loss minimizers, for suitably defined loss functions. In some sense, this shows the strength of AM and EM algorithms that converges to ``optimal solutions'' even in the absence of realizable generative models.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores the risk preferences of Large Language Models (LLMs) and how the process of aligning them with human ethical standards influences their economic decision-making. By analyzing 30 LLMs, we uncover a broad range of inherent risk profiles ranging from risk-averse to risk-seeking. We then explore how different types of AI alignment, a process that ensures models act according to human values and that focuses on harmlessness, helpfulness, and honesty, alter these base risk preferences. Alignment significantly shifts LLMs towards risk aversion, with models that incorporate all three ethical dimensions exhibiting the most conservative investment behavior. Replicating a prior study that used LLMs to predict corporate investments from company earnings call transcripts, we demonstrate that although some alignment can improve the accuracy of investment forecasts, excessive alignment results in overly cautious predictions. These findings suggest that deploying excessively aligned LLMs in financial decision-making could lead to severe underinvestment. We underline the need for a nuanced approach that carefully balances the degree of ethical alignment with the specific requirements of economic domains when leveraging LLMs within finance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanhua Huang, Yuchen Zhang, Zhe Li, Yongjian You, Mingze Wang, Zhouwang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) has sparked concerns about the potential misuse of AI-generated text, as these models can produce content that closely resembles human-generated text. Current detectors for AI-generated text (AIGT) lack robustness against adversarial perturbations, with even minor changes in characters or words causing a reversal in distinguishing between human-created and AI-generated text. This paper investigates the robustness of existing AIGT detection methods and introduces a novel detector, the Siamese Calibrated Reconstruction Network (SCRN). The SCRN employs a reconstruction network to add and remove noise from text, extracting a semantic representation that is robust to local perturbations. We also propose a siamese calibration technique to train the model to make equally confidence predictions under different noise, which improves the model's robustness against adversarial perturbations. Experiments on four publicly available datasets show that the SCRN outperforms all baseline methods, achieving 6.5\%-18.25\% absolute accuracy improvement over the best baseline method under adversarial attacks. Moreover, it exhibits superior generalizability in cross-domain, cross-genre, and mixed-source scenarios. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/CarlanLark/Robust-AIGC-Detector}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Working with high-dimensional data is a common practice, in the field of machine learning. Identifying relevant input features is thus crucial, so as to obtain compact dataset more prone for effective numerical handling. Further, by isolating pivotal elements that form the basis of decision making, one can contribute to elaborate on - ex post - models' interpretability, so far rather elusive. Here, we propose a novel method to estimate the relative importance of the input components for a Deep Neural Network. This is achieved by leveraging on a spectral re-parametrization of the optimization process. Eigenvalues associated to input nodes provide in fact a robust proxy to gauge the relevance of the supplied entry features. Unlike existing techniques, the spectral features ranking is carried out automatically, as a byproduct of the network training. The technique is successfully challenged against both synthetic and real data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Zhou, Mario Fritz, Margret Keuper</p>
<p>Abstract: SoftMax is a ubiquitous ingredient of modern machine learning algorithms. It maps an input vector onto a probability simplex and reweights the input by concentrating the probability mass at large entries. Yet, as a smooth approximation to the Argmax function, a significant amount of probability mass is distributed to other, residual entries, leading to poor interpretability and noise. Although sparsity can be achieved by a family of SoftMax variants, they often require an alternative loss function and do not preserve multi-modality. We show that this trade-off between multi-modality and sparsity limits the expressivity of SoftMax as well as its variants. We provide a solution to this tension between objectives by proposing a piece-wise differentiable function, termed MultiMax, which adaptively modulates the output distribution according to input entry range. Through comprehensive analysis and evaluation, we show that MultiMax successfully produces a distribution that supresses irrelevant entries while preserving multimodality, with benefits in image classification, language modeling and machine translation.

<p>Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of diverse methods have been proposed for 3D pose estimation. Among these, self-attention mechanisms and graph convolutions have both been proven to be effective and practical methods. Recognizing the strengths of those two techniques, we have developed a novel Semantic Graph Attention Network which can benefit from the ability of self-attention to capture global context, while also utilizing the graph convolutions to handle the local connectivity and structural constraints of the skeleton. We also design a Body Part Decoder that assists in extracting and refining the information related to specific segments of the body. Furthermore, our approach incorporates Distance Information, enhancing our model's capability to comprehend and accurately predict spatial relationships. Finally, we introduce a Geometry Loss who makes a critical constraint on the structural skeleton of the body, ensuring that the model's predictions adhere to the natural limits of human posture. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that every element within the system is essential for improving pose estimation outcomes. With comparison to state-of-the-art, the proposed work not only meets but exceeds the existing benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep image clustering methods are typically evaluated on small-scale balanced classification datasets while feature-based $k$-means has been applied on proprietary billion-scale datasets. In this work, we explore the performance of feature-based deep clustering approaches on large-scale benchmarks whilst disentangling the impact of the following data-related factors: i) class imbalance, ii) class granularity, iii) easy-to-recognize classes, and iv) the ability to capture multiple classes. Consequently, we develop multiple new benchmarks based on ImageNet21K. Our experimental analysis reveals that feature-based $k$-means is often unfairly evaluated on balanced datasets. However, deep clustering methods outperform $k$-means across most large-scale benchmarks. Interestingly, $k$-means underperforms on easy-to-classify benchmarks by large margins. The performance gap, however, diminishes on the highest data regimes such as ImageNet21K. Finally, we find that non-primary cluster predictions capture meaningful classes (i.e. coarser classes).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuojun Ding, Wei Wei, Xiaoye Qu, Dangyang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-lingual named entity recognition (NER) aims to train an NER model for the target language leveraging only labeled source language data and unlabeled target language data. Prior approaches either perform label projection on translated source language data or employ a source model to assign pseudo labels for target language data and train a target model on these pseudo-labeled data to generalize to the target language. However, these automatic labeling procedures inevitably introduce noisy labels, thus leading to a performance drop. In this paper, we propose a Global-Local Denoising framework (GLoDe) for cross-lingual NER. Specifically, GLoDe introduces a progressive denoising strategy to rectify incorrect pseudo labels by leveraging both global and local distribution information in the semantic space. The refined pseudo-labeled target language data significantly improves the model's generalization ability. Moreover, previous methods only consider improving the model with language-agnostic features, however, we argue that target language-specific features are also important and should never be ignored. To this end, we employ a simple auxiliary task to achieve this goal. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets with six target languages demonstrate that our proposed GLoDe significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhutao Zhuang, Xinqi Zeng, Zhiguang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Key\-value separation is used in LSM\-tree to stored large value in separate log files to reduce write amplification, but requires garbage collection to garbage collect invalid values. Existing garbage collection techniques in LSM\-tree typically adopt static parameter based garbage collection to garbage collect obsolete values which struggles to achieve low write amplification and it's challenging to find proper parameter for garbage collection triggering. In this work we introduce DumpKV, which introduces learning based lifetime aware garbage collection with dynamic lifetime adjustment to do efficient garbage collection to achieve lower write amplification. DumpKV manages large values using trained lightweight model with features suitable for various application based on past write access information of keys to give lifetime prediction for each individual key to enable efficient garbage collection. To reduce interference to write throughput DumpKV conducts feature collection during L0\-L1 compaction leveraging the fact that LSM\-tree is small under KV separation. Experimental results show that DumpKV achieves lower write amplification by 38\%\-73\% compared to existing key\-value separation garbage collection LSM\-tree stores with small feature storage overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Alignment is the most critical step in building large language models (LLMs) that meet human needs. With the rapid development of LLMs gradually surpassing human capabilities, traditional alignment methods based on human-annotation are increasingly unable to meet the scalability demands. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore new sources of automated alignment signals and technical approaches. In this paper, we systematically review the recently emerging methods of automated alignment, attempting to explore how to achieve effective, scalable, automated alignment once the capabilities of LLMs exceed those of humans. Specifically, we categorize existing automated alignment methods into 4 major categories based on the sources of alignment signals and discuss the current status and potential development of each category. Additionally, we explore the underlying mechanisms that enable automated alignment and discuss the essential factors that make automated alignment technologies feasible and effective from the fundamental role of alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bioacoustic research provides invaluable insights into the behavior, ecology, and conservation of animals. Most bioacoustic datasets consist of long recordings where events of interest, such as vocalizations, are exceedingly rare. Analyzing these datasets poses a monumental challenge to researchers, where deep learning techniques have emerged as a standard method. Their adaptation remains challenging, focusing on models conceived for computer vision, where the audio waveforms are engineered into spectrographic representations for training and inference. We improve the current state of deep learning in bioacoustics in two ways: First, we present the animal2vec framework: a fully interpretable transformer model and self-supervised training scheme tailored for sparse and unbalanced bioacoustic data. Second, we openly publish MeerKAT: Meerkat Kalahari Audio Transcripts, a large-scale dataset containing audio collected via biologgers deployed on free-ranging meerkats with a length of over 1068h, of which 184h have twelve time-resolved vocalization-type classes, each with ms-resolution, making it the largest publicly-available labeled dataset on terrestrial mammals. Further, we benchmark animal2vec against the NIPS4Bplus birdsong dataset. We report new state-of-the-art results on both datasets and evaluate the few-shot capabilities of animal2vec of labeled training data. Finally, we perform ablation studies to highlight the differences between our architecture and a vanilla transformer baseline for human-produced sounds. animal2vec allows researchers to classify massive amounts of sparse bioacoustic data even with little ground truth information available. In addition, the MeerKAT dataset is the first large-scale, millisecond-resolution corpus for benchmarking bioacoustic models in the pretrain/finetune paradigm. We believe this sets the stage for a new reference point for bioacoustics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhao Ni, Yuxin Guo, Junlong Jia, Lei Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Layer normalization (LN) is a ubiquitous technique in deep learning but our theoretical understanding to it remains elusive. This paper investigates a new theoretical direction for LN, regarding to its nonlinearity and representation capacity. We investigate the representation capacity of a network with layerwise composition of linear and LN transformations, referred to as LN-Net. We theoretically show that, given $m$ samples with any label assignment, an LN-Net with only 3 neurons in each layer and $O(m)$ LN layers can correctly classify them. We further show the lower bound of the VC dimension of an LN-Net. The nonlinearity of LN can be amplified by group partition, which is also theoretically demonstrated with mild assumption and empirically supported by our experiments. Based on our analyses, we consider to design neural architecture by exploiting and amplifying the nonlinearity of LN, and the effectiveness is supported by our experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bahram Mohammadi, Yicong Hong, Yuankai Qi, Qi Wu, Shirui Pan, Javen Qinfeng Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: The vision-and-language navigation (VLN) task necessitates an agent to perceive the surroundings, follow natural language instructions, and act in photo-realistic unseen environments. Most of the existing methods employ the entire image or object features to represent navigable viewpoints. However, these representations are insufficient for proper action prediction, especially for the REVERIE task, which uses concise high-level instructions, such as ''Bring me the blue cushion in the master bedroom''. To address enhancing representation, we propose an augmented commonsense knowledge model (ACK) to leverage commonsense information as a spatio-temporal knowledge graph for improving agent navigation. Specifically, the proposed approach involves constructing a knowledge base by retrieving commonsense information from ConceptNet, followed by a refinement module to remove noisy and irrelevant knowledge. We further present ACK which consists of knowledge graph-aware cross-modal and concept aggregation modules to enhance visual representation and visual-textual data alignment by integrating visible objects, commonsense knowledge, and concept history, which includes object and knowledge temporal information. Moreover, we add a new pipeline for the commonsense-based decision-making process which leads to more accurate local action prediction. Experimental results demonstrate our proposed model noticeably outperforms the baseline and archives the state-of-the-art on the REVERIE benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: The notion of visual similarity is essential for computer vision, and in applications and studies revolving around vector embeddings of images. However, the scarcity of benchmark datasets poses a significant hurdle in exploring how these models perceive similarity. Here we introduce Style Aligned Artwork Datasets (SALADs), and an example of fruit-SALAD with 10,000 images of fruit depictions. This combined semantic category and style benchmark comprises 100 instances each of 10 easy-to-recognize fruit categories, across 10 easy distinguishable styles. Leveraging a systematic pipeline of generative image synthesis, this visually diverse yet balanced benchmark demonstrates salient differences in semantic category and style similarity weights across various computational models, including machine learning models, feature extraction algorithms, and complexity measures, as well as conceptual models for reference. This meticulously designed dataset offers a controlled and balanced platform for the comparative analysis of similarity perception. The SALAD framework allows the comparison of how these models perform semantic category and style recognition task to go beyond the level of anecdotal knowledge, making it robustly quantifiable and qualitatively interpretable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungmin Yun, Mihyeon Kim, Youngbin Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved dominant performance in numerous NLP tasks. Despite their remarkable successes, pre-trained transformers such as BERT suffer from a computationally expensive self-attention mechanism that interacts with all tokens, including the ones unfavorable to classification performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose integrating two strategies: token pruning and token combining. Token pruning eliminates less important tokens in the attention mechanism's key and value as they pass through the layers. Additionally, we adopt fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty and alleviate potential mispruning risks arising from an imbalanced distribution of each token's importance. Token combining, on the other hand, condenses input sequences into smaller sizes in order to further compress the model. By integrating these two approaches, we not only improve the model's performance but also reduce its computational demands. Experiments with various datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline models, especially with the best improvement over the existing BERT model, achieving +5%p in accuracy and +5.6%p in F1 score. Additionally, memory cost is reduced to 0.61x, and a speedup of 1.64x is achieved.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Malte Lichtenberg, Alexander Buchholz, Pola Schw\"obel</p>
<p>Abstract: The issue of popularity bias -- where popular items are disproportionately recommended, overshadowing less popular but potentially relevant items -- remains a significant challenge in recommender systems. Recent advancements have seen the integration of general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) into the architecture of such systems. This integration raises concerns that it might exacerbate popularity bias, given that the LLM's training data is likely dominated by popular items. However, it simultaneously presents a novel opportunity to address the bias via prompt tuning. Our study explores this dichotomy, examining whether LLMs contribute to or can alleviate popularity bias in recommender systems. We introduce a principled way to measure popularity bias by discussing existing metrics and proposing a novel metric that fulfills a series of desiderata. Based on our new metric, we compare a simple LLM-based recommender to traditional recommender systems on a movie recommendation task. We find that the LLM recommender exhibits less popularity bias, even without any explicit mitigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaosen Zheng, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Qian Liu, Jing Jiang, Min Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Anil et al. (2024) show that many-shot (up to hundreds of) demonstrations can jailbreak state-of-the-art LLMs by exploiting their long-context capability. Nevertheless, is it possible to use few-shot demonstrations to efficiently jailbreak LLMs within limited context sizes? While the vanilla few-shot jailbreaking may be inefficient, we propose improved techniques such as injecting special system tokens like [/INST] and employing demo-level random search from a collected demo pool. These simple techniques result in surprisingly effective jailbreaking against aligned LLMs (even with advanced defenses). For examples, our method achieves >80% (mostly >95%) ASRs on Llama-2-7B and Llama-3-8B without multiple restarts, even if the models are enhanced by strong defenses such as perplexity detection and/or SmoothLLM, which is challenging for suffix-based jailbreaking. In addition, we conduct comprehensive and elaborate (e.g., making sure to use correct system prompts) evaluations against other aligned LLMs and advanced defenses, where our method consistently achieves nearly 100% ASRs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishi Hazra, Alkis Sygkounas, Andreas Persson, Amy Loutfi, Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is crucial to training reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. However, this design is non-trivial, even for domain experts, due to the subjective nature of certain tasks that are hard to quantify explicitly. In recent works, large language models (LLMs) have been used for reward generation from natural language task descriptions, leveraging their extensive instruction tuning and commonsense understanding of human behavior. In this work, we hypothesize that LLMs, guided by human feedback, can be used to formulate human-aligned reward functions. Specifically, we study this in the challenging setting of autonomous driving (AD), wherein notions of "good" driving are tacit and hard to quantify. To this end, we introduce REvolve, an evolutionary framework that uses LLMs for reward design in AD. REvolve creates and refines reward functions by utilizing human feedback to guide the evolution process, effectively translating implicit human knowledge into explicit reward functions for training (deep) RL agents. We demonstrate that agents trained on REvolve-designed rewards align closely with human driving standards, thereby outperforming other state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Firas Khader, Omar S. M. El Nahhas, Tianyu Han, Gustav M\"uller-Franzes, Sven Nebelung, Jakob Nikolas Kather, Daniel Truhn</p>
<p>Abstract: The Transformer model has been pivotal in advancing fields such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and computer vision. However, a critical limitation of this model is its quadratic computational and memory complexity relative to the sequence length, which constrains its application to longer sequences. This is especially crucial in medical imaging where high-resolution images can reach gigapixel scale. Efforts to address this issue have predominantely focused on complex techniques, such as decomposing the softmax operation integral to the Transformer's architecture. This paper addresses this quadratic computational complexity of Transformer models and introduces a remarkably simple and effective method that circumvents this issue by eliminating the softmax function from the attention mechanism and adopting a sequence normalization technique for the key, query, and value tokens. Coupled with a reordering of matrix multiplications this approach reduces the memory- and compute complexity to a linear scale. We evaluate this approach across various medical imaging datasets comprising fundoscopic, dermascopic, radiologic and histologic imaging data. Our findings highlight that these models exhibit a comparable performance to traditional transformer models, while efficiently handling longer sequences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Due to the scarcity of labeled sensor data in HAR, prior research has turned to video data to synthesize Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) data, capitalizing on its rich activity annotations. However, generating IMU data from videos presents challenges for HAR in real-world settings, attributed to the poor quality of synthetic IMU data and its limited efficacy in subtle, fine-grained motions. In this paper, we propose Multi$^3$Net, our novel multi-modal, multitask, and contrastive-based framework approach to address the issue of limited data. Our pretraining procedure uses videos from online repositories, aiming to learn joint representations of text, pose, and IMU simultaneously. By employing video data and contrastive learning, our method seeks to enhance wearable HAR performance, especially in recognizing subtle activities.Our experimental findings validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving HAR performance with IMU data. We demonstrate that models trained with synthetic IMU data generated from videos using our method surpass existing approaches in recognizing fine-grained activities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant approach for learning over graph-structured data. However, most GNNs operate as black-box models and require post-hoc explanations, which may not suffice in high-stakes scenarios where transparency is crucial. In this paper, we present a GNN that is interpretable by design. Our model, Graph Neural Additive Network (GNAN), is a novel extension of the interpretable class of Generalized Additive Models, and can be visualized and fully understood by humans. GNAN is designed to be fully interpretable, allowing both global and local explanations at the feature and graph levels through direct visualization of the model. These visualizations describe the exact way the model uses the relationships between the target variable, the features, and the graph. We demonstrate the intelligibility of GNANs in a series of examples on different tasks and datasets. In addition, we show that the accuracy of GNAN is on par with black-box GNNs, making it suitable for critical applications where transparency is essential, alongside high accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Speech in-painting is the task of regenerating missing audio contents using reliable context information. Despite various recent studies in multi-modal perception of audio in-painting, there is still a need for an effective infusion of visual and auditory information in speech in-painting. In this paper, we introduce a novel sequence-to-sequence model that leverages the visual information to in-paint audio signals via an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder plays the role of a lip-reader for facial recordings and the decoder takes both encoder outputs as well as the distorted audio spectrograms to restore the original speech. Our model outperforms an audio-only speech in-painting model and has comparable results with a recent multi-modal speech in-painter in terms of speech quality and intelligibility metrics for distortions of 300 ms to 1500 ms duration, which proves the effectiveness of the introduced multi-modality in speech in-painting.</p>

<p>Abstract: In numerous high-stakes domains, training novices via conventional learning systems does not suffice. To impart tacit knowledge, experts' hands-on guidance is imperative. However, training novices by experts is costly and time-consuming, increasing the need for alternatives. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has conventionally been used to make black-box artificial intelligence systems interpretable. In this work, we utilize XAI as an alternative: An (X)AI system is trained on experts' past decisions and is then employed to teach novices by providing examples coupled with explanations. In a study with 249 participants, we measure the effectiveness of such an approach for a classification task. We show that (X)AI-based learning systems are able to induce learning in novices and that their cognitive styles moderate learning. Thus, we take the first steps to reveal the impact of XAI on human learning and point AI developers to future options to tailor the design of (X)AI-based learning systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown their impressive capabilities, while also raising concerns about the data contamination problems due to privacy issues and leakage of benchmark datasets in the pre-training phase. Therefore, it is vital to detect the contamination by checking whether an LLM has been pre-trained on the target texts. Recent studies focus on the generated texts and compute perplexities, which are superficial features and not reliable. In this study, we propose to utilize the probing technique for pre-training data detection by examining the model's internal activations. Our method is simple and effective and leads to more trustworthy pre-training data detection. Additionally, we propose ArxivMIA, a new challenging benchmark comprising arxiv abstracts from Computer Science and Mathematics categories. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms all baselines, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both WikiMIA and ArxivMIA, with additional experiments confirming its efficacy (Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/zhliu0106/probing-lm-data).</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of Differential Privacy (DP) with diffusion models (DMs) presents a promising yet challenging frontier, particularly due to the substantial memorization capabilities of DMs that pose significant privacy risks. Differential privacy offers a rigorous framework for safeguarding individual data points during model training, with Differential Privacy Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) being a prominent implementation. Diffusion method decomposes image generation into iterative steps, theoretically aligning well with DP's incremental noise addition. Despite the natural fit, the unique architecture of DMs necessitates tailored approaches to effectively balance privacy-utility trade-off. Recent developments in this field have highlighted the potential for generating high-quality synthetic data by pre-training on public data (i.e., ImageNet) and fine-tuning on private data, however, there is a pronounced gap in research on optimizing the trade-offs involved in DP settings, particularly concerning parameter efficiency and model scalability. Our work addresses this by proposing a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy optimized for private diffusion models, which minimizes the number of trainable parameters to enhance the privacy-utility trade-off. We empirically demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in DP synthesis, significantly surpassing previous benchmarks on widely studied datasets (e.g., with only 0.47M trainable parameters, achieving a more than 35% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art with a small privacy budget on the CelebA-64 dataset).

However, there is no widely recognized methodology to evaluate them. To fill this gap, we introduce the Benchmarks for the Evaluation of LLM Safeguards (BELLS), a structured collection of tests, organized into three categories: (1) established failure tests, based on already-existing benchmarks for well-defined failure modes, aiming to compare the performance of current input-output safeguards; (2) emerging failure tests, to measure generalization to never-seen-before failure modes and encourage the development of more general safeguards; (3) next-gen architecture tests, for more complex scaffolding (such as LLM-agents and multi-agent systems), aiming to foster the development of safeguards that could adapt to future applications for which no safeguard currently exists. Furthermore, we implement and share the first next-gen architecture test, using the MACHIAVELLI environment, along with an interactive visualization of the dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keyon Vafa, Ashesh Rambachan, Sendhil Mullainathan</p>
<p>Abstract: What makes large language models (LLMs) impressive is also what makes them hard to evaluate: their diversity of uses. To evaluate these models, we must understand the purposes they will be used for. We consider a setting where these deployment decisions are made by people, and in particular, people's beliefs about where an LLM will perform well. We model such beliefs as the consequence of a human generalization function: having seen what an LLM gets right or wrong, people generalize to where else it might succeed. We collect a dataset of 19K examples of how humans make generalizations across 79 tasks from the MMLU and BIG-Bench benchmarks. We show that the human generalization function can be predicted using NLP methods: people have consistent structured ways to generalize. We then evaluate LLM alignment with the human generalization function. Our results show that -- especially for cases where the cost of mistakes is high -- more capable models (e.g. GPT-4) can do worse on the instances people choose to use them for, exactly because they are not aligned with the human generalization function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeongyeol Kwon, Shie Mannor, Constantine Caramanis, Yonathan Efroni</p>
<p>Abstract: In many real-world decision problems there is partially observed, hidden or latent information that remains fixed throughout an interaction. Such decision problems can be modeled as Latent Markov Decision Processes (LMDPs), where a latent variable is selected at the beginning of an interaction and is not disclosed to the agent. In the last decade, there has been significant progress in solving LMDPs under different structural assumptions. However, for general LMDPs, there is no known learning algorithm that provably matches the existing lower bound~\cite{kwon2021rl}. We introduce the first sample-efficient algorithm for LMDPs without any additional structural assumptions. Our result builds off a new perspective on the role of off-policy evaluation guarantees and coverage coefficients in LMDPs, a perspective, that has been overlooked in the context of exploration in partially observed environments. Specifically, we establish a novel off-policy evaluation lemma and introduce a new coverage coefficient for LMDPs. Then, we show how these can be used to derive near-optimal guarantees of an optimistic exploration algorithm. These results, we believe, can be valuable for a wide range of interactive learning problems beyond LMDPs, and especially, for partially observed environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqian Zeng, Jianwei Wang, Zhengdong Lu, Huiping Zhuang, Cen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread usage of online Large Language Models (LLMs) inference services has raised significant privacy concerns about the potential exposure of private information in user inputs to eavesdroppers or untrustworthy service providers. Existing privacy protection methods for LLMs suffer from insufficient privacy protection, performance degradation, or severe inference time overhead. In this paper, we propose PrivacyRestore to protect the privacy of user inputs during LLM inference. PrivacyRestore directly removes privacy spans in user inputs and restores privacy information via activation steering during inference. The privacy spans are encoded as restoration vectors. We propose Attention-aware Weighted Aggregation (AWA) which aggregates restoration vectors of all privacy spans in the input into a meta restoration vector. AWA not only ensures proper representation of all privacy spans but also prevents attackers from inferring the privacy spans from the meta restoration vector alone. This meta restoration vector, along with the query with privacy spans removed, is then sent to the server. The experimental results show that PrivacyRestore can protect private information while maintaining acceptable levels of performance and inference efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Li, Linjun Shou, Xuejun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot visual question answering (VQA) is a challenging task that requires reasoning across modalities. While some existing methods rely on a single rationale within the Chain of Thoughts (CoT) framework, they may fall short of capturing the complexity of the VQA problem. On the other hand, some other methods that use multiple rationales may still suffer from low diversity, poor modality alignment, and inefficient retrieval and fusion. In response to these challenges, we propose \emph{Mixture of Rationales (MoR)}, a novel multi-modal reasoning method that mixes multiple rationales for VQA. MoR uses a single frozen Vision-and-Language Pre-trained Models (VLPM) model to {dynamically generate, retrieve and fuse multi-modal thoughts}. We evaluate MoR on two challenging VQA datasets, i.e. NLVR2 and OKVQA, with two representative backbones OFA and VL-T5. MoR achieves a 12.43\% accuracy improvement on NLVR2, and a 2.45\% accuracy improvement on OKVQA-S( the science and technology category of OKVQA).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaniv Oren, Moritz A. Zanger, Pascal R. van der Vaart, Matthijs T. J. Spaan, Wendelin Bohmer</p>
<p>Abstract: Many modern reinforcement learning algorithms build on the actor-critic (AC) framework: iterative improvement of a policy (the actor) using policy improvement operators and iterative approximation of the policy's value (the critic). In contrast, the popular value-based algorithm family employs improvement operators in the value update, to iteratively improve the value function directly. In this work, we propose a general extension to the AC framework that employs two separate improvement operators: one applied to the policy in the spirit of policy-based algorithms and one applied to the value in the spirit of value-based algorithms, which we dub Value-Improved AC (VI-AC). We design two practical VI-AC algorithms based in the popular online off-policy AC algorithms TD3 and DDPG. We evaluate VI-TD3 and VI-DDPG in the Mujoco benchmark and find that both improve upon or match the performance of their respective baselines in all environments tested.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksandar Petrov, Tom A. Lamb, Alasdair Paren, Philip H. S. Torr, Adel Bibi</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot and in-context learning enable solving tasks without model fine-tuning, making them essential for developing generative model solutions. Therefore, it is crucial to understand whether a pretrained model can be prompted to approximate any function, i.e., whether it is a universal in-context approximator. While it was recently shown that transformer models do possess this property, these results rely on their attention mechanism. Hence, these findings do not apply to fully recurrent architectures like RNNs, LSTMs, and the increasingly popular SSMs. We demonstrate that RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, Linear RNNs, and linear gated architectures such as Mamba and Hawk/Griffin can also serve as universal in-context approximators. To streamline our argument, we introduce a programming language called LSRL that compiles to these fully recurrent architectures. LSRL may be of independent interest for further studies of fully recurrent models, such as constructing interpretability benchmarks. We also study the role of multiplicative gating and observe that architectures incorporating such gating (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs, Hawk/Griffin) can implement certain operations more stably, making them more viable candidates for practical in-context universal approximation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alfreds Lapkovskis, Natalia Nefedova, Ali Beikmohammadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Plant classification is vital for ecological conservation and agricultural productivity, enhancing our understanding of plant growth dynamics and aiding species preservation. The advent of deep learning (DL) techniques has revolutionized this field by enabling autonomous feature extraction, significantly reducing the dependence on manual expertise. However, conventional DL models often rely solely on single data sources, failing to capture the full biological diversity of plant species comprehensively. Recent research has turned to multimodal learning to overcome this limitation by integrating multiple data types, which enriches the representation of plant characteristics. This shift introduces the challenge of determining the optimal point for modality fusion. In this paper, we introduce a pioneering multimodal DL-based approach for plant classification with automatic modality fusion. Utilizing the multimodal fusion architecture search, our method integrates images from multiple plant organs-flowers, leaves, fruits, and stems-into a cohesive model. Our method achieves 83.48% accuracy on 956 classes of the PlantCLEF2015 dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. It outperforms late fusion by 11.07% and is more robust to missing modalities. We validate our model against established benchmarks using standard performance metrics and McNemar's test, further underscoring its superiority.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zhang, Qi Zhang, Zixuan Gong, Yiwei Shi, Yepeng Liu, Duoqian Miao, Yang Liu, Ke Liu, Kun Yi, Wei Fan, Liang Hu, Changwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has achieved remarkable success, leading to rapid advancements in multimodal studies. However, CLIP faces a notable challenge in terms of inefficient data utilization. It relies on a single contrastive supervision for each image-text pair during representation learning, disregarding a substantial amount of valuable information that could offer richer supervision. Additionally, the retention of non-informative tokens leads to increased computational demands and time costs, particularly in CLIP's ViT image encoder. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Perspective Language-Image Pretraining (MLIP). In MLIP, we leverage the frequency transform's sensitivity to both high and low-frequency variations, which complements the spatial domain's sensitivity limited to low-frequency variations only. By incorporating frequency transforms and token-level alignment, we expand CILP's single supervision into multi-domain and multi-level supervision, enabling a more thorough exploration of informative image features. Additionally, we introduce a token merging method guided by comprehensive semantics from the frequency and spatial domains. This allows us to merge tokens to multi-granularity tokens with a controllable compression rate to accelerate CLIP. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our design.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the output token probability information in the output embedding of language models. We provide an approximate common log-linear encoding of output token probabilities within the output embedding vectors and demonstrate that it is accurate and sparse when the output space is large and output logits are concentrated. Based on such findings, we edit the encoding in output embedding to modify the output probability distribution accurately. Moreover, the sparsity we find in output probability encoding suggests that a large number of dimensions in the output embedding do not contribute to causal language modeling. Therefore, we attempt to delete the output-unrelated dimensions and find more than 30% of the dimensions can be deleted without significant movement in output distribution and degeneration on sequence generation. Additionally, in training dynamics, we use such encoding as a probe and find that the output embeddings capture token frequency information in early steps, even before an obvious convergence starts.</p>

<p>Abstract: In digital markets comprised of many competing services, each user chooses between multiple service providers according to their preferences, and the chosen service makes use of the user data to incrementally improve its model. The service providers' models influence which service the user will choose at the next time step, and the user's choice, in return, influences the model update, leading to a feedback loop. In this paper, we formalize the above dynamics and develop a simple and efficient decentralized algorithm to locally minimize the overall user loss. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm asymptotically converges to stationary points of of the overall loss almost surely. We also experimentally demonstrate the utility of our algorithm with real world data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiho Park, Yo Joong Choe, Yibo Jiang, Victor Veitch</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how semantic meaning is encoded in the representation spaces of large language models is a fundamental problem in interpretability. In this paper, we study the two foundational questions in this area. First, how are categorical concepts, such as {'mammal', 'bird', 'reptile', 'fish'}, represented? Second, how are hierarchical relations between concepts encoded? For example, how is the fact that 'dog' is a kind of 'mammal' encoded? We show how to extend the linear representation hypothesis to answer these questions. We find a remarkably simple structure: simple categorical concepts are represented as simplices, hierarchically related concepts are orthogonal in a sense we make precise, and (in consequence) complex concepts are represented as polytopes constructed from direct sums of simplices, reflecting the hierarchical structure. We validate these theoretical results on the Gemma large language model, estimating representations for 957 hierarchically related concepts using data from WordNet.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01538">What Are Large Language Models Mapping to in the Brain? A Case Against Over-Reliance on Brain Scores</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ebrahim Feghhi, Nima Hadidi, Bryan Song, Idan A. Blank, Jonathan C. Kao</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing interest in evaluating their similarity to the human brain. One approach towards quantifying this similarity is by measuring how well a model predicts neural signals, also called "brain score". Internal representations from LLMs achieve state-of-the-art brain scores, leading to speculation that they share computational principles with human language processing. This inference is only valid if the subset of neural activity predicted by LLMs reflects core elements of language processing. Here, we question this assumption by analyzing three neural datasets used in an impactful study on LLM-to-brain mappings, with a particular focus on an fMRI dataset where participants read short passages. We first find that when using shuffled train-test splits, as done in previous studies with these datasets, a trivial feature that encodes temporal autocorrelation not only outperforms LLMs but also accounts for the majority of neural variance that LLMs explain. We therefore use contiguous splits moving forward. Second, we explain the surprisingly high brain scores of untrained LLMs by showing they do not account for additional neural variance beyond two simple features: sentence length and sentence position. This undermines evidence used to claim that the transformer architecture biases computations to be more brain-like. Third, we find that brain scores of trained LLMs on this dataset can largely be explained by sentence length, position, and pronoun-dereferenced static word embeddings; a small, additional amount is explained by sense-specific embeddings and contextual representations of sentence structure. We conclude that over-reliance on brain scores can lead to over-interpretations of similarity between LLMs and brains, and emphasize the importance of deconstructing what LLMs are mapping to in neural signals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fazel Arasteh, Mohammed Elmahgiubi, Behzad Khamidehi, Hamidreza Mirkhani, Weize Zhang, Kasra Rezaee</p>
<p>Abstract: The planning problem constitutes a fundamental aspect of the autonomous driving framework. Recent strides in representation learning have empowered vehicles to comprehend their surrounding environments, thereby facilitating the integration of learning-based planning strategies. Among these approaches, Imitation Learning stands out due to its notable training efficiency. However, traditional Imitation Learning methodologies encounter challenges associated with the co-variate shift phenomenon. We propose Learn from Mistakes (LfM) as a remedy to address this issue. The essence of LfM lies in deploying a pre-trained planner across diverse scenarios. Instances where the planner deviates from its immediate objectives, such as maintaining a safe distance from obstacles or adhering to traffic rules, are flagged as mistakes. The environments corresponding to these mistakes are categorized as out-of-distribution states and compiled into a new dataset termed closed-loop mistakes dataset. Notably, the absence of expert annotations for the closed-loop data precludes the applicability of standard imitation learning approaches. To facilitate learning from the closed-loop mistakes, we introduce Validity Learning, a weakly supervised method, which aims to discern valid trajectories within the current environmental context. Experimental evaluations conducted on the InD and Nuplan datasets reveal substantial enhancements in closed-loop metrics such as Progress and Collision Rate, underscoring the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sadek Belamfedel Alaoui, Adnane Saoud</p>
<p>Abstract: Q-learning is widely recognized as an effective approach for synthesizing controllers to achieve specific goals. However, handling challenges posed by continuous state-action spaces remains an ongoing research focus. This paper presents a systematic analysis that highlights a major drawback in space discretization methods. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a symbolic model that represents behavioral relations, such as alternating simulation from abstraction to the controlled system. This relation allows for seamless application of the synthesized controller based on abstraction to the original system. Introducing a novel Q-learning technique for symbolic models, the algorithm yields two Q-tables encoding optimal policies. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that these Q-tables serve as both upper and lower bounds on the Q-values of the original system with continuous spaces. Additionally, the paper explores the correlation between the parameters of the space abstraction and the loss in Q-values. The resulting algorithm facilitates achieving optimality within an arbitrary accuracy, providing control over the trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. The obtained results provide valuable insights for selecting appropriate learning parameters and refining the controller. The engineering relevance of the proposed Q-learning based symbolic model is illustrated through two case studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation integrates the capabilities of large language models with relevant information retrieved from an extensive corpus, yet encounters challenges when confronted with real-world noisy data. One recent solution is to train a filter module to find relevant content but only achieve suboptimal noise compression. In this paper, we propose to introduce the information bottleneck theory into retrieval-augmented generation. Our approach involves the filtration of noise by simultaneously maximizing the mutual information between compression and ground output, while minimizing the mutual information between compression and retrieved passage. In addition, we derive the formula of information bottleneck to facilitate its application in novel comprehensive evaluations, the selection of supervised fine-tuning data, and the construction of reinforcement learning rewards. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements across various question answering datasets, not only in terms of the correctness of answer generation but also in the conciseness with $2.5\%$ compression rate.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work characterizes equivariant polynomial functions from tuples of tensor inputs to tensor outputs. Loosely motivated by physics, we focus on equivariant functions with respect to the diagonal action of the orthogonal group on tensors. We show how to extend this characterization to other linear algebraic groups, including the Lorentz and symplectic groups.
  Our goal behind these characterizations is to define equivariant machine learning models. In particular, we focus on the sparse vector estimation problem. This problem has been broadly studied in the theoretical computer science literature, and explicit spectral methods, derived by techniques from sum-of-squares, can be shown to recover sparse vectors under certain assumptions. Our numerical results show that the proposed equivariant machine learning models can learn spectral methods that outperform the best theoretically known spectral methods in some regimes. The experiments also suggest that learned spectral methods can solve the problem in settings that have not yet been theoretically analyzed.
  This is an example of a promising direction in which theory can inform machine learning models and machine learning models could inform theory.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models trained on extensive text-image pairs have shown the capacity to generate photorealistic images consistent with textual descriptions. However, a significant limitation of these models is their slow sample generation, which requires iterative refinement through the same network. In this paper, we enhance Score identity Distillation (SiD) by developing long and short classifier-free guidance (LSG) to efficiently distill pretrained Stable Diffusion models without using real training data. SiD aims to optimize a model-based explicit score matching loss, utilizing a score-identity-based approximation alongside the proposed LSG for practical computation. By training exclusively with fake images synthesized with its one-step generator, SiD equipped with LSG rapidly improves FID and CLIP scores, achieving state-of-the-art FID performance while maintaining a competitive CLIP score. Specifically, its data-free distillation of Stable Diffusion 1.5 achieves a record low FID of 8.15 on the COCO-2014 validation set, with a CLIP score of 0.304 at an LSG scale of 1.5, and a FID of 9.56 with a CLIP score of 0.313 at an LSG scale of 2. We will make our PyTorch implementation and distilled Stable Diffusion one-step generators available at https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD-LSG</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Roice, Parham Mohammad Panahi, Scott M. Jordan, Adam White, Martha White</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates a new approach to model-based reinforcement learning using background planning: mixing (approximate) dynamic programming updates and model-free updates, similar to the Dyna architecture. Background planning with learned models is often worse than model-free alternatives, such as Double DQN, even though the former uses significantly more memory and computation. The fundamental problem is that learned models can be inaccurate and often generate invalid states, especially when iterated many steps. In this paper, we avoid this limitation by constraining background planning to a set of (abstract) subgoals and learning only local, subgoal-conditioned models. This goal-space planning (GSP) approach is more computationally efficient, naturally incorporates temporal abstraction for faster long-horizon planning and avoids learning the transition dynamics entirely. We show that our GSP algorithm can propagate value from an abstract space in a manner that helps a variety of base learners learn significantly faster in different domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: In various applications, the optimal policy in a strategic decision-making problem depends both on the environmental configuration and exogenous events. For these settings, we introduce Bilevel Optimization with Contextual Markov Decision Processes (BO-CMDP), a stochastic bilevel decision-making model, where the lower level consists of solving a contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP). BO-CMDP can be viewed as a Stackelberg Game where the leader and a random context beyond the leader's control together decide the setup of (many) MDPs that (potentially multiple) followers best respond to. This framework extends beyond traditional bilevel optimization and finds relevance in diverse fields such as model design for MDPs, tax design, reward shaping and dynamic mechanism design. We propose a stochastic Hyper Policy Gradient Descent (HPGD) algorithm to solve BO-CMDP, and demonstrate its convergence. Notably, HPGD only utilizes observations of the followers' trajectories. Therefore, it allows followers to use any training procedure and the leader to be agnostic of the specific algorithm used, which aligns with various real-world scenarios. We further consider the setting when the leader can influence the training of followers and propose an accelerated algorithm. We empirically demonstrate the performance of our algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanxing Lu, Zifeng Gao, Tianxing Chen, Wenxun Dai, Ziwei Wang, Yansong Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have been verified to be effective in generating complex distributions from natural images to motion trajectories. Recent diffusion-based methods show impressive performance in 3D robotic manipulation tasks, whereas they suffer from severe runtime inefficiency due to multiple denoising steps, especially with high-dimensional observations. To this end, we propose a real-time robotic manipulation model named ManiCM that imposes the consistency constraint to the diffusion process, so that the model can generate robot actions in only one-step inference. Specifically, we formulate a consistent diffusion process in the robot action space conditioned on the point cloud input, where the original action is required to be directly denoised from any point along the ODE trajectory. To model this process, we design a consistency distillation technique to predict the action sample directly instead of predicting the noise within the vision community for fast convergence in the low-dimensional action manifold. We evaluate ManiCM on 31 robotic manipulation tasks from Adroit and Metaworld, and the results demonstrate that our approach accelerates the state-of-the-art method by 10 times in average inference speed while maintaining competitive average success rate.</p>

<p>Abstract: The nn2poly package provides the implementation in R of the NN2Poly method to explain and interpret feed-forward neural networks by means of polynomial representations that predict in an equivalent manner as the original network.Through the obtained polynomial coefficients, the effect and importance of each variable and their interactions on the output can be represented. This capabiltiy of capturing interactions is a key aspect usually missing from most Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, specially if they rely on expensive computations that can be amplified when used on large neural networks. The package provides integration with the main deep learning framework packages in R (tensorflow and torch), allowing an user-friendly application of the NN2Poly algorithm. Furthermore, nn2poly provides implementation of the required weight constraints to be used during the network training in those same frameworks. Other neural networks packages can also be used by including their weights in list format. Polynomials obtained with nn2poly can also be used to predict with new data or be visualized through its own plot method. Simulations are provided exemplifying the usage of the package alongside with a comparison with other approaches available in R to interpret neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun-Chun Chen, Selena Ling, Zhiqin Chen, Vladimir G. Kim, Matheus Gadelha, Alec Jacobson</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel technique for adding geometric details to an input coarse 3D mesh guided by a text prompt. Our method is composed of three stages. First, we generate a single-view RGB image conditioned on the input coarse geometry and the input text prompt. This single-view image generation step allows the user to pre-visualize the result and offers stronger conditioning for subsequent multi-view generation. Second, we use our novel multi-view normal generation architecture to jointly generate six different views of the normal images. The joint view generation reduces inconsistencies and leads to sharper details. Third, we optimize our mesh with respect to all views and generate a fine, detailed geometry as output. The resulting method produces an output within seconds and offers explicit user control over the coarse structure, pose, and desired details of the resulting 3D mesh.

<p><b>Authors:</b> R. V. Bettker, P. P. Minini, A. G. Pereira, M. Ritt</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning good heuristic functions for classical planning tasks with neural networks based on samples represented by states with their cost-to-goal estimates. The heuristic function is learned for a state space and goal condition with the number of samples limited to a fraction of the size of the state space, and must generalize well for all states of the state space with the same goal condition. Our main goal is to better understand the influence of sample generation strategies on the performance of a greedy best-first heuristic search (GBFS) guided by a learned heuristic function. In a set of controlled experiments, we find that two main factors determine the quality of the learned heuristic: the algorithm used to generate the sample set and how close the sample estimates to the perfect cost-to-goal are. These two factors are dependent: having perfect cost-to-goal estimates is insufficient if the samples are not well distributed across the state space. We also study other effects, such as adding samples with high-value estimates. Based on our findings, we propose practical strategies to improve the quality of learned heuristics: three strategies that aim to generate more representative states and two strategies that improve the cost-to-goal estimates. Our practical strategies result in a learned heuristic that, when guiding a GBFS algorithm, increases by more than 30% the mean coverage compared to a baseline learned heuristic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lyle Regenwetter, Yazan Abu Obaideh, Faez Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Designers may often ask themselves how to adjust their design concepts to achieve demanding functional goals. To answer such questions, designers must often consider counterfactuals, weighing design alternatives and their projected performance. This paper introduces Multi-objective Counterfactuals for Design (MCD), a computational tool that automates and streamlines the counterfactual search process and recommends targeted design modifications that meet designers' unique requirements. MCD improves upon existing counterfactual search methods by supporting multi-objective requirements, which are crucial in design problems, and by decoupling the counterfactual search and sampling processes, thus enhancing efficiency and facilitating objective trade-off visualization. The paper showcases MCD's capabilities in complex engineering tasks using three demonstrative bicycle design challenges. In the first, MCD effectively identifies design modifications that quantifiably enhance functional performance, strengthening the bike frame and saving weight. In the second, MCD modifies parametric bike models in a cross-modal fashion to resemble subjective text prompts or reference images. In a final multidisciplinary case study, MCD tackles all the quantitative and subjective design requirements introduced in the first two problems, while simultaneously customizing a bike design to an individual rider's biomechanical attributes. By exploring hypothetical design alterations and their impact on multiple design objectives, MCD recommends effective design modifications for practitioners seeking to make targeted enhancements to their designs. The code, test problems, and datasets used in the paper are available to the public at decode.mit.edu/projects/counterfactuals/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuyue Sun, Ying Sheng, Oded Padon, Clark Barrett</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of large language models for code generation is a rapidly growing trend in software development. However, without effective methods for ensuring the correctness of generated code, this trend could lead to any number of undesirable outcomes. In this paper, we lay out a vision for addressing this challenge: the Clover paradigm, short for Closed-Loop Verifiable Code Generation, which reduces correctness checking to the more accessible problem of consistency checking. At the core of Clover lies a checker that performs consistency checks among code, docstrings, and formal annotations. The checker is implemented using a novel integration of formal verification tools and large language models. We provide a theoretical analysis to support our thesis that Clover should be effective at consistency checking. We also empirically investigate its feasibility on a hand-designed dataset (CloverBench) featuring annotated Dafny programs at a textbook level of difficulty. Experimental results show that for this dataset, (i) LLMs are reasonably successful at automatically generating formal specifications; and (ii) our consistency checker achieves a promising acceptance rate (up to 87%) for correct instances while maintaining zero tolerance for incorrect ones (no false positives).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Wu, Yuxuan Liang, Wei Xiong, Zhengyang Zhou, Wei Huang, Shilong Wang, Kun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficiently modeling spatio-temporal (ST) physical processes and observations presents a challenging problem for the deep learning community. Many recent studies have concentrated on meticulously reconciling various advantages, leading to designed models that are neither simple nor practical. To address this issue, this paper presents a systematic study on existing shortcomings faced by off-the-shelf models, including lack of local fidelity, poor prediction performance over long time-steps,low scalability, and inefficiency. To systematically address the aforementioned problems, we propose an EarthFarseer, a concise framework that combines parallel local convolutions and global Fourier-based transformer architectures, enabling dynamically capture the local-global spatial interactions and dependencies. EarthFarseer also incorporates a multi-scale fully convolutional and Fourier architectures to efficiently and effectively capture the temporal evolution. Our proposal demonstrates strong adaptability across various tasks and datasets, with fast convergence and better local fidelity in long time-steps predictions. Extensive experiments and visualizations over eight human society physical and natural physical datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance of EarthFarseer.

<p>Abstract: For combinatorial optimization problems, model-based paradigms such as mixed-integer programming (MIP) and constraint programming (CP) aim to decouple modeling and solving a problem: the `holy grail' of declarative problem solving. We propose domain-independent dynamic programming (DIDP), a new model-based paradigm based on dynamic programming (DP). While DP is not new, it has typically been implemented as a problem-specific method. We introduce Dynamic Programming Description Language (DyPDL), a formalism to define DP models based on a state transition system, inspired by AI planning. We show that heuristic search algorithms can be used to solve DyPDL models and propose seven DIDP solvers. We experimentally compare our DIDP solvers with commercial MIP and CP solvers (solving MIP and CP models, respectively) on common benchmark instances of eleven combinatorial optimization problem classes. We show that DIDP outperforms MIP in nine problem classes, CP also in nine problem classes, and both MIP and CP in seven.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the multifaceted consequences of federated unlearning (FU) with data heterogeneity. We introduce key metrics for FU assessment, concentrating on verification, global stability, and local fairness, and investigate the inherent trade-offs. Furthermore, we formulate the unlearning process with data heterogeneity through an optimization framework. Our key contribution lies in a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the trade-offs in FU and provides insights into data heterogeneity's impacts on FU. Leveraging these insights, we propose FU mechanisms to manage the trade-offs, guiding further development for FU mechanisms. We empirically validate that our FU mechanisms effectively balance trade-offs, confirming insights derived from our theoretical analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Planning is a fundamental property of human intelligence. Reasoning about asynchronous plans is challenging since it requires sequential and parallel planning to optimize time costs. Can large language models (LLMs) succeed at this task? Here, we present the first large-scale study investigating this question. We find that a representative set of closed and open-source LLMs, including GPT-4 and LLaMA-2, behave poorly when not supplied with illustrations about the task-solving process in our benchmark AsyncHow. We propose a novel technique called Plan Like a Graph (PLaG) that combines graphs with natural language prompts and achieves state-of-the-art results. We show that although PLaG can boost model performance, LLMs still suffer from drastic degradation when task complexity increases, highlighting the limits of utilizing LLMs for simulating digital devices. We see our study as an exciting step towards using LLMs as efficient autonomous agents. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/fangru-lin/graph-llm-asynchow-plan.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural Theory-of-Mind (N-ToM), machine's ability to understand and keep track of the mental states of others, is pivotal in developing socially intelligent agents. However, prevalent N-ToM benchmarks have several shortcomings, including the presence of ambiguous and artificial narratives, absence of personality traits and preferences, a lack of questions addressing characters' psychological mental states, and limited diversity in the questions posed. In response to these issues, we construct OpenToM, a new benchmark for assessing N-ToM with (1) longer and clearer narrative stories, (2) characters with explicit personality traits, (3) actions that are triggered by character intentions, and (4) questions designed to challenge LLMs' capabilities of modeling characters' mental states of both the physical and psychological world. Using OpenToM, we reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs thrive at modeling certain aspects of mental states in the physical world but fall short when tracking characters' mental states in the psychological world.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used across various domains, from software development to cyber threat intelligence. Understanding all the different fields of cybersecurity, which includes topics such as cryptography, reverse engineering, and risk assessment, poses a challenge even for human experts. To accurately test the general knowledge of LLMs in cybersecurity, the research community needs a diverse, accurate, and up-to-date dataset. To address this gap, we present CyberMetric-80, CyberMetric-500, CyberMetric-2000, and CyberMetric-10000, which are multiple-choice Q&A benchmark datasets comprising 80, 500, 2000, and 10,000 questions respectively. By utilizing GPT-3.5 and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we collected documents, including NIST standards, research papers, publicly accessible books, RFCs, and other publications in the cybersecurity domain, to generate questions, each with four possible answers. The results underwent several rounds of error checking and refinement. Human experts invested over 200 hours validating the questions and solutions to ensure their accuracy and relevance, and to filter out any questions unrelated to cybersecurity. We have evaluated and compared 25 state-of-the-art LLM models on the CyberMetric datasets. In addition to our primary goal of evaluating LLMs, we involved 30 human participants to solve CyberMetric-80 in a closed-book scenario. The results can serve as a reference for comparing the general cybersecurity knowledge of humans and LLMs. The findings revealed that GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct, Falcon-180B-Chat, and GEMINI-pro 1.0 were the best-performing LLMs. Additionally, the top LLMs were more accurate than humans on CyberMetric-80, although highly experienced human experts still outperformed small models such as Llama-3-8B, Phi-2 or Gemma-7b.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhao Li, Xin Wang, Jun Zhao, Wenbin Guo, Jianxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge hypergraph embedding models are usually computationally expensive due to the inherent complex semantic information. However, existing works mainly focus on improving the effectiveness of knowledge hypergraph embedding, making the model architecture more complex and redundant. It is desirable and challenging for knowledge hypergraph embedding to reach a trade-off between model effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end efficient n-ary knowledge hypergraph embedding model, HyCubE, which designs a novel 3D circular convolutional neural network and the alternate mask stack strategy to enhance the interaction and extraction of feature information comprehensively. Furthermore, our proposed model achieves a better trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency by adaptively adjusting the 3D circular convolutional layer structure to handle different arity knowledge hypergraphs with fewer parameters. In addition, we use 1-N multilinear scoring based on the entity mask mechanism to further accelerate the model training efficiency. Finally, extensive experimental results on all datasets demonstrate that our proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with an average improvement of 7.30%-9.53% and a maximum improvement of 33.82% across all metrics. Meanwhile, HyCubE is 4.12x faster, GPU memory usage is 52.19% lower, and the number of parameters is reduced by 85.21% compared with the average metric of the latest state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

Traditional solutions to this bias involve ensemble-based methods, which require significant computational resources, or complex log-policy-based approaches, which are difficult to understand and implement. In contrast, we propose a straightforward solution using a $Q$-target and incorporating a behavioral cloning (BC) loss penalty. This solution, acting as an uncertainty measure, can be easily implemented with minimal code and without the need for an ensemble. Our empirical findings strongly support the superiority of Conservative DDPG over DDPG across various MuJoCo and Bullet tasks. We consistently observe better performance in all evaluated tasks and even competitive or superior performance compared to TD3 and TD7, all achieved with significantly reduced computational requirements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neuro-symbolic reinforcement learning (NS-RL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for explainable decision-making, characterized by the interpretability of symbolic policies. NS-RL entails structured state representations for tasks with visual observations, but previous methods are unable to refine the structured states with rewards due to a lack of efficiency. Accessibility also remains to be an issue, as extensive domain knowledge is required to interpret symbolic policies. In this paper, we present a framework for learning structured states and symbolic policies jointly, whose key idea is to distill vision foundation models into a scalable perception module and refine it during policy learning. Moreover, we design a pipeline to generate language explanations for policies and decisions using large language models. In experiments on nine Atari tasks, we verify the efficacy of our approach, and we also present explanations for policies and decisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Chen, Felix Weitk\"amper, Sagar Malhotra</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the generalization behavior of Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) across relational structures of different sizes. Multiple works have noticed that MLNs learned on a given domain generalize poorly across domains of different sizes. This behavior emerges from a lack of internal consistency within an MLN when used across different domain sizes. In this paper, we quantify this inconsistency and bound it in terms of the variance of the MLN parameters. The parameter variance also bounds the KL divergence between an MLN's marginal distributions taken from different domain sizes. We use these bounds to show that maximizing the data log-likelihood while simultaneously minimizing the parameter variance corresponds to two natural notions of generalization across domain sizes. Our theoretical results apply to Exponential Random Graphs and other Markov network based relational models. Finally, we observe that solutions known to decrease the variance of the MLN parameters, like regularization and Domain-Size Aware MLNs, increase the internal consistency of the MLNs. We empirically verify our results on four different datasets, with different methods to control parameter variance, showing that controlling parameter variance leads to better generalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Privacy is a human right. It ensures that individuals are free to engage in discussions, participate in groups, and form relationships online or offline without fear of their data being inappropriately harvested, analyzed, or otherwise used to harm them. Preserving privacy has emerged as a critical factor in research, particularly in the computational social science (CSS), artificial intelligence (AI) and data science domains, given their reliance on individuals' data for novel insights. The increasing use of advanced computational models stands to exacerbate privacy concerns because, if inappropriately used, they can quickly infringe privacy rights and lead to adverse effects for individuals -- especially vulnerable groups -- and society. We have already witnessed a host of privacy issues emerge with the advent of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, which further demonstrate the importance of embedding privacy from the start. This article contributes to the field by discussing the role of privacy and the issues that researchers working in CSS, AI, data science and related domains are likely to face. It then presents several key considerations for researchers to ensure participant privacy is best preserved in their research design, data collection and use, analysis, and dissemination of research results.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the big data era, integrating diverse data modalities poses significant challenges, particularly in complex fields like healthcare. This paper introduces a new process model for multimodal Data Fusion for Data Mining, integrating embeddings and the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining with the existing Data Fusion Information Group model. Our model aims to decrease computational costs, complexity, and bias while improving efficiency and reliability. We also propose "disentangled dense fusion", a novel embedding fusion method designed to optimize mutual information and facilitate dense inter-modality feature interaction, thereby minimizing redundant information.
  We demonstrate the model's efficacy through three use cases: predicting diabetic retinopathy using retinal images and patient metadata, domestic violence prediction employing satellite imagery, internet, and census data, and identifying clinical and demographic features from radiography images and clinical notes. The model achieved a Macro F1 score of 0.92 in diabetic retinopathy prediction, an R-squared of 0.854 and sMAPE of 24.868 in domestic violence prediction, and a macro AUC of 0.92 and 0.99 for disease prediction and sex classification, respectively, in radiological analysis.
  These results underscore the Data Fusion for Data Mining model's potential to significantly impact multimodal data processing, promoting its adoption in diverse, resource-constrained settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Timothy Bennett</p>
<p>Abstract: Biological intelligence is more sample-efficient than artificial intelligence (AI), learning from fewer examples. Here we answer why. Given data, there can be many policies which seem "correct" because they perfectly fit the data. However, only one correct policy could have actually caused the data. Sample-efficiency requires a means of discerning which. Previous work showed sample efficiency is maximised by weak-policy-optimisation (WPO); preferring policies that more weakly constrain what is considered to be correct, given finite resources. Biology's sample-efficiency demonstrates it is better at WPO. To understand how, we formalise the "multiscale-competency-architecture" (MCA) observed in biological systems, as a sequence of nested "agentic-abstraction-layers". We show that WPO at low levels enables synthesis of weaker policies at high. We call this "multiscale-causal-learning", and argue this is how we might construct more scale-able, sample-efficient and reliable AI. Furthermore, a sufficiently weak policy at low levels is a precondition of collective policy at higher levels. The higher level "identity" of the collective is lost if lower levels use an insufficiently weak policy (e.g. cells may become isolated from the collective informational structure and revert to primitive behaviour). This has implications for biology, machine learning, AI-safety, and philosophy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Wen, Yuan Fang, Pengcheng Wei, Fayao Liu, Zhenghua Chen, Min Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a crucial role in the prognostics and health management of industrial systems that involve a variety of interrelated sensors. Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Hu, Xibin Wu, Weixun Wang,  Xianyu, Dehao Zhang, Yu Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow by scaling laws, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has gained significant attention due to its outstanding performance. However, unlike pretraining or fine-tuning a single model, scaling reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for training large language models poses coordination challenges across four models. We present OpenRLHF, an open-source framework enabling efficient RLHF scaling. Unlike existing RLHF frameworks that co-locate four models on the same GPUs, OpenRLHF re-designs scheduling for the models beyond 70B parameters using Ray, vLLM, and DeepSpeed, leveraging improved resource utilization and diverse training approaches. Integrating seamlessly with Hugging Face, OpenRLHF provides an out-of-the-box solution with optimized algorithms and launch scripts, which ensures user-friendliness. OpenRLHF implements RLHF, DPO, rejection sampling, and other alignment techniques. Empowering state-of-the-art LLM development, OpenRLHF's code is available at https://github.com/OpenLLMAI/OpenRLHF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenghui Chen, Daniel Fried, Ufuk Topcu</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing autonomous agents that can strategize and cooperate with humans under information asymmetry is challenging without effective communication in natural language. We introduce a shared-control game, where two players collectively control a token in alternating turns to achieve a common objective under incomplete information. We formulate a policy synthesis problem for an autonomous agent in this game with a human as the other player. To solve this problem, we propose a communication-based approach comprising a language module and a planning module. The language module translates natural language messages into and from a finite set of flags, a compact representation defined to capture player intents. The planning module leverages these flags to compute a policy using an asymmetric information-set Monte Carlo tree search with flag exchange algorithm we present. We evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in a testbed based on Gnomes at Night, a search-and-find maze board game. Results of human subject experiments show that communication narrows the information gap between players and enhances human-agent cooperation efficiency with fewer turns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tae-wook Kim, Han-jin Lee, Hyeon-Jin Jung, Ji-Woong Yang, Ellen J. Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic accidents are recognized as a major social issue worldwide, causing numerous injuries and significant costs annually. Consequently, methods for predicting and preventing traffic accidents have been researched for many years. With advancements in the field of artificial intelligence, various studies have applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to traffic accident prediction. Modern traffic conditions change rapidly by the minute, and these changes vary significantly across different roads. In other words, the risk of traffic accidents changes minute by minute in various patterns for each road. Therefore, it is desirable to predict traffic accident risk at the Minute-Level and Road-Level. However, because roads have close and complex relationships with adjacent roads, research on predicting traffic accidents at the Minute-Level and Road-Level is challenging. Thus, it is essential to build a model that can reflect the spatial and temporal characteristics of roads for traffic accident prediction. Consequently, recent attempts have been made to use Graph Convolutional Networks to capture the spatial characteristics of roads and Recurrent Neural Networks to capture their temporal characteristics for predicting traffic accident risk. This paper proposes the Sequential based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (SST-GCN), which combines GCN and LSTM, to predict traffic accidents at the Minute-Level and Road-Level using a road dataset constructed in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. Experiments have demonstrated that SST-GCN outperforms other state-of-the-art models in Minute-Level predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaming Che, Junlin Zhang, Zhuang Qi, Xin Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning with noisy labels has become an effective strategy for enhancing the robustness of models, which enables models to better tolerate inaccurate data. Existing methods either focus on optimizing the loss function to mitigate the interference from noise, or design procedures to detect potential noise and correct errors. However, their effectiveness is often compromised in representation learning due to the dilemma where models overfit to noisy labels. To address this issue, this paper proposes a relation modeling and distillation framework that models inter-sample relationships via self-supervised learning and employs knowledge distillation to enhance understanding of latent associations, which mitigate the impact of noisy labels. Specifically, the proposed method, termed RMDNet, includes two main modules, where the relation modeling (RM) module implements the contrastive learning technique to learn representations of all data, an unsupervised approach that effectively eliminates the interference of noisy tags on feature extraction. The relation-guided representation learning (RGRL) module utilizes inter-sample relation learned from the RM module to calibrate the representation distribution for noisy samples, which is capable of improving the generalization of the model in the inference phase. Notably, the proposed RMDNet is a plug-and-play framework that can integrate multiple methods to its advantage. Extensive experiments were conducted on two datasets, including performance comparison, ablation study, in-depth analysis and case study. The results show that RMDNet can learn discriminative representations for noisy data, which results in superior performance than the existing methods.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19808">AI with Alien Content and Alien Metasemantics</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Herman Cappelen, Josh Dever</p>
<p>Abstract: AlphaGo plays chess and Go in a creative and novel way. It is natural for us to attribute contents to it, such as that it doesn't view being several pawns behind, if it has more board space, as bad. The framework introduced in Cappelen and Dever (2021) provides a way of thinking about the semantics and the metasemantics of AI content: does AlphaGo entertain contents like this, and if so, in virtue of what does a given state of the program mean that particular content? One salient question Cappelen and Dever didn't consider was the possibility of alien content. Alien content is content that is not or cannot be expressed by human beings. It's highly plausible that AlphaGo, or any other sophisticated AI system, expresses alien contents. That this is so, moreover, is plausibly a metasemantic fact: a fact that has to do with how AI comes to entertain content in the first place, one that will heed the vastly different etiology of AI and human content. This chapter explores the question of alien content in AI from a semantic and metasemantic perspective. It lays out the logical space of possible responses to the semantic and metasemantic questions alien content poses, considers whether and how we humans could communicate with entities who express alien content, and points out that getting clear about such questions might be important for more 'applied' issues in the philosophy of AI, such as existential risk and XAI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Herman Cappelen, Josh Dever, John Hawthorne</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an argument that certain AI safety measures, rather than mitigating existential risk, may instead exacerbate it. Under certain key assumptions - the inevitability of AI failure, the expected correlation between an AI system's power at the point of failure and the severity of the resulting harm, and the tendency of safety measures to enable AI systems to become more powerful before failing - safety efforts have negative expected utility. The paper examines three response strategies: Optimism, Mitigation, and Holism. Each faces challenges stemming from intrinsic features of the AI safety landscape that we term Bottlenecking, the Perfection Barrier, and Equilibrium Fluctuation. The surprising robustness of the argument forces a re-examination of core assumptions around AI safety and points to several avenues for further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingda Li, Xinyu Li, Yifan Chen, Wenfeng Xuan, Weinan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (RALMs) demonstrate their superiority in terms of factuality, they do not consistently outperform the original retrieval-free Language Models (LMs). Our experiments reveal that this example-level performance inconsistency exists not only between retrieval-augmented and retrieval-free LM but also among different retrievers. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate the degeneration behavior of RALMs and theoretically decompose it into four categories. Further analysis based on our decomposition reveals that the innate difference in knowledge sources and the unpredictable degeneration of the reader model contribute most to the inconsistency. Drawing from our analysis, we introduce Ensemble of Retrievers (EoR), a trainable framework that can adaptively retrieve from different knowledge sources and effectively decrease unpredictable reader errors. Our experiments on Open Domain Question Answering show that EoR substantially improves performance over the RALM with a single retriever by considerably reducing inconsistent behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhilin Wang, Qin Hu, Minghui Xu, Yan Zhuang, Yawei Wang, Xiuzhen Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: With the technological advances in machine learning, effective ways are available to process the huge amount of data generated in real life. However, issues of privacy and scalability will constrain the development of machine learning. Federated learning (FL) can prevent privacy leakage by assigning training tasks to multiple clients, thus separating the central server from the local devices. However, FL still suffers from shortcomings such as single-point-failure and malicious data. The emergence of blockchain provides a secure and efficient solution for the deployment of FL. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the literature on blockchained FL (BCFL). First, we investigate how blockchain can be applied to federal learning from the perspective of system composition. Then, we analyze the concrete functions of BCFL from the perspective of mechanism design and illustrate what problems blockchain addresses specifically for FL. We also survey the applications of BCFL in reality. Finally, we discuss some challenges and future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laura Blattner, Scott Nelson, Jann Spiess</p>
<p>Abstract: What should regulators of complex algorithms regulate? We propose a model of oversight over 'black-box' algorithms used in high-stakes applications such as lending, medical testing, or hiring. In our model, a regulator is limited in how much she can learn about a black-box model deployed by an agent with misaligned preferences. The regulator faces two choices: first, whether to allow for the use of complex algorithms; and second, which key properties of algorithms to regulate. We show that limiting agents to algorithms that are simple enough to be fully transparent is inefficient as long as the misalignment is limited and complex algorithms have sufficiently better performance than simple ones. Allowing for complex algorithms can improve welfare, but the gains depend on how the regulator regulates them. Regulation that focuses on the overall average behavior of algorithms, for example based on standard explainer tools, will generally be inefficient. Targeted regulation that focuses on the source of incentive misalignment, e.g., excess false positives or racial disparities, can provide second-best solutions. We provide empirical support for our theoretical findings using an application in consumer lending, where we document that complex models regulated based on context-specific explanation tools outperform simple, fully transparent models. This gain from complex models represents a Pareto improvement across our empirical applications that is preferred both by the lender and from the perspective of the financial regulator.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengjian Zhang, Guihua Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: A swarm intelligence-based optimization algorithm, named Duck Swarm Algorithm (DSA), is proposed in this study, which is inspired by the searching for food sources and foraging behaviors of the duck swarm. Two rules are modeled from the finding food and foraging of the duck, which corresponds to the exploration and exploitation phases of the proposed DSA, respectively. The performance of the DSA is verified by using multiple CEC benchmark functions, where its statistical (best, mean, standard deviation, and average running-time) results are compared with seven well-known algorithms like Particle swarm optimization (PSO), Firefly algorithm (FA), Chicken swarm optimization (CSO), Grey wolf optimizer (GWO), Sine cosine algorithm (SCA), and Marine-predators algorithm (MPA), and Archimedes optimization algorithm (AOA). Moreover, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Friedman test, and convergence curves of the comparison results are utilized to prove the superiority of the DSA against other algorithms. The results demonstrate that DSA is a high-performance optimization method in terms of convergence speed and exploration-exploitation balance for solving the numerical optimization problems. Also, DSA is applied for the optimal design of six engineering constrained optimization problems and the node optimization deployment task of the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Overall, the comparison results revealed that the DSA is a promising and very competitive algorithm for solving different optimization problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ce Ju, Cuntai Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: The machine learning community has shown increasing interest in addressing the domain adaptation problem on symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds. This interest is primarily driven by the complexities of neuroimaging data generated from brain signals, which often exhibit shifts in data distribution across recording sessions. These neuroimaging data, represented by signal covariance matrices, possess the mathematical properties of symmetry and positive definiteness. However, applying conventional domain adaptation methods is challenging because these mathematical properties can be disrupted when operating on covariance matrices. In this study, we introduce a novel geometric deep learning-based approach utilizing optimal transport on SPD manifolds to manage discrepancies in both marginal and conditional distributions between the source and target domains. We evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in three cross-session brain-computer interface scenarios and provide visualized results for further insights.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ludwig Bothmann, Kristina Peters, Bernd Bischl</p>
<p>Abstract: A growing body of literature in fairness-aware machine learning (fairML) aims to mitigate machine learning (ML)-related unfairness in automated decision-making (ADM) by defining metrics that measure fairness of an ML model and by proposing methods to ensure that trained ML models achieve low scores on these metrics. However, the underlying concept of fairness, i.e., the question of what fairness is, is rarely discussed, leaving a significant gap between centuries of philosophical discussion and the recent adoption of the concept in the ML community. In this work, we try to bridge this gap by formalizing a consistent concept of fairness and by translating the philosophical considerations into a formal framework for the training and evaluation of ML models in ADM systems. We argue that fairness problems can arise even without the presence of protected attributes (PAs), and point out that fairness and predictive performance are not irreconcilable opposites, but that the latter is necessary to achieve the former. Furthermore, we argue why and how causal considerations are necessary when assessing fairness in the presence of PAs by proposing a fictitious, normatively desired (FiND) world in which PAs have no causal effects. In practice, this FiND world must be approximated by a warped world in which the causal effects of the PAs are removed from the real-world data. Finally, we achieve greater linguistic clarity in the discussion of fairML. We outline algorithms for practical applications and present illustrative experiments on COMPAS data.</p>

Furthermore, we propose an approach for mining the root-causing experience and results for reuse, to accelerate future debug activities and reduce dependency on validation experts. We believe that these techniques are beneficial also for other validation activities at different levels of abstraction, for complex hardware, software and firmware systems, both pre-silicon and post-silicon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Fuhrer, Yuval Shpigelman, Chen Tessler, Shie Mannor, Gal Chechik, Eitan Zahavi, Gal Dalal</p>
<p>Abstract: As communication protocols evolve, datacenter network utilization increases. As a result, congestion is more frequent, causing higher latency and packet loss. Combined with the increasing complexity of workloads, manual design of congestion control (CC) algorithms becomes extremely difficult. This calls for the development of AI approaches to replace the human effort. Unfortunately, it is currently not possible to deploy AI models on network devices due to their limited computational capabilities. Here, we offer a solution to this problem by building a computationally-light solution based on a recent reinforcement learning CC algorithm [arXiv:2207.02295]. We reduce the inference time of RL-CC by x500 by distilling its complex neural network into decision trees. This transformation enables real-time inference within the $\mu$-sec decision-time requirement, with a negligible effect on quality. We deploy the transformed policy on NVIDIA NICs in a live cluster. Compared to popular CC algorithms used in production, RL-CC is the only method that performs well on all benchmarks tested over a large range of number of flows. It balances multiple metrics simultaneously: bandwidth, latency, and packet drops. These results suggest that data-driven methods for CC are feasible, challenging the prior belief that handcrafted heuristics are necessary to achieve optimal performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wancong Zhang, Anthony GX-Chen, Vlad Sobal, Yann LeCun, Nicolas Carion</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised visual representation learning offers the opportunity to leverage large corpora of unlabeled trajectories to form useful visual representations, which can benefit the training of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. However, evaluating the fitness of such representations requires training RL algorithms which is computationally intensive and has high variance outcomes. Inspired by the vision community, we study whether linear probing can be a proxy evaluation task for the quality of unsupervised RL representation. Specifically, we probe for the observed reward in a given state and the action of an expert in a given state, both of which are generally applicable to many RL domains. Through rigorous experimentation, we show that the probing tasks are strongly rank correlated with the downstream RL performance on the Atari100k Benchmark, while having lower variance and up to 600x lower computational cost. This provides a more efficient method for exploring the space of pretraining algorithms and identifying promising pretraining recipes without the need to run RL evaluations for every setting. Leveraging this framework, we further improve existing self-supervised learning (SSL) recipes for RL, highlighting the importance of the forward model, the size of the visual backbone, and the precise formulation of the unsupervised objective.</p>

<p>Abstract: Event-based machine learning promises more energy-efficient AI on future neuromorphic hardware. Here, we investigate how the recently discovered Eventprop algorithm for gradient descent on exact gradients in spiking neural networks can be scaled up to challenging keyword recognition benchmarks. We implemented Eventprop in the GPU-enhanced Neural Networks framework and used it for training recurrent spiking neural networks on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits and Spiking Speech Commands datasets. We found that learning depended strongly on the loss function and extended Eventprop to a wider class of loss functions to enable effective training. When combined with the right additional mechanisms from the machine learning toolbox, Eventprop networks achieved state-of-the-art performance on Spiking Heidelberg Digits and good accuracy on Spiking Speech Commands. This work is a significant step towards a low-power neuromorphic alternative to current machine learning paradigms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shang-Fu Chen, Hsiang-Chun Wang, Ming-Hao Hsu, Chun-Mao Lai, Shao-Hua Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning addresses the challenge of learning by observing an expert's demonstrations without access to reward signals from environments. Most existing imitation learning methods that do not require interacting with environments either model the expert distribution as the conditional probability p(a|s) (e.g., behavioral cloning, BC) or the joint probability p(s, a). Despite the simplicity of modeling the conditional probability with BC, it usually struggles with generalization. While modeling the joint probability can improve generalization performance, the inference procedure is often time-consuming, and the model can suffer from manifold overfitting. This work proposes an imitation learning framework that benefits from modeling both the conditional and joint probability of the expert distribution. Our proposed Diffusion Model-Augmented Behavioral Cloning (DBC) employs a diffusion model trained to model expert behaviors and learns a policy to optimize both the BC loss (conditional) and our proposed diffusion model loss (joint). DBC outperforms baselines in various continuous control tasks in navigation, robot arm manipulation, dexterous manipulation, and locomotion. We design additional experiments to verify the limitations of modeling either the conditional probability or the joint probability of the expert distribution, as well as compare different generative models. Ablation studies justify the effectiveness of our design choices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bohao Qu, Xiaofeng Cao, Jielong Yang, Hechang Chen, Chang Yi, Ivor W. Tsang, Yew-Soon Ong</p>
<p>Abstract: Markov Decision Process (MDP) presents a mathematical framework to formulate the learning processes of agents in reinforcement learning. MDP is limited by the Markovian assumption that a reward only depends on the immediate state and action. However, a reward sometimes depends on the history of states and actions, which may result in the decision process in a non-Markovian environment. In such environments, agents receive rewards via temporally-extended behaviors sparsely, and the learned policies may be similar. This leads the agents acquired with similar policies generally overfit to the given task and can not quickly adapt to perturbations of environments. To resolve this problem, this paper tries to learn the diverse policies from the history of state-action pairs under a non-Markovian environment, in which a policy dispersion scheme is designed for seeking diverse policy representation. Specifically, we first adopt a transformer-based method to learn policy embeddings. Then, we stack the policy embeddings to construct a dispersion matrix to induce a set of diverse policies. Finally, we prove that if the dispersion matrix is positive definite, the dispersed embeddings can effectively enlarge the disagreements across policies, yielding a diverse expression for the original policy embedding distribution. Experimental results show that this dispersion scheme can obtain more expressive diverse policies, which then derive more robust performance than recent learning baselines under various learning environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Schwabe, Maribel Acosta</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardinality Estimation over Knowledge Graphs (KG) is crucial for query optimization, yet remains a challenging task due to the semi-structured nature and complex correlations of typical Knowledge Graphs. In this work, we propose GNCE, a novel approach that leverages knowledge graph embeddings and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to accurately predict the cardinality of conjunctive queries. GNCE first creates semantically meaningful embeddings for all entities in the KG, which are then integrated into the given query, which is processed by a GNN to estimate the cardinality of the query. We evaluate GNCE on several KGs in terms of q-Error and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches based on sampling, summaries, and (machine) learning in terms of estimation accuracy while also having lower execution time and less parameters. Additionally, we show that GNCE can inductively generalise to unseen entities, making it suitable for use in dynamic query processing scenarios. Our proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve query optimization and related applications that rely on accurate cardinality estimates of conjunctive queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bang Yang, Fenglin Liu, Yuexian Zou, Xian Wu, Yaowei Wang, David A. Clifton</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural Language Generation (NLG) accepts input data in the form of images, videos, or text and generates corresponding natural language text as output. Existing NLG methods mainly adopt a supervised approach and rely heavily on coupled data-to-text pairs. However, for many targeted scenarios and for non-English languages, sufficient quantities of labeled data are often not available. To relax the dependency on labeled data of downstream tasks, we propose an intuitive and effective zero-shot learning framework, ZeroNLG, which can deal with multiple NLG tasks, including image-to-text (image captioning), video-to-text (video captioning), and text-to-text (neural machine translation), across English, Chinese, German, and French within a unified framework. ZeroNLG does not require any labeled downstream pairs for training. During training, ZeroNLG (i) projects different domains (across modalities and languages) to corresponding coordinates in a shared common latent space; (ii) bridges different domains by aligning their corresponding coordinates in this space; and (iii) builds an unsupervised multilingual auto-encoder to learn to generate text by reconstructing the input text given its coordinate in shared latent space. Consequently, during inference, based on the data-to-text pipeline, ZeroNLG can generate target sentences across different languages given the coordinate of input data in the common space. Within this unified framework, given visual (imaging or video) data as input, ZeroNLG can perform zero-shot visual captioning; given textual sentences as input, ZeroNLG can perform zero-shot machine translation. We present the results of extensive experiments on twelve NLG tasks, showing that, without using any labeled downstream pairs for training, ZeroNLG generates high-quality and believable outputs and significantly outperforms existing zero-shot methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanbo Wang, Muhan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Research on the theoretical expressiveness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has developed rapidly, and many methods have been proposed to enhance the expressiveness. However, most methods do not have a uniform expressiveness measure except for a few that strictly follow the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman ($k$-WL) test hierarchy, leading to difficulties in quantitatively comparing their expressiveness. Previous research has attempted to use datasets for measurement, but facing problems with difficulty (any model surpassing 1-WL has nearly 100% accuracy), granularity (models tend to be either 100% correct or near random guess), and scale (only several essentially different graphs involved). To address these limitations, we study the realized expressive power that a practical model instance can achieve using a novel expressiveness dataset, BREC, which poses greater difficulty (with up to 4-WL-indistinguishable graphs), finer granularity (enabling comparison of models between 1-WL and 3-WL), a larger scale (consisting of 800 1-WL-indistinguishable graphs that are non-isomorphic to each other). We synthetically test 23 models with higher-than-1-WL expressiveness on BREC. Our experiment gives the first thorough measurement of the realized expressiveness of those state-of-the-art beyond-1-WL GNN models and reveals the gap between theoretical and realized expressiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Gao, Dashun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has the potential to change almost every line of work. As AI capabilities continue to improve in accuracy, robustness, and reach, AI may outperform and even replace human experts across many valuable tasks. Despite enormous effort devoted to understanding the impact of AI on labor and the economy and AI's recent successes in accelerating scientific discovery and progress, we lack a systematic understanding of how AI advances may benefit scientific research across disciplines and fields. Here, drawing from the literature on the future of work and the science of science, we develop a measurement framework to estimate both the direct use of AI and the potential benefit of AI in scientific research, applying natural language processing techniques to 74.6 million publications and 7.1 million patents. We find that the use of AI in research is widespread throughout the sciences, growing especially rapidly since 2015, and papers that use AI exhibit a citation premium, more likely to be highly cited both within and outside their disciplines. Moreover, our analysis reveals considerable potential for AI to benefit numerous scientific fields, yet a notable disconnect exists between AI education and its research applications, highlighting a mismatch between the supply of AI expertise and its demand in research. Lastly, we examine demographic disparities in AI's benefits across scientific disciplines and find that disciplines with a higher proportion of women or Black scientists tend to be associated with less benefit, suggesting that AI's growing impact on research may further exacerbate existing inequalities in science. As the connection between AI and scientific research deepens, our findings may become increasingly important, with implications for the equity and sustainability of the research enterprise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Yuanzhi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based language models are effective but complex, and understanding their inner workings is a significant challenge. Previous research has primarily explored how these models handle simple tasks like name copying or selection, and we extend this by investigating how these models grasp complex, recursive language structures defined by context-free grammars (CFGs). We introduce a family of synthetic CFGs that produce hierarchical rules, capable of generating lengthy sentences (e.g., hundreds of tokens) that are locally ambiguous and require dynamic programming to parse. Despite this complexity, we demonstrate that generative models like GPT can accurately learn this CFG language and generate sentences based on it. We explore the model's internals, revealing that its hidden states precisely capture the structure of CFGs, and its attention patterns resemble the information passing in a dynamic programming algorithm.
  This paper also presents several corollaries, including showing why positional embedding is inferior to relative attention or rotary embedding; demonstrating that encoder-based models (e.g., BERT, deBERTa) cannot learn very deeply nested CFGs as effectively as generative models (e.g., GPT); and highlighting the necessity of adding structural and syntactic errors to the pretraining data to make the model more robust to corrupted language prefixes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caroline Choi, Fahim Tajwar, Yoonho Lee, Huaxiu Yao, Ananya Kumar, Chelsea Finn</p>
<p>Abstract: In safety-critical applications of machine learning, it is often desirable for a model to be conservative, abstaining from making predictions on unknown inputs which are not well-represented in the training data. However, detecting unknown examples is challenging, as it is impossible to anticipate all potential inputs at test time. To address this, prior work (Hendrycks et al., 2018) minimizes model confidence on an auxiliary outlier dataset carefully curated to be disjoint from the training distribution. We theoretically analyze the choice of auxiliary dataset for confidence minimization, revealing two actionable insights: (1) if the auxiliary set contains unknown examples similar to those seen at test time, confidence minimization leads to provable detection of unknown test examples, and (2) if the first condition is satisfied, it is unnecessary to filter out known examples for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Motivated by these guidelines, we propose the Data-Driven Confidence Minimization (DCM) framework, which minimizes confidence on an uncertainty dataset. We apply DCM to two problem settings in which conservative prediction is paramount -- selective classification and OOD detection -- and provide a realistic way to gather uncertainty data for each setting. In our experiments, DCM consistently outperforms existing selective classification approaches on 4 datasets when tested on unseen distributions and outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods on 12 ID-OOD dataset pairs, reducing FPR (at TPR $95\%$) by $6.3\%$ and $58.1\%$ on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 compared to Outlier Exposure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Zhang, Xiaohua Qi, Bo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing approaches in Federated Learning (FL) mainly focus on sending model parameters or gradients from clients to a server. However, these methods are plagued by significant inefficiency, privacy, and security concerns. Thanks to the emerging foundation generative models, we propose a novel federated learning framework, namely Federated Generative Learning. In this framework, each client can create text embeddings that are tailored to their local data, and send embeddings to the server. Then the informative training data can be synthesized remotely on the server using foundation generative models with these embeddings, which can benefit FL tasks. Our proposed framework offers several advantages, including increased communication efficiency, robustness to data heterogeneity, substantial performance improvements, and enhanced privacy protection. We validate these benefits through extensive experiments conducted on 12 datasets. For example, on the ImageNet100 dataset with a highly skewed data distribution, our method outperforms FedAvg by 12% in a single communication round, compared to FedAvg's performance over 200 communication rounds. We have released the code for all experiments conducted in this study.</p>

<p>Abstract: Representing urban regions accurately and comprehensively is essential for various urban planning and analysis tasks. Recently, with the expansion of the city, modeling long-range spatial dependencies with multiple data sources plays an important role in urban region representation. In this paper, we propose the Attentive Graph Enhanced Region Representation Learning (ATGRL) model, which aims to capture comprehensive dependencies from multiple graphs and learn rich semantic representations of urban regions. Specifically, we propose a graph-enhanced learning module to construct regional graphs by incorporating mobility flow patterns, point of interests (POIs) functions, and check-in semantics with noise filtering. Then, we present a multi-graph aggregation module to capture both local and global spatial dependencies between regions by integrating information from multiple graphs. In addition, we design a dual-stage fusion module to facilitate information sharing between different views and efficiently fuse multi-view representations for urban region embedding using an improved linear attention mechanism. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world datasets for three downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaron J. Li, Robin Netzorg, Zhihan Cheng, Zhuoqin Zhang, Bin Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, work has gone into developing deep interpretable methods for image classification that clearly attributes a model's output to specific features of the data. One such of these methods is the Prototypical Part Network (ProtoPNet), which attempts to classify images based on meaningful parts of the input. While this architecture is able to produce visually interpretable classifications, it often learns to classify based on parts of the image that are not semantically meaningful. To address this problem, we propose the Reward Reweighing, Reselecting, and Retraining (R3) post-processing framework, which performs three additional corrective updates to a pretrained ProtoPNet in an offline and efficient manner. The first two steps involve learning a reward model based on collected human feedback and then aligning the prototypes with human preferences. The final step is retraining, which realigns the base features and the classifier layer of the original model with the updated prototypes. We find that our R3 framework consistently improves both the interpretability and the predictive accuracy of ProtoPNet and its variants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Tang, Xiaodan Xing, Guang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based Generative Models have the potential to convert low-resolution CT images into high-resolution counterparts without long acquisition times and increased radiation exposure in thin-slice CT imaging. However, procuring appropriate training data for these Super-Resolution (SR) models is challenging. Previous SR research has simulated thick-slice CT images from thin-slice CT images to create training pairs. However, these methods either rely on simplistic interpolation techniques that lack realism or sinogram reconstruction, which require the release of raw data and complex reconstruction algorithms. Thus, we introduce a simple yet realistic method to generate thick CT images from thin-slice CT images, facilitating the creation of training pairs for SR algorithms. The training pairs produced by our method closely resemble real data distributions (PSNR=49.74 vs. 40.66, p$<$0.05). A multivariate Cox regression analysis involving thick slice CT images with lung fibrosis revealed that only the radiomics features extracted using our method demonstrated a significant correlation with mortality (HR=1.19 and HR=1.14, p$<$0.005). This paper represents the first to identify and address the challenge of generating appropriate paired training data for Deep Learning-based CT SR models, which enhances the efficacy and applicability of SR models in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Compressed prompts aid instruction-tuned language models (LMs) in overcoming context window limitations and reducing computational costs. Existing methods, which primarily based on training embeddings, face various challenges associated with interpretability, the fixed number of embedding tokens, reusability across different LMs, and inapplicability when interacting with black-box APIs. This study proposes prompt compression with reinforcement learning (PCRL), which is a discrete prompt compression method that addresses these issues. The proposed PCRL method utilizes a computationally efficient policy network that edits prompts directly. The training approach employed in the proposed PCRLs can be applied flexibly to various types of LMs, including both decoder-only and encoder-decoder architecture and it can be trained without gradient access to the LMs or labeled data. The proposed PCRL achieves an average reduction of 24.6% in terms of the token count across various instruction prompts while maintaining sufficient performance. In addition, we demonstrate that the learned policy can be transferred to larger LMs, and through a comprehensive analysis, we explore the token importance within the prompts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bilgehan Sel, Ahmad Al-Tawaha, Vanshaj Khattar, Ruoxi Jia, Ming Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Current literature, aiming to surpass the "Chain-of-Thought" approach, often resorts to external modi operandi involving halting, modifying, and then resuming the generation process to boost Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning capacities. Due to their myopic perspective, they escalate the number of query requests, leading to increased costs, memory, and computational overheads. Addressing this, we propose the Algorithm of Thoughts -- a novel strategy that propels LLMs through algorithmic reasoning pathways. By employing algorithmic examples fully in-context, this overarching view of the whole process exploits the innate recurrence dynamics of LLMs, expanding their idea exploration with merely one or a few queries. Our technique outperforms earlier single-query methods and even more recent multi-query strategies that employ an extensive tree search algorithms while using significantly fewer tokens. Intriguingly, our results suggest that instructing an LLM using an algorithm can lead to performance surpassing that of the algorithm itself, hinting at LLM's inherent ability to weave its intuition into optimized searches. We probe into the underpinnings of our method's efficacy and its nuances in application. The code and related content can be found in: https://algorithm-of-thoughts.github.io.</p>

We introduce TextBind, an almost annotation-free framework for empowering larger language models with the multi-turn interleaved multimodal instruction-following capabilities. Our approach requires only image-caption pairs and generates multi-turn multimodal instruction-response conversations from a language model. To accommodate interleaved image-text inputs and outputs, we devise MIM, a language model-centric architecture that seamlessly integrates image encoder and decoder models. We release our dataset, model, and demo to foster future research in the area of multimodal instruction following.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) has long been a hot research topic. Traditional methods are generally shallow learners, based on the cluster assumption. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have become the predominant techniques for their promising performance. In this paper, we theoretically discuss the relationship between these two types of methods in a unified optimization framework. One of the most intriguing findings is that, unlike traditional ones, typical GCNs may not jointly consider the graph structure and label information at each layer. Motivated by this, we further propose three simple but powerful graph convolution methods. The first is a supervised method OGC which guides the graph convolution process with labels. The others are two unsupervised methods: GGC and its multi-scale version GGCM, both aiming to preserve the graph structure information during the convolution process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show the effectiveness of our methods.</p>

Inspired by the success of deep learning, recent deep generative SR methods have shown promising results.

In this work, we propose DySymNet, a novel neural-guided Dynamic Symbolic Network for SR. Instead of searching for expressions within a large search space, we explore symbolic networks with various structures, guided by reinforcement learning, and optimize them to identify expressions that better-fitting the data. Based on extensive numerical experiments on low-dimensional public standard benchmarks and the well-known SRBench with more variables, DySymNet shows clear superiority over several representative baseline models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniele Condorelli, Massimiliano Furlan</p>
<p>Abstract: We simulate behaviour of two independent reinforcement learning algorithms playing the Crawford and Sobel (1982) game of strategic information transmission. We adopt memoryless algorithms to capture learning in a static game where a large population interacts anonymously. We show that sender and receiver converge to Nash equilibrium play. The level of informativeness of the sender's cheap talk decreases as the bias increases and, at intermediate level of the bias, it matches the level predicted by the Pareto optimal equilibrium or by the second best one. Conclusions are robust to alternative specifications of the learning hyperparameters and of the game.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingfeng Shen, Aayush Mishra, Daniel Khashabi</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of In-Context Learning (ICL) in LLMs remains a remarkable phenomenon that is partially understood. To explain ICL, recent studies have created theoretical connections to Gradient Descent (GD). We ask, do such connections hold up in actual pre-trained language models? We highlight the limiting assumptions in prior works that make their setup considerably different from the practical setup in which language models are trained. For example, their experimental verification uses \emph{ICL objective} (training models explicitly for ICL), which differs from the emergent ICL in the wild. Furthermore, the theoretical hand-constructed weights used in these studies have properties that don't match those of real LLMs. We also look for evidence in real models. We observe that ICL and GD have different sensitivity to the order in which they observe demonstrations. Finally, we probe and compare the ICL vs. GD hypothesis in a natural setting. We conduct comprehensive empirical analyses on language models pre-trained on natural data (LLaMa-7B). Our comparisons of three performance metrics highlight the inconsistent behavior of ICL and GD as a function of various factors such as datasets, models, and the number of demonstrations. We observe that ICL and GD modify the output distribution of language models differently. These results indicate that \emph{the equivalence between ICL and GD remains an open hypothesis} and calls for further studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaodong Yu, Hao Cheng, Xiaodong Liu, Dan Roth, Jianfeng Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by retrieval augmentation, it remains challenging to measure the reliability of LLMs using static question-answering (QA) data. Specifically, given the potential of data contamination (e.g., leading to memorization), good static benchmark performance does not ensure that model can reliably use the provided evidence for responding, which is essential to avoid hallucination when the required knowledge is new or private. Inspired by adversarial machine learning, we investigate the feasibility of automatically perturbing existing static one for dynamic evaluation. Specifically, this paper presents ReEval, an LLM-based framework using prompt chaining to perturb the original evidence for generating new test cases for evaluating the LLMs' reliability in using new evidence for answering.
  We implement ReEval using ChatGPT and evaluate the resulting variants of two popular open-domain QA datasets on a collection of LLMs under various prompting settings. Our generated data is human-readable and useful to trigger hallucination in LLM. Accurate models on static data are observed to produce unsupported answers from the perturbed evidence, with pronounced accuracy drops across LLMs including GPT-4. We find that our adversarial examples are transferable across all considered LLMs. The examples generated by a small model can be used to evaluate a much larger model, making our approach cost-effective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupei Liu, Yuqi Jia, Runpeng Geng, Jinyuan Jia, Neil Zhenqiang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: A prompt injection attack aims to inject malicious instruction/data into the input of an LLM-Integrated Application such that it produces results as an attacker desires. Existing works are limited to case studies. As a result, the literature lacks a systematic understanding of prompt injection attacks and their defenses. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. In particular, we propose a framework to formalize prompt injection attacks. Existing attacks are special cases in our framework. Moreover, based on our framework, we design a new attack by combining existing ones. Using our framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation on 5 prompt injection attacks and 10 defenses with 10 LLMs and 7 tasks. Our work provides a common benchmark for quantitatively evaluating future prompt injection attacks and defenses. To facilitate research on this topic, we make our platform public at https://github.com/liu00222/Open-Prompt-Injection.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14621">Spiking mode-based neural networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanghan Lin, Haiping Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking neural networks play an important role in brain-like neuromorphic computations and in studying working mechanisms of neural circuits. One drawback of training a large scale spiking neural network is that updating all weights is quite expensive. Furthermore, after training, all information related to the computational task is hidden into the weight matrix, prohibiting us from a transparent understanding of circuit mechanisms. Therefore, in this work, we address these challenges by proposing a spiking mode-based training protocol, where the recurrent weight matrix is explained as a Hopfield-like multiplication of three matrices: input, output modes and a score matrix. The first advantage is that the weight is interpreted by input and output modes and their associated scores characterizing the importance of each decomposition term. The number of modes is thus adjustable, allowing more degrees of freedom for modeling the experimental data. This significantly reduces the training cost because of significantly reduced space complexity for learning. Training spiking networks is thus carried out in the mode-score space. The second advantage is that one can project the high dimensional neural activity (filtered spike train) in the state space onto the mode space which is typically of a low dimension, e.g., a few modes are sufficient to capture the shape of the underlying neural manifolds. We successfully apply our framework in two computational tasks -- digit classification and selective sensory integration tasks. Our method accelerate the training of spiking neural networks by a Hopfield-like decomposition, and moreover this training leads to low-dimensional attractor structures of high-dimensional neural dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deqing Fu, Tian-Qi Chen, Robin Jia, Vatsal Sharan</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers excel at in-context learning (ICL) -- learning from demonstrations without parameter updates -- but how they do so remains a mystery. Recent work suggests that Transformers may internally run Gradient Descent (GD), a first-order optimization method, to perform ICL. In this paper, we instead demonstrate that Transformers learn to approximate higher-order optimization methods for ICL. For in-context linear regression, Transformers share a similar convergence rate as Iterative Newton's Method; both are exponentially faster than GD. Empirically, predictions from successive Transformer layers closely match different iterations of Newton's Method linearly, with each middle layer roughly computing 3 iterations; thus, Transformers and Newton's method converge at roughly the same rate. In contrast, Gradient Descent converges exponentially more slowly. We also show that Transformers can learn in-context on ill-conditioned data, a setting where Gradient Descent struggles but Iterative Newton succeeds. Finally, to corroborate our empirical findings, we prove that Transformers can implement $k$ iterations of Newton's method with $k + \mathcal{O}(1)$ layers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongkyun Kim, Mingi Kwon, Youngjung Uh</p>
<p>Abstract: When the training dataset comprises a 1:1 proportion of dogs to cats, a generative model that produces 1:1 dogs and cats better resembles the training species distribution than another model with 3:1 dogs and cats. Can we capture this phenomenon using existing metrics? Unfortunately, we cannot, because these metrics do not provide any interpretability beyond "diversity". In this context, we propose a new evaluation protocol that measures the divergence of a set of generated images from the training set regarding the distribution of attribute strengths as follows. Single-attribute Divergence (SaD) measures the divergence regarding PDFs of a single attribute. Paired-attribute Divergence (PaD) measures the divergence regarding joint PDFs of a pair of attributes. They provide which attributes the models struggle. For measuring the attribute strengths of an image, we propose Heterogeneous CLIPScore (HCS) which measures the cosine similarity between image and text vectors with heterogeneous initial points. With SaD and PaD, we reveal the following about existing generative models. ProjectedGAN generates implausible attribute relationships such as a baby with a beard even though it has competitive scores of existing metrics. Diffusion models struggle to capture diverse colors in the datasets. The larger sampling timesteps of latent diffusion model generate the more minor objects including earrings and necklaces. Stable Diffusion v1.5 better captures the attributes than v2.1. Our metrics lay a foundation for explainable evaluations of generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Latif Siddiq, Joanna C. S. Santos, Sajith Devareddy, Anna Muller</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineers' daily practices, it is important to ensure that the code generated by these tools is not only functionally correct but also free of vulnerabilities. Although LLMs can help developers to be more productive, prior empirical studies have shown that LLMs can generate insecure code. There are two contributing factors to the insecure code generation. First, existing datasets used to evaluate LLMs do not adequately represent genuine software engineering tasks sensitive to security. Instead, they are often based on competitive programming challenges or classroom-type coding tasks. In real-world applications, the code produced is integrated into larger codebases, introducing potential security risks. Second, existing evaluation metrics primarily focus on the functional correctness of the generated code while ignoring security considerations. Therefore, in this paper, we described SALLM, a framework to benchmark LLMs' abilities to generate secure code systematically. This framework has three major components: a novel dataset of security-centric Python prompts, configurable assessment techniques to evaluate the generated code, and novel metrics to evaluate the models' performance from the perspective of secure code generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) extend Large Language Models to the vision domain. Initial LMMs used holistic images and text prompts to generate ungrounded textual responses. Recently, region-level LMMs have been used to generate visually grounded responses. However, they are limited to only referring to a single object category at a time, require users to specify the regions, or cannot offer dense pixel-wise object grounding. In this work, we present Grounding LMM (GLaMM), the first model that can generate natural language responses seamlessly intertwined with corresponding object segmentation masks. GLaMM not only grounds objects appearing in the conversations but is flexible enough to accept both textual and optional visual prompts (region of interest) as input. This empowers users to interact with the model at various levels of granularity, both in textual and visual domains. Due to the lack of standard benchmarks for the novel setting of visually Grounded Conversation Generation (GCG), we introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol with our curated grounded conversations. Our proposed GCG task requires densely grounded concepts in natural scenes at a large-scale. To this end, we propose a densely annotated Grounding-anything Dataset (GranD) using our proposed automated annotation pipeline that encompasses 7.5M unique concepts grounded in a total of 810M regions available with segmentation masks. Besides GCG, GLaMM also performs effectively on several downstream tasks, e.g., referring expression segmentation, image and region-level captioning and vision-language conversations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Metod Jazbec, Patrick Forr\'e, Stephan Mandt, Dan Zhang, Eric Nalisnick</p>
<p>Abstract: Early-exit neural networks (EENNs) enable adaptive and efficient inference by providing predictions at multiple stages during the forward pass. In safety-critical applications, these predictions are meaningful only when accompanied by reliable uncertainty estimates. A popular method for quantifying the uncertainty of predictive models is the use of prediction sets. However, we demonstrate that standard techniques such as conformal prediction and Bayesian credible sets are not suitable for EENNs. They tend to generate non-nested sets across exits, meaning that labels deemed improbable at one exit may reappear in the prediction set of a subsequent exit. To address this issue, we investigate anytime-valid confidence sequences (AVCSs), an extension of traditional confidence intervals tailored for data-streaming scenarios. These sequences are inherently nested and thus well-suited for an EENN's sequential predictions. We explore the theoretical and practical challenges of using AVCSs in EENNs and show that they indeed yield nested sets across exits. Thus our work presents a promising approach towards fast, yet still safe, predictive modeling</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qizhou Wang, Guansong Pang, Mahsa Salehi, Xiaokun Xia, Christopher Leckie</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper considers an important Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) task, namely open-set GAD, which aims to train a detection model using a small number of normal and anomaly nodes (referred to as seen anomalies) to detect both seen anomalies and unseen anomalies (i.e., anomalies that cannot be illustrated the training anomalies). The availability of those labelled training data provides crucial prior knowledge about abnormalities for GAD models, enabling substantially reduced detection errors. However, current methods tend to over-emphasise fitting the seen anomalies, leading to a weak generalisation ability to detect the unseen anomalies. Further, they were introduced to handle Euclidean data, failing to effectively capture important information on graph structure and node attributes for GAD. In this work, we propose a novel open-set GAD approach, namely Normal Structure Regularisation (NSReg) to achieve generalised detection ability to unseen anomalies, while maintaining its effectiveness on detecting seen anomalies. The key idea in NSReg is to introduce a regularisation term that enforces the learning of compact, semantically-rich representations of normal nodes based on their structural relations to other nodes. When being optimised with supervised anomaly detection losses, the regularisation term helps incorporate strong normality into the modelling, and thus, it effectively avoids the overfitting the seen anomalies solely. In doing so, it helps learn better normality decision boundary, reducing the errors of detecting unseen anomalies as normal. Extensive empirical results on seven real-world datasets show the superiority of NSReg for open-set GAD.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07466">On Measuring Faithfulness or Self-consistency of Natural Language Explanations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Letitia Parcalabescu, Anette Frank</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can explain their predictions through post-hoc or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations. But an LLM could make up reasonably sounding explanations that are unfaithful to its underlying reasoning. Recent work has designed tests that aim to judge the faithfulness of post-hoc or CoT explanations. In this work we argue that these faithfulness tests do not measure faithfulness to the models' inner workings -- but rather their self-consistency at output level. Our contributions are three-fold: i) We clarify the status of faithfulness tests in view of model explainability, characterising them as self-consistency tests instead. This assessment we underline by ii) constructing a Comparative Consistency Bank for self-consistency tests that for the first time compares existing tests on a common suite of 11 open LLMs and 5 tasks -- including iii) our new self-consistency measure CC-SHAP. CC-SHAP is a fine-grained measure (not a test) of LLM self-consistency. It compares how a model's input contributes to the predicted answer and to generating the explanation. Our fine-grained CC-SHAP metric allows us iii) to compare LLM behaviour when making predictions and to analyse the effect of other consistency tests at a deeper level, which takes us one step further towards measuring faithfulness by bringing us closer to the internals of the model than strictly surface output-oriented tests.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengyu Cheng, Yifan Yang, Jian Li, Yong Dai, Tianhao Hu, Peixin Cao, Nan Du, Xiaolong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Human preference alignment is essential to improve the interaction quality of large language models (LLMs). Existing alignment methods depend on manually annotated preference data to guide the LLM optimization directions. However, continuously updating LLMs for alignment raises a distribution gap between model-generated samples and human-annotated responses, hindering training effectiveness. To mitigate this issue, previous methods require additional preference annotation on newly generated samples to adapt to the shifted distribution, which consumes a large amount of annotation resources. Targeting more efficient human preference optimization, we propose an Adversarial Preference Optimization (APO) framework, in which the LLM and the reward model update alternatively via a min-max game. Through adversarial training, the reward model can adapt to the shifted generation distribution of the LLM without any additional annotation. With comprehensive experiments, we find the proposed adversarial training framework further enhances existing alignment baselines in terms of LLM helpfulness and harmlessness.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), often show strong performance on English tasks, while exhibiting limitations on other languages. What is an LLM's multilingual capability when it is trained only on certain languages? The underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study endeavors to examine the multilingual capability of LLMs from the vocabulary sharing perspective by conducting an exhaustive analysis across 101 languages. Through the investigation of the performance gap before and after embedding fine-tuning, we discovered four distinct quadrants. By delving into each quadrant we provide actionable and efficient guidelines for tuning these languages. Extensive experiments reveal that existing LLMs possess multilingual capabilities that surpass our expectations, and we can significantly improve the multilingual performance of LLMs based on these attributes of each quadrant~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/CONE-MT/Vocabulary-Sharing-Facilitates-Multilingualism}.}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kushal Kedia, Atiksh Bhardwaj, Prithwish Dan, Sanjiban Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: In collaborative human-robot manipulation, a robot must predict human intents and adapt its actions accordingly to smoothly execute tasks. However, the human's intent in turn depends on actions the robot takes, creating a chicken-or-egg problem. Prior methods ignore such inter-dependency and instead train marginal intent prediction models independent of robot actions. This is because training conditional models is hard given a lack of paired human-robot interaction datasets. Can we instead leverage large-scale human-human interaction data that is more easily accessible? Our key insight is to exploit a correspondence between human and robot actions that enables transfer learning from human-human to human-robot data. We propose a novel architecture, InteRACT, that pre-trains a conditional intent prediction model on large human-human datasets and fine-tunes on a small human-robot dataset. We evaluate on a set of real-world collaborative human-robot manipulation tasks and show that our conditional model improves over various marginal baselines. We also introduce new techniques to tele-operate a 7-DoF robot arm and collect a diverse range of human-robot collaborative manipulation data, which we open-source.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Augustin, Yannic Neuhaus, Matthias Hein</p>
<p>Abstract: While deep learning has led to huge progress in complex image classification tasks like ImageNet, unexpected failure modes, e.g. via spurious features, call into question how reliably these classifiers work in the wild. Furthermore, for safety-critical tasks the black-box nature of their decisions is problematic, and explanations or at least methods which make decisions plausible are needed urgently. In this paper, we address these problems by generating images that optimize a classifier-derived objective using a framework for guided image generation. We analyze the decisions of image classifiers by visual counterfactual explanations (VCEs), detection of systematic mistakes by analyzing images where classifiers maximally disagree, and visualization of neurons and spurious features. In this way, we validate existing observations, e.g. the shape bias of adversarially robust models, as well as novel failure modes, e.g. systematic errors of zero-shot CLIP classifiers. Moreover, our VCEs outperform previous work while being more versatile.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Milkert, David Hyde, Forrest Laine</p>
<p>Abstract: A neural network with ReLU activations may be viewed as a composition of piecewise linear functions. For such networks, the number of distinct linear regions expressed over the input domain has the potential to scale exponentially with depth, but it is not expected to do so when the initial parameters are chosen randomly. This poor scaling can necessitate the use of overly large models to approximate even simple functions. To address this issue, we introduce a novel training strategy: we first reparameterize the network weights in a manner that forces the network to display a number of activation patterns exponential in depth. Training first on our derived parameters provides an initial solution that can later be refined by directly updating the underlying model weights. This approach allows us to learn approximations of convex, one-dimensional functions that are several orders of magnitude more accurate than their randomly initialized counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Ballotta, Nicol\`o Dal Fabbro, Giovanni Perin, Luca Schenato, Michele Rossi, Giuseppe Piro</p>
<p>Abstract: Assisted and autonomous driving are rapidly gaining momentum and will soon become a reality. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are regarded as key enablers thanks to the massive amount of data that smart vehicles will collect from onboard sensors. Federated learning is one of the most promising techniques for training global machine learning models while preserving data privacy of vehicles and optimizing communications resource usage. In this article, we propose vehicular radio environment map federated learning (VREM-FL), a computation-scheduling co-design for vehicular federated learning that combines mobility of vehicles with 5G radio environment maps. VREM-FL jointly optimizes learning performance of the global model and wisely allocates communication and computation resources. This is achieved by orchestrating local computations at the vehicles in conjunction with transmission of their local models in an adaptive and predictive fashion, by exploiting radio channel maps. The proposed algorithm can be tuned to trade training time for radio resource usage. Experimental results demonstrate that VREM-FL outperforms literature benchmarks for both a linear regression model (learning time reduced by 28%) and a deep neural network for semantic image segmentation (doubling the number of model updates within the same time window).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luka Grbcic, Juliane M\"uller, Wibe Albert de Jong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology designed to augment the inverse design optimization process in scenarios constrained by limited compute, through the strategic synergy of multi-fidelity evaluations, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms. The proposed methodology is analyzed on two distinct engineering inverse design problems: airfoil inverse design and the scalar field reconstruction problem. It leverages a machine learning model trained with low-fidelity simulation data, in each optimization cycle, thereby proficiently predicting a target variable and discerning whether a high-fidelity simulation is necessitated, which notably conserves computational resources. Additionally, the machine learning model is strategically deployed prior to optimization to compress the design space boundaries, thereby further accelerating convergence toward the optimal solution. The methodology has been employed to enhance two optimization algorithms, namely Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Optimization. Comparative analyses illustrate performance improvements across both algorithms. Notably, this method is adaptable across any inverse design application, facilitating a synergy between a representative low-fidelity ML model, and high-fidelity simulation, and can be seamlessly applied across any variety of population-based optimization algorithms.}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongqiang Ren, Anushtup Nandy, Sivakumar Rathinam, Howie Choset</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Combinatorial Path Finding (MCPF) seeks collision-free paths for multiple agents from their initial to goal locations, while visiting a set of intermediate target locations in the middle of the paths. MCPF is challenging as it involves both planning collision-free paths for multiple agents and target sequencing, i.e., solving traveling salesman problems to assign targets to and find the visiting order for the agents. Recent work develops methods to address MCPF while minimizing the sum of individual arrival times at goals. Such a problem formulation may result in paths with different arrival times and lead to a long makespan, the maximum arrival time, among the agents. This paper proposes a min-max variant of MCPF, denoted as MCPF-max, that minimizes the makespan of the agents. While the existing methods (such as MS*) for MCPF can be adapted to solve MCPF-max, we further develop two new techniques based on MS* to defer the expensive target sequencing during planning to expedite the overall computation. We analyze the properties of the resulting algorithm Deferred MS* (DMS*), and test DMS* with up to 20 agents and 80 targets. We demonstrate the use of DMS* on differential-drive robots.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Candi Zheng, Yuan Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Popular guidance for denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) linearly combines distinct conditional models together to provide enhanced control over samples. However, this approach overlooks nonlinear effects that become significant when guidance scale is large. To address this issue, we propose characteristic guidance, a guidance method that provides first-principle non-linear correction for classifier-free guidance. Such correction forces the guided DDPMs to respect the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation of diffusion process, in a way that is training-free and compatible with existing sampling methods. Experiments show that characteristic guidance enhances semantic characteristics of prompts and mitigate irregularities in image generation, proving effective in diverse applications ranging from simulating magnet phase transitions to latent space sampling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Contemporary practices in instruction tuning often hinge on enlarging data scaling without a clear strategy for ensuring data quality, inadvertently introducing noise that may compromise model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce \textsc{Nuggets}, a novel and efficient methodology that leverages one-shot learning to discern and select high-quality instruction data from extensive datasets. \textsc{Nuggets} assesses the potential of individual instruction examples to act as effective one-shot learning instances, thereby identifying those that can significantly improve performance across diverse tasks. \textsc{Nuggets} utilizes a scoring system based on the impact of candidate examples on the perplexity of a diverse anchor set, facilitating the selection of the most advantageous data for instruction tuning. Through comprehensive evaluations on two benchmarks, including MT-Bench and Alpaca-Eval, we show that instruction tuning with the top 1\% of examples curated by \textsc{Nuggets} substantially outperforms conventional methods employing the entire dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohit Sharma, Amit Deshpande</p>
<p>Abstract: A general belief in fair classification is that fairness constraints incur a trade-off with accuracy, which biased data may worsen. Contrary to this belief, Blum & Stangl (2019) show that fair classification with equal opportunity constraints even on extremely biased data can recover optimally accurate and fair classifiers on the original data distribution. Their result is interesting because it demonstrates that fairness constraints can implicitly rectify data bias and simultaneously overcome a perceived fairness-accuracy trade-off. Their data bias model simulates under-representation and label bias in underprivileged population, and they show the above result on a stylized data distribution with i.i.d. label noise, under simple conditions on the data distribution and bias parameters. We propose a general approach to extend the result of Blum & Stangl (2019) to different fairness constraints, data bias models, data distributions, and hypothesis classes. We strengthen their result, and extend it to the case when their stylized distribution has labels with Massart noise instead of i.i.d. noise. We prove a similar recovery result for arbitrary data distributions using fair reject option classifiers. We further generalize it to arbitrary data distributions and arbitrary hypothesis classes, i.e., we prove that for any data distribution, if the optimally accurate classifier in a given hypothesis class is fair and robust, then it can be recovered through fair classification with equal opportunity constraints on the biased distribution whenever the bias parameters satisfy certain simple conditions. Finally, we show applications of our technique to time-varying data bias in classification and fair machine learning pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haeyong Kang, Jaehong Yoon, Sung Ju Hwang, Chang D. Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH), which highlights the existence of efficient subnetworks within larger, dense networks, a high-performing Winning Subnetwork (WSN) in terms of task performance under appropriate sparsity conditions is considered for various continual learning tasks. It leverages pre-existing weights from dense networks to achieve efficient learning in Task Incremental Learning (TIL) and Task-agnostic Incremental Learning (TaIL) scenarios. In Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL), a variation of WSN referred to as the Soft subnetwork (SoftNet) is designed to prevent overfitting when the data samples are scarce. Furthermore, the sparse reuse of WSN weights is considered for Video Incremental Learning (VIL). The use of Fourier Subneural Operator (FSO) within WSN is considered. It enables compact encoding of videos and identifies reusable subnetworks across varying bandwidths. We have integrated FSO into different architectural frameworks for continual learning, including VIL, TIL, and FSCIL. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate FSO's effectiveness, significantly improving task performance at various convolutional representational levels. Specifically, FSO enhances higher-layer performance in TIL and FSCIL and lower-layer performance in VIL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Ku, Dongfu Jiang, Cong Wei, Xiang Yue, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly advancing field of conditional image generation research, challenges such as limited explainability lie in effectively evaluating the performance and capabilities of various models. This paper introduces VIEScore, a Visual Instruction-guided Explainable metric for evaluating any conditional image generation tasks. VIEScore leverages general knowledge from Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as the backbone and does not require training or fine-tuning. We evaluate VIEScore on seven prominent tasks in conditional image tasks and found: (1) VIEScore (GPT4-o) achieves a high Spearman correlation of 0.4 with human evaluations, while the human-to-human correlation is 0.45. (2) VIEScore (with open-source MLLM) is significantly weaker than GPT-4o and GPT-4v in evaluating synthetic images. (3) VIEScore achieves a correlation on par with human ratings in the generation tasks but struggles in editing tasks. With these results, we believe VIEScore shows its great potential to replace human judges in evaluating image synthesis tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Liu, Xialiang Tong, Mingxuan Yuan, Xi Lin, Fu Luo, Zhenkun Wang, Zhichao Lu, Qingfu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Heuristics are widely used for dealing with complex search and optimization problems. However, manual design of heuristics can be often very labour extensive and requires rich working experience and knowledge. This paper proposes Evolution of Heuristic (EoH), a novel evolutionary paradigm that leverages both Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Computation (EC) methods for Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD). EoH represents the ideas of heuristics in natural language, termed thoughts. They are then translated into executable codes by LLMs. The evolution of both thoughts and codes in an evolutionary search framework makes it very effective and efficient for generating high-performance heuristics. Experiments on three widely studied combinatorial optimization benchmark problems demonstrate that EoH outperforms commonly used handcrafted heuristics and other recent AHD methods including FunSearch. Particularly, the heuristic produced by EoH with a low computational budget (in terms of the number of queries to LLMs) significantly outperforms widely-used human hand-crafted baseline algorithms for the online bin packing problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shichao Sun, Junlong Li, Weizhe Yuan, Ruifeng Yuan, Wenjie Li, Pengfei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Critique, as a natural language description for assessing the quality of model-generated content, has played a vital role in the training, evaluation, and refinement of LLMs. However, a systematic method to evaluate the quality of critique is lacking. In this paper, we pioneer the critique of critique, termed MetaCritique, which builds specific quantification criteria. To achieve a reliable evaluation outcome, we propose Atomic Information Units (AIUs), which describe the critique in a more fine-grained manner. MetaCritique aggregates each AIU's judgment for the overall score. Moreover, MetaCritique delivers a natural language rationale for the intricate reasoning within each judgment. Lastly, we construct a meta-evaluation dataset covering 4 tasks across 16 public datasets involving human-written and LLM-generated critiques. Experiments demonstrate that MetaCritique can achieve near-human performance. Our study can facilitate future research in LLM critiques based on our following observations and released resources: (1) superior critiques judged by MetaCritique can lead to better refinements, indicating that it can potentially enhance the alignment of existing LLMs; (2) the leaderboard of critique models reveals that open-source critique models commonly suffer from factuality issues; (3) relevant code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/MetaCritique to support deeper exploration; (4) an API at PyPI with the usage documentation in Appendix C allows users to assess the critique conveniently.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Gong, Zheng Zhan, Qing Jin, Yanyu Li, Yerlan Idelbayev, Xian Liu, Andrey Zharkov, Kfir Aberman, Sergey Tulyakov, Yanzhi Wang, Jian Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: One highly promising direction for enabling flexible real-time on-device image editing is utilizing data distillation by leveraging large-scale text-to-image diffusion models to generate paired datasets used for training generative adversarial networks (GANs). This approach notably alleviates the stringent requirements typically imposed by high-end commercial GPUs for performing image editing with diffusion models. However, unlike text-to-image diffusion models, each distilled GAN is specialized for a specific image editing task, necessitating costly training efforts to obtain models for various concepts. In this work, we introduce and address a novel research direction: can the process of distilling GANs from diffusion models be made significantly more efficient? To achieve this goal, we propose a series of innovative techniques. First, we construct a base GAN model with generalized features, adaptable to different concepts through fine-tuning, eliminating the need for training from scratch. Second, we identify crucial layers within the base GAN model and employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with a simple yet effective rank search process, rather than fine-tuning the entire base model. Third, we investigate the minimal amount of data necessary for fine-tuning, further reducing the overall training time. Extensive experiments show that we can efficiently empower GANs with the ability to perform real-time high-quality image editing on mobile devices with remarkably reduced training and storage costs for each concept.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moritz Plenz, Anette Frank</p>
<p>Abstract: While Language Models (LMs) are the workhorses of NLP, their interplay with structured knowledge graphs (KGs) is still actively researched. Current methods for encoding such graphs typically either (i) linearize them for embedding with LMs -- which underutilize structural information, or (ii) use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to preserve the graph structure -- but GNNs cannot represent text features as well as pretrained LMs. In our work we introduce a novel LM type, the Graph Language Model (GLM), that integrates the strengths of both approaches and mitigates their weaknesses. The GLM parameters are initialized from a pretrained LM to enhance understanding of individual graph concepts and triplets. Simultaneously, we design the GLM's architecture to incorporate graph biases, thereby promoting effective knowledge distribution within the graph. This enables GLMs to process graphs, texts, and interleaved inputs of both. Empirical evaluations on relation classification tasks show that GLM embeddings surpass both LM- and GNN-based baselines in supervised and zero-shot setting, demonstrating their versatility.</p>

Our method can be used to optimize through any differentiable feature matching loss to achieve a target (stylized) output and leverages gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency. We demonstrate a surprisingly wide-range of applications for music generation including inpainting, outpainting, and looping as well as intensity, melody, and musical structure control - all without ever fine-tuning the underlying model. When we compare our approach against related training, guidance, and optimization-based methods, we find DITTO achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks, including outperforming comparable approaches on controllability, audio quality, and computational efficiency, thus opening the door for high-quality, flexible, training-free control of diffusion models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Chiang, Elvis Hsieh, Chia-Hong Chou, Janosh Riebesell</p>
<p>Abstract: Reducing hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) is imperative for use in the sciences, where reliability and reproducibility are crucial. However, LLMs inherently lack long-term memory, making it a nontrivial, ad hoc, and inevitably biased task to fine-tune them on domain-specific literature and data. Here we introduce LLaMP, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework of hierarchical reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents that can dynamically and recursively interact with computational and experimental data on Materials Project (MP) and run atomistic simulations via high-throughput workflow interface. Without fine-tuning, LLaMP demonstrates strong tool usage ability to comprehend and integrate various modalities of materials science concepts, fetch relevant data stores on the fly, process higher-order data (such as crystal structure and elastic tensor), and streamline complex tasks in computational materials and chemistry. We propose a simple metric combining uncertainty and confidence estimates to evaluate the self-consistency of responses by LLaMP and vanilla LLMs. Our benchmark shows that LLaMP effectively mitigates the intrinsic bias in LLMs, counteracting the errors on bulk moduli, electronic bandgaps, and formation energies that seem to derive from mixed data sources. We also demonstrate LLaMP's capability to edit crystal structures and run annealing molecular dynamics simulations using pre-trained machine-learning force fields. The framework offers an intuitive and nearly hallucination-free approach to exploring and scaling materials informatics, and establishes a pathway for knowledge distillation and fine-tuning other language models.

<p>Abstract: We study the probabilistic modeling performed by Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) through the angle of time directionality, addressing a question first raised in (Shannon, 1951). For large enough models, we empirically find a time asymmetry in their ability to learn natural language: a difference in the average log-perplexity when trying to predict the next token versus when trying to predict the previous one. This difference is at the same time subtle and very consistent across various modalities (language, model size, training time, ...). Theoretically, this is surprising: from an information-theoretic point of view, there should be no such difference. We provide a theoretical framework to explain how such an asymmetry can appear from sparsity and computational complexity considerations, and outline a number of perspectives opened by our results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chujie Zheng, Fan Yin, Hao Zhou, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Kai-Wei Chang, Minlie Huang, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Prepending model inputs with safety prompts is a common practice for safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against queries with harmful intents. However, the underlying working mechanisms of safety prompts have not been unraveled yet, restricting the possibility of automatically optimizing them to improve LLM safety. In this work, we investigate how LLMs' behavior (i.e., complying with or refusing user queries) is affected by safety prompts from the perspective of model representation. We find that in the representation space, the input queries are typically moved by safety prompts in a "higher-refusal" direction, in which models become more prone to refusing to provide assistance, even when the queries are harmless. On the other hand, LLMs are naturally capable of distinguishing harmful and harmless queries without safety prompts. Inspired by these findings, we propose a method for safety prompt optimization, namely DRO (Directed Representation Optimization). Treating a safety prompt as continuous, trainable embeddings, DRO learns to move the queries' representations along or opposite the refusal direction, depending on their harmfulness. Experiments with eight LLMs on out-of-domain and jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts, without compromising the models' general performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akbar Rafiey</p>
<p>Abstract: Submodular functions, as well as the sub-class of decomposable submodular functions, and their optimization appear in a wide range of applications in machine learning, recommendation systems, and welfare maximization. However, optimization of decomposable submodular functions with millions of component functions is computationally prohibitive. Furthermore, the component functions may be private (they might represent user preference function, for example) and cannot be widely shared. To address these issues, we propose a {\em federated optimization} setting for decomposable submodular optimization. In this setting, clients have their own preference functions, and a weighted sum of these preferences needs to be maximized. We implement the popular {\em continuous greedy} algorithm in this setting where clients take parallel small local steps towards the local solution and then the local changes are aggregated at a central server. To address the large number of clients, the aggregation is performed only on a subsampled set. Further, the aggregation is performed only intermittently between stretches of parallel local steps, which reduces communication cost significantly. We show that our federated algorithm is guaranteed to provide a good approximate solution, even in the presence of above cost-cutting measures. Finally, we show how the federated setting can be incorporated in solving fundamental discrete submodular optimization problems such as Maximum Coverage and Facility Location.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiymet Kaya, Elif Ak, Sumeyye Bas, Berk Canberk, Sule Gunduz Oguducu</p>
<p>Abstract: The effectiveness of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is critical in an era where cyber threats are becoming increasingly complex. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models provide an efficient and accurate solution for identifying attacks and anomalies in computer networks. However, using ML and DL models in IDS has led to a trust deficit due to their non-transparent decision-making. This transparency gap in IDS research is significant, affecting confidence and accountability. To address, this paper introduces a novel Explainable IDS approach, called X-CBA, that leverages the structural advantages of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to effectively process network traffic data, while also adapting a new Explainable AI (XAI) methodology. Unlike most GNN-based IDS that depend on labeled network traffic and node features, thereby overlooking critical packet-level information, our approach leverages a broader range of traffic data through network flows, including edge attributes, to improve detection capabilities and adapt to novel threats. Through empirical testing, we establish that our approach not only achieves high accuracy with 99.47% in threat detection but also advances the field by providing clear, actionable explanations of its analytical outcomes. This research also aims to bridge the current gap and facilitate the broader integration of ML/DL technologies in cybersecurity defenses by offering a local and global explainability solution that is both precise and interpretable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kawin Ethayarajh, Winnie Xu, Niklas Muennighoff, Dan Jurafsky, Douwe Kiela</p>
<p>Abstract: Kahneman & Tversky's $\textit{prospect theory}$ tells us that humans perceive random variables in a biased but well-defined manner (1992); for example, humans are famously loss-averse. We show that objectives for aligning LLMs with human feedback implicitly incorporate many of these biases -- the success of these objectives (e.g., DPO) over cross-entropy minimization can partly be ascribed to them belonging to a family of loss functions that we call $\textit{human-aware losses}$ (HALOs). However, the utility functions these methods attribute to humans still differ from those in the prospect theory literature. Using a Kahneman-Tversky model of human utility, we propose a HALO that directly maximizes the utility of generations instead of maximizing the log-likelihood of preferences, as current methods do. We call this approach KTO, and it matches or exceeds the performance of preference-based methods at scales from 1B to 30B, despite only learning from a binary signal of whether an output is desirable. More broadly, our work suggests that there is no one HALO that is universally superior; the best loss depends on the inductive biases most appropriate for a given setting, an oft-overlooked consideration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Zhao, Wanru Zhuang, Jia Song, Yaqi Li, Shuqi Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge in the development of 3D structure-based pre-trained protein models, representing a significant advancement over pre-trained protein language models in various downstream tasks. However, most existing structure-based pre-trained models primarily focus on the residue level, i.e., alpha carbon atoms, while ignoring other atoms like side chain atoms. We argue that modeling proteins at both residue and atom levels is important since the side chain atoms can also be crucial for numerous downstream tasks, for example, molecular docking. Nevertheless, we find that naively combining residue and atom information during pre-training typically fails. We identify a key reason is the information leakage caused by the inclusion of atom structure in the input, which renders residue-level pre-training tasks trivial and results in insufficiently expressive residue representations. To address this issue, we introduce a span mask pre-training strategy on 3D protein chains to learn meaningful representations of both residues and atoms. This leads to a simple yet effective approach to learning protein representation suitable for diverse downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Rozado</p>
<p>Abstract: I report here a comprehensive analysis about the political preferences embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs). Namely, I administer 11 political orientation tests, designed to identify the political preferences of the test taker, to 24 state-of-the-art conversational LLMs, both closed and open source. When probed with questions/statements with political connotations, most conversational LLMs tend to generate responses that are diagnosed by most political test instruments as manifesting preferences for left-of-center viewpoints. This does not appear to be the case for five additional base (i.e. foundation) models upon which LLMs optimized for conversation with humans are built. However, the weak performance of the base models at coherently answering the tests' questions makes this subset of results inconclusive. Finally, I demonstrate that LLMs can be steered towards specific locations in the political spectrum through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with only modest amounts of politically aligned data, suggesting SFT's potential to embed political orientation in LLMs. With LLMs beginning to partially displace traditional information sources like search engines and Wikipedia, the societal implications of political biases embedded in LLMs are substantial.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Ma, Jiajia Zhang, Hongping Deng, Ningyu Zhang, Qinglang Guo, Haiyang Yu, Yong Liao, Pengyuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The escalating quality of video generated by advanced video generation methods results in new security challenges, while there have been few relevant research efforts: 1) There is no open-source dataset for generated video detection, 2) No generated video detection method has been proposed so far. To this end, we propose an open-source dataset and a detection method for generated video for the first time. First, we propose a scalable dataset consisting of 964 prompts, covering various forgery targets, scenes, behaviors, and actions, as well as various generation models with different architectures and generation methods, including the most popular commercial models like OpenAI's Sora and Google's Veo. Second, we found via probing experiments that spatial artifact-based detectors lack generalizability. Hence, we propose a simple yet effective \textbf{de}tection model based on \textbf{f}rame \textbf{co}nsistency (\textbf{DeCoF}), which focuses on temporal artifacts by eliminating the impact of spatial artifacts during feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of DeCoF in detecting videos generated by unseen video generation models and confirm its powerful generalizability across several commercially proprietary models. Our code and dataset will be released at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DeCoF-8394}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Morris, Nadav Dym, Haggai Maron, \.Ismail \.Ilkan Ceylan, Fabrizio Frasca, Ron Levie, Derek Lim, Michael Bronstein, Martin Grohe, Stefanie Jegelka</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning on graphs, especially using graph neural networks (GNNs), has seen a surge in interest due to the wide availability of graph data across a broad spectrum of disciplines, from life to social and engineering sciences. Despite their practical success, our theoretical understanding of the properties of GNNs remains highly incomplete. Recent theoretical advancements primarily focus on elucidating the coarse-grained expressive power of GNNs, predominantly employing combinatorial techniques. However, these studies do not perfectly align with practice, particularly in understanding the generalization behavior of GNNs when trained with stochastic first-order optimization techniques. In this position paper, we argue that the graph machine learning community needs to shift its attention to developing a balanced theory of graph machine learning, focusing on a more thorough understanding of the interplay of expressive power, generalization, and optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Ji, Boyuan Chen, Hantao Lou, Donghai Hong, Borong Zhang, Xuehai Pan, Juntao Dai, Tianyi Qiu, Yaodong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) and ever-evolving practical requirements, finding an efficient and effective alignment method has never been more critical. However, the tension between the complexity of current alignment methods and the need for rapid iteration in deployment scenarios necessitates the development of a model-agnostic alignment approach that can operate under these constraints. In this paper, we introduce Aligner, a novel and simple alignment paradigm that learns the correctional residuals between preferred and dispreferred answers using a small model. Designed as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, Aligner can be directly applied to various open-source and API-based models with only one-off training, making it suitable for rapid iteration. Notably, Aligner can be applied to any powerful, large-scale upstream models. Moreover, it can even iteratively bootstrap the upstream models using corrected responses as synthetic human preference data, breaking through the model's performance ceiling. Our experiments demonstrate performance improvements by deploying the same Aligner model across 11 different LLMs, evaluated on the 3H dimensions (helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty). Specifically, Aligner-7B has achieved an average improvement of 68.9\% in helpfulness and 23.8\% in harmlessness across the tested LLMs while also effectively reducing hallucination. In the Alpaca-Eval leaderboard, stacking Aligner-2B on GPT-4 Turbo improved its LC Win Rate from 55.0\% to 58.3\%, surpassing GPT-4 Omni's 57.5\% Win Rate (community report).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Jin, Yifan Zhang, Wei Chen, Kexin Zhang, Yuxuan Liang, Bin Yang, Jindong Wang, Shirui Pan, Qingsong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series analysis is essential for comprehending the complexities inherent in various realworld systems and applications. Although large language models (LLMs) have recently made significant strides, the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) equipped with time series analysis capabilities remains in its nascent phase. Most existing time series models heavily rely on domain knowledge and extensive model tuning, predominantly focusing on prediction tasks. In this paper, we argue that current LLMs have the potential to revolutionize time series analysis, thereby promoting efficient decision-making and advancing towards a more universal form of time series analytical intelligence. Such advancement could unlock a wide range of possibilities, including time series modality switching and question answering. We encourage researchers and practitioners to recognize the potential of LLMs in advancing time series analysis and emphasize the need for trust in these related efforts. Furthermore, we detail the seamless integration of time series analysis with existing LLM technologies and outline promising avenues for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Yuan, Chang Ma, Shuai Yuan, Qiushi Sun, Lei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis posits the existence of ``winning tickets'' within a randomly initialized neural network. Do winning tickets exist for LLMs in fine-tuning scenarios? How can we find such winning tickets? In this paper, we propose KS-Lottery, a method to identify a small subset of LLM parameters highly effective in multilingual fine-tuning. Our key idea is to use Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test to analyze the distribution shift of parameters before and after fine-tuning. We further theoretically prove that KS-Lottery can find the certified winning tickets in the embedding layer, fine-tuning on the found parameters is guaranteed to perform as well as full fine-tuning. Comparing KS-Lottery with other parameter-efficient tuning algorithms on translation tasks, the experimental results show that KS-Lottery finds a much smaller set of parameters for fine-tuning while achieving the comparable performance as full fine-tuning LLM. Surprisingly, we find that fine-tuning 18 tokens' embedding of LLaMA suffices to reach the fine-tuning translation performance~\footnote{https://github.com/CONE-MT/KS-Lottery.}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengbo Wang, Jian Liang, Ran He, Zilei Wang, Tieniu Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: With the emergence of pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), considerable efforts have been devoted to fine-tuning them for downstream tasks. Despite the progress made in designing efficient fine-tuning methods, such methods require access to the model's parameters, which can be challenging as model owners often opt to provide their models as a black box to safeguard model ownership. This paper proposes a \textbf{C}ollabo\textbf{ra}tive \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning (\textbf{CraFT}) approach for fine-tuning black-box VLMs to downstream tasks, where one only has access to the input prompts and the output predictions of the model. CraFT comprises two modules, a prompt generation module for learning text prompts and a prediction refinement module for enhancing output predictions in residual style. Additionally, we introduce an auxiliary prediction-consistent loss to promote consistent optimization across these modules. These modules are optimized by a novel collaborative training algorithm. Extensive experiments on few-shot classification over 15 datasets demonstrate the superiority of CraFT. The results show that CraFT achieves a decent gain of about 12\% with 16-shot datasets and only 8,000 queries. Moreover, CraFT trains faster and uses only about 1/80 of the memory footprint for deployment, while sacrificing only 1.62\% compared to the white-box method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Thomas Lin, Zhao Song, Han Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the computational limits of the memory retrieval dynamics of modern Hopfield models from the fine-grained complexity analysis. Our key contribution is the characterization of a phase transition behavior in the efficiency of all possible modern Hopfield models based on the norm of patterns. Specifically, we establish an upper bound criterion for the norm of input query patterns and memory patterns. Only below this criterion, sub-quadratic (efficient) variants of the modern Hopfield model exist, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). To showcase our theory, we provide a formal example of efficient constructions of modern Hopfield models using low-rank approximation when the efficient criterion holds. This includes a derivation of a lower bound on the computational time, scaling linearly with $\max\{$# of stored memory patterns, length of input query sequence$\}$. In addition, we prove its memory retrieval error bound and exponential memory capacity.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04601">Alirector: Alignment-Enhanced Chinese Grammatical Error Corrector</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haihui Yang, Xiaojun Quan</p>
<p>Abstract: Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) faces serious overcorrection challenges when employing autoregressive generative models such as sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models and decoder-only large language models (LLMs). While previous methods aim to address overcorrection in Seq2Seq models, they are difficult to adapt to decoder-only LLMs. In this paper, we propose an alignment-enhanced corrector for the overcorrection problem that applies to both Seq2Seq models and decoder-only LLMs. Our method first trains a correction model to generate an initial correction of the source sentence. Then, we combine the source sentence with the initial correction and feed it through an alignment model for another round of correction, aiming to enforce the alignment model to focus on potential overcorrection. Moreover, to enhance the model's ability to identify nuances, we further explore the reverse alignment of the source sentence and the initial correction. Finally, we transfer the alignment knowledge from two alignment models to the correction model, instructing it on how to avoid overcorrection. Experimental results on three CGEC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in alleviating overcorrection and improving overall performance. Our code has been made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Huang, Niao He, Andreas Krause</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the sample complexity of reinforcement learning (RL) in Mean-Field Games (MFGs) with model-based function approximation that requires strategic exploration to find a Nash Equilibrium policy. We introduce the Partial Model-Based Eluder Dimension (P-MBED), a more effective notion to characterize the model class complexity. Notably, P-MBED measures the complexity of the single-agent model class converted from the given mean-field model class, and potentially, can be exponentially lower than the MBED proposed by \citet{huang2023statistical}. We contribute a model elimination algorithm featuring a novel exploration strategy and establish sample complexity results polynomial w.r.t.~P-MBED. Crucially, our results reveal that, under the basic realizability and Lipschitz continuity assumptions, \emph{learning Nash Equilibrium in MFGs is no more statistically challenging than solving a logarithmic number of single-agent RL problems}. We further extend our results to Multi-Type MFGs, generalizing from conventional MFGs and involving multiple types of agents. This extension implies statistical tractability of a broader class of Markov Games through the efficacy of mean-field approximation. Finally, inspired by our theoretical algorithm, we present a heuristic approach with improved computational efficiency and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianhui Pang, Fanghua Ye, Derek Fai Wong, Xin He, Wanshun Chen, Longyue Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) predominantly employ decoder-only transformer architectures, necessitating the retention of keys/values information for historical tokens to provide contextual information and avoid redundant computation. However, the substantial size and parameter volume of these LLMs require massive GPU memory. This memory demand increases with the length of the input text, leading to an urgent need for more efficient methods of information storage and processing. This study introduces Anchor-based LLMs (AnLLMs), which utilize an innovative anchor-based self-attention network (AnSAN) and also an anchor-based inference strategy. This approach enables LLMs to compress sequence information into an anchor token, reducing the keys/values cache and enhancing inference efficiency. Experiments on question-answering benchmarks reveal that AnLLMs maintain similar accuracy levels while achieving up to 99% keys/values cache reduction and up to 3.5 times faster inference. Despite a minor compromise in accuracy, the substantial enhancements of AnLLMs employing the AnSAN technique in resource utilization and computational efficiency underscore their potential for practical LLM applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noam Razin, Yotam Alexander, Edo Cohen-Karlik, Raja Giryes, Amir Globerson, Nadav Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: In modern machine learning, models can often fit training data in numerous ways, some of which perform well on unseen (test) data, while others do not. Remarkably, in such cases gradient descent frequently exhibits an implicit bias that leads to excellent performance on unseen data. This implicit bias was extensively studied in supervised learning, but is far less understood in optimal control (reinforcement learning). There, learning a controller applied to a system via gradient descent is known as policy gradient, and a question of prime importance is the extent to which a learned controller extrapolates to unseen initial states. This paper theoretically studies the implicit bias of policy gradient in terms of extrapolation to unseen initial states. Focusing on the fundamental Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem, we establish that the extent of extrapolation depends on the degree of exploration induced by the system when commencing from initial states included in training. Experiments corroborate our theory, and demonstrate its conclusions on problems beyond LQR, where systems are non-linear and controllers are neural networks. We hypothesize that real-world optimal control may be greatly improved by developing methods for informed selection of initial states to train on.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthieu Vilain, R\'emi Giraud, Hugo Germain, Guillaume Bourmaud</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-dense detector-free approaches (SDF), such as LoFTR, are currently among the most popular image matching methods. While SDF methods are trained to establish correspondences between two images, their performances are almost exclusively evaluated using relative pose estimation metrics. Thus, the link between their ability to establish correspondences and the quality of the resulting estimated pose has thus far received little attention. This paper is a first attempt to study this link. We start with proposing a novel structured attention-based image matching architecture (SAM). It allows us to show a counter-intuitive result on two datasets (MegaDepth and HPatches): on the one hand SAM either outperforms or is on par with SDF methods in terms of pose/homography estimation metrics, but on the other hand SDF approaches are significantly better than SAM in terms of matching accuracy. We then propose to limit the computation of the matching accuracy to textured regions, and show that in this case SAM often surpasses SDF methods. Our findings highlight a strong correlation between the ability to establish accurate correspondences in textured regions and the accuracy of the resulting estimated pose/homography. Our code will be made available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenza Amara, Rita Sevastjanova, Mennatallah El-Assady</p>
<p>Abstract: To harness the power of large language models in safety-critical domains, we need to ensure the explainability of their predictions. However, despite the significant attention to model interpretability, there remains an unexplored domain in explaining sequence-to-sequence tasks using methods tailored for textual data. This paper introduces SyntaxShap, a local, model-agnostic explainability method for text generation that takes into consideration the syntax in the text data. The presented work extends Shapley values to account for parsing-based syntactic dependencies. Taking a game theoric approach, SyntaxShap only considers coalitions constraint by the dependency tree. We adopt a model-based evaluation to compare SyntaxShap and its weighted form to state-of-the-art explainability methods adapted to text generation tasks, using diverse metrics including faithfulness, coherency, and semantic alignment of the explanations to the model. We show that our syntax-aware method produces explanations that help build more faithful and coherent explanations for predictions by autoregressive models. Confronted with the misalignment of human and AI model reasoning, this paper also highlights the need for cautious evaluation strategies in explainable AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengxi Liu, Vitor Fortes Rey, Yu Zhang, Lala Shakti Swarup Ray, Bo Zhou, Paul Lukowicz</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic and precise fitness activity recognition can be beneficial in aspects from promoting a healthy lifestyle to personalized preventative healthcare. While IMUs are currently the prominent fitness tracking modality, through iMove, we show bio-impedence can help improve IMU-based fitness tracking through sensor fusion and contrastive learning.To evaluate our methods, we conducted an experiment including six upper body fitness activities performed by ten subjects over five days to collect synchronized data from bio-impedance across two wrists and IMU on the left wrist.The contrastive learning framework uses the two modalities to train a better IMU-only classification model, where bio-impedance is only required at the training phase, by which the average Macro F1 score with the input of a single IMU was improved by 3.22 \% reaching 84.71 \% compared to the 81.49 \% of the IMU baseline model. We have also shown how bio-impedance can improve human activity recognition (HAR) directly through sensor fusion, reaching an average Macro F1 score of 89.57 \% (two modalities required for both training and inference) even if Bio-impedance alone has an average macro F1 score of 75.36 \%, which is outperformed by IMU alone. In addition, similar results were obtained in an extended study on lower body fitness activity classification, demonstrating the generalisability of our approach.Our findings underscore the potential of sensor fusion and contrastive learning as valuable tools for advancing fitness activity recognition, with bio-impedance playing a pivotal role in augmenting the capabilities of IMU-based systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benedikt Alkin, Lukas Miklautz, Sepp Hochreiter, Johannes Brandstetter</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce MIM (Masked Image Modeling)-Refiner, a contrastive learning boost for pre-trained MIM models. MIM-Refiner is motivated by the insight that strong representations within MIM models generally reside in intermediate layers. Accordingly, MIM-Refiner leverages multiple contrastive heads that are connected to different intermediate layers. In each head, a modified nearest neighbor objective constructs semantic clusters that capture semantic information which improves performance on downstream tasks, including off-the-shelf and fine-tuning settings.
  The refinement process is short and simple - yet highly effective. Within a few epochs, we refine the features of MIM models from subpar to state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf features. Refining a ViT-H, pre-trained with data2vec 2.0 on ImageNet-1K, sets a new state-of-the-art in linear probing (84.7%) and low-shot classification among models that are pre-trained on ImageNet-1K. At ImageNet-1K 1-shot classification, MIM-Refiner advances the state-of-the-art to 64.2%, outperforming larger models that were trained on up to 2000 times more data such as DINOv2-g, OpenCLIP-G and MAWS-6.5B.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan Marisca, Cesare Alippi, Filippo Maria Bianchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a set of synchronous time series, each associated with a sensor-point in space and characterized by inter-series relationships, the problem of spatiotemporal forecasting consists of predicting future observations for each point. Spatiotemporal graph neural networks achieve striking results by representing the relationships across time series as a graph. Nonetheless, most existing methods rely on the often unrealistic assumption that inputs are always available and fail to capture hidden spatiotemporal dynamics when part of the data is missing. In this work, we tackle this problem through hierarchical spatiotemporal downsampling. The input time series are progressively coarsened over time and space, obtaining a pool of representations that capture heterogeneous temporal and spatial dynamics. Conditioned on observations and missing data patterns, such representations are combined by an interpretable attention mechanism to generate the forecasts. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks under different missing data distributions, particularly in the presence of contiguous blocks of missing values.</p>

<p>Abstract: Social networks shape opinions, behaviors, and information dissemination in human societies. As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into social and professional environments, understanding their behavior within the context of social interactions and networks becomes essential. Our study analyzes LLMs' network formation behavior to examine whether the dynamics of multiple LLMs are similar to or different from human social dynamics. We observe that LLMs exhibit key social network principles, including preferential attachment, triadic closure, homophily, community structure, and the small-world phenomenon, when asked about their preferences in network formation. We also investigate LLMs' decision-making based on real-world networks, revealing that triadic closure and homophily have a stronger influence than preferential attachment and that LLMs perform well in network formation predictions. Overall, our study opens up new possibilities for using LLMs in network science research and helps develop socially aware LLMs by shedding light on their social interaction behaviors and exploring their impacts on social dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raktim Kumar Mondol, Ewan K. A. Millar, Arcot Sowmya, Erik Meijering</p>
<p>Abstract: Breast cancer is a significant health concern affecting millions of women worldwide. Accurate survival risk stratification plays a crucial role in guiding personalised treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes. Here we present BioFusionNet, a deep learning framework that fuses image-derived features with genetic and clinical data to obtain a holistic profile and achieve survival risk stratification of ER+ breast cancer patients. We employ multiple self-supervised feature extractors (DINO and MoCoV3) pretrained on histopathological patches to capture detailed image features. These features are then fused by a variational autoencoder and fed to a self-attention network generating patient-level features. A co-dual-cross-attention mechanism combines the histopathological features with genetic data, enabling the model to capture the interplay between them. Additionally, clinical data is incorporated using a feed-forward network, further enhancing predictive performance and achieving comprehensive multimodal feature integration. Furthermore, we introduce a weighted Cox loss function, specifically designed to handle imbalanced survival data, which is a common challenge. Our model achieves a mean concordance index of 0.77 and a time-dependent area under the curve of 0.84, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. It predicts risk (high versus low) with prognostic significance for overall survival in univariate analysis (HR=2.99, 95% CI: 1.88--4.78, p<0.005), and maintains independent significance in multivariate analysis incorporating standard clinicopathological variables (HR=2.91, 95\% CI: 1.80--4.68, p<0.005).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwei Ni, Minjing Shi, Dominik Stammbach, Mrinmaya Sachan, Elliott Ash, Markus Leippold</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of generative AI, automated fact-checking methods to combat misinformation are becoming more and more important. However, factual claim detection, the first step in a fact-checking pipeline, suffers from two key issues that limit its scalability and generalizability: (1) inconsistency in definitions of the task and what a claim is, and (2) the high cost of manual annotation. To address (1), we review the definitions in related work and propose a unifying definition of factual claims that focuses on verifiability. To address (2), we introduce AFaCTA (Automatic Factual Claim deTection Annotator), a novel framework that assists in the annotation of factual claims with the help of large language models (LLMs). AFaCTA calibrates its annotation confidence with consistency along three predefined reasoning paths. Extensive evaluation and experiments in the domain of political speech reveal that AFaCTA can efficiently assist experts in annotating factual claims and training high-quality classifiers, and can work with or without expert supervision. Our analyses also result in PoliClaim, a comprehensive claim detection dataset spanning diverse political topics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Govind Gangadhar, Karl Stratos</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard fine-tuning is considered not as effective as specialized methods for model editing due to its comparatively poor performance. However, it is simple, agnostic to the architectural details of the model being edited, and able to leverage advances in standard training techniques with no additional work (e.g., black-box PEFT for computational efficiency), making it an appealing choice for a model editor. In this work, we show that standard fine-tuning alone can yield competitive model editing performance with two minor modifications. First, we optimize the conditional likelihood rather than the full likelihood. Second, in addition to the typical practice of training on randomly paraphrased edit prompts to encourage generalization, we also train on random or similar unedited facts to encourage locality. Our experiments on the ZsRE and CounterFact datasets demonstrate that these simple modifications allow standard fine-tuning to match or outperform highly specialized editors in terms of edit score.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Ren, Biao Wu, Lingqiao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores an intriguing observation: fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) with responses generated by a LLM often yields better results than using responses generated by humans. We conduct an in-depth investigation to understand why this occurs. Contrary to the common belief that these instances is simply due to the more detailed nature of LLM-generated content, our study identifies another contributing factor: an LLM is inherently more "familiar" with LLM generated responses. This familiarity is evidenced by lower perplexity before fine-tuning. We design a series of experiments to understand the impact of the "familiarity" and our conclusion reveals that this "familiarity" significantly impacts learning performance. Training with LLM-generated responses not only enhances performance but also helps maintain the model's capabilities in other tasks after fine-tuning on a specific task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vijay Keswani, Anay Mehrotra, L. Elisa Celis</p>
<p>Abstract: In many predictive contexts (e.g., credit lending), true outcomes are only observed for samples that were positively classified in the past. These past observations, in turn, form training datasets for classifiers that make future predictions. However, such training datasets lack information about the outcomes of samples that were (incorrectly) negatively classified in the past and can lead to erroneous classifiers. We present an approach that trains a classifier using available data and comes with a family of exploration strategies to collect outcome data about subpopulations that otherwise would have been ignored. For any exploration strategy, the approach comes with guarantees that (1) all sub-populations are explored, (2) the fraction of false positives is bounded, and (3) the trained classifier converges to a ``desired'' classifier. The right exploration strategy is context-dependent; it can be chosen to improve learning guarantees and encode context-specific group fairness properties. Evaluation on real-world datasets shows that this approach consistently boosts the quality of collected outcome data and improves the fraction of true positives for all groups, with only a small reduction in predictive utility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxi Hu, Yuehong Hu, Wei Chen, Ming Jin, Shirui Pan, Qingsong Wen, Yuxuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: In long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) tasks, an increasing number of models have acknowledged that discrete time series originate from continuous dynamic systems and have attempted to model their dynamical structures. Recognizing the chaotic nature of real-world data, our model, \textbf{\textit{Attraos}}, incorporates chaos theory into LTSF, perceiving real-world time series as observations from unknown high-dimensional chaotic dynamic systems. Under the concept of attractor invariance, Attraos utilizes non-parametric Phase Space Reconstruction embedding and the proposed multi-scale dynamic memory unit to memorize historical dynamics structure and predicts by a frequency-enhanced local evolution strategy. Detailed theoretical analysis and abundant empirical evidence consistently show that Attraos outperforms various LTSF methods on mainstream LTSF datasets and chaotic datasets with only one-twelfth of the parameters compared to PatchTST.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongru Wu, Zhuosheng Zhang, Pengzhou Cheng, Gongshen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the notable success of language models (LMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, the reliability of LMs is susceptible to backdoor attacks. Prior research attempts to mitigate backdoor learning while training the LMs on the poisoned dataset, yet struggles against complex backdoor attacks in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the learning mechanisms of backdoor LMs in the frequency space by Fourier analysis. Our findings indicate that the backdoor mapping presented on the poisoned datasets exhibits a more discernible inclination towards lower frequency compared to clean mapping, resulting in the faster convergence of backdoor mapping. To alleviate this dilemma, we propose Multi-Scale Low-Rank Adaptation (MuScleLoRA), which deploys multiple radial scalings in the frequency space with low-rank adaptation to the target model and further aligns the gradients when updating parameters. Through downscaling in the frequency space, MuScleLoRA encourages the model to prioritize the learning of relatively high-frequency clean mapping, consequently mitigating backdoor learning. Experimental results demonstrate that MuScleLoRA outperforms baselines significantly. Notably, MuScleLoRA reduces the average success rate of diverse backdoor attacks to below 15\% across multiple datasets and generalizes to various backbone LMs, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT2-XL, and Llama2.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thodoris Lykouris, Wentao Weng</p>
<p>Abstract: Successful content moderation in online platforms relies on a human-AI collaboration approach. A typical heuristic estimates the expected harmfulness of a post and uses fixed thresholds to decide whether to remove it and whether to send it for human review. This disregards the prediction uncertainty, the time-varying element of human review capacity and post arrivals, and the selective sampling in the dataset (humans only review posts filtered by the admission algorithm).
  In this paper, we introduce a model to capture the human-AI interplay in content moderation. The algorithm observes contextual information for incoming posts, makes classification and admission decisions, and schedules posts for human review. Only admitted posts receive human reviews on their harmfulness. These reviews help educate the machine-learning algorithms but are delayed due to congestion in the human review system. The classical learning-theoretic way to capture this human-AI interplay is via the framework of learning to defer, where the algorithm has the option to defer a classification task to humans for a fixed cost and immediately receive feedback. Our model contributes to this literature by introducing congestion in the human review system. Moreover, unlike work on online learning with delayed feedback where the delay in the feedback is exogenous to the algorithm's decisions, the delay in our model is endogenous to both the admission and the scheduling decisions.
  We propose a near-optimal learning algorithm that carefully balances the classification loss from a selectively sampled dataset, the idiosyncratic loss of non-reviewed posts, and the delay loss of having congestion in the human review system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result for online learning in contextual queueing systems and hence our analytical framework may be of independent interest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinlong Pang, Jialu Wang, Zhaowei Zhu, Yuanshun Yao, Chen Qian, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The pursuit of fairness in machine learning (ML), ensuring that the models do not exhibit biases toward protected demographic groups, typically results in a compromise scenario. This compromise can be explained by a Pareto frontier where given certain resources (e.g., data), reducing the fairness violations often comes at the cost of lowering the model accuracy. In this work, we aim to train models that mitigate group fairness disparity without causing harm to model accuracy. Intuitively, acquiring more data is a natural and promising approach to achieve this goal by reaching a better Pareto frontier of the fairness-accuracy tradeoff. The current data acquisition methods, such as fair active learning approaches, typically require annotating sensitive attributes. However, these sensitive attribute annotations should be protected due to privacy and safety concerns. In this paper, we propose a tractable active data sampling algorithm that does not rely on training group annotations, instead only requiring group annotations on a small validation set. Specifically, the algorithm first scores each new example by its influence on fairness and accuracy evaluated on the validation dataset, and then selects a certain number of examples for training. We theoretically analyze how acquiring more data can improve fairness without causing harm, and validate the possibility of our sampling approach in the context of risk disparity. We also provide the upper bound of generalization error and risk disparity as well as the corresponding connections. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing adoption of solar energy necessitates advanced methodologies for monitoring and maintenance to ensure optimal performance of solar panel installations. A critical component in this context is the accurate segmentation of solar panels from aerial or satellite imagery, which is essential for identifying operational issues and assessing efficiency. This paper addresses the significant challenges in panel segmentation, particularly the scarcity of annotated data and the labour-intensive nature of manual annotation for supervised learning. We explore and apply Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to solve these challenges. We demonstrate that SSL significantly enhances model generalization under various conditions and reduces dependency on manually annotated data, paving the way for robust and adaptable solar panel segmentation solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Randomly initialized dense networks contain subnetworks that achieve high accuracy without weight learning -- strong lottery tickets (SLTs). Recently, Gadhikar et al. (2023) demonstrated that SLTs can also be found within a randomly pruned source network, thus reducing the SLT search space. However, this limits the search to SLTs that are even sparser than the source, leading to worse accuracy due to unintentionally high sparsity. This paper proposes a method that reduces the SLT search space by an arbitrary ratio independent of the desired SLT sparsity. A random subset of the initial weights is excluded from the search space by freezing it -- i.e., by either permanently pruning them or locking them as a fixed part of the SLT. In addition to reducing search space, the proposed random freezing can also provide the benefit of reducing the model size for inference. Furthermore, experimental results show that the proposed method finds SLTs with better accuracy-to-model size trade-off than the SLTs obtained from dense or randomly pruned source networks. In particular, the SLTs found in Frozen ResNets on image classification using ImageNet significantly improve the accuracy-to-search space and accuracy-to-model size trade-offs over SLTs within dense (non-freezing) or sparse (non-locking) random networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunfan Shao, Linyang Li, Zhaoye Fei, Hang Yan, Dahua Lin, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Data plays a fundamental role in the training of Large Language Models (LLMs). While attention has been paid to the collection and composition of datasets, determining the data sampling strategy in training remains an open question. Most LLMs are trained with a simple strategy, random sampling. However, this sampling strategy ignores the unbalanced nature of training data distribution, which can be sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose ClusterClip Sampling to balance the text distribution of training data for better model training. Specifically, ClusterClip Sampling utilizes data clustering to reflect the data distribution of the training set and balances the common samples and rare samples during training based on the cluster results. A repetition clip operation is introduced to mitigate the overfitting issue led by samples from certain clusters. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of ClusterClip Sampling, which outperforms random sampling and other cluster-based sampling variants under various training datasets and large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zicheng Lin, Zhibin Gou, Tian Liang, Ruilin Luo, Haowei Liu, Yujiu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to critique and refine their reasoning is crucial for their application in evaluation, feedback provision, and self-improvement. This paper introduces CriticBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess LLMs' abilities to critique and rectify their reasoning across a variety of tasks. CriticBench encompasses five reasoning domains: mathematical, commonsense, symbolic, coding, and algorithmic. It compiles 15 datasets and incorporates responses from three LLM families. Utilizing CriticBench, we evaluate and dissect the performance of 17 LLMs in generation, critique, and correction reasoning, i.e., GQC reasoning. Our findings reveal: (1) a linear relationship in GQC capabilities, with critique-focused training markedly enhancing performance; (2) a task-dependent variation in correction effectiveness, with logic-oriented tasks being more amenable to correction; (3) GQC knowledge inconsistencies that decrease as model size increases; and (4) an intriguing inter-model critiquing dynamic, where stronger models are better at critiquing weaker ones, while weaker models can surprisingly surpass stronger ones in their self-critique. We hope these insights into the nuanced critique-correct reasoning of LLMs will foster further research in LLM critique and self-improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Mondorf, Barbara Plank</p>
<p>Abstract: Deductive reasoning plays a pivotal role in the formulation of sound and cohesive arguments. It allows individuals to draw conclusions that logically follow, given the truth value of the information provided. Recent progress in the domain of large language models (LLMs) has showcased their capability in executing deductive reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, a significant portion of research primarily assesses the accuracy of LLMs in solving such tasks, often overlooking a deeper analysis of their reasoning behavior. In this study, we draw upon principles from cognitive psychology to examine inferential strategies employed by LLMs, through a detailed evaluation of their responses to propositional logic problems. Our findings indicate that LLMs display reasoning patterns akin to those observed in humans, including strategies like $\textit{supposition following}$ or $\textit{chain construction}$. Moreover, our research demonstrates that the architecture and scale of the model significantly affect its preferred method of reasoning, with more advanced models tending to adopt strategies more frequently than less sophisticated ones. Importantly, we assert that a model's accuracy, that is the correctness of its final conclusion, does not necessarily reflect the validity of its reasoning process. This distinction underscores the necessity for more nuanced evaluation procedures in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Tan, Chengshuai Zhao, Raha Moraffah, Yifan Li, Yu Kong, Tianlong Chen, Huan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to their unprecedented ability to process and respond to various types of data, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are constantly defining the new boundary of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). As these advanced generative models increasingly form collaborative networks for complex tasks, the integrity and security of these systems are crucial. Our paper, ``The Wolf Within'', explores a novel vulnerability in MLLM societies - the indirect propagation of malicious content. Unlike direct harmful output generation for MLLMs, our research demonstrates how a single MLLM agent can be subtly influenced to generate prompts that, in turn, induce other MLLM agents in the society to output malicious content. Our findings reveal that, an MLLM agent, when manipulated to produce specific prompts or instructions, can effectively ``infect'' other agents within a society of MLLMs. This infection leads to the generation and circulation of harmful outputs, such as dangerous instructions or misinformation, across the society. We also show the transferability of these indirectly generated prompts, highlighting their possibility in propagating malice through inter-agent communication. This research provides a critical insight into a new dimension of threat posed by MLLMs, where a single agent can act as a catalyst for widespread malevolent influence. Our work underscores the urgent need for developing robust mechanisms to detect and mitigate such covert manipulations within MLLM societies, ensuring their safe and ethical utilization in societal applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) are hindered by data contamination, leading to inflated assessments of their effectiveness. Existing strategies, which aim to detect contaminated texts, focus on quantifying contamination status instead of accurately gauging model performance. In this paper, we introduce KIEval, a Knowledge-grounded Interactive Evaluation framework, which incorporates an LLM-powered "interactor" role for the first time to accomplish a dynamic contamination-resilient evaluation. Starting with a question in a conventional LLM benchmark involving domain-specific knowledge, KIEval utilizes dynamically generated, multi-round, and knowledge-focused dialogues to determine whether a model's response is merely a recall of benchmark answers or demonstrates a deep comprehension to apply knowledge in more complex conversations. Extensive experiments on seven leading LLMs across five datasets validate KIEval's effectiveness and generalization. We also reveal that data contamination brings no contribution or even negative effect to models' real-world applicability and understanding, and existing contamination detection methods for LLMs can only identify contamination in pre-training but not during supervised fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vy Vo, He Zhao, Trung Le, Edwin V. Bonilla, Dinh Phung</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal discovery in the presence of missing data introduces a chicken-and-egg dilemma. While the goal is to recover the true causal structure, robust imputation requires considering the dependencies or, preferably, causal relations among variables. Merely filling in missing values with existing imputation methods and subsequently applying structure learning on the complete data is empirically shown to be sub-optimal. To address this problem, we propose a score-based algorithm for learning causal structures from missing data based on optimal transport. This optimal transport viewpoint diverges from existing score-based approaches that are dominantly based on expectation maximization. We formulate structure learning as a density fitting problem, where the goal is to find the causal model that induces a distribution of minimum Wasserstein distance with the observed data distribution. Our framework is shown to recover the true causal graphs more effectively than competing methods in most simulations and real-data settings. Empirical evidence also shows the superior scalability of our approach, along with the flexibility to incorporate any off-the-shelf causal discovery methods for complete data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huan Ma, Yan Zhu, Changqing Zhang, Peilin Zhao, Baoyuan Wu, Long-Kai Huang, Qinghua Hu, Bingzhe Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language foundation models have exhibited remarkable success across a multitude of downstream tasks due to their scalability on extensive image-text paired data. However, these models also display significant limitations when applied to downstream tasks, such as fine-grained image classification, as a result of ``decision shortcuts'' that hinder their generalization capabilities. In this work, we find that the CLIP model possesses a rich set of features, encompassing both \textit{desired invariant causal features} and \textit{undesired decision shortcuts}. Moreover, the underperformance of CLIP on downstream tasks originates from its inability to effectively utilize pre-trained features in accordance with specific task requirements. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective method, Spurious Feature Eraser (SEraser), to alleviate the decision shortcuts by erasing the spurious features. Specifically, we introduce a test-time prompt tuning paradigm that optimizes a learnable prompt, thereby compelling the model to exploit invariant features while disregarding decision shortcuts during the inference phase. The proposed method effectively alleviates excessive dependence on potentially misleading spurious information. We conduct comparative analysis of the proposed method against various approaches which validates the significant superiority.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miao Li, Ming-Bin Chen, Bo Tang, Shengbin Hou, Pengyu Wang, Haiying Deng, Zhiyu Li, Feiyu Xiong, Keming Mao, Peng Cheng, Yi Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: We present NewsBench, a novel evaluation framework to systematically assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for editorial capabilities in Chinese journalism. Our constructed benchmark dataset is focused on four facets of writing proficiency and six facets of safety adherence, and it comprises manually and carefully designed 1,267 test samples in the types of multiple choice questions and short answer questions for five editorial tasks in 24 news domains. To measure performances, we propose different GPT-4 based automatic evaluation protocols to assess LLM generations for short answer questions in terms of writing proficiency and safety adherence, and both are validated by the high correlations with human evaluations. Based on the systematic evaluation framework, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of ten popular LLMs which can handle Chinese. The experimental results highlight GPT-4 and ERNIE Bot as top performers, yet reveal a relative deficiency in journalistic safety adherence in creative writing tasks. Our findings also underscore the need for enhanced ethical guidance in machine-generated journalistic content, marking a step forward in aligning LLMs with journalistic standards and safety considerations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiqian Yang, Yiqun Duan, Qiang Zhang, Hyejeong Jo, Jinni Zhou, Won Hee Lee, Renjing Xu, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Decoding language from brain dynamics is an important open direction in the realm of brain-computer interface (BCI), especially considering the rapid growth of large language models. Compared to invasive-based signals which require electrode implantation surgery, non-invasive neural signals (e.g. EEG, MEG) have attracted increasing attention considering their safety and generality. However, the exploration is not adequate in three aspects: 1) previous methods mainly focus on EEG but none of the previous works address this problem on MEG with better signal quality; 2) prior works have predominantly used $``teacher-forcing"$ during generative decoding, which is impractical; 3) prior works are mostly $``BART-based"$ not fully auto-regressive, which performs better in other sequence tasks. In this paper, we explore the brain-to-text translation of MEG signals in a speech-decoding formation. Here we are the first to investigate a cross-attention-based ``whisper" model for generating text directly from MEG signals without teacher forcing. Our model achieves impressive BLEU-1 scores of 60.30 and 52.89 without pretraining $\&$ teacher-forcing on two major datasets ($\textit{GWilliams}$ and $\textit{Schoffelen}$). This paper conducts a comprehensive review to understand how speech decoding formation performs on the neural decoding tasks, including pretraining initialization, training $\&$ evaluation set splitting, augmentation, and scaling law.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinhua Piao, Sangseon Lee, Yijingxiu Lu, Sun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in the graph domain is challenging due to complex distribution shifts and a lack of environmental contexts. Recent methods attempt to enhance graph OOD generalization by generating flat environments. However, such flat environments come with inherent limitations to capture more complex data distributions. Considering the DrugOOD dataset, which contains diverse training environments (e.g., scaffold, size, etc.), flat contexts cannot sufficiently address its high heterogeneity. Thus, a new challenge is posed to generate more semantically enriched environments to enhance graph invariant learning for handling distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to generate hierarchical semantic environments for each graph. Firstly, given an input graph, we explicitly extract variant subgraphs from the input graph to generate proxy predictions on local environments. Then, stochastic attention mechanisms are employed to re-extract the subgraphs for regenerating global environments in a hierarchical manner. In addition, we introduce a new learning objective that guides our model to learn the diversity of environments within the same hierarchy while maintaining consistency across different hierarchies. This approach enables our model to consider the relationships between environments and facilitates robust graph invariant learning. Extensive experiments on real-world graph data have demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework. Particularly, in the challenging dataset DrugOOD, our method achieves up to 1.29% and 2.83% improvement over the best baselines on IC50 and EC50 prediction tasks, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suneel Belkhale, Tianli Ding, Ted Xiao, Pierre Sermanet, Quon Vuong, Jonathan Tompson, Yevgen Chebotar, Debidatta Dwibedi, Dorsa Sadigh</p>
<p>Abstract: Language provides a way to break down complex concepts into digestible pieces. Recent works in robot imitation learning use language-conditioned policies that predict actions given visual observations and the high-level task specified in language. These methods leverage the structure of natural language to share data between semantically similar tasks (e.g., "pick coke can" and "pick an apple") in multi-task datasets. However, as tasks become more semantically diverse (e.g., "pick coke can" and "pour cup"), sharing data between tasks becomes harder, so learning to map high-level tasks to actions requires much more demonstration data. To bridge tasks and actions, our insight is to teach the robot the language of actions, describing low-level motions with more fine-grained phrases like "move arm forward". Predicting these language motions as an intermediate step between tasks and actions forces the policy to learn the shared structure of low-level motions across seemingly disparate tasks. Furthermore, a policy that is conditioned on language motions can easily be corrected during execution through human-specified language motions. This enables a new paradigm for flexible policies that can learn from human intervention in language. Our method RT-H builds an action hierarchy using language motions: it first learns to predict language motions, and conditioned on this and the high-level task, it predicts actions, using visual context at all stages. We show that RT-H leverages this language-action hierarchy to learn policies that are more robust and flexible by effectively tapping into multi-task datasets. We show that these policies not only allow for responding to language interventions, but can also learn from such interventions and outperform methods that learn from teleoperated interventions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Lu, Sanmitra Banerjee, Jiaqi Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Photonic computing has emerged as a promising solution for accelerating computation-intensive artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, offering unparalleled speed and energy efficiency, especially in resource-limited, latency-sensitive edge computing environments. However, the deployment of analog photonic tensor accelerators encounters reliability challenges due to hardware noise and environmental variations. While off-chip noise-aware training and on-chip training have been proposed to enhance the variation tolerance of optical neural accelerators with moderate, static noise, we observe a notable performance degradation over time due to temporally drifting variations, which requires a real-time, in-situ calibration mechanism. To tackle this challenging reliability issues, for the first time, we propose a lightweight dynamic on-chip remediation framework, dubbed DOCTOR, providing adaptive, in-situ accuracy recovery against temporally drifting noise. The DOCTOR framework intelligently monitors the chip status using adaptive probing and performs fast in-situ training-free calibration to restore accuracy when necessary. Recognizing nonuniform spatial variation distributions across devices and tensor cores, we also propose a variation-aware architectural remapping strategy to avoid executing critical tasks on noisy devices. Extensive experiments show that our proposed framework can guarantee sustained performance under drifting variations with 34% higher accuracy and 2-3 orders-of-magnitude lower overhead compared to state-of-the-art on-chip training methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Beck, Matthew Jackson, Risto Vuorio, Zheng Xiong, Shimon Whiteson</p>
<p>Abstract: A core ambition of reinforcement learning (RL) is the creation of agents capable of rapid learning in novel tasks. Meta-RL aims to achieve this by directly learning such agents. Black box methods do so by training off-the-shelf sequence models end-to-end. By contrast, task inference methods explicitly infer a posterior distribution over the unknown task, typically using distinct objectives and sequence models designed to enable task inference. Recent work has shown that task inference methods are not necessary for strong performance. However, it remains unclear whether task inference sequence models are beneficial even when task inference objectives are not. In this paper, we present evidence that task inference sequence models are indeed still beneficial. In particular, we investigate sequence models with permutation invariant aggregation, which exploit the fact that, due to the Markov property, the task posterior does not depend on the order of data. We empirically confirm the advantage of permutation invariant sequence models without the use of task inference objectives. However, we also find, surprisingly, that there are multiple conditions under which permutation variance remains useful. Therefore, we propose SplAgger, which uses both permutation variant and invariant components to achieve the best of both worlds, outperforming all baselines evaluated on continuous control and memory environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Lamparth, Anthony Corso, Jacob Ganz, Oriana Skylar Mastro, Jacquelyn Schneider, Harold Trinkunas</p>
<p>Abstract: To some, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) promises better decision-making and increased military effectiveness while reducing the influence of human error and emotions. However, there is still debate about how AI systems, especially large language models (LLMs), behave compared to humans in high-stakes military decision-making scenarios with the potential for increased risks towards escalation and unnecessary conflicts. To test this potential and scrutinize the use of LLMs for such purposes, we use a new wargame experiment with 107 national security experts designed to look at crisis escalation in a fictional US-China scenario and compare human players to LLM-simulated responses in separate simulations. Wargames have a long history in the development of military strategy and the response of nations to threats or attacks. Here, we show a considerable high-level agreement in the LLM and human responses and significant quantitative and qualitative differences in individual actions and strategic tendencies. These differences depend on intrinsic biases in LLMs regarding the appropriate level of violence following strategic instructions, the choice of LLM, and whether the LLMs are tasked to decide for a team of players directly or first to simulate dialog between players. When simulating the dialog, the discussions lack quality and maintain a farcical harmony. The LLM simulations cannot account for human player characteristics, showing no significant difference even for extreme traits, such as "pacifist" or "aggressive sociopath". Our results motivate policymakers to be cautious before granting autonomy or following AI-based strategy recommendations.</p>

Our method modifies the latent variable to provide an end-to-end, lightweight capability for fast generation of stereo image pairs, without the need for fine-tuning model weights or any post-processing of images. Using the original input to generate a left image and estimate a disparity map for it, we generate the latent vector for the right image through Stereo Pixel Shift operations, complemented by Symmetric Pixel Shift Masking Denoise and Self-Attention Layers Modification methods to align the right-side image with the left-side image. Moreover, our proposed method maintains a high standard of image quality throughout the stereo generation process, achieving state-of-the-art scores in various quantitative evaluations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative modeling have significantly enhanced the reconstruction of audio waveforms from various representations. While diffusion models are adept at this task, they are hindered by latency issues due to their operation at the individual sample point level and the need for numerous sampling steps. In this study, we introduce RFWave, a cutting-edge multi-band Rectified Flow approach designed to reconstruct high-fidelity audio waveforms from Mel-spectrograms or discrete tokens. RFWave uniquely generates complex spectrograms and operates at the frame level, processing all subbands simultaneously to boost efficiency. Leveraging Rectified Flow, which targets a flat transport trajectory, RFWave achieves reconstruction with just 10 sampling steps. Our empirical evaluations show that RFWave not only provides outstanding reconstruction quality but also offers vastly superior computational efficiency, enabling audio generation at speeds up to 97 times faster than real-time on a GPU.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weikai Li, Zhiping Xiao, Xiao Luo, Yizhou Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely utilized to capture the information spreading patterns in graphs. While remarkable performance has been achieved, there is a new trending topic of evaluating node influence. We propose a new method of evaluating node influence, which measures the prediction change of a trained GNN model caused by removing a node. A real-world application is, "In the task of predicting Twitter accounts' polarity, had a particular account been removed, how would others' polarity change?". We use the GNN as a surrogate model whose prediction could simulate the change of nodes or edges caused by node removal. Our target is to obtain the influence score for every node, and a straightforward way is to alternately remove every node and apply the trained GNN on the modified graph to generate new predictions. It is reliable but time-consuming, so we need an efficient method. The related lines of work, such as graph adversarial attack and counterfactual explanation, cannot directly satisfy our needs, since their problem settings are different. We propose an efficient, intuitive, and effective method, NOde-Removal-based fAst GNN inference (NORA), which uses the gradient information to approximate the node-removal influence. It only costs one forward propagation and one backpropagation to approximate the influence score for all nodes. Extensive experiments on six datasets and six GNN models verify the effectiveness of NORA. Our code is available at https://github.com/weikai-li/NORA.git.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhishuai Li, Xiang Wang, Jingjing Zhao, Sun Yang, Guoqing Du, Xiaoru Hu, Bin Zhang, Yuxiao Ye, Ziyue Li, Rui Zhao, Hangyu Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) emphasize stimulating the large language models (LLM) on in-context learning, achieving significant results. Nevertheless, they face challenges when dealing with verbose database information and complex user intentions. This paper presents a two-stage framework to enhance the performance of current LLM-based natural language to SQL systems. We first introduce a novel prompt representation, called reference-enhanced representation, which includes schema information and randomly sampled cell values from tables to instruct LLMs in generating SQL queries. Then, in the first stage, question-SQL pairs are retrieved as few-shot demonstrations, prompting the LLM to generate a preliminary SQL (PreSQL). After that, the mentioned entities in PreSQL are parsed to conduct schema linking, which can significantly compact the useful information. In the second stage, with the linked schema, we simplify the prompt's schema information and instruct the LLM to produce the final SQL. Finally, as the post-refinement module, we propose using cross-consistency across different LLMs rather than self-consistency within a particular LLM. Our methods achieve new SOTA results on the Spider benchmark, with an execution accuracy of 87.6%.</p>

<p>Abstract: A key aspect of intelligence is the ability to demonstrate a broad spectrum of behaviors for adapting to unexpected situations. Over the past decade, advancements in deep reinforcement learning have led to groundbreaking achievements to solve complex continuous control tasks. However, most approaches return only one solution specialized for a specific problem. We introduce Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), an off-policy actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages a value function critic and a successor features critic to learn high-performing and diverse behaviors. In this framework, the actor optimizes an objective that seamlessly unifies both critics using constrained optimization to (1) maximize return, while (2) executing diverse skills. Compared with other Quality-Diversity methods, QDAC achieves significantly higher performance and more diverse behaviors on six challenging continuous control locomotion tasks. We also demonstrate that we can harness the learned skills to adapt better than other baselines to five perturbed environments. Finally, qualitative analyses showcase a range of remarkable behaviors: adaptive-intelligent-robotics.github.io/QDAC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Santosh Sanjeev, Nuren Zhaksylyk, Ibrahim Almakky, Anees Ur Rehman Hashmi, Mohammad Areeb Qazi, Mohammad Yaqub</p>
<p>Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated medical datasets requires leveraging transfer learning from broader datasets like ImageNet or pre-trained models like CLIP. Model soups averages multiple fine-tuned models aiming to improve performance on In-Domain (ID) tasks and enhance robustness against Out-of-Distribution (OOD) datasets. However, applying these methods to the medical imaging domain faces challenges and results in suboptimal performance. This is primarily due to differences in error surface characteristics that stem from data complexities such as heterogeneity, domain shift, class imbalance, and distributional shifts between training and testing phases. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical merging approach that involves local and global aggregation of models at various levels based on models' hyperparameter configurations. Furthermore, to alleviate the need for training a large number of models in the hyperparameter search, we introduce a computationally efficient method using a cyclical learning rate scheduler to produce multiple models for aggregation in the weight space. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over the model souping approach across multiple datasets (around 6% gain in HAM10000 and CheXpert datasets) while maintaining low computational costs for model generation and selection. Moreover, we achieve better results on OOD datasets than model soups. The code is available at https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/FissionFusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matt White, Ibrahim Haddad, Cailean Osborne, Xiao-Yang Liu Yanglet, Ahmed Abdelmonsef, Sachin Varghese</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) offers unprecedented opportunities for research and innovation, but its commercialization has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open GAI models lack the necessary components for full understanding and reproducibility, and some use restrictive licenses whilst claiming to be ``open-source''. To address these concerns, we propose the Model Openness Framework (MOF), a ranked classification system that rates machine learning models based on their completeness and openness, following principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. The MOF requires specific components of the model development lifecycle to be included and released under appropriate open licenses. This framework aims to prevent misrepresentation of models claiming to be open, guide researchers and developers in providing all model components under permissive licenses, and help individuals and organizations identify models that can be safely adopted without restrictions. By promoting transparency and reproducibility, the MOF combats ``openwashing'' practices and establishes completeness and openness as primary criteria alongside the core tenets of responsible AI. Wide adoption of the MOF will foster a more open AI ecosystem, benefiting research, innovation, and adoption of state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods can successfully solve a wide range of sequential decision problems. However, learning policies that can generalize predictably across multiple tasks in a setting with non-Markovian reward specifications is a challenging problem. We propose to use successor features to learn a policy basis so that each (sub)policy in it solves a well-defined subproblem. In a task described by a finite state automaton (FSA) that involves the same set of subproblems, the combination of these (sub)policies can then be used to generate an optimal solution without additional learning. In contrast to other methods that combine (sub)policies via planning, our method asymptotically attains global optimality, even in stochastic environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Compressing high-capability Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a favored strategy for resource-efficient inferences. While state-of-the-art (SoTA) compression methods boast impressive advancements in preserving benign task performance, the potential risks of compression in terms of safety and trustworthiness have been largely neglected. This study conducts the first, thorough evaluation of three (3) leading LLMs using five (5) SoTA compression techniques across eight (8) trustworthiness dimensions. Our experiments highlight the intricate interplay between compression and trustworthiness, revealing some interesting patterns. We find that quantization is currently a more effective approach than pruning in achieving efficiency and trustworthiness simultaneously. For instance, a 4-bit quantized model retains the trustworthiness of its original counterpart, but model pruning significantly degrades trustworthiness, even at 50% sparsity. Moreover, employing quantization within a moderate bit range could unexpectedly improve certain trustworthiness dimensions such as ethics and fairness. Conversely, extreme quantization to very low bit levels (3 bits) tends to reduce trustworthiness significantly. This increased risk cannot be uncovered by looking at benign performance alone, in turn, mandating comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation in practice. These findings culminate in practical recommendations for simultaneously achieving high utility, efficiency, and trustworthiness in LLMs. Code and models are available at https://decoding-comp-trust.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayue Zhang, Yiheng Liu, Wenqi Cai, Lanlan Wu, Yali Peng, Jingjing Yu, Senqing Qi, Taotao Long, Bao Ge</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, especially the emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has presented significant prospects for application in the field of education. LLMs possess the capability to interpret knowledge, answer questions, and consider context, thus providing support for dialogic teaching to students. Therefore, an examination of the capacity of LLMs to effectively fulfill instructional roles, thereby facilitating student learning akin to human educators within dialogic teaching scenarios, is an exceptionally valuable research topic. This research recruited 34 undergraduate students as participants, who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group engaged in dialogic teaching using ChatGPT, while the control group interacted with human teachers. Both groups learned the histogram equalization unit in the information-related course "Digital Image Processing". The research findings show comparable scores between the two groups on the retention test. However, students who engaged in dialogue with ChatGPT exhibited lower performance on the transfer test. Electroencephalography data revealed that students who interacted with ChatGPT exhibited higher levels of cognitive activity, suggesting that ChatGPT could help students establish a knowledge foundation and stimulate cognitive activity. However, its strengths on promoting students. knowledge application and creativity were insignificant. Based upon the research findings, it is evident that ChatGPT cannot fully excel in fulfilling teaching tasks in the dialogue teaching in information related courses. Combining ChatGPT with traditional human teachers might be a more ideal approach. The synergistic use of both can provide students with more comprehensive learning support, thus contributing to enhancing the quality of teaching.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdelrhman Werby, Chenguang Huang, Martin B\"uchner, Abhinav Valada, Wolfram Burgard</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary robot mapping methods enrich dense geometric maps with pre-trained visual-language features. While these maps allow for the prediction of point-wise saliency maps when queried for a certain language concept, large-scale environments and abstract queries beyond the object level still pose a considerable hurdle, ultimately limiting language-grounded robotic navigation. In this work, we present HOV-SG, a hierarchical open-vocabulary 3D scene graph mapping approach for language-grounded robot navigation. Leveraging open-vocabulary vision foundation models, we first obtain state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segment-level maps in 3D and subsequently construct a 3D scene graph hierarchy consisting of floor, room, and object concepts, each enriched with open-vocabulary features. Our approach is able to represent multi-story buildings and allows robotic traversal of those using a cross-floor Voronoi graph. HOV-SG is evaluated on three distinct datasets and surpasses previous baselines in open-vocabulary semantic accuracy on the object, room, and floor level while producing a 75% reduction in representation size compared to dense open-vocabulary maps. In order to prove the efficacy and generalization capabilities of HOV-SG, we showcase successful long-horizon language-conditioned robot navigation within real-world multi-storage environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> George Panagopoulos, Daniele Malitesta, Fragkiskos D. Malliaros, Jun Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating causal effects in e-commerce tends to involve costly treatment assignments which can be impractical in large-scale settings. Leveraging machine learning to predict such treatment effects without actual intervention is a standard practice to diminish the risk. However, existing methods for treatment effect prediction tend to rely on training sets of substantial size, which are built from real experiments and are thus inherently risky to create. In this work we propose a graph neural network to diminish the required training set size, relying on graphs that are common in e-commerce data. Specifically, we view the problem as node regression with a restricted number of labeled instances, develop a two-model neural architecture akin to previous causal effect estimators, and test varying message-passing layers for encoding. Furthermore, as an extra step, we combine the model with an acquisition function to guide the creation of the training set in settings with extremely low experimental budget. The framework is flexible since each step can be used separately with other models or treatment policies. The experiments on real large-scale networks indicate a clear advantage of our methodology over the state of the art, which in many cases performs close to random, underlining the need for models that can generalize with limited supervision to reduce experimental risks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large AI models trained on audio data may have the potential to rapidly classify patients, enhancing medical decision-making and potentially improving outcomes through early detection. Existing technologies depend on limited datasets using expensive recording equipment in high-income, English-speaking countries. This challenges deployment in resource-constrained, high-volume settings where audio data may have a profound impact. This report introduces a novel data type and a corresponding collection system that captures health data through guided questions using only a mobile/web application. This application ultimately results in an audio electronic health record (voice EHR) which may contain complex biomarkers of health from conventional voice/respiratory features, speech patterns, and language with semantic meaning - compensating for the typical limitations of unimodal clinical datasets. This report introduces a consortium of partners for global work, presents the application used for data collection, and showcases the potential of informative voice EHR to advance the scalability and diversity of audio AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinbao Qiao, Meng Zhang, Ming Tang, Ermin Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning strives to uphold the data owners' right to be forgotten by enabling models to selectively forget specific data. Recent advances suggest precomputing and storing statistics extracted from second-order information and implementing unlearning through Newton-style updates. However, the theoretical analysis of these works often depends on restrictive assumptions of convexity and smoothness, and those mentioned operations on Hessian matrix are extremely costly. As a result, applying these works to high-dimensional models becomes challenging. In this paper, we propose an efficient Hessian-free certified unlearning. We propose to maintain a statistical vector for each data, computed through affine stochastic recursion approximation of the difference between retrained and learned models. Our analysis does not involve inverting Hessian and thus can be extended to non-convex non-smooth objectives. Under same assumptions, we demonstrate advancements of proposed method beyond the state-of-the-art theoretical studies, in terms of generalization, unlearning guarantee, deletion capacity, and computation/storage complexity, and we show that the unlearned model of our proposed approach is close to or same as the retrained model. Based on the strategy of recollecting statistics for forgetting data, we develop an algorithm that achieves near-instantaneous unlearning as it only requires a vector addition operation. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme surpasses existing results by orders of magnitude in terms of time/storage costs, while also enhancing accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen Ma, Anda Cao, Zhiqing Xiao, Jie Zhang, Chao Ye, Junbo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have received widespread attention due to their remarkable generation capabilities. However, concerns have been raised about the ethical implications of the models in generating Not Safe for Work (NSFW) images because NSFW images may cause discomfort to people or be used for illegal purposes. To mitigate the generation of such images, T2I models deploy various types of safety checkers. However, they still cannot completely prevent the generation of NSFW images. In this paper, we propose the Jailbreak Prompt Attack (JPA) - an automatic attack framework. We aim to maintain prompts that bypass safety checkers while preserving the semantics of the original images. Specifically, we aim to find prompts that can bypass safety checkers because of the robustness of the text space. Our evaluation demonstrates that JPA successfully bypasses both online services with closed-box safety checkers and offline defenses safety checkers to generate NSFW images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyao Zeng, Daniel Wang, Fengyu Yang, Hyoungseob Park, Yangchao Wu, Stefano Soatto, Byung-Woo Hong, Dong Lao, Alex Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from a single image is an ill-posed problem with inherent ambiguities, i.e. scale. Predicting a 3D scene from text description(s) is similarly ill-posed, i.e. spatial arrangements of objects described. We investigate the question of whether two inherently ambiguous modalities can be used in conjunction to produce metric-scaled reconstructions. To test this, we focus on monocular depth estimation, the problem of predicting a dense depth map from a single image, but with an additional text caption describing the scene. To this end, we begin by encoding the text caption as a mean and standard deviation; using a variational framework, we learn the distribution of the plausible metric reconstructions of 3D scenes corresponding to the text captions as a prior. To "select" a specific reconstruction or depth map, we encode the given image through a conditional sampler that samples from the latent space of the variational text encoder, which is then decoded to the output depth map. Our approach is trained alternatingly between the text and image branches: in one optimization step, we predict the mean and standard deviation from the text description and sample from a standard Gaussian, and in the other, we sample using a (image) conditional sampler. Once trained, we directly predict depth from the encoded text using the conditional sampler. We demonstrate our approach on indoor (NYUv2) and outdoor (KITTI) scenarios, where we show that language can consistently improve performance in both.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongzhi Jiang, Guanglu Song, Xiaoshi Wu, Renrui Zhang, Dazhong Shen, Zhuofan Zong, Yu Liu, Hongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated great success in the field of text-to-image generation. However, alleviating the misalignment between the text prompts and images is still challenging. The root reason behind the misalignment has not been extensively investigated. We observe that the misalignment is caused by inadequate token attention activation. We further attribute this phenomenon to the diffusion model's insufficient condition utilization, which is caused by its training paradigm. To address the issue, we propose CoMat, an end-to-end diffusion model fine-tuning strategy with an image-to-text concept matching mechanism. We leverage an image captioning model to measure image-to-text alignment and guide the diffusion model to revisit ignored tokens. A novel attribute concentration module is also proposed to address the attribute binding problem. Without any image or human preference data, we use only 20K text prompts to fine-tune SDXL to obtain CoMat-SDXL. Extensive experiments show that CoMat-SDXL significantly outperforms the baseline model SDXL in two text-to-image alignment benchmarks and achieves start-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas F Burns</p>
<p>Abstract: I introduce a novel associative memory model named Correlated Dense Associative Memory (CDAM), which integrates both auto- and hetero-association in a unified framework for continuous-valued memory patterns. Employing an arbitrary graph structure to semantically link memory patterns, CDAM is theoretically and numerically analysed, revealing four distinct dynamical modes: auto-association, narrow hetero-association, wide hetero-association, and neutral quiescence. Drawing inspiration from inhibitory modulation studies, I employ anti-Hebbian learning rules to control the range of hetero-association, extract multi-scale representations of community structures in graphs, and stabilise the recall of temporal sequences. Experimental demonstrations showcase CDAM's efficacy in handling real-world data, replicating a classical neuroscience experiment, performing image retrieval, and simulating arbitrary finite automata.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zishuo Zhao, Zhixuan Fang, Xuechao Wang, Xi Chen, Yuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Most concurrent blockchain systems rely heavily on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms for decentralized consensus and security assurance. However, the substantial energy expenditure stemming from computationally intensive yet meaningless tasks has raised considerable concerns surrounding traditional PoW approaches, The PoS mechanism, while free of energy consumption, is subject to security and economic issues. Addressing these issues, the paradigm of Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) seeks to employ challenges of practical significance as PoW, thereby imbuing energy consumption with tangible value. While previous efforts in Proof of Learning (PoL) explored the utilization of deep learning model training SGD tasks as PoUW challenges, recent research has revealed its vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and the theoretical hardness in crafting a byzantine-secure PoL mechanism. In this paper, we introduce the concept of incentive-security that incentivizes rational provers to behave honestly for their best interest, bypassing the existing hardness to design a PoL mechanism with computational efficiency, a provable incentive-security guarantee and controllable difficulty. Particularly, our work is secure against two attacks to the recent work of Jia et al. [2021], and also improves the computational overhead from $\Theta(1)$ to $O(\frac{\log E}{E})$. Furthermore, while most recent research assumes trusted problem providers and verifiers, our design also guarantees frontend incentive-security even when problem providers are untrusted, and verifier incentive-security that bypasses the Verifier's Dilemma. By incorporating ML training into blockchain consensus mechanisms with provable guarantees, our research not only proposes an eco-friendly solution to blockchain systems, but also provides a proposal for a completely decentralized computing power market in the new AI age.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sein Kim, Hongseok Kang, Seungyoon Choi, Donghyun Kim, Minchul Yang, Chanyoung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaborative filtering recommender systems (CF-RecSys) have shown successive results in enhancing the user experience on social media and e-commerce platforms. However, as CF-RecSys struggles under cold scenarios with sparse user-item interactions, recent strategies have focused on leveraging modality information of user/items (e.g., text or images) based on pre-trained modality encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite their effectiveness under cold scenarios, we observe that they underperform simple traditional collaborative filtering models under warm scenarios due to the lack of collaborative knowledge. In this work, we propose an efficient All-round LLM-based Recommender system, called A-LLMRec, that excels not only in the cold scenario but also in the warm scenario. Our main idea is to enable an LLM to directly leverage the collaborative knowledge contained in a pre-trained state-of-the-art CF-RecSys so that the emergent ability of the LLM as well as the high-quality user/item embeddings that are already trained by the state-of-the-art CF-RecSys can be jointly exploited. This approach yields two advantages: (1) model-agnostic, allowing for integration with various existing CF-RecSys, and (2) efficiency, eliminating the extensive fine-tuning typically required for LLM-based recommenders. Our extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of A-LLMRec in various scenarios, including cold/warm, few-shot, cold user, and cross-domain scenarios. Beyond the recommendation task, we also show the potential of A-LLMRec in generating natural language outputs based on the understanding of the collaborative knowledge by performing a favorite genre prediction task.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongcheng Zeng, Guoqing Liu, Weiyu Ma, Ning Yang, Haifeng Zhang, Jun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential to align them with human values and intentions. This process often utilizes methods like pairwise comparisons and KL divergence against a reference LLM, focusing on the evaluation of full answers generated by the models. However, the generation of these responses occurs in a token level, following a sequential, auto-regressive fashion. In this paper, we introduce Token-level Direct Preference Optimization (TDPO), a novel approach to align LLMs with human preferences by optimizing policy at the token level. Unlike previous methods, which face challenges in divergence efficiency, TDPO incorporates forward KL divergence constraints for each token, improving alignment and diversity. Utilizing the Bradley-Terry model for a token-based reward system, TDPO enhances the regulation of KL divergence, while preserving simplicity without the need for explicit reward modeling. Experimental results across various text tasks demonstrate TDPO's superior performance in balancing alignment with generation diversity. Notably, fine-tuning with TDPO strikes a better balance than DPO in the controlled sentiment generation and single-turn dialogue datasets, and significantly improves the quality of generated responses compared to both DPO and PPO-based RLHF methods.

<p>Abstract: Parkinson's disease ranks as the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder globally. This research aims to develop a system leveraging Mixed Reality capabilities for tracking and assessing eye movements. In this paper, we present a medical scenario and outline the development of an application designed to capture eye-tracking signals through Mixed Reality technology for the evaluation of neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, we introduce a pipeline for extracting clinically relevant features from eye-gaze analysis, describing the capabilities of the proposed system from a medical perspective. The study involved a cohort of healthy control individuals and patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, showcasing the feasibility and potential of the proposed technology for non-intrusive monitoring of eye movement patterns for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.
  Clinical relevance - Developing a non-invasive biomarker for Parkinson's disease is urgently needed to accurately detect the disease's onset. This would allow for the timely introduction of neuroprotective treatment at the earliest stage and enable the continuous monitoring of intervention outcomes. The ability to detect subtle changes in eye movements allows for early diagnosis, offering a critical window for intervention before more pronounced symptoms emerge. Eye tracking provides objective and quantifiable biomarkers, ensuring reliable assessments of disease progression and cognitive function. The eye gaze analysis using Mixed Reality glasses is wireless, facilitating convenient assessments in both home and hospital settings. The approach offers the advantage of utilizing hardware that requires no additional specialized attachments, enabling examinations through personal eyewear.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced in various fields and intelligent agent applications. However, current LLMs that learn from human or external model supervision are costly and may face performance ceilings as task complexity and diversity increase. To address this issue, self-evolution approaches that enable LLM to autonomously acquire, refine, and learn from experiences generated by the model itself are rapidly growing. This new training paradigm inspired by the human experiential learning process offers the potential to scale LLMs towards superintelligence. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of self-evolution approaches in LLMs. We first propose a conceptual framework for self-evolution and outline the evolving process as iterative cycles composed of four phases: experience acquisition, experience refinement, updating, and evaluation. Second, we categorize the evolution objectives of LLMs and LLM-based agents; then, we summarize the literature and provide taxonomy and insights for each module. Lastly, we pinpoint existing challenges and propose future directions to improve self-evolution frameworks, equipping researchers with critical insights to fast-track the development of self-evolving LLMs. Our corresponding GitHub repository is available at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/Awesome-Self-Evolution-of-LLM</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Xue, Yuhao Zhou, Shen Nie, Xu Min, Xiaolu Zhang, Jun Zhou, Chongxuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian flow networks (BFNs) iteratively refine the parameters, instead of the samples in diffusion models (DMs), of distributions at various noise levels through Bayesian inference. Owing to its differentiable nature, BFNs are promising in modeling both continuous and discrete data, while simultaneously maintaining fast sampling capabilities. This paper aims to understand and enhance BFNs by connecting them with DMs through stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We identify the linear SDEs corresponding to the noise-addition processes in BFNs, demonstrate that BFN's regression losses are aligned with denoise score matching, and validate the sampler in BFN as a first-order solver for the respective reverse-time SDE. Based on these findings and existing recipes of fast sampling in DMs, we propose specialized solvers for BFNs that markedly surpass the original BFN sampler in terms of sample quality with a limited number of function evaluations (e.g., 10) on both image and text datasets. Notably, our best sampler achieves an increase in speed of 5~20 times for free. Our code is available at https://github.com/ML-GSAI/BFN-Solver.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parshin Shojaee, Kazem Meidani, Shashank Gupta, Amir Barati Farimani, Chandan K Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical equations have been unreasonably effective in describing complex natural phenomena across various scientific disciplines. However, discovering such insightful equations from data presents significant challenges due to the necessity of navigating extremely high-dimensional combinatorial and nonlinear hypothesis spaces. Traditional methods of equation discovery, commonly known as symbolic regression, largely focus on extracting equations from data alone, often neglecting the rich domain-specific prior knowledge that scientists typically depend on. To bridge this gap, we introduce LLM-SR, a novel approach that leverages the extensive scientific knowledge and robust code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover scientific equations from data in an efficient manner. Specifically, LLM-SR treats equations as programs with mathematical operators and combines LLMs' scientific priors with evolutionary search over equation programs. The LLM iteratively proposes new equation skeleton hypotheses, drawing from its physical understanding, which are then optimized against data to estimate skeleton parameters. We demonstrate LLM-SR's effectiveness across three diverse scientific domains, where it discovers physically accurate equations that provide significantly better fits to in-domain and out-of-domain data compared to the well-established symbolic regression baselines. Incorporating scientific prior knowledge also enables LLM-SR to search the equation space more efficiently than baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nitsan Soffair, Gilad Katz</p>
<p>Abstract: Discounted algorithms often encounter evaluation errors due to their reliance on short-term estimations, which can impede their efficacy in addressing simple, short-term tasks and impose undesired temporal discounts (\(\gamma\)). Interestingly, these algorithms are often tested without applying a discount, a phenomenon we refer as the \textit{train-test bias}. In response to these challenges, we propose the Markov Flow Policy, which utilizes a non-negative neural network flow to enable comprehensive forward-view predictions. Through integration into the TD7 codebase and evaluation using the MuJoCo benchmark, we observe significant performance improvements, positioning MFP as a straightforward, practical, and easily implementable solution within the domain of average rewards algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minsu Kim, Giseop Kim, Sunwook Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Bird's Eye View (BEV) fusion for map construction have demonstrated remarkable mapping of urban environments. However, their deep and bulky architecture incurs substantial amounts of backpropagation memory and computing latency. Consequently, the problem poses an unavoidable bottleneck in constructing high-resolution (HR) BEV maps, as their large-sized features cause significant increases in costs including GPU memory consumption and computing latency, named diverging training costs issue. Affected by the problem, most existing methods adopt low-resolution (LR) BEV and struggle to estimate the precise locations of urban scene components like road lanes, and sidewalks. As the imprecision leads to risky self-driving, the diverging training costs issue has to be resolved. In this paper, we address the issue with our novel Trumpet Neural Network (TNN) mechanism. The framework utilizes LR BEV space and outputs an up-sampled semantic BEV map to create a memory-efficient pipeline. To this end, we introduce Local Restoration of BEV representation. Specifically, the up-sampled BEV representation has severely aliased, blocky signals, and thick semantic labels. Our proposed Local Restoration restores the signals and thins (or narrows down) the width of the labels. Our extensive experiments show that the TNN mechanism provides a plug-and-play memory-efficient pipeline, thereby enabling the effective estimation of real-sized (or precise) semantic labels for BEV map construction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riley Simmons-Edler, Ryan Badman, Shayne Longpre, Kanaka Rajan</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent embrace of machine learning (ML) in the development of autonomous weapons systems (AWS) creates serious risks to geopolitical stability and the free exchange of ideas in AI research. This topic has received comparatively little attention of late compared to risks stemming from superintelligent artificial general intelligence (AGI), but requires fewer assumptions about the course of technological development and is thus a nearer-future issue. ML is already enabling the substitution of AWS for human soldiers in many battlefield roles, reducing the upfront human cost, and thus political cost, of waging offensive war. In the case of peer adversaries, this increases the likelihood of "low intensity" conflicts which risk escalation to broader warfare. In the case of non-peer adversaries, it reduces the domestic blowback to wars of aggression. This effect can occur regardless of other ethical issues around the use of military AI such as the risk of civilian casualties, and does not require any superhuman AI capabilities. Further, the military value of AWS raises the specter of an AI-powered arms race and the misguided imposition of national security restrictions on AI research. Our goal in this paper is to raise awareness among the public and ML researchers on the near-future risks posed by full or near-full autonomy in military technology, and we provide regulatory suggestions to mitigate these risks. We call upon AI policy experts and the defense AI community in particular to embrace transparency and caution in their development and deployment of AWS to avoid the negative effects on global stability and AI research that we highlight here.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David R\"ugamer, Chris Kolb, Tobias Weber, Lucas Kook, Thomas Nagler</p>
<p>Abstract: The complexity of black-box algorithms can lead to various challenges, including the introduction of biases. These biases present immediate risks in the algorithms' application. It was, for instance, shown that neural networks can deduce racial information solely from a patient's X-ray scan, a task beyond the capability of medical experts. If this fact is not known to the medical expert, automatic decision-making based on this algorithm could lead to prescribing a treatment (purely) based on racial information. While current methodologies allow for the "orthogonalization" or "normalization" of neural networks with respect to such information, existing approaches are grounded in linear models. Our paper advances the discourse by introducing corrections for non-linearities such as ReLU activations. Our approach also encompasses scalar and tensor-valued predictions, facilitating its integration into neural network architectures. Through extensive experiments, we validate our method's effectiveness in safeguarding sensitive data in generalized linear models, normalizing convolutional neural networks for metadata, and rectifying pre-existing embeddings for undesired attributes.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a valuable tool in drug design, offering the potential to propose and optimize molecules with desired properties. However, striking a balance between capabilities, flexibility, reliability, and efficiency remains challenging due to the complexity of advanced RL algorithms and the significant reliance on specialized code. In this work, we introduce ACEGEN, a comprehensive and streamlined toolkit tailored for generative drug design, built using TorchRL, a modern RL library that offers thoroughly tested reusable components. We validate ACEGEN by benchmarking against other published generative modeling algorithms and show comparable or improved performance. We also show examples of ACEGEN applied in multiple drug discovery case studies. ACEGEN is accessible at \url{https://github.com/acellera/acegen-open} and available for use under the MIT license.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Inderjeet Nair, Lu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the task of conducting structured reasoning as generating a reasoning graph from natural language input using large language models (LLMs). Previous approaches have explored various prompting schemes, yet they suffer from error propagation due to the autoregressive nature and single-pass-based decoding, which lack error correction capability. Additionally, relying solely on a single sample may result in the omission of true nodes and edges. To counter this, we draw inspiration from self-consistency (SC), which involves sampling a diverse set of reasoning chains and taking the majority vote as the final answer. To tackle the substantial challenge of applying SC on generated graphs, we propose MIDGARD (MInimum Description length Guided Aggregation of Reasoning in Directed acyclic graph) that leverages Minimum Description Length (MDL)-based formulation to identify consistent properties among the different graph samples generated by an LLM. This formulation helps reject properties that appear in only a few samples, which are likely to be erroneous, while enabling the inclusion of missing elements without compromising precision. Our method demonstrates superior performance than comparisons across various structured reasoning tasks, including argument structure extraction, explanation graph generation, inferring dependency relations among actions for everyday tasks, and semantic graph generation from natural texts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fatemeh Nazary, Yashar Deldjoo, Tommaso Di Noia, Eugenio di Sciascio</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare diagnostics offers a promising avenue for clinical decision-making. This study outlines the development of a novel method for zero-shot/few-shot in-context learning (ICL) by integrating medical domain knowledge using a multi-layered structured prompt. We also explore the efficacy of two communication styles between the user and LLMs: the Numerical Conversational (NC) style, which processes data incrementally, and the Natural Language Single-Turn (NL-ST) style, which employs long narrative prompts.
  Our study systematically evaluates the diagnostic accuracy and risk factors, including gender bias and false negative rates, using a dataset of 920 patient records in various few-shot scenarios. Results indicate that traditional clinical machine learning (ML) models generally outperform LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings. However, the performance gap narrows significantly when employing few-shot examples alongside effective explainable AI (XAI) methods as sources of domain knowledge. Moreover, with sufficient time and an increased number of examples, the conversational style (NC) nearly matches the performance of ML models. Most notably, LLMs demonstrate comparable or superior cost-sensitive accuracy relative to ML models.
  This research confirms that, with appropriate domain knowledge and tailored communication strategies, LLMs can significantly enhance diagnostic processes. The findings highlight the importance of optimizing the number of training examples and communication styles to improve accuracy and reduce biases in LLM applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaejun Lee, Minsung Hwang, Joyce Jiyoung Whang</p>
<p>Abstract: While a number of knowledge graph representation learning (KGRL) methods have been proposed over the past decade, very few theoretical analyses have been conducted on them. In this paper, we present the first PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for KGRL methods. To analyze a broad class of KGRL models, we propose a generic framework named ReED (Relation-aware Encoder-Decoder), which consists of a relation-aware message passing encoder and a triplet classification decoder. Our ReED framework can express at least 15 different existing KGRL models, including not only graph neural network-based models such as R-GCN and CompGCN but also shallow-architecture models such as RotatE and ANALOGY. Our generalization bounds for the ReED framework provide theoretical grounds for the commonly used tricks in KGRL, e.g., parameter-sharing and weight normalization schemes, and guide desirable design choices for practical KGRL methods. We empirically show that the critical factors in our generalization bounds can explain actual generalization errors on three real-world knowledge graphs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Discrimination and calibration represent two important properties of survival analysis, with the former assessing the model's ability to accurately rank subjects and the latter evaluating the alignment of predicted outcomes with actual events. With their distinct nature, it is hard for survival models to simultaneously optimize both of them especially as many previous results found improving calibration tends to diminish discrimination performance. This paper introduces a novel approach utilizing conformal regression that can improve a model's calibration without degrading discrimination. We provide theoretical guarantees for the above claim, and rigorously validate the efficiency of our approach across 11 real-world datasets, showcasing its practical applicability and robustness in diverse scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (reSGLD) is an effective sampler for non-convex learning in large-scale datasets. However, the simulation may encounter stagnation issues when the high-temperature chain delves too deeply into the distribution tails. To tackle this issue, we propose reflected reSGLD (r2SGLD): an algorithm tailored for constrained non-convex exploration by utilizing reflection steps within a bounded domain. Theoretically, we observe that reducing the diameter of the domain enhances mixing rates, exhibiting a $\textit{quadratic}$ behavior. Empirically, we test its performance through extensive experiments, including identifying dynamical systems with physical constraints, simulations of constrained multi-modal distributions, and image classification tasks. The theoretical and empirical findings highlight the crucial role of constrained exploration in improving the simulation efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Optic nerve head (ONH) detection has been a crucial area of study in ophthalmology for years. However, the significant discrepancy between fundus image datasets, each generated using a single type of fundus camera, poses challenges to the generalizability of ONH detection approaches developed based on semantic segmentation networks. Despite the numerous recent advancements in general-purpose semantic segmentation methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, there is currently a lack of benchmarks for these state-of-the-art (SoTA) networks specifically trained for ONH detection. Therefore, in this article, we make contributions from three key aspects: network design, the publication of a dataset, and the establishment of a comprehensive benchmark. Our newly developed ONH detection network, referred to as ODFormer, is based upon the Swin Transformer architecture and incorporates two novel components: a multi-scale context aggregator and a lightweight bidirectional feature recalibrator. Our published large-scale dataset, known as TongjiU-DROD, provides multi-resolution fundus images for each participant, captured using two distinct types of cameras. Our established benchmark involves three datasets: DRIONS-DB, DRISHTI-GS1, and TongjiU-DROD, created by researchers from different countries and containing fundus images captured from participants of diverse races and ages. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed ODFormer outperforms other state-of-the-art (SoTA) networks in terms of performance and generalizability. Our dataset and source code are publicly available at mias.group/ODFormer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianhao Chen, Haoyuan Ouyang, Junyang Ren, Wentao Ding, Wei Hu, Yuzhong Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Facts extraction is pivotal for constructing knowledge graphs. Recently, the increasing demand for temporal facts in downstream tasks has led to the emergence of the task of temporal fact extraction. In this paper, we specifically address the extraction of temporal facts from natural language text. Previous studies fail to handle the challenge of establishing time-to-fact correspondences in complex sentences. To overcome this hurdle, we propose a timeline-based sentence decomposition strategy using large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning, ensuring a fine-grained understanding of the timeline associated with various facts. In addition, we evaluate the performance of LLMs for direct temporal fact extraction and get unsatisfactory results. To this end, we introduce TSDRE, a method that incorporates the decomposition capabilities of LLMs into the traditional fine-tuning of smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs). To support the evaluation, we construct ComplexTRED, a complex temporal fact extraction dataset. Our experiments show that TSDRE achieves state-of-the-art results on both HyperRED-Temporal and ComplexTRED datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Li, Zedong Wang, Zicheng Liu, Di Wu, Cheng Tan, Jiangbin Zheng, Yufei Huang, Stan Z. Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Similar to natural language models, pre-trained genome language models are proposed to capture the underlying intricacies within genomes with unsupervised sequence modeling. They have become essential tools for researchers and practitioners in biology. However, the hand-crafted tokenization policies used in these models may not encode the most discriminative patterns from the limited vocabulary of genomic data. In this paper, we introduce VQDNA, a general-purpose framework that renovates genome tokenization from the perspective of genome vocabulary learning. By leveraging vector-quantized codebooks as learnable vocabulary, VQDNA can adaptively tokenize genomes into pattern-aware embeddings in an end-to-end manner. To further push its limits, we propose Hierarchical Residual Quantization (HRQ), where varying scales of codebooks are designed in a hierarchy to enrich the genome vocabulary in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments on 32 genome datasets demonstrate VQDNA's superiority and favorable parameter efficiency compared to existing genome language models. Notably, empirical analysis of SARS-CoV-2 mutations reveals the fine-grained pattern awareness and biological significance of learned HRQ vocabulary, highlighting its untapped potential for broader applications in genomics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amr Keleg, Walid Magdy, Sharon Goldwater</p>
<p>Abstract: On annotating multi-dialect Arabic datasets, it is common to randomly assign the samples across a pool of native Arabic speakers. Recent analyses recommended routing dialectal samples to native speakers of their respective dialects to build higher-quality datasets. However, automatically identifying the dialect of samples is hard. Moreover, the pool of annotators who are native speakers of specific Arabic dialects might be scarce. Arabic Level of Dialectness (ALDi) was recently introduced as a quantitative variable that measures how sentences diverge from Standard Arabic. On randomly assigning samples to annotators, we hypothesize that samples of higher ALDi scores are harder to label especially if they are written in dialects that the annotators do not speak. We test this by analyzing the relation between ALDi scores and the annotators' agreement, on 15 public datasets having raw individual sample annotations for various sentence-classification tasks. We find strong evidence supporting our hypothesis for 11 of them. Consequently, we recommend prioritizing routing samples of high ALDi scores to native speakers of each sample's dialect, for which the dialect could be automatically identified at higher accuracies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihwan Kim, Junoh Kang, Jinyoung Choi, Bohyung Han</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel inference technique based on a pretrained diffusion model for text-conditional video generation. Our approach, called FIFO-Diffusion, is conceptually capable of generating infinitely long videos without additional training. This is achieved by iteratively performing diagonal denoising, which concurrently processes a series of consecutive frames with increasing noise levels in a queue; our method dequeues a fully denoised frame at the head while enqueuing a new random noise frame at the tail. However, diagonal denoising is a double-edged sword as the frames near the tail can take advantage of cleaner ones by forward reference but such a strategy induces the discrepancy between training and inference. Hence, we introduce latent partitioning to reduce the training-inference gap and lookahead denoising to leverage the benefit of forward referencing. Practically, FIFO-Diffusion consumes a constant amount of memory regardless of the target video length given a baseline model, while well-suited for parallel inference on multiple GPUs. We have demonstrated the promising results and effectiveness of the proposed methods on existing text-to-video generation baselines. Generated video samples and source codes are available at our project page.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingjia Yin, Hao Wang, Wei Guo, Yong Liu, Zhi Li, Sirui Zhao, Defu Lian, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to uncover and transfer users' sequential preferences across multiple recommendation domains. While significant endeavors have been made, they primarily concentrated on developing advanced transfer modules and aligning user representations using self-supervised learning techniques. However, the problem of aligning item representations has received limited attention, and misaligned item representations can potentially lead to sub-optimal sequential modeling and user representation alignment. To this end, we propose a model-agnostic framework called \textbf{C}ross-domain item representation \textbf{A}lignment for \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{D}omain \textbf{S}equential \textbf{R}ecommendation (\textbf{CA-CDSR}), which achieves sequence-aware generation and adaptively partial alignment for item representations. Specifically, we first develop a sequence-aware feature augmentation strategy, which captures both collaborative and sequential item correlations, thus facilitating holistic item representation generation. Next, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the partial representation alignment problem from a spectrum perspective. It motivates us to devise an adaptive spectrum filter, achieving partial alignment adaptively. Furthermore, the aligned item representations can be fed into different sequential encoders to obtain user representations. The entire framework is optimized in a multi-task learning paradigm with an annealing strategy. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that CA-CDSR can surpass state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin and can effectively align items in representation spaces to enhance performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Exploring the loss landscape offers insights into the inherent principles of deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent work suggests an additional asymmetry of the valley beyond the flat and sharp ones, yet without thoroughly examining its causes or implications. Our study methodically explores the factors affecting the symmetry of DNN valleys, encompassing (1) the dataset, network architecture, initialization, and hyperparameters that influence the convergence point; and (2) the magnitude and direction of the noise for 1D visualization. Our major observation shows that the {\it degree of sign consistency} between the noise and the convergence point is a critical indicator of valley symmetry. Theoretical insights from the aspects of ReLU activation and softmax function could explain the interesting phenomenon. Our discovery propels novel understanding and applications in the scenario of Model Fusion: (1) the efficacy of interpolating separate models significantly correlates with their sign consistency ratio, and (2) imposing sign alignment during federated learning emerges as an innovative approach for model parameter alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Huang, Yuang Zhang, Liping Wang, Fan Zhang, Xuemin Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Outlier Detection (UOD) is an important data mining task. With the advance of deep learning, deep Outlier Detection (OD) has received broad interest. Most deep UOD models are trained exclusively on clean datasets to learn the distribution of the normal data, which requires huge manual efforts to clean the real-world data if possible. Instead of relying on clean datasets, some approaches directly train and detect on unlabeled contaminated datasets, leading to the need for methods that are robust to such conditions. Ensemble methods emerged as a superior solution to enhance model robustness against contaminated training sets. However, the training time is greatly increased by the ensemble.
  In this study, we investigate the impact of outliers on the training phase, aiming to halt training on unlabeled contaminated datasets before performance degradation. Initially, we noted that blending normal and anomalous data causes AUC fluctuations, a label-dependent measure of detection accuracy. To circumvent the need for labels, we propose a zero-label entropy metric named Loss Entropy for loss distribution, enabling us to infer optimal stopping points for training without labels. Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate negative correlation between entropy metric and the label-based AUC. Based on this, we develop an automated early-stopping algorithm, EntropyStop, which halts training when loss entropy suggests the maximum model detection capability. We conduct extensive experiments on ADBench (including 47 real datasets), and the overall results indicate that AutoEncoder (AE) enhanced by our approach not only achieves better performance than ensemble AEs but also requires under 2\% of training time. Lastly, our proposed metric and early-stopping approach are evaluated on other deep OD models, exhibiting their broad potential applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongseong Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper establishes a mathematical foundation for the Adam optimizer, elucidating its connection to natural gradient descent through Riemannian and information geometry. We rigorously analyze the diagonal empirical Fisher information matrix (FIM) in Adam, clarifying all detailed approximations and advocating for the use of log probability functions as loss, which should be based on discrete distributions, due to the limitations of empirical FIM. Our analysis uncovers flaws in the original Adam algorithm, leading to proposed corrections such as enhanced momentum calculations, adjusted bias corrections, adaptive epsilon, and gradient clipping. We refine the weight decay term based on our theoretical framework. Our modified algorithm, Fisher Adam (FAdam), demonstrates superior performance across diverse domains including LLM, ASR, and VQ-VAE, achieving state-of-the-art results in ASR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Linares-Barranco, Luciano Prono, Robert Lengenstein, Giacomo Indiveri, Charlotte Frenkel</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence, neural network simulations of biological neuron models are being explored to reduce the footprint of learning and inference in resource-constrained task scenarios. A mainstream type of such networks are spiking neural networks (SNNs) based on simplified Integrate and Fire models for which several hardware accelerators have emerged. Among them, the ReckOn chip was introduced as a recurrent SNN allowing for both online training and execution of tasks based on arbitrary sensory modalities, demonstrated for vision, audition, and navigation. As a fully digital and open-source chip, we adapted ReckOn to be implemented on a Xilinx Multiprocessor System on Chip system (MPSoC), facilitating its deployment in embedded systems and increasing the setup flexibility. We present an overview of the system, and a Python framework to use it on a Pynq ZU platform. We validate the architecture and implementation in the new scenario of robotic arm control, and show how the simulated accuracy is preserved with a peak performance of 3.8M events processed per second.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bilgehan Sel, Priya Shanmugasundaram, Mohammad Kachuee, Kun Zhou, Ruoxi Jia, Ming Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in tasks such as summarization, arithmetic reasoning, and question answering. However, they encounter significant challenges in the domain of moral reasoning and ethical decision-making, especially in complex scenarios with multiple stakeholders. This paper introduces the Skin-in-the-Game (SKIG) framework, aimed at enhancing moral reasoning in LLMs by exploring decisions' consequences from multiple stakeholder perspectives. Central to SKIG's mechanism is simulating accountability for actions, which, alongside empathy exercises and risk assessment, is pivotal to its effectiveness. We validate SKIG's performance across various moral reasoning benchmarks with proprietary and opensource LLMs, and investigate its crucial components through extensive ablation analyses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrik Vel\v{c}ick\'y, Jakub Breier, Mladen Kova\v{c}evi\'c, Xiaolu Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Fault injection attacks are a potent threat against embedded implementations of neural network models. Several attack vectors have been proposed, such as misclassification, model extraction, and trojan/backdoor planting. Most of these attacks work by flipping bits in the memory where quantized model parameters are stored.
  In this paper, we introduce an encoding-based protection method against bit-flip attacks on neural networks, titled DeepNcode. We experimentally evaluate our proposal with several publicly available models and datasets, by using state-of-the-art bit-flip attacks: BFA, T-BFA, and TA-LBF. Our results show an increase in protection margin of up to $7.6\times$ for $4-$bit and $12.4\times$ for $8-$bit quantized networks. Memory overheads start at $50\%$ of the original network size, while the time overheads are negligible. Moreover, DeepNcode does not require retraining and does not change the original accuracy of the model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chan-Jan Hsu, Yi-Chang Chen, Feng-Ting Liao, Pei-Chen Ho, Yu-Hsiang Wang, Po-Chun Hsu, Da-shan Shiu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce "Generative Fusion Decoding" (GFD), a novel shallow fusion framework, utilized to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into multi-modal text recognition systems such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and optical character recognition (OCR). We derive the formulas necessary to enable GFD to operate across mismatched token spaces of different models by mapping text token space to byte token space, enabling seamless fusion during the decoding process. The framework is plug-and-play, compatible with various auto-regressive models, and does not require re-training for feature alignment, thus overcoming limitations of previous fusion techniques. We highlight three main advantages of GFD: First, by simplifying the complexity of aligning different model sample spaces, GFD allows LLMs to correct errors in tandem with the recognition model, reducing computation latencies. Second, the in-context learning ability of LLMs is fully capitalized by GFD, increasing robustness in long-form speech recognition and instruction aware speech recognition. Third, GFD enables fusing recognition models deficient in Chinese text recognition with LLMs extensively trained on Chinese. Our evaluation demonstrates that GFD significantly improves performance in ASR and OCR tasks, with ASR reaching state-of-the-art in the NTUML2021 benchmark. GFD provides a significant step forward in model integration, offering a unified solution that could be widely applicable to leveraging existing pre-trained models through step by step fusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Kumar, Sarfaroz Yunusov, Ali Emami</p>
<p>Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) has often neglected subtle biases that, although less apparent, can significantly influence the models' outputs toward particular social narratives. This study addresses two such biases within LLMs: representative bias, which denotes a tendency of LLMs to generate outputs that mirror the experiences of certain identity groups, and affinity bias, reflecting the models' evaluative preferences for specific narratives or viewpoints. We introduce two novel metrics to measure these biases: the Representative Bias Score (RBS) and the Affinity Bias Score (ABS), and present the Creativity-Oriented Generation Suite (CoGS), a collection of open-ended tasks such as short story writing and poetry composition, designed with customized rubrics to detect these subtle biases. Our analysis uncovers marked representative biases in prominent LLMs, with a preference for identities associated with being white, straight, and men. Furthermore, our investigation of affinity bias reveals distinctive evaluative patterns within each model, akin to `bias fingerprints'. This trend is also seen in human evaluators, highlighting a complex interplay between human and machine bias perceptions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxu Wang, Junhao He, Ziyi Zhang, Mingyuan Sun, Jingkai Sun, Renjing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Event cameras offer promising advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, making them well-suited for challenging lighting conditions and fast-moving scenarios. However, reconstructing 3D scenes from raw event streams is difficult because event data is sparse and does not carry absolute color information. To release its potential in 3D reconstruction, we propose the first event-based generalizable 3D reconstruction framework, called EvGGS, which reconstructs scenes as 3D Gaussians from only event input in a feedforward manner and can generalize to unseen cases without any retraining. This framework includes a depth estimation module, an intensity reconstruction module, and a Gaussian regression module. These submodules connect in a cascading manner, and we collaboratively train them with a designed joint loss to make them mutually promote. To facilitate related studies, we build a novel event-based 3D dataset with various material objects and calibrated labels of grayscale images, depth maps, camera poses, and silhouettes. Experiments show models that have jointly trained significantly outperform those trained individually. Our approach performs better than all baselines in reconstruction quality, and depth/intensity predictions with satisfactory rendering speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinuo Wang, Likun Wang, Yuxuan Jiang, Wenjun Zou, Tong Liu, Xujie Song, Wenxuan Wang, Liming Xiao, Jiang Wu, Jingliang Duan, Shengbo Eben Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in addressing complex decision-making and control tasks. However, in most traditional RL algorithms, the policy is typically parameterized as a diagonal Gaussian distribution with learned mean and variance, which constrains their capability to acquire complex policies. In response to this problem, we propose an online RL algorithm termed diffusion actor-critic with entropy regulator (DACER). This algorithm conceptualizes the reverse process of the diffusion model as a novel policy function and leverages the capability of the diffusion model to fit multimodal distributions, thereby enhancing the representational capacity of the policy. Since the distribution of the diffusion policy lacks an analytical expression, its entropy cannot be determined analytically. To mitigate this, we propose a method to estimate the entropy of the diffusion policy utilizing Gaussian mixture model. Building on the estimated entropy, we can learn a parameter $\alpha$ that modulates the degree of exploration and exploitation. Parameter $\alpha$ will be employed to adaptively regulate the variance of the added noise, which is applied to the action output by the diffusion model. Experimental trials on MuJoCo benchmarks and a multimodal task demonstrate that the DACER algorithm achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in most MuJoCo control tasks while exhibiting a stronger representational capacity of the diffusion policy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenzhong Wang, Zehui Lin, Wanyu Lin, Ming Yang, Minggang Zeng, Kay Chen Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Providing explainable molecule property predictions is critical for many scientific domains, such as drug discovery and material science. Though transformer-based language models have shown great potential in accurate molecular property prediction, they neither provide chemically meaningful explanations nor faithfully reveal the molecular structure-property relationships. In this work, we develop a new framework for explainable molecular property prediction based on language models, dubbed as Lamole, which can provide chemical concepts-aligned explanations. We first leverage a designated molecular representation -- the Group SELFIES -- as it can provide chemically meaningful semantics. Because attention mechanisms in Transformers can inherently capture relationships within the input, we further incorporate the attention weights and gradients together to generate explanations for capturing the functional group interactions. We then carefully craft a marginal loss to explicitly optimize the explanations to be able to align with the chemists' annotations. We bridge the manifold hypothesis with the elaborated marginal loss to prove that the loss can align the explanations with the tangent space of the data manifold, leading to concept-aligned explanations. Experimental results over six mutagenicity datasets and one hepatotoxicity dataset demonstrate Lamole can achieve comparable classification accuracy and boost the explanation accuracy by up to 14.8%, being the state-of-the-art in explainable molecular property prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in tasks like the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), showcasing advanced textual common-sense reasoning. However, applying this reasoning to multimodal domains, where understanding text and images together is essential, remains a substantial challenge. To address this, we introduce WinoVis, a novel dataset specifically designed to probe text-to-image models on pronoun disambiguation within multimodal contexts. Utilizing GPT-4 for prompt generation and Diffusion Attentive Attribution Maps (DAAM) for heatmap analysis, we propose a novel evaluation framework that isolates the models' ability in pronoun disambiguation from other visual processing challenges. Evaluation of successive model versions reveals that, despite incremental advancements, Stable Diffusion 2.0 achieves a precision of 56.7% on WinoVis, only marginally surpassing random guessing. Further error analysis identifies important areas for future research aimed at advancing text-to-image models in their ability to interpret and interact with the complex visual world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Kumar, Robert Morabito, Sanzhar Umbet, Jad Kabbara, Ali Emami</p>
<p>Abstract: As the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes more widespread, understanding their self-evaluation of confidence in generated responses becomes increasingly important as it is integral to the reliability of the output of these models. We introduce the concept of Confidence-Probability Alignment, that connects an LLM's internal confidence, quantified by token probabilities, to the confidence conveyed in the model's response when explicitly asked about its certainty. Using various datasets and prompting techniques that encourage model introspection, we probe the alignment between models' internal and expressed confidence. These techniques encompass using structured evaluation scales to rate confidence, including answer options when prompting, and eliciting the model's confidence level for outputs it does not recognize as its own. Notably, among the models analyzed, OpenAI's GPT-4 showed the strongest confidence-probability alignment, with an average Spearman's $\hat{\rho}$ of 0.42, across a wide range of tasks. Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts to facilitate risk assessment in the application of LLMs and to further our understanding of model trustworthiness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wuhao Wang, Zhiyong Chen, Lepeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal difference (TD) learning is a fundamental technique in reinforcement learning that updates value estimates for states or state-action pairs using a TD target. This target represents an improved estimate of the true value by incorporating both immediate rewards and the estimated value of subsequent states. Traditionally, TD learning relies on the value of a single subsequent state. We propose an enhanced multi-state TD (MSTD) target that utilizes the estimated values of multiple subsequent states. Building on this new MSTD concept, we develop complete actor-critic algorithms that include management of replay buffers in two modes, and integrate with deep deterministic policy optimization (DDPG) and soft actor-critic (SAC). Experimental results demonstrate that algorithms employing the MSTD target significantly improve learning performance compared to traditional methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advent of modern data processing has led to an increasing tendency towards interdisciplinarity, which frequently involves the importation of different technical approaches. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a unified data control system to facilitate the integration of varying libraries. This integration is of profound significance in accelerating prototype verification, optimising algorithm performance and minimising maintenance costs. This paper presents a novel functional programming (FP) paradigm based on the Python architecture and associated suites in programming practice, designed for the integration of pipelines of different data mapping operations. In particular, the solution is intended for the integration of scientific computation flows, which affords a robust yet flexible solution for the aforementioned challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Zhou, Yuezhou Ma, Haixu Wu, Haowen Wang, Mingsheng Long</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep models have recently emerged as a promising tool to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. While neural solvers trained from either simulation data or physics-informed loss can solve the PDEs reasonably well, they are mainly restricted to a specific set of PDEs, e.g. a certain equation or a finite set of coefficients. This bottleneck limits the generalizability of neural solvers, which is widely recognized as its major advantage over numerical solvers. In this paper, we present the Universal PDE solver (Unisolver) capable of solving a wide scope of PDEs by leveraging a Transformer pre-trained on diverse data and conditioned on diverse PDEs. Instead of simply scaling up data and parameters, Unisolver stems from the theoretical analysis of the PDE-solving process. Our key finding is that a PDE solution is fundamentally under the control of a series of PDE components, e.g. equation symbols, coefficients, and initial and boundary conditions. Inspired by the mathematical structure of PDEs, we define a complete set of PDE components and correspondingly embed them as domain-wise (e.g. equation symbols) and point-wise (e.g. boundaries) conditions for Transformer PDE solvers. Integrating physical insights with recent Transformer advances, Unisolver achieves consistent state-of-the-art results on three challenging large-scale benchmarks, showing impressive gains and endowing favorable generalizability and scalability.</p>

Computing such subsets is nontrivial as the input space is exponentially large. We propose InversionView, which allows us to practically inspect this subset by sampling from a trained decoder model conditioned on activations. This helps uncover the information content of activation vectors, and facilitates understanding of the algorithms implemented by transformer models. We present three case studies where we investigate models ranging from small transformers to GPT-2. In these studies, we demonstrate the characteristics of our method, show the distinctive advantages it offers, and provide causally verified circuits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangyu Wang, Gengchen Mai, Krzysztof Janowicz, Ni Lao</p>
<p>Abstract: A wide range of (multivariate) temporal (1D) and spatial (2D) data analysis tasks, such as grouping vehicle sensor trajectories, can be formulated as clustering with given metric constraints. Existing metric-constrained clustering algorithms overlook the rich correlation between feature similarity and metric distance, i.e., metric autocorrelation. The model-based variations of these clustering algorithms (e.g. TICC and STICC) achieve SOTA performance, yet suffer from computational instability and complexity by using a metric-constrained Expectation-Maximization procedure. In order to address these two problems, we propose a novel clustering algorithm, MC-GTA (Model-based Clustering via Goodness-of-fit Tests with Autocorrelations). Its objective is only composed of pairwise weighted sums of feature similarity terms (square Wasserstein-2 distance) and metric autocorrelation terms (a novel multivariate generalization of classic semivariogram). We show that MC-GTA is effectively minimizing the total hinge loss for intra-cluster observation pairs not passing goodness-of-fit tests, i.e., statistically not originating from the same distribution. Experiments on 1D/2D synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that MC-GTA successfully incorporates metric autocorrelation. It outperforms strong baselines by large margins (up to 14.3% in ARI and 32.1% in NMI) with faster and stabler optimization (>10x speedup).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Madhavan, Aurghya Maiti, Gaurav Sinha, Siddharth Barman</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a variant of causal contextual bandits where the context is chosen based on an initial intervention chosen by the learner. At the beginning of each round, the learner selects an initial action, depending on which a stochastic context is revealed by the environment. Following this, the learner then selects a final action and receives a reward. Given $T$ rounds of interactions with the environment, the objective of the learner is to learn a policy (of selecting the initial and the final action) with maximum expected reward. In this paper we study the specific situation where every action corresponds to intervening on a node in some known causal graph. We extend prior work from the deterministic context setting to obtain simple regret minimization guarantees. This is achieved through an instance-dependent causal parameter, $\lambda$, which characterizes our upper bound. Furthermore, we prove that our simple regret is essentially tight for a large class of instances. A key feature of our work is that we use convex optimization to address the bandit exploration problem. We also conduct experiments to validate our theoretical results, and release our code at our project GitHub repository: https://github.com/adaptiveContextualCausalBandits/aCCB.</p>

<p>Abstract: Train-time data poisoning attacks threaten machine learning models by introducing adversarial examples during training, leading to misclassification. Current defense methods often reduce generalization performance, are attack-specific, and impose significant training overhead. To address this, we introduce a set of universal data purification methods using a stochastic transform, $\Psi(x)$, realized via iterative Langevin dynamics of Energy-Based Models (EBMs), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), or both. These approaches purify poisoned data with minimal impact on classifier generalization. Our specially trained EBMs and DDPMs provide state-of-the-art defense against various attacks (including Narcissus, Bullseye Polytope, Gradient Matching) on CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet, and CINIC-10, without needing attack or classifier-specific information. We discuss performance trade-offs and show that our methods remain highly effective even with poisoned or distributionally shifted generative model training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S. Mostafa Mousavi, Marc Stogaitis, Tajinder Gadh, Richard M Allen, Alexei Barski, Robert Bosch, Patrick Robertson, Nivetha Thiruverahan, Youngmin Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the ground shaking intensity using social media data and CCTV footage. Employing the Gemini Pro (Reid et al. 2024) model, a multi-modal language model, we demonstrate the ability to extract relevant information from unstructured data utilizing generative AI and natural language processing. The model output, in the form of Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) values, align well with independent observational data. Furthermore, our results suggest that beyond its advanced visual and auditory understanding abilities, Gemini appears to utilize additional sources of knowledge, including a simplified understanding of the general relationship between earthquake magnitude, distance, and MMI intensity, which it presumably acquired during its training, in its reasoning and decision-making processes. These findings raise intriguing questions about the extent of Gemini's general understanding of the physical world and its phenomena. The ability of Gemini to generate results consistent with established scientific knowledge highlights the potential of LLMs like Gemini in augmenting our understanding of complex physical phenomena such as earthquakes. More specifically, the results of this study highlight the potential of LLMs like Gemini to revolutionize citizen seismology by enabling rapid, effective, and flexible analysis of crowdsourced data from eyewitness accounts for assessing earthquake impact and providing crisis situational awareness. This approach holds great promise for improving early warning systems, disaster response, and overall resilience in earthquake-prone regions. This study provides a significant step toward harnessing the power of social media and AI for earthquake disaster mitigation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, or LLaMA have been trending recently, demonstrating considerable advancement and generalizability power in countless domains. However, LLMs create an even bigger black box exacerbating opacity, with interpretability limited to few approaches. The uncertainty and opacity embedded in LLMs' nature restrict their application in high-stakes domains like financial fraud, phishing, etc. Current approaches mainly rely on traditional textual classification with posterior interpretable algorithms, suffering from attackers who may create versatile adversarial samples to break the system's defense, forcing users to make trade-offs between efficiency and robustness. To address this issue, we propose a novel cascading framework called Genshin (General Shield for Natural Language Processing with Large Language Models), utilizing LLMs as defensive one-time plug-ins. Unlike most applications of LLMs that try to transform text into something new or structural, Genshin uses LLMs to recover text to its original state. Genshin aims to combine the generalizability of the LLM, the discrimination of the median model, and the interpretability of the simple model. Our experiments on the task of sentimental analysis and spam detection have shown fatal flaws of the current median models and exhilarating results on LLMs' recovery ability, demonstrating that Genshin is both effective and efficient. In our ablation study, we unearth several intriguing observations. Utilizing the LLM defender, a tool derived from the 4th paradigm, we have reproduced BERT's 15% optimal mask rate results in the 3rd paradigm of NLP. Additionally, when employing the LLM as a potential adversarial tool, attackers are capable of executing effective attacks that are nearly semantically lossless.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Devine</p>
<p>Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) aligns model outputs more closely with human preferences. This involves an evaluator model ranking multiple candidate responses to user prompts. However, the rankings from popular evaluator models such as GPT-4 can be inconsistent. We propose the Repeat Ranking method - where we evaluate the same responses multiple times and train only on those responses which are consistently ranked. Using 2,714 prompts in 62 languages, we generated responses from 7 top multilingual LLMs and had GPT-4 rank them five times each. Evaluating on MT-Bench chat benchmarks in six languages, our method outperformed the standard practice of training on all available prompts. Our work highlights the quality versus quantity trade-off in RLAIF dataset generation and offers a stackable strategy for enhancing dataset and thus model quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Geisler, Arthur Kosmala, Daniel Herbst, Stephan G\"unnemann</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MPGNNs) are widely used for learning on graph-structured data. However, key limitations of l-step MPGNNs are that their "receptive field" is typically limited to the l-hop neighborhood of a node and that information exchange between distant nodes is limited by over-squashing. Motivated by these limitations, we propose Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Networks (S$^2$GNNs) -- a new modeling paradigm for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that synergistically combines spatially and spectrally parametrized graph filters. Parameterizing filters partially in the frequency domain enables global yet efficient information propagation. We show that S$^2$GNNs vanquish over-squashing and yield strictly tighter approximation-theoretic error bounds than MPGNNs. Further, rethinking graph convolutions at a fundamental level unlocks new design spaces. For example, S$^2$GNNs allow for free positional encodings that make them strictly more expressive than the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test. Moreover, to obtain general-purpose S$^2$GNNs, we propose spectrally parametrized filters for directed graphs. S$^2$GNNs outperform spatial MPGNNs, graph transformers, and graph rewirings, e.g., on the peptide long-range benchmark tasks, and are competitive with state-of-the-art sequence modeling. On a 40 GB GPU, S$^2$GNNs scale to millions of nodes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made great strides in recent years to achieve unprecedented performance across different tasks. However, due to commercial interest, the most competitive models like GPT, Gemini, and Claude have been gated behind proprietary interfaces without disclosing the training details. Recently, many institutions have open-sourced several strong LLMs like LLaMA-3, comparable to existing closed-source LLMs. However, only the model's weights are provided with most details (e.g., intermediate checkpoints, pre-training corpus, and training code, etc.) being undisclosed. To improve the transparency of LLMs, the research community has formed to open-source truly open LLMs (e.g., Pythia, Amber, OLMo), where more details (e.g., pre-training corpus and training code) are being provided. These models have greatly advanced the scientific study of these large models including their strengths, weaknesses, biases and risks. However, we observe that the existing truly open LLMs on reasoning, knowledge, and coding tasks are still inferior to existing state-of-the-art LLMs with similar model sizes. To this end, we open-source MAP-Neo, a highly capable and transparent bilingual language model with 7B parameters trained from scratch on 4.5T high-quality tokens. Our MAP-Neo is the first fully open-sourced bilingual LLM with comparable performance compared to existing state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, we open-source all details to reproduce our MAP-Neo, where the cleaned pre-training corpus, data cleaning pipeline, checkpoints, and well-optimized training/evaluation framework are provided. Finally, we hope our MAP-Neo will enhance and strengthen the open research community and inspire more innovations and creativities to facilitate the further improvements of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omead Pooladzandi, Jeffrey Jiang, Sunay Bhat, Gregory Pottie</p>
<p>Abstract: Data poisoning attacks pose a significant threat to the integrity of machine learning models by leading to misclassification of target distribution data by injecting adversarial examples during training. Existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) defense methods suffer from limitations, such as significantly reduced generalization performance and significant overhead during training, making them impractical or limited for real-world applications. In response to this challenge, we introduce a universal data purification method that defends naturally trained classifiers from malicious white-, gray-, and black-box image poisons by applying a universal stochastic preprocessing step $\Psi_{T}(x)$, realized by iterative Langevin sampling of a convergent Energy Based Model (EBM) initialized with an image $x.$ Mid-run dynamics of $\Psi_{T}(x)$ purify poison information with minimal impact on features important to the generalization of a classifier network. We show that EBMs remain universal purifiers, even in the presence of poisoned EBM training data, and achieve SoTA defense on leading triggered and triggerless poisons. This work is a subset of a larger framework introduced in \pgen with a more detailed focus on EBM purification and poison defense.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masatoshi Uehara, Yulai Zhao, Ehsan Hajiramezanali, Gabriele Scalia, G\"okcen Eraslan, Avantika Lal, Sergey Levine, Tommaso Biancalani</p>
<p>Abstract: AI-driven design problems, such as DNA/protein sequence design, are commonly tackled from two angles: generative modeling, which efficiently captures the feasible design space (e.g., natural images or biological sequences), and model-based optimization, which utilizes reward models for extrapolation. To combine the strengths of both approaches, we adopt a hybrid method that fine-tunes cutting-edge diffusion models by optimizing reward models through RL. Although prior work has explored similar avenues, they primarily focus on scenarios where accurate reward models are accessible. In contrast, we concentrate on an offline setting where a reward model is unknown, and we must learn from static offline datasets, a common scenario in scientific domains. In offline scenarios, existing approaches tend to suffer from overoptimization, as they may be misled by the reward model in out-of-distribution regions. To address this, we introduce a conservative fine-tuning approach, BRAID, by optimizing a conservative reward model, which includes additional penalization outside of offline data distributions. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to outperform the best designs in offline data, leveraging the extrapolation capabilities of reward models while avoiding the generation of invalid designs through pre-trained diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Chen, Zhendong Wang, Mingyuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) leverages pre-collected datasets to train optimal policies. Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL), introducing diffusion models as a powerful and expressive policy class, significantly boosts the performance of offline RL. However, its reliance on iterative denoising sampling to generate actions slows down both training and inference. While several recent attempts have tried to accelerate diffusion-QL, the improvement in training and/or inference speed often results in degraded performance. In this paper, we introduce a dual policy approach, Diffusion Trusted Q-Learning (DTQL), which comprises a diffusion policy for pure behavior cloning and a practical one-step policy. We bridge the two polices by a newly introduced diffusion trust region loss. The diffusion policy maintains expressiveness, while the trust region loss directs the one-step policy to explore freely and seek modes within the region defined by the diffusion policy. DTQL eliminates the need for iterative denoising sampling during both training and inference, making it remarkably computationally efficient. We evaluate its effectiveness and algorithmic characteristics against popular Kullback-Leibler (KL) based distillation methods in 2D bandit scenarios and gym tasks. We then show that DTQL could not only outperform other methods on the majority of the D4RL benchmark tasks but also demonstrate efficiency in training and inference speeds.

<p>Abstract: Gender bias in machine translation (MT) sys- tems poses a significant challenge to achieving accurate and inclusive translations. This paper examines gender bias in machine translation systems for languages such as Telugu and Kan- nada from the Dravidian family, analyzing how gender inflections affect translation accuracy and neutrality using Google Translate and Chat- GPT. It finds that while plural forms can reduce bias, individual-centric sentences often main- tain the bias due to historical stereotypes. The study evaluates the Chain of Thought process- ing, noting significant bias mitigation from 80% to 4% in Telugu and from 40% to 0% in Kan- nada. It also compares Telugu and Kannada translations, emphasizing the need for language specific strategies to address these challenges and suggesting directions for future research to enhance fairness in both data preparation and prompts during inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeiyoon Park, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: With the recent introduction of Assistants API, it is expected that document-based language models will be actively used in various domains, especially Role-playing. However, a key challenge lies in utilizing protagonist's persona: Assistants API often fails to achieve with its search because the information extraction part is different each time and it often omits important information such as protagonist's backstory or relationships. It is hard to maintain a consistent persona simply by using the persona document as input to the Assistants API. To address the challenge of achieving stable persona consistency, we propose CharacterGPT, a novel persona reconstruction framework to alleviate the shortcomings of the Assistants API. Our method involves Character Persona Training (CPT), an effective persona rebuilding process that updates the character persona by extracting the character's traits from given summary of the novel for each character as if the story in a novel progresses. In our experiments, we ask each character to take the Big Five Inventory personality test in various settings and analyze the results. To assess whether it can think outside the box, we let each character generate short novels. Extensive experiments and human evaluation demonstrate that CharacterGPT presents new possibilities for role-playing agent research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tenglong Liu, Yang Li, Yixing Lan, Hao Gao, Wei Pan, Xin Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD) is pronounced. To address this, existing methods often constrain the learned policy through policy regularization. However, these methods often suffer from the issue of unnecessary conservativeness, hampering policy improvement. This occurs due to the indiscriminate use of all actions from the behavior policy that generates the offline dataset as constraints. The problem becomes particularly noticeable when the quality of the dataset is suboptimal. Thus, we propose Adaptive Advantage-guided Policy Regularization (A2PR), obtaining high-advantage actions from an augmented behavior policy combined with VAE to guide the learned policy. A2PR can select high-advantage actions that differ from those present in the dataset, while still effectively maintaining conservatism from OOD actions. This is achieved by harnessing the VAE capacity to generate samples matching the distribution of the data points. We theoretically prove that the improvement of the behavior policy is guaranteed. Besides, it effectively mitigates value overestimation with a bounded performance gap. Empirically, we conduct a series of experiments on the D4RL benchmark, where A2PR demonstrates state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, experimental results on additional suboptimal mixed datasets reveal that A2PR exhibits superior performance. Code is available at https://github.com/ltlhuuu/A2PR.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19996">DP-IQA: Utilizing Diffusion Prior for Blind Image Quality Assessment in the Wild</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Honghao Fu, Yufei Wang, Wenhan Yang, Bihan Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) plays a critical role in selecting high-quality images and guiding compression and enhancement methods in a series of applications. The blind IQA, which assesses the quality of in-the-wild images containing complex authentic distortions without reference images, poses greater challenges. Existing methods are limited to modeling a uniform distribution with local patches and are bothered by the gap between low and high-level visions (caused by widely adopted pre-trained classification networks). In this paper, we propose a novel IQA method called diffusion priors-based IQA (DP-IQA), which leverages the prior knowledge from the pre-trained diffusion model with its excellent powers to bridge semantic gaps in the perception of the visual quality of images. Specifically, we use pre-trained stable diffusion as the backbone, extract multi-level features from the denoising U-Net during the upsampling process at a specified timestep, and decode them to estimate the image quality score. The text and image adapters are adopted to mitigate the domain gap for downstream tasks and correct the information loss caused by the variational autoencoder bottleneck. Finally, we distill the knowledge in the above model into a CNN-based student model, significantly reducing the parameter to enhance applicability, with the student model performing similarly or even better than the teacher model surprisingly. Experimental results demonstrate that our DP-IQA achieves state-of-the-art results on various in-the-wild datasets with better generalization capability, which shows the superiority of our method in global modeling and utilizing the hierarchical feature clues of diffusion for evaluating image quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niki van Stein, Thomas B\"ack</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have demonstrated their ability to understand natural language and generate complex code snippets. This paper introduces a novel Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework, leveraging GPT models for the automated generation and refinement of algorithms. Given a set of criteria and a task definition (the search space), LLaMEA iteratively generates, mutates and selects algorithms based on performance metrics and feedback from runtime evaluations. This framework offers a unique approach to generating optimized algorithms without requiring extensive prior expertise. We show how this framework can be used to generate novel black-box metaheuristic optimization algorithms automatically. LLaMEA generates multiple algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art optimization algorithms (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy and Differential Evolution) on the five dimensional black box optimization benchmark (BBOB). The algorithms also show competitive performance on the 10- and 20-dimensional instances of the test functions, although they have not seen such instances during the automated generation process. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the framework and identify future directions for automated generation and optimization of algorithms via LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present MOFA-Video, an advanced controllable image animation method that generates video from the given image using various additional controllable signals (such as human landmarks reference, manual trajectories, and another even provided video) or their combinations. This is different from previous methods which only can work on a specific motion domain or show weak control abilities with diffusion prior. To achieve our goal, we design several domain-aware motion field adapters (\ie, MOFA-Adapters) to control the generated motions in the video generation pipeline. For MOFA-Adapters, we consider the temporal motion consistency of the video and generate the dense motion flow from the given sparse control conditions first, and then, the multi-scale features of the given image are wrapped as a guided feature for stable video diffusion generation. We naively train two motion adapters for the manual trajectories and the human landmarks individually since they both contain sparse information about the control. After training, the MOFA-Adapters in different domains can also work together for more controllable video generation. Project Page: https://myniuuu.github.io/MOFA_Video/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ciro Beneduce, Bruno Lepri, Massimiliano Luca</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting the locations an individual will visit in the future is crucial for solving many societal issues like disease diffusion and reduction of pollution among many others. The models designed to tackle next-location prediction, however, require a significant amount of individual-level information to be trained effectively. Such data may be scarce or even unavailable in some geographic regions or peculiar scenarios (e.g., cold-start in recommendation systems). Moreover, the design of a next-location predictor able to generalize or geographically transfer knowledge is still an open research challenge. Recent advances in natural language processing have led to a rapid diffusion of Large Language Models (LLMs) which have shown good generalization and reasoning capabilities. These insights, coupled with the recent findings that LLMs are rich in geographical knowledge, allowed us to believe that these models can act as zero-shot next-location predictors. This paper evaluates the capabilities of many popular LLMs in this role, specifically Llama, GPT-3.5 and Mistral 7B. After designing a proper prompt, we tested the models on three real-world mobility datasets. The results show that LLMs can obtain accuracies up to 32.4%, a significant relative improvement of over 600% when compared to sophisticated DL models specifically designed for human mobility. Moreover, we show that other LLMs are unable to perform the task properly. To prevent positively biased results, we also propose a framework inspired by other studies to test data contamination. Finally, we explored the possibility of using LLMs as text-based explainers for next-location prediction showing that can effectively provide an explanation for their decision. Notably, 7B models provide more generic, but still reliable, explanations compared to larger counterparts. Code: github.com/ssai-trento/LLM-zero-shot-NL</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiesong Lian, Yucong Huang, Mingzhi Wang, Chengdong Ma, Yixue Hao, Ying Wen, Yaodong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: A popular approach for solving zero-sum games is to maintain populations of policies to approximate the Nash Equilibrium (NE). Previous studies have shown that Policy Space Response Oracle (PSRO) algorithm is an effective multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for solving such games. However, repeatedly training new policies from scratch to approximate Best Response (BR) to opponents' mixed policies at each iteration is both inefficient and costly. While some PSRO variants initialize a new policy by inheriting from past BR policies, this approach limits the exploration of new policies, especially against challenging opponents. To address this issue, we propose Fusion-PSRO, which employs policy fusion to initialize policies for better approximation to BR. By selecting high-quality base policies from meta-NE, policy fusion fuses the base policies into a new policy through model averaging. This approach allows the initialized policies to incorporate multiple expert policies, making it easier to handle difficult opponents compared to inheriting from past BR policies or initializing from scratch. Moreover, our method only modifies the policy initialization phase, allowing its application to nearly all PSRO variants without additional training overhead. Our experiments on non-transitive matrix games, Leduc Poker, and the more complex Liars Dice demonstrate that Fusion-PSRO enhances the performance of nearly all PSRO variants, achieving lower exploitability.</p>
