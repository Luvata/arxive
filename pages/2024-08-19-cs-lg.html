<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirreza Ahmadnejad, Somayyeh Koohi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations in Optical Neural Networks (ONNs) related to training efficiency, nonlinear function implementation, and large input data processing. We introduce Two-Pass Forward Propagation, a novel training method that avoids specific nonlinear activation functions by modulating and re-entering error with random noise. Additionally, we propose a new way to implement convolutional neural networks using simple neural networks in integrated optical systems. Theoretical foundations and numerical results demonstrate significant improvements in training speed, energy efficiency, and scalability, advancing the potential of optical computing for complex data tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoqin Yang, Jiansong Zhang, Xiaoling Luo, Zheng Lu, Linlin Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: The multilayer perceptron (MLP), a fundamental paradigm in current artificial intelligence, is widely applied in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, the recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), based on nonlinear additive connections, has been proven to achieve performance comparable to MLPs with significantly fewer parameters. Despite this potential, the use of a single activation function space results in reduced performance of KAN and related works across different tasks. To address this issue, we propose an activation space Selectable KAN (S-KAN). S-KAN employs an adaptive strategy to choose the possible activation mode for data at each feedforward KAN node. Our approach outperforms baseline methods in seven representative function fitting tasks and significantly surpasses MLP methods with the same level of parameters. Furthermore, we extend the structure of S-KAN and propose an activation space selectable Convolutional KAN (S-ConvKAN), which achieves leading results on four general image classification datasets. Our method mitigates the performance variability of the original KAN across different tasks and demonstrates through extensive experiments that feedforward KANs with selectable activations can achieve or even exceed the performance of MLP-based methods. This work contributes to the understanding of the data-centric design of new AI paradigms and provides a foundational reference for innovations in KAN-based network architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Varlamov, Daria Diatlova, Egor Spirin</p>
<p>Abstract: Improvements in diffusion models have boosted the quality of image generation, which has led researchers, companies, and creators to focus on improving watermarking algorithms. This provision would make it possible to clearly identify the creators of generative art. The main challenges that modern watermarking algorithms face have to do with their ability to withstand attacks and encrypt many unique messages, such as user IDs. In this paper, we present METR: Message Enhanced Tree-Ring, which is an approach that aims to address these challenges. METR is built on the Tree-Ring watermarking algorithm, a technique that makes it possible to encode multiple distinct messages without compromising attack resilience or image quality. This ensures the suitability of this watermarking algorithm for any Diffusion Model. In order to surpass the limitations on the quantity of encoded messages, we propose METR++, an enhanced version of METR. This approach, while limited to the Latent Diffusion Model architecture, is designed to inject a virtually unlimited number of unique messages. We demonstrate its robustness to attacks and ability to encrypt many unique messages while preserving image quality, which makes METR and METR++ hold great potential for practical applications in real-world settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijie Xia, Gao Peng, Chenguang Wang, Peter Palensky, Eric Pauwels, Pedro P. Vergara</p>
<p>Abstract: Electricity Consumption Profiles (ECPs) are crucial for operating and planning power distribution systems, especially with the increasing numbers of various low-carbon technologies such as solar panels and electric vehicles. Traditional ECP modeling methods typically assume the availability of sufficient ECP data. However, in practice, the accessibility of ECP data is limited due to privacy issues or the absence of metering devices. Few-shot learning (FSL) has emerged as a promising solution for ECP modeling in data-scarce scenarios. Nevertheless, standard FSL methods, such as those used for images, are unsuitable for ECP modeling because (1) these methods usually assume several source domains with sufficient data and several target domains. However, in the context of ECP modeling, there may be thousands of source domains with a moderate amount of data and thousands of target domains. (2) Standard FSL methods usually involve cumbersome knowledge transfer mechanisms, such as pre-training and fine-tuning, whereas ECP modeling requires more lightweight methods. (3) Deep learning models often lack explainability, hindering their application in industry. This paper proposes a novel FSL method that exploits Transformers and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for ECP modeling to address the above-described issues. Results show that our method can accurately restore the complex ECP distribution with a minimal amount of ECP data (e.g., only 1.6\% of the complete domain dataset) while it outperforms state-of-the-art time series modeling methods, maintaining the advantages of being both lightweight and interpretable.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joon Kim, Sejin Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning(FL), in theory, preserves privacy of individual clients' data while producing quality machine learning models. However, attacks such as Deep Leakage from Gradients(DLG) severely question the practicality of FL. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the efficacy of four defensive methods against DLG: Masking, Clipping, Pruning, and Noising. Masking, while only previously studied as a way to compress information during parameter transfer, shows surprisingly robust defensive utility when compared to the other three established methods. Our experimentation is two-fold. We first evaluate the minimum hyperparameter threshold for each method across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and lfw datasets. Then, we train FL clients with each method and their minimum threshold values to investigate the trade-off between DLG defense and training performance. Results reveal that Masking and Clipping show near to none degradation in performance while obfuscating enough information to effectively defend against DLG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael Rafailov, Kyle Hatch, Anikait Singh, Laura Smith, Aviral Kumar, Ilya Kostrikov, Philippe Hansen-Estruch, Victor Kolev, Philip Ball, Jiajun Wu, Chelsea Finn, Sergey Levine</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning algorithms hold the promise of enabling data-driven RL methods that do not require costly or dangerous real-world exploration and benefit from large pre-collected datasets. This in turn can facilitate real-world applications, as well as a more standardized approach to RL research. Furthermore, offline RL methods can provide effective initializations for online finetuning to overcome challenges with exploration. However, evaluating progress on offline RL algorithms requires effective and challenging benchmarks that capture properties of real-world tasks, provide a range of task difficulties, and cover a range of challenges both in terms of the parameters of the domain (e.g., length of the horizon, sparsity of rewards) and the parameters of the data (e.g., narrow demonstration data or broad exploratory data). While considerable progress in offline RL in recent years has been enabled by simpler benchmark tasks, the most widely used datasets are increasingly saturating in performance and may fail to reflect properties of realistic tasks. We propose a new benchmark for offline RL that focuses on realistic simulations of robotic manipulation and locomotion environments, based on models of real-world robotic systems, and comprising a variety of data sources, including scripted data, play-style data collected by human teleoperators, and other data sources. Our proposed benchmark covers state-based and image-based domains, and supports both offline RL and online fine-tuning evaluation, with some of the tasks specifically designed to require both pre-training and fine-tuning. We hope that our proposed benchmark will facilitate further progress on both offline RL and fine-tuning algorithms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Lee, Samuel Liebana Garcia, Claudia Clopath, Will Dabney</p>
<p>Abstract: Navigating multiple tasks$\unicode{x2014}$for instance in succession as in continual or lifelong learning, or in distributions as in meta or multi-task learning$\unicode{x2014}$requires some notion of adaptation. Evolution over timescales of millennia has imbued humans and other animals with highly effective adaptive learning and decision-making strategies. Central to these functions are so-called neuromodulatory systems. In this work we introduce an abstract framework for integrating theories and evidence from neuroscience and the cognitive sciences into the design of adaptive artificial reinforcement learning algorithms. We give a concrete instance of this framework built on literature surrounding the neuromodulators Acetylcholine (ACh) and Noradrenaline (NA), and empirically validate the effectiveness of the resulting adaptive algorithm in a non-stationary multi-armed bandit problem. We conclude with a theory-based experiment proposal providing an avenue to link our framework back to efforts in experimental neuroscience.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08448">Exploring Cross-model Neuronal Correlations in the Context of Predicting Model Performance and Generalizability</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie, Lionel Levine, Majid Sarrafzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are increasingly integrated into critical systems, the need for a robust framework to establish the trustworthiness of AI is increasingly paramount. While collaborative efforts have established conceptual foundations for such a framework, there remains a significant gap in developing concrete, technically robust methods for assessing AI model quality and performance. A critical drawback in the traditional methods for assessing the validity and generalizability of models is their dependence on internal developer datasets, rendering it challenging to independently assess and verify their performance claims. This paper introduces a novel approach for assessing a newly trained model's performance based on another known model by calculating correlation between neural networks. The proposed method evaluates correlations by determining if, for each neuron in one network, there exists a neuron in the other network that produces similar output. This approach has implications for memory efficiency, allowing for the use of smaller networks when high correlation exists between networks of different sizes. Additionally, the method provides insights into robustness, suggesting that if two highly correlated networks are compared and one demonstrates robustness when operating in production environments, the other is likely to exhibit similar robustness. This contribution advances the technical toolkit for responsible AI, supporting more comprehensive and nuanced evaluations of AI models to ensure their safe and effective deployment.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08470">Context-Aware Assistant Selection for Improved Inference Acceleration with Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerry Huang, Prasanna Parthasarathi, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Sarath Chandar</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their widespread adoption, large language models (LLMs) remain prohibitive to use under resource constraints, with their ever growing sizes only increasing the barrier for use. One noted issue is the high latency associated with auto-regressive generation, rendering large LLMs use dependent on advanced computing infrastructure. Assisted decoding, where a smaller draft model guides a larger target model's generation, has helped alleviate this, but remains dependent on alignment between the two models. Thus if the draft model is insufficiently capable on some domain relative to the target model, performance can degrade. Alternatively, one can leverage multiple draft models to better cover the expertise of the target, but when multiple black-box draft models are available, selecting an assistant without details about its construction can be difficult. To better understand this decision making problem, we observe it as a contextual bandit, where a policy must choose a draft model based on a context. We show that even without prior knowledge of the draft models, creating an offline dataset from only outputs of independent draft/target models and training a policy over the alignment of these outputs can accelerate performance on multiple domains provided the candidates are effective. Further results show this to hold on various settings with multiple assisted decoding candidates, highlighting its flexibility and the advantageous role that such decision making can play.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08488">Adversarial Contrastive Learning Based Physics-Informed Temporal Networks for Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Wang, Mengshi Qi, Yingxia Shao, Anfu Zhou, Huadong Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series data mining is immensely important in extensive applications, such as traffic, medical, and e-commerce. In this paper, we focus on medical temporal variation modeling, \emph{i.e.,} cuffless blood pressure (BP) monitoring which has great value in cardiovascular healthcare. Although providing a comfortable user experience, such methods are suffering from the demand for a significant amount of realistic data to train an individual model for each subject, especially considering the invasive or obtrusive BP ground-truth measurements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel physics-informed temporal network~(PITN) with adversarial contrastive learning to enable precise BP estimation with very limited data. Specifically, we first enhance the physics-informed neural network~(PINN) with the temporal block for investigating BP dynamics' multi-periodicity for personal cardiovascular cycle modeling and temporal variation. We then employ adversarial training to generate extra physiological time series data, improving PITN's robustness in the face of sparse subject-specific training data. Furthermore, we utilize contrastive learning to capture the discriminative variations of cardiovascular physiologic phenomena. This approach aggregates physiological signals with similar blood pressure values in latent space while separating clusters of samples with dissimilar blood pressure values. Experiments on three widely-adopted datasets with different modailties (\emph{i.e.,} bioimpedance, PPG, millimeter-wave) demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed methods over previous state-of-the-art approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Liu, Mingyuan Li, Xu Wang, Guangsheng Yu, Wei Ni, Lixiang Li, Haipeng Peng, Renping Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlearning in various learning frameworks remains challenging, with the continuous growth and updates of models exhibiting complex inheritance relationships. This paper presents a novel unlearning framework, which enables fully parallel unlearning among models exhibiting inheritance. A key enabler is the new Unified Model Inheritance Graph (UMIG), which captures the inheritance using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).Central to our framework is the new Fisher Inheritance Unlearning (FIUn) algorithm, which utilizes the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) from initial unlearning models to pinpoint impacted parameters in inherited models. By employing FIM, the FIUn method breaks the sequential dependencies among the models, facilitating simultaneous unlearning and reducing computational overhead. We further design to merge disparate FIMs into a single matrix, synchronizing updates across inherited models. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of our unlearning framework. For single-class tasks, it achieves complete unlearning with 0\% accuracy for unlearned labels while maintaining 94.53\% accuracy for retained labels on average. For multi-class tasks, the accuracy is 1.07\% for unlearned labels and 84.77\% for retained labels on average. Our framework accelerates unlearning by 99\% compared to alternative methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study stochastic optimization in the context of performative shifts, where the data distribution changes in response to the deployed model. We demonstrate that naive retraining can be provably suboptimal even for simple distribution shifts. The issue worsens when models are retrained given a finite number of samples at each retraining step. We show that adding regularization to retraining corrects both of these issues, attaining provably optimal models in the face of distribution shifts. Our work advocates rethinking how machine learning models are retrained in the presence of performative effects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fang He, Jinhai Deng, Ruizhan Xue, Maojun Wang, Zeyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are also up against fairness issues from source data and typical aggregation method. In this paper, we are pioneering to make the investigation of fairness in SGNNs expanded from GNNs. We identify the issue of degree bias within signed graphs, offering a new perspective on the fairness issues related to SGNNs. To handle the confronted bias issue, inspired by previous work on degree bias, a new Model-Agnostic method is consequently proposed to enhance representation of nodes with different degrees, which named as Degree Debiased Signed Graph Neural Network (DD-SGNN) . More specifically, in each layer, we make a transfer from nodes with high degree to nodes with low degree inside a head-to-tail triplet, which to supplement the underlying domain missing structure of the tail nodes and meanwhile maintain the positive and negative semantics specified by balance theory in signed graphs. We make extensive experiments on four real-world datasets. The result verifies the validity of the model, that is, our model mitigates the degree bias issue without compromising performance($\textit{i.e.}$, AUC, F1).

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08526">Inverse design with conditional cascaded diffusion models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Milad Habibi, Mark Fuge</p>
<p>Abstract: Adjoint-based design optimizations are usually computationally expensive and those costs scale with resolution. To address this, researchers have proposed machine learning approaches for inverse design that can predict higher-resolution solutions from lower cost/resolution ones. Due to the recent success of diffusion models over traditional generative models, we extend the use of diffusion models for multi-resolution tasks by proposing the conditional cascaded diffusion model (cCDM). Compared to GANs, cCDM is more stable to train, and each diffusion model within the cCDM can be trained independently, thus each model's parameters can be tuned separately to maximize the performance of the pipeline. Our study compares cCDM against a cGAN model with transfer learning.
  Our results demonstrate that the cCDM excels in capturing finer details, preserving volume fraction constraints, and minimizing compliance errors in multi-resolution tasks when a sufficient amount of high-resolution training data (more than 102 designs) is available. Furthermore, we explore the impact of training data size on the performance of both models. While both models show decreased performance with reduced high-resolution training data, the cCDM loses its superiority to the cGAN model with transfer learning when training data is limited (less than 102), and we show the break-even point for this transition. Also, we highlight that while the diffusion model may achieve better pixel-wise performance in both low-resolution and high-resolution scenarios, this does not necessarily guarantee that the model produces optimal compliance error or constraint satisfaction.</p>

<p>Abstract: This full paper in the research track evaluates the usage of data logged from cybersecurity exercises in order to predict students who are potentially at risk of performing poorly. Hands-on exercises are essential for learning since they enable students to practice their skills. In cybersecurity, hands-on exercises are often complex and require knowledge of many topics. Therefore, students may miss solutions due to gaps in their knowledge and become frustrated, which impedes their learning. Targeted aid by the instructor helps, but since the instructor's time is limited, efficient ways to detect struggling students are needed. This paper develops automated tools to predict when a student is having difficulty. We formed a dataset with the actions of 313 students from two countries and two learning environments: KYPO CRP and EDURange. These data are used in machine learning algorithms to predict the success of students in exercises deployed in these environments. After extracting features from the data, we trained and cross-validated eight classifiers for predicting the exercise outcome and evaluated their predictive power. The contribution of this paper is comparing two approaches to feature engineering, modeling, and classification performance on data from two learning environments. Using the features from either learning environment, we were able to detect and distinguish between successful and struggling students. A decision tree classifier achieved the highest balanced accuracy and sensitivity with data from both learning environments. The results show that activity data from cybersecurity exercises are suitable for predicting student success. In a potential application, such models can aid instructors in detecting struggling students and providing targeted help. We publish data and code for building these models so that others can adopt or adapt them.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. However, their practical application is constrained by substantial memory and computational demands. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is considered an effective method to accelerate LLM inference. Despite its growing popularity in LLM model compression, PTQ deployment faces two major challenges. First, low-bit quantization leads to performance degradation. Second, restricted by the limited integer computing unit type on GPUs, quantized matrix operations with different precisions cannot be effectively accelerated. To address these issues, we introduce a novel arbitrary-bit quantization algorithm and inference framework, ABQ-LLM. It achieves superior performance across various quantization settings and enables efficient arbitrary-precision quantized inference on the GPU. ABQ-LLM introduces several key innovations: (1) a distribution correction method for transformer blocks to mitigate distribution differences caused by full quantization of weights and activations, improving performance at low bit-widths. (2) the bit balance strategy to counteract performance degradation from asymmetric distribution issues at very low bit-widths (e.g., 2-bit). (3) an innovative quantization acceleration framework that reconstructs the quantization matrix multiplication of arbitrary precision combinations based on BTC (Binary TensorCore) equivalents, gets rid of the limitations of INT4/INT8 computing units. ABQ-LLM can convert each component bit width gain into actual acceleration gain, maximizing performance under mixed precision(e.g., W6A6, W2A8). Based on W2*A8 quantization configuration on LLaMA-7B model, it achieved a WikiText2 perplexity of 7.59 (2.17$\downarrow $ vs 9.76 in AffineQuant). Compared to SmoothQuant, we realized 1.6$\times$ acceleration improvement and 2.7$\times$ memory compression gain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xue Wang, Tian Zhou, Jianqing Zhu, Jialin Liu, Kun Yuan, Tao Yao, Wotao Yin, Rong Jin, HanQin Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention based models have achieved many remarkable breakthroughs in numerous applications. However, the quadratic complexity of Attention makes the vanilla Attention based models hard to apply to long sequence tasks. Various improved Attention structures are proposed to reduce the computation cost by inducing low rankness and approximating the whole sequence by sub-sequences. The most challenging part of those approaches is maintaining the proper balance between information preservation and computation reduction: the longer sub-sequences used, the better information is preserved, but at the price of introducing more noise and computational costs. In this paper, we propose a smoothed skeleton sketching based Attention structure, coined S$^3$Attention, which significantly improves upon the previous attempts to negotiate this trade-off. S$^3$Attention has two mechanisms to effectively minimize the impact of noise while keeping the linear complexity to the sequence length: a smoothing block to mix information over long sequences and a matrix sketching method that simultaneously selects columns and rows from the input matrix. We verify the effectiveness of S$^3$Attention both theoretically and empirically. Extensive studies over Long Range Arena (LRA) datasets and six time-series forecasting show that S$^3$Attention significantly outperforms both vanilla Attention and other state-of-the-art variants of Attention structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gongpei Zhao, Tao Wang, Yi Jin, Congyan Lang, Yidong Li, Haibin Ling</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing spectral convolutional networks is a formidable task in graph learning. In traditional spectral graph neural networks (GNNs), polynomial-based methods are commonly used to design filters via the Laplacian matrix. In practical applications, however, these polynomial methods encounter inherent limitations, which primarily arise from the the low-order truncation of polynomial filters and the lack of overall modeling of the graph spectrum. This leads to poor performance of existing spectral approaches on real-world graph data, especially when the spectrum is highly concentrated or contains many numerically identical values, as they tend to apply the exact same modulation to signals with the same frequencies. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we propose Graph State Space Network (GrassNet), a novel graph neural network with theoretical support that provides a simple yet effective scheme for designing and learning arbitrary graph spectral filters. In particular, our GrassNet introduces structured state space models (SSMs) to model the correlations of graph signals at different frequencies and derives a unique rectification for each frequency in the graph spectrum. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to employ SSMs for the design of GNN spectral filters, and it theoretically offers greater expressive power compared with polynomial filters. Extensive experiments on nine public benchmarks reveal that GrassNet achieves superior performance in real-world graph modeling tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiucheng Wang, Keda Tao, Nan Cheng, Zhisheng Yin, Zan Li, Yuan Zhang, Xuemin Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Radio map (RM) is a promising technology that can obtain pathloss based on only location, which is significant for 6G network applications to reduce the communication costs for pathloss estimation. However, the construction of RM in traditional is either computationally intensive or depends on costly sampling-based pathloss measurements. Although the neural network (NN)-based method can efficiently construct the RM without sampling, its performance is still suboptimal. This is primarily due to the misalignment between the generative characteristics of the RM construction problem and the discrimination modeling exploited by existing NN-based methods. Thus, to enhance RM construction performance, in this paper, the sampling-free RM construction is modeled as a conditional generative problem, where a denoised diffusion-based method, named RadioDiff, is proposed to achieve high-quality RM construction. In addition, to enhance the diffusion model's capability of extracting features from dynamic environments, an attention U-Net with an adaptive fast Fourier transform module is employed as the backbone network to improve the dynamic environmental features extracting capability. Meanwhile, the decoupled diffusion model is utilized to further enhance the construction performance of RMs. Moreover, a comprehensive theoretical analysis of why the RM construction is a generative problem is provided for the first time, from both perspectives of data features and NN training methods. Experimental results show that the proposed RadioDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in all three metrics of accuracy, structural similarity, and peak signal-to-noise ratio.

<p>Abstract: Decentralized optimization has become a standard paradigm for solving large-scale decision-making problems and training large machine learning models without centralizing data. However, this paradigm introduces new privacy and security risks, with malicious agents potentially able to infer private data or impair the model accuracy. Over the past decade, significant advancements have been made in developing secure decentralized optimization and learning frameworks and algorithms. This survey provides a comprehensive tutorial on these advancements. We begin with the fundamentals of decentralized optimization and learning, highlighting centralized aggregation and distributed consensus as key modules exposed to security risks in federated and distributed optimization, respectively. Next, we focus on privacy-preserving algorithms, detailing three cryptographic tools and their integration into decentralized optimization and learning systems. Additionally, we examine resilient algorithms, exploring the design and analysis of resilient aggregation and consensus protocols that support these systems. We conclude the survey by discussing current trends and potential future directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the era of big data, machine learning (ML) has become a powerful tool in various fields, notably impacting structural dynamics. ML algorithms offer advantages by modeling physical phenomena based on data, even in the absence of underlying mechanisms. However, uncertainties such as measurement noise and modeling errors can compromise the reliability of ML predictions, highlighting the need for effective uncertainty awareness to enhance prediction robustness. This paper presents a comprehensive review on navigating uncertainties in ML, categorizing uncertainty-aware approaches into probabilistic methods (including Bayesian and frequentist perspectives) and non-probabilistic methods (such as interval learning and fuzzy learning). Bayesian neural networks, known for their uncertainty quantification and nonlinear mapping capabilities, are emphasized for their superior performance and potential. The review covers various techniques and methodologies for addressing uncertainties in ML, discussing fundamentals and implementation procedures of each method. While providing a concise overview of fundamental concepts, the paper refrains from in-depth critical explanations. Strengths and limitations of each approach are examined, along with their applications in structural dynamic forward problems like response prediction, sensitivity assessment, and reliability analysis, and inverse problems like system identification, model updating, and damage identification. Additionally, the review identifies research gaps and suggests future directions for investigations, aiming to provide comprehensive insights to the research community. By offering an extensive overview of both probabilistic and non-probabilistic approaches, this review aims to assist researchers and practitioners in making informed decisions when utilizing ML techniques to address uncertainties in structural dynamic problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiating Ma, Yipeng Zhou, Qi Li, Quan Z. Sheng, Laizhong Cui, Jiangchuan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: To preserve the data privacy, the federated learning (FL) paradigm emerges in which clients only expose model gradients rather than original data for conducting model training. To enhance the protection of model gradients in FL, differentially private federated learning (DPFL) is proposed which incorporates differentially private (DP) noises to obfuscate gradients before they are exposed. Yet, an essential but largely overlooked problem in DPFL is the heterogeneity of clients' privacy requirement, which can vary significantly between clients and extremely complicates the client selection problem in DPFL. In other words, both the data quality and the influence of DP noises should be taken into account when selecting clients. To address this problem, we conduct convergence analysis of DPFL under heterogeneous privacy, a generic client selection strategy, popular DP mechanisms and convex loss. Based on convergence analysis, we formulate the client selection problem to minimize the value of loss function in DPFL with heterogeneous privacy, which is a convex optimization problem and can be solved efficiently. Accordingly, we propose the DPFL-BCS (biased client selection) algorithm. The extensive experiment results with real datasets under both convex and non-convex loss functions indicate that DPFL-BCS can remarkably improve model utility compared with the SOTA baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angus Nicolson, Yarin Gal, J. Alison Noble</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept-based interpretability methods are a popular form of explanation for deep learning models which provide explanations in the form of high-level human interpretable concepts. These methods typically find concept activation vectors (CAVs) using a probe dataset of concept examples. This requires labelled data for these concepts -- an expensive task in the medical domain. We introduce TextCAVs: a novel method which creates CAVs using vision-language models such as CLIP, allowing for explanations to be created solely using text descriptions of the concept, as opposed to image exemplars. This reduced cost in testing concepts allows for many concepts to be tested and for users to interact with the model, testing new ideas as they are thought of, rather than a delay caused by image collection and annotation. In early experimental results, we demonstrate that TextCAVs produces reasonable explanations for a chest x-ray dataset (MIMIC-CXR) and natural images (ImageNet), and that these explanations can be used to debug deep learning-based models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binbin Ding, Penghui Yang, Zeqing Ge, Shengjun Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple clients to collaboratively train machine learning models under the overall planning of the server while adhering to privacy requirements. However, the server cannot directly oversee the local training process, creating an opportunity for malicious clients to introduce backdoors. Existing research shows that backdoor attacks activate specific neurons in the compromised model, which remain dormant when processing clean data. Leveraging this insight, we propose a method called Flipping Weight Updates of Low-Activation Input Neurons (FLAIN) to defend against backdoor attacks in federated learning. Specifically, after completing global training, we employ an auxiliary dataset to identify low-activation input neurons and flip the associated weight updates. We incrementally raise the threshold for low-activation inputs and flip the weight updates iteratively, until the performance degradation on the auxiliary data becomes unacceptable. Extensive experiments validate that our method can effectively reduce the success rate of backdoor attacks to a low level in various attack scenarios including those with non-IID data distribution or high MCRs, causing only minimal performance degradation on clean data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beatrice Balbierer, Lukas Heinlein, Domenique Zipperling, Niklas K\"uhl</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning presents a way to revolutionize AI applications by eliminating the necessity for data sharing. Yet, research has shown that information can still be extracted during training, making additional privacy-preserving measures such as differential privacy imperative. To implement real-world federated learning applications, fairness, ranging from a fair distribution of performance to non-discriminative behaviour, must be considered. Particularly in high-risk applications (e.g. healthcare), avoiding the repetition of past discriminatory errors is paramount. As recent research has demonstrated an inherent tension between privacy and fairness, we conduct a multivocal literature review to examine the current methods to integrate privacy and fairness in federated learning. Our analyses illustrate that the relationship between privacy and fairness has been neglected, posing a critical risk for real-world applications. We highlight the need to explore the relationship between privacy, fairness, and performance, advocating for the creation of integrated federated learning frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elena Umili, Francesco Argenziano, Roberto Capobianco</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks are very hard to solve, because agents must consider the entire history of state-action pairs to act rationally in the environment. Most works use symbolic formalisms (as Linear Temporal Logic or automata) to specify the temporally-extended task. These approaches only work in finite and discrete state environments or continuous problems for which a mapping between the raw state and a symbolic interpretation is known as a symbol grounding (SG) function. Here, we define Neural Reward Machines (NRM), an automata-based neurosymbolic framework that can be used for both reasoning and learning in non-symbolic non-markovian RL domains, which is based on the probabilistic relaxation of Moore Machines. We combine RL with semisupervised symbol grounding (SSSG) and we show that NRMs can exploit high-level symbolic knowledge in non-symbolic environments without any knowledge of the SG function, outperforming Deep RL methods which cannot incorporate prior knowledge. Moreover, we advance the research in SSSG, proposing an algorithm for analysing the groundability of temporal specifications, which is more efficient than baseline techniques of a factor $10^3$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyuan Chen, Wenwei Kuang, Lei Deng, Wei Han, Bo Bai, Goncalo dos Reis</p>
<p>Abstract: The pre-training cost of large language models (LLMs) is prohibitive. One cutting-edge approach to reduce the cost is zero-shot weight transfer, also known as model growth for some cases, which magically transfers the weights trained in a small model to a large model. However, there are still some theoretical mysteries behind the weight transfer. In this paper, inspired by prior applications of mean field theory to neural network dynamics, we introduce a mean field ansatz to provide a theoretical explanation for weight transfer. Specifically, we propose the row-column (RC) ansatz under the mean field point of view, which describes the measure structure of the weights in the neural network (NN) and admits a close measure dynamic. Thus, the weights of different sizes NN admit a common distribution under proper assumptions, and weight transfer methods can be viewed as sampling methods. We empirically validate the RC ansatz by exploring simple MLP examples and LLMs such as GPT-3 and Llama-3.1. We show the mean-field point of view is adequate under suitable assumptions which can provide theoretical support for zero-shot weight transfer.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this article, we explore the challenges and evolution of two key technologies in the current field of AI: Vision Transformer model and Large Language Model (LLM). Vision Transformer captures global information by splitting images into small pieces and leveraging Transformer's multi-head attention mechanism, but its high reference count and compute overhead limit deployment on mobile devices. At the same time, the rapid development of LLM has revolutionized natural language processing, but it also faces huge deployment challenges. To address these issues, we investigate model pruning techniques, with a particular focus on how to reduce redundant parameters without losing accuracy to accommodate personalized data and resource-constrained environments. In this paper, a new layered pruning strategy is proposed to distinguish the personalized layer from the common layer by compressed sensing and random sampling, thus significantly reducing the model parameters. Our experimental results show that the introduced step buffering mechanism further improves the accuracy of the model after pruning, providing new directions and possibilities for the deployment of efficient and personalized AI models on mobile devices in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongjian Zhang, Xiao Wang, Huichi Zhou, Yue Yu, Mengmei Zhang, Cheng Yang, Chuan Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, especially for topology attacks, and many methods that improve the robustness of GNNs have received considerable attention. Recently, we have witnessed the significant success of large language models (LLMs), leading many to explore the great potential of LLMs on GNNs. However, they mainly focus on improving the performance of GNNs by utilizing LLMs to enhance the node features. Therefore, we ask: Will the robustness of GNNs also be enhanced with the powerful understanding and inference capabilities of LLMs? By presenting the empirical results, we find that despite that LLMs can improve the robustness of GNNs, there is still an average decrease of 23.1% in accuracy, implying that the GNNs remain extremely vulnerable against topology attack. Therefore, another question is how to extend the capabilities of LLMs on graph adversarial robustness. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based robust graph structure inference framework, LLM4RGNN, which distills the inference capabilities of GPT-4 into a local LLM for identifying malicious edges and an LM-based edge predictor for finding missing important edges, so as to recover a robust graph structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM4RGNN consistently improves the robustness across various GNNs. Even in some cases where the perturbation ratio increases to 40%, the accuracy of GNNs is still better than that on the clean graph.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tejas Pagare, Avishek Ghosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Online learning in a decentralized two-sided matching markets, where the demand-side (players) compete to match with the supply-side (arms), has received substantial interest because it abstracts out the complex interactions in matching platforms (e.g. UpWork, TaskRabbit). However, past works assume that each arm knows their preference ranking over the players (one-sided learning), and each player aim to learn the preference over arms through successive interactions. Moreover, several (impractical) assumptions on the problem are usually made for theoretical tractability such as broadcast player-arm match Liu et al. (2020; 2021); Kong & Li (2023) or serial dictatorship Sankararaman et al. (2021); Basu et al. (2021); Ghosh et al. (2022). In this paper, we study a decentralized two-sided matching market, where we do not assume that the preference ranking over players are known to the arms apriori. Furthermore, we do not have any structural assumptions on the problem. We propose a multi-phase explore-then-commit type algorithm namely epoch-based CA-ETC (collision avoidance explore then commit) (\texttt{CA-ETC} in short) for this problem that does not require any communication across agents (players and arms) and hence decentralized. We show that for the initial epoch length of $T_{\circ}$ and subsequent epoch-lengths of $2^{l/\gamma} T_{\circ}$ (for the $l-$th epoch with $\gamma \in (0,1)$ as an input parameter to the algorithm), \texttt{CA-ETC} yields a player optimal expected regret of $\mathcal{O}\left(T_{\circ} (\frac{K \log T}{T_{\circ} \Delta^2})^{1/\gamma} + T_{\circ} (\frac{T}{T_{\circ}})^\gamma\right)$ for the $i$-th player, where $T$ is the learning horizon, $K$ is the number of arms and $\Delta$ is an appropriately defined problem gap. Furthermore, we propose a blackboard communication based baseline achieving logarithmic regret in $T$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuaijun Chen, Omid Tavallaie, Niousha Nazemi, Albert Y. Zomaya</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising privacy-aware distributed learning framework that can be deployed on various devices, such as mobile phones, desktops, and devices equipped with CPUs or GPUs. In the context of server-based Federated Learning as a Service (FLaas), FL enables the central server to coordinate the training process across multiple devices without direct access to the local data, thereby enhancing privacy and data security. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a method that fine-tunes models efficiently by focusing on a low-dimensional subspace of the model's parameters. This approach significantly reduces computational and memory costs compared to fine-tuning all parameters from scratch. When integrated with FL, especially in a FLaas environment, LoRA allows for flexible and efficient deployment across diverse hardware with varying computational capabilities by adjusting the local model's rank. However, in LoRA-enabled FL, different clients may train models with varying ranks, which poses a challenge for model aggregation on the server. Current methods of aggregating models of different ranks require padding weights to a uniform shape, which can degrade the global model's performance. To address this issue, we propose Rank-Based LoRA Aggregation (RBLA), a novel model aggregation method designed for heterogeneous LoRA structures. RBLA preserves key features across models with different ranks. This paper analyzes the issues with current padding methods that reshape models for aggregation in a FLaas environment. Then, we introduce RBLA, a rank-based aggregation method that maintains both low-rank and high-rank features. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RBLA through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: To unbiasedly evaluate multiple target policies, the dominant approach among RL practitioners is to run and evaluate each target policy separately. However, this evaluation method is far from efficient because samples are not shared across policies, and running target policies to evaluate themselves is actually not optimal. In this paper, we address these two weaknesses by designing a tailored behavior policy to reduce the variance of estimators across all target policies. Theoretically, we prove that executing this behavior policy with manyfold fewer samples outperforms on-policy evaluation on every target policy under characterized conditions. Empirically, we show our estimator has a substantially lower variance compared with previous best methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in a broad range of environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunxiao Shi, Wujiang Wu, Mingyu Jin, Haimin Zhang, Qiang Wu, Yongfeng Zhang, Min Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling feature interactions is crucial for click-through rate (CTR) prediction, particularly when it comes to high-order explicit interactions. Traditional methods struggle with this task because they often predefine a maximum interaction order, which relies heavily on prior knowledge and can limit the model's effectiveness. Additionally, modeling high-order interactions typically leads to increased computational costs. Therefore, the challenge lies in adaptively modeling high-order feature interactions while maintaining efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce Kolmogorov-Arnold Represented Sparse Efficient Interaction Network (KarSein), designed to optimize both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. We firstly identify limitations of directly applying Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to CTR and then introduce KarSein to overcome these issues. It features a novel architecture that reduces the computational costs of KAN and supports embedding vectors as feature inputs. Additionally, KarSein employs guided symbolic regression to address the challenge of KAN in spontaneously learning multiplicative relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate KarSein's superior performance, achieving significant predictive accuracy with minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, KarSein maintains strong global explainability while enabling the removal of redundant features, resulting in a sparse network structure. These advantages also position KarSein as a promising method for efficient inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Li, Jiale Liu, Xingyu Ji, Maojun Wang, Zeyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) have been shown to be effective in analyzing complex patterns in real-world situations where positive and negative links coexist. However, SGNN models suffer from poor explainability, which limit their adoptions in critical scenarios that require understanding the rationale behind predictions. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no research work on the explainability of the SGNN models. Our goal is to address the explainability of decision-making for the downstream task of link sign prediction specific to signed graph neural networks. Since post-hoc explanations are not derived directly from the models, they may be biased and misrepresent the true explanations. Therefore, in this paper we introduce a Self-Explainable Signed Graph transformer (SE-SGformer) framework, which can not only outputs explainable information while ensuring high prediction accuracy. Specifically, We propose a new Transformer architecture for signed graphs and theoretically demonstrate that using positional encoding based on signed random walks has greater expressive power than current SGNN methods and other positional encoding graph Transformer-based approaches. We constructs a novel explainable decision process by discovering the $K$-nearest (farthest) positive (negative) neighbors of a node to replace the neural network-based decoder for predicting edge signs. These $K$ positive (negative) neighbors represent crucial information about the formation of positive (negative) edges between nodes and thus can serve as important explanatory information in the decision-making process. We conducted experiments on several real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of SE-SGformer, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by improving 2.2\% prediction accuracy and 73.1\% explainablity accuracy in the best-case scenario.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sascha Marton, Tim Grams, Florian Vogt, Stefan L\"udtke, Christian Bartelt, Heiner Stuckenschmidt</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has seen significant success across various domains, but its adoption is often limited by the black-box nature of neural network policies, making them difficult to interpret. In contrast, symbolic policies allow representing decision-making strategies in a compact and interpretable way. However, learning symbolic policies directly within on-policy methods remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce SYMPOL, a novel method for SYMbolic tree-based on-POLicy RL. SYMPOL employs a tree-based model integrated with a policy gradient method, enabling the agent to learn and adapt its actions while maintaining a high level of interpretability. We evaluate SYMPOL on a set of benchmark RL tasks, demonstrating its superiority over alternative tree-based RL approaches in terms of performance and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method, that allows a gradient-based end-to-end learning of interpretable, axis-aligned decision trees on-policy. Therefore, SYMPOL can become the foundation for a new class of interpretable RL based on decision trees. Our implementation is available under: https://github.com/s-marton/SYMPOL</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanjjushri Varshini R, Rohith Mahadevan, Bagiya Lakshmi S, Mathivanan Periasamy, Raja CSP Raman, Lokesh M</p>
<p>Abstract: This research tackles the challenge of speckle noise in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) space data, a prevalent issue that hampers the clarity and utility of SAR images. The study presents a comparative analysis of six distinct speckle noise reduction techniques: Lee Filtering, Frost Filtering, Kuan Filtering, Gaussian Filtering, Median Filtering, and Bilateral Filtering. These methods, selected for their unique approaches to noise reduction and image preservation, were applied to SAR datasets sourced from the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF). The performance of each technique was evaluated using a comprehensive set of metrics, including Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Equivalent Number of Looks (ENL), and Speckle Suppression Index (SSI). The study concludes that both the Lee and Kuan Filters are effective, with the choice of filter depending on the specific application requirements for image quality and noise suppression. This work provides valuable insights into optimizing SAR image processing, with significant implications for remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and geological surveying.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raphael T. Husistein, Markus Reiher, Marco Eckhoff</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial neural networks have been shown to be state-of-the-art machine learning models in a wide variety of applications, including natural language processing and image recognition. However, building a performant neural network is a laborious task and requires substantial computing power. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) addresses this issue by an automatic selection of the optimal network from a set of potential candidates. While many NAS methods still require training of (some) neural networks, zero-cost proxies promise to identify the optimal network without training. In this work, we propose the zero-cost proxy Network Expressivity by Activation Rank (NEAR). It is based on the effective rank of the pre- and post-activation matrix, i.e., the values of a neural network layer before and after applying its activation function. We demonstrate the cutting-edge correlation between this network score and the model accuracy on NAS-Bench-101 and NATS-Bench-SSS/TSS. In addition, we present a simple approach to estimate the optimal layer sizes in multi-layer perceptrons. Furthermore, we show that this score can be utilized to select hyperparameters such as the activation function and the neural network weight initialization scheme.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiqiao Wei, Ye Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention due to their ability to represent graph data. Among various GNN variants, graph attention network (GAT) stands out since it is able to dynamically learn the importance of different nodes. However, present GATs heavily rely on the smoothed node features to obtain the attention coefficients rather than graph structural information, which fails to provide crucial contextual cues for node representations. To address this issue, this study proposes a neighbor overlay-induced graph attention network (NO-GAT) with the following two-fold ideas: a) learning favorable structural information, i.e., overlaid neighbors, outside the node feature propagation process from an adjacency matrix; b) injecting the information of overlaid neighbors into the node feature propagation process to compute the attention coefficient jointly. Empirical studies on graph benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed NO-GAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Zhang, Allen Zhang, Ruth Nelson, Giorgio Ascoli, Liang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Geometric trees are characterized by their tree-structured layout and spatially constrained nodes and edges, which significantly impacts their topological attributes. This inherent hierarchical structure plays a crucial role in domains such as neuron morphology and river geomorphology, but traditional graph representation methods often overlook these specific characteristics of tree structures. To address this, we introduce a new representation learning framework tailored for geometric trees. It first features a unique message passing neural network, which is both provably geometrical structure-recoverable and rotation-translation invariant. To address the data label scarcity issue, our approach also includes two innovative training targets that reflect the hierarchical ordering and geometric structure of these geometric trees. This enables fully self-supervised learning without explicit labels. We validate our method's effectiveness on eight real-world datasets, demonstrating its capability to represent geometric trees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ravi Raju, Swayambhoo Jain, Bo Li, Jonathan Li, Urmish Thakkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the landscape of machine learning, yet current benchmarks often fall short in capturing the diverse behavior of these models in real-world applications. A benchmark's usefulness is determined by its ability to clearly differentiate between models of varying capabilities (separability) and closely align with human preferences. Existing frameworks like Alpaca-Eval 2.0 LC \cite{dubois2024lengthcontrolledalpacaevalsimpleway} and Arena-Hard v0.1 \cite{li2024crowdsourced} are limited by their focus on general-purpose queries and lack of diversity across domains such as law, medicine, and multilingual contexts. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a novel data pipeline that curates diverse, domain-specific evaluation sets tailored for LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks. Our approach leverages a combination of manual curation, semi-supervised learning to generate clusters, and stratified sampling to ensure balanced representation across a wide range of domains and languages. The resulting evaluation set, which includes 1573 samples across 14 categories, demonstrates high separability (84\%) across ten top-ranked models, and agreement (84\%) with Chatbot Arena and (0.915) Spearman correlation. The agreement values are 9\% better than Arena Hard and 20\% better than AlpacaEval 2.0 LC, while the Spearman coefficient is 0.7 more than the next best benchmark, showcasing a significant improvement in the usefulness of the benchmark. We further provide an open-source evaluation tool that enables fine-grained analysis of model performance across user-defined categories, offering valuable insights for practitioners. This work contributes to the ongoing effort to enhance the transparency, diversity, and effectiveness of LLM evaluation methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamad Fares El Hajj Chehade, Amrit Singh Bedi, Amy Zhang, Hao Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transfer learning in reinforcement learning (RL) has become a pivotal strategy for improving data efficiency in new, unseen tasks by utilizing knowledge from previously learned tasks. This approach is especially beneficial in real-world deployment scenarios where computational resources are constrained and agents must adapt rapidly to novel environments. However, current state-of-the-art methods often fall short in ensuring safety during the transfer process, particularly when unforeseen risks emerge in the deployment phase. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a novel Caution-Aware Transfer Learning (CAT) framework. Unlike traditional approaches that limit risk considerations to mean-variance, we define "caution" as a more generalized and comprehensive notion of risk. Our core innovation lies in optimizing a weighted sum of reward return and caution-based on state-action occupancy measures-during the transfer process, allowing for a rich representation of diverse risk factors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore the optimization of such a generalized risk notion within the context of transfer RL. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We propose a Caution-Aware Transfer (CAT) framework that evaluates source policies within the test environment and constructs a new policy that balances reward maximization and caution. (2) We derive theoretical sub-optimality bounds for our method, providing rigorous guarantees of its efficacy. (3) We empirically validate CAT, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms existing methods by delivering safer policies under varying risk conditions in the test tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Counterfactual estimation from observations represents a critical endeavor in numerous application fields, such as healthcare and finance, with the primary challenge being the mitigation of treatment bias. The balancing strategy aimed at reducing covariate disparities between different treatment groups serves as a universal solution. However, when it comes to the time series data, the effectiveness of balancing strategies remains an open question, with a thorough analysis of the robustness and applicability of balancing strategies still lacking. This paper revisits counterfactual estimation in the temporal setting and provides a brief overview of recent advancements in balancing strategies. More importantly, we conduct a critical empirical examination for the effectiveness of the balancing strategies within the realm of temporal counterfactual estimation in various settings on multiple datasets. Our findings could be of significant interest to researchers and practitioners and call for a reexamination of the balancing strategy in time series settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vishal S. Ngairangbam, Michael Spannowsky</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the role of group symmetries in binary classification tasks, presenting a novel framework that leverages the principles of Neyman-Pearson optimality. Contrary to the common intuition that larger symmetry groups lead to improved classification performance, our findings show that selecting the appropriate group symmetries is crucial for optimising generalisation and sample efficiency. We develop a theoretical foundation for designing group equivariant neural networks that align the choice of symmetries with the underlying probability distributions of the data. Our approach provides a unified methodology for improving classification accuracy across a broad range of applications by carefully tailoring the symmetry group to the specific characteristics of the problem. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that optimal classification performance is not always associated with the largest equivariant groups possible in the domain, even when the likelihood ratio is invariant under one of its proper subgroups, but rather with those subgroups themselves. This work offers insights and practical guidelines for constructing more effective group equivariant architectures in diverse machine-learning contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamad Fares El Hajj Chehade, Brian Wesley Bell, Russell Bent, Hao Zhu, Wenting Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The robustness of neural networks is paramount in safety-critical applications. While most current robustness verification methods assess the worst-case output under the assumption that the input space is known, identifying a verifiable input space $\mathcal{C}$, where no adversarial examples exist, is crucial for effective model selection, robustness evaluation, and the development of reliable control strategies. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework, $\texttt{LEVIS}$, comprising $\texttt{LEVIS}$-$\alpha$ and $\texttt{LEVIS}$-$\beta$. $\texttt{LEVIS}$-$\alpha$ locates the largest possible verifiable ball within the central region of $\mathcal{C}$ that intersects at least two boundaries. In contrast, $\texttt{LEVIS}$-$\beta$ integrates multiple verifiable balls to encapsulate the entirety of the verifiable space comprehensively. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We propose $\texttt{LEVIS}$ equipped with three pioneering techniques that identify the maximum verifiable ball and the nearest adversarial point along collinear or orthogonal directions. (2) We offer a theoretical analysis elucidating the properties of the verifiable balls acquired through $\texttt{LEVIS}$-$\alpha$ and $\texttt{LEVIS}$-$\beta$. (3) We validate our methodology across diverse applications, including electrical power flow regression and image classification, showcasing performance enhancements and visualizations of the searching characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuchuang Wang, Jinhang Zuo, Xutong Liu, John C. S. Lui, Mohammad Hajiesmaili</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates stochastic multi-armed bandit algorithms that are robust to adversarial attacks, where an attacker can first observe the learner's action and {then} alter their reward observation. We study two cases of this model, with or without the knowledge of an attack budget $C$, defined as an upper bound of the summation of the difference between the actual and altered rewards. For both cases, we devise two types of algorithms with regret bounds having additive or multiplicative $C$ dependence terms. For the known attack budget case, we prove our algorithms achieve the regret bound of ${O}((K/\Delta)\log T + KC)$ and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{KTC})$ for the additive and multiplicative $C$ terms, respectively, where $K$ is the number of arms, $T$ is the time horizon, $\Delta$ is the gap between the expected rewards of the optimal arm and the second-best arm, and $\tilde{O}$ hides the logarithmic factors. For the unknown case, we prove our algorithms achieve the regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{KT} + KC^2)$ and $\tilde{O}(KC\sqrt{T})$ for the additive and multiplicative $C$ terms, respectively. In addition to these upper bound results, we provide several lower bounds showing the tightness of our bounds and the optimality of our algorithms. These results delineate an intrinsic separation between the bandits with attacks and corruption models [Lykouris et al., 2018].</p>

<p>Abstract: Achieving human-level intelligence requires refining cognitive distinctions between System 1 and System 2 thinking. While contemporary AI, driven by large language models, demonstrates human-like traits, it falls short of genuine cognition. Transitioning from structured benchmarks to real-world scenarios presents challenges for visual agents, often leading to inaccurate and overly confident responses. To address the challenge, we introduce FaST, which incorporates the Fast and Slow Thinking mechanism into visual agents. FaST employs a switch adapter to dynamically select between System 1/2 modes, tailoring the problem-solving approach to different task complexity. It tackles uncertain and unseen objects by adjusting model confidence and integrating new contextual data. With this novel design, we advocate a flexible system, hierarchical reasoning capabilities, and a transparent decision-making pipeline, all of which contribute to its ability to emulate human-like cognitive processes in visual intelligence. Empirical results demonstrate that FaST outperforms various well-known baselines, achieving 80.8% accuracy over VQA^{v2} for visual question answering and 48.7% GIoU score over ReasonSeg for reasoning segmentation, demonstrate FaST's superior performance. Extensive testing validates the efficacy and robustness of FaST's core components, showcasing its potential to advance the development of cognitive visual agents in AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The state-of-the-art for training on-device language models for mobile keyboard applications combines federated learning (FL) with differential privacy (DP) via the DP-Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (DP-FTRL) algorithm. Two variants of DP-FTRL are used in practice, tree aggregation and matrix factorization. However, tree aggregation suffers from significantly suboptimal privacy/utility tradeoffs, while matrix mechanisms require expensive optimization parameterized by hard-to-estimate-in-advance constants, and high runtime memory costs.This paper extends the recently introduced Buffered Linear Toeplitz (BLT) mechanism to multi-participation scenarios. Our BLT-DP-FTRL maintains the ease-of-use advantages of tree aggregation, while essentially matching matrix factorization in terms of utility and privacy. We evaluate BLT-DP-FTRL on the StackOverflow dataset, serving as a re-producible simulation benchmark, and across four on-device language model tasks in a production FL system. Our empirical results highlight the advantages of the BLT mechanism and elevate the practicality and effectiveness of DP in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Giordano, Kanika Dheman, Michele Magno</p>
<p>Abstract: Sepsis is a lethal syndrome of organ dysfunction that is triggered by an infection and claims 11 million lives per year globally. Prognostic algorithms based on deep learning have shown promise in detecting the onset of sepsis hours before the actual event but use a large number of bio-markers, including vital signs and laboratory tests. The latter makes the deployment of such systems outside hospitals or in resource-limited environments extremely challenging. This paper introduces SepAl, an energy-efficient and lightweight neural network, using only data from low-power wearable sensors, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), inertial measurement units (IMU), and body temperature sensors, designed to deliver alerts in real-time. SepAl leverages only six digitally acquirable vital signs and tiny machine learning algorithms, enabling on-device real-time sepsis prediction.
  SepAl uses a lightweight temporal convolution neural network capable of providing sepsis alerts with a median predicted time to sepsis of 9.8 hours. The model has been fully quantized, being able to be deployed on any low-power processors, and evaluated on an ARM Cortex-M33 core. Experimental evaluations show an inference efficiency of 0.11MAC/Cycle and a latency of 143ms, with an energy per inference of 2.68mJ. This work aims at paving the way toward accurate disease prediction, deployable in a long-lasting multi-vital sign wearable device, suitable for providing sepsis onset alerts at the point of care.

<p>Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), such as ChatGPT, have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing. This progress has inspired a series of innovative studies that explore the adaptation of PLMs to time series analysis, intending to create a unified foundation model that addresses various time series analytical tasks. However, these efforts predominantly focus on Regularly Sampled Time Series (RSTS), neglecting the unique challenges posed by Irregularly Sampled Time Series (ISTS), which are characterized by non-uniform sampling intervals and prevalent missing data. To bridge this gap, this work explores the potential of PLMs for ISTS analysis. We begin by investigating the effect of various methods for representing ISTS, aiming to maximize the efficacy of PLMs in this under-explored area. Furthermore, we present a unified PLM-based framework, ISTS-PLM, which integrates time-aware and variable-aware PLMs tailored for comprehensive intra and inter-time series modeling and includes a learnable input embedding layer and a task-specific output layer to tackle diverse ISTS analytical tasks. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark demonstrate that the ISTS-PLM, utilizing a simple yet effective series-based representation for ISTS, consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various analytical tasks, such as classification, interpolation, and extrapolation, as well as few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios, spanning scientific domains like healthcare and biomechanics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongze Wu, Nicholas Kolkin, Jonathan Brandt, Richard Zhang, Eli Shechtman</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the challenges of precise image inversion and disentangled image editing in the context of few-step diffusion models. We introduce an encoder based iterative inversion technique. The inversion network is conditioned on the input image and the reconstructed image from the previous step, allowing for correction of the next reconstruction towards the input image. We demonstrate that disentangled controls can be easily achieved in the few-step diffusion model by conditioning on an (automatically generated) detailed text prompt. To manipulate the inverted image, we freeze the noise maps and modify one attribute in the text prompt (either manually or via instruction based editing driven by an LLM), resulting in the generation of a new image similar to the input image with only one attribute changed. It can further control the editing strength and accept instructive text prompt. Our approach facilitates realistic text-guided image edits in real-time, requiring only 8 number of functional evaluations (NFEs) in inversion (one-time cost) and 4 NFEs per edit. Our method is not only fast, but also significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multi-step diffusion editing techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Po-Yu Liang, Xueting Huang, Tibo Duran, Andrew J. Wiemer, Jun Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating peptides with desired properties is crucial for drug discovery and biotechnology. Traditional sequence-based and structure-based methods often require extensive datasets, which limits their effectiveness. In this study, we proposed a novel method that utilized autoencoder shaped models to explore the protein embedding space, and generate novel peptide analogs by leveraging protein language models. The proposed method requires only a single sequence of interest, avoiding the need for large datasets. Our results show significant improvements over baseline models in similarity indicators of peptide structures, descriptors and bioactivities. The proposed method validated through Molecular Dynamics simulations on TIGIT inhibitors, demonstrates that our method produces peptide analogs with similar yet distinct properties, highlighting its potential to enhance peptide screening processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anahita Samadi, Allison Sullivan</p>
<p>Abstract: As machine learning systems become more widely used, especially for safety critical applications, there is a growing need to ensure that these systems behave as intended, even in the face of adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are inputs that are designed to trick the decision making process, and are intended to be imperceptible to humans. However, for text-based classification systems, changes to the input, a string of text, are always perceptible. Therefore, text-based adversarial examples instead focus on trying to preserve semantics. Unfortunately, recent work has shown this goal is often not met. To improve the quality of text-based adversarial examples, we need to know what elements of the input text are worth focusing on. To address this, in this paper, we explore what parts of speech have the highest impact of text-based classifiers. Our experiments highlight a distinct bias in CNN algorithms against certain parts of speech tokens within review datasets. This finding underscores a critical vulnerability in the linguistic processing capabilities of CNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krisztian Balog, John Palowitch, Barbara Ikica, Filip Radlinski, Hamidreza Alvari, Mehdi Manshadi</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of synthetic data represents a pivotal shift in modern machine learning, offering a solution to satisfy the need for large volumes of data in domains where real data is scarce, highly private, or difficult to obtain. We investigate the feasibility of creating realistic, large-scale synthetic datasets of user-generated content, noting that such content is increasingly prevalent and a source of frequently sought information. Large language models (LLMs) offer a starting point for generating synthetic social media discussion threads, due to their ability to produce diverse responses that typify online interactions. However, as we demonstrate, straightforward application of LLMs yields limited success in capturing the complex structure of online discussions, and standard prompting mechanisms lack sufficient control. We therefore propose a multi-step generation process, predicated on the idea of creating compact representations of discussion threads, referred to as scaffolds. Our framework is generic yet adaptable to the unique characteristics of specific social media platforms. We demonstrate its feasibility using data from two distinct online discussion platforms. To address the fundamental challenge of ensuring the representativeness and realism of synthetic data, we propose a portfolio of evaluation measures to compare various instantiations of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Konz, Maciej A. Mazurowski</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been interest in how geometric properties such as intrinsic dimension (ID) of a neural network's hidden representations evolve through its layers, and how such properties are predictive of important model behavior such as generalization ability. However, evidence has begun to emerge that such behavior can change significantly depending on the domain of the network's training data, such as natural versus medical images. Here, we further this inquiry by exploring how the ID of a network's learned representations evolves through its layers, in essence, characterizing how the network successively refines the information content of input data to be used for predictions. Analyzing eleven natural and medical image datasets across six network architectures, we find that the shape of this ID evolution curve differs noticeably between natural and medical image models: medical image models peak in representation ID earlier in the network, implying a difference in the image features and their abstractness that are typically used for downstream tasks in these domains. Additionally, we discover a strong correlation of this peak representation ID with the ID of the data in its input space, implying that the intrinsic information content of a model's learned representations is guided by that of the data it was trained on. Overall, our findings emphasize notable discrepancies in network behavior between natural and non-natural imaging domains regarding hidden representation information content, and provide further insights into how a network's learned features are shaped by its training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarbojit Roy, Malik Shahid Sultan, Hernando Ombao</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpretable classification of time series presents significant challenges in high dimensions. Traditional feature selection methods in the frequency domain often assume sparsity in spectral density matrices (SDMs) or their inverses, which can be restrictive for real-world applications. In this article, we propose a model-based approach for classifying high-dimensional stationary time series by assuming sparsity in the difference between inverse SDMs. Our approach emphasizes the interpretability of model parameters, making it especially suitable for fields like neuroscience, where understanding differences in brain network connectivity across various states is crucial. The estimators for model parameters demonstrate consistency under appropriate conditions. We further propose using standard deep learning optimizers for parameter estimation, employing techniques such as mini-batching and learning rate scheduling. Additionally, we introduce a method to screen the most discriminatory frequencies for classification, which exhibits the sure screening property under general conditions. The flexibility of the proposed model allows the significance of covariates to vary across frequencies, enabling nuanced inferences and deeper insights into the underlying problem. The novelty of our method lies in the interpretability of the model parameters, addressing critical needs in neuroscience. The proposed approaches have been evaluated on simulated examples and the `Alert-vs-Drowsy' EEG dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mary V. Bastawrous, Zhi Chen, Alexander C. Ogren, Chiara Daraio, Cynthia Rudin, L. Catherine Brinson</p>
<p>Abstract: Manipulating the dispersive characteristics of vibrational waves is beneficial for many applications, e.g., high-precision instruments. architected hierarchical phononic materials have sparked promise tunability of elastodynamic waves and vibrations over multiple frequency ranges. In this article, hierarchical unit-cells are obtained, where features at each length scale result in a band gap within a targeted frequency range. Our novel approach, the ``hierarchical unit-cell template method,'' is an interpretable machine-learning approach that uncovers global unit-cell shape/topology patterns corresponding to predefined band-gap objectives. A scale-separation effect is observed where the coarse-scale band-gap objective is mostly unaffected by the fine-scale features despite the closeness of their length scales, thus enabling an efficient hierarchical algorithm. Moreover, the hierarchical patterns revealed are not predefined or self-similar hierarchies as common in current hierarchical phononic materials. Thus, our approach offers a flexible and efficient method for the exploration of new regions in the hierarchical design space, extracting minimal effective patterns for inverse design in applications targeting multiple frequency ranges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdur R. Fayjie, Jutika Borah, Florencia Carbone, Jan Tack, Patrick Vandewalle</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has shown tremendous progress in a wide range of digital pathology and medical image classification tasks. Its integration into safe clinical decision-making support requires robust and reliable models. However, real-world data comes with diversities that often lie outside the intended source distribution. Moreover, when test samples are dramatically different, clinical decision-making is greatly affected. Quantifying predictive uncertainty in models is crucial for well-calibrated predictions and determining when (or not) to trust a model. Unfortunately, many works have overlooked the importance of predictive uncertainty estimation. This paper evaluates whether predictive uncertainty estimation adds robustness to deep learning-based diagnostic decision-making systems. We investigate the effect of various carcinoma distribution shift scenarios on predictive performance and calibration. We first systematically investigate three popular methods for improving predictive uncertainty: Monte Carlo dropout, deep ensemble, and few-shot learning on lung adenocarcinoma classification as a primary disease in whole slide images. Secondly, we compare the effectiveness of the methods in terms of performance and calibration under clinically relevant distribution shifts such as in-distribution shifts comprising primary disease sub-types and other characterization analysis data; out-of-distribution shifts comprising well-differentiated cases, different organ origin, and imaging modality shifts. While studies on uncertainty estimation exist, to our best knowledge, no rigorous large-scale benchmark compares predictive uncertainty estimation including these dataset shifts for lung carcinoma classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bernard T. Agyeman (University of Alberta), Benjamin Decard-Nelson (University of Alberta), Jinfeng Liu (University of Alberta), Sirish L. Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a Semi-Centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (SCMARL) approach for irrigation scheduling in spatially variable agricultural fields, where management zones address spatial variability. The SCMARL framework is hierarchical in nature, with a centralized coordinator agent at the top level and decentralized local agents at the second level. The coordinator agent makes daily binary irrigation decisions based on field-wide conditions, which are communicated to the local agents. Local agents determine appropriate irrigation amounts for specific management zones using local conditions. The framework employs state augmentation approach to handle non-stationarity in the local agents' environments. An extensive evaluation on a large-scale field in Lethbridge, Canada, compares the SCMARL approach with a learning-based multi-agent model predictive control scheduling approach, highlighting its enhanced performance, resulting in water conservation and improved Irrigation Water Use Efficiency (IWUE). Notably, the proposed approach achieved a 4.0% savings in irrigation water while enhancing the IWUE by 6.3%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinming Nian, Zhiyuan Peng, Qifan Wang, Yi Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: In knowledge-intensive tasks such as open-domain question answering (OpenQA), Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to generate factual answers relying solely on their internal (parametric) knowledge. To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance LLMs by retrieving relevant information from external sources, thereby positioning the retriever as a pivotal component. Although dense retrieval demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, its training poses challenges due to the scarcity of ground-truth evidence, largely attributed to the high costs of human annotation. In this paper, we propose W-RAG by utilizing the ranking capabilities of LLMs to create weakly labeled data for training dense retrievers. Specifically, we rerank the top-$K$ passages retrieved via BM25 by assessing the probability that LLMs will generate the correct answer based on the question and each passage. The highest-ranking passages are then used as positive training examples for dense retrieval. Our comprehensive experiments across four publicly available OpenQA datasets demonstrate that our approach enhances both retrieval and OpenQA performance compared to baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zohaib Khan, Muhammad Khaquan, Omer Tafveez, Agha Ali Raza</p>
<p>Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized deep learning through its Self-Attention mechanism, which effectively captures contextual information. However, the memory footprint of Self-Attention presents significant challenges for long-sequence tasks. Grouped Query Attention (GQA) addresses this issue by grouping queries and mean-pooling the corresponding key-value heads - reducing the number of overall parameters and memory requirements in a flexible manner without adversely compromising model accuracy. In this work, we introduce enhancements to GQA, focusing on two novel approaches that deviate from the static nature of grouping: Key-Distributed GQA (KDGQA) and Dynamic Key-Distributed GQA (DGQA), which leverage information from the norms of the key heads to inform query allocation. Specifically, KDGQA looks at the ratios of the norms of the key heads during each forward pass, while DGQA examines the ratios of the norms as they evolve through training. Additionally, we present Perturbed GQA (PGQA) as a case-study, which introduces variability in (static) group formation via subtracting noise from the attention maps. Our experiments with up-trained Vision Transformers, for Image Classification on datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Food101, and Tiny ImageNet, demonstrate the promise of these variants in improving upon the original GQA through more informed and adaptive grouping mechanisms: specifically ViT-L experiences accuracy gains of up to 8% when utilizing DGQA in comparison to GQA and other variants. We further analyze the impact of the number of Key-Value Heads on performance, underscoring the importance of utilizing query-key affinities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusen Wu, Hao Chen, Alex Pissinou Makki, Phuong Nguyen, Yelena Yesha</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributional drift detection is important in medical applications as it helps ensure the accuracy and reliability of models by identifying changes in the underlying data distribution that could affect diagnostic or treatment decisions. However, current methods have limitations in detecting drift; for example, the inclusion of abnormal datasets can lead to unfair comparisons. This paper presents an accurate and sensitive approach to detect distributional drift in CT-scan medical images by leveraging data-sketching and fine-tuning techniques. We developed a robust baseline library model for real-time anomaly detection, allowing for efficient comparison of incoming images and identification of anomalies. Additionally, we fine-tuned a vision transformer pre-trained model to extract relevant features using breast cancer images as an example, significantly enhancing model accuracy to 99.11\%. Combining with data-sketches and fine-tuning, our feature extraction evaluation demonstrated that cosine similarity scores between similar datasets provide greater improvements, from around 50\% increased to 100\%. Finally, the sensitivity evaluation shows that our solutions are highly sensitive to even 1\% salt-and-pepper and speckle noise, and it is not sensitive to lighting noise (e.g., lighting conditions have no impact on data drift). The proposed methods offer a scalable and reliable solution for maintaining the accuracy of diagnostic models in dynamic clinical environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaochuang Han, Marjan Ghazvininejad, Pang Wei Koh, Yulia Tsvetkov</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work in image and video generation has been adopting the autoregressive LLM architecture due to its generality and potentially easy integration into multi-modal systems. The crux of applying autoregressive training in language generation to visual generation is discretization -- representing continuous data like images and videos as discrete tokens. Common methods of discretizing images and videos include modeling raw pixel values, which are prohibitively lengthy, or vector quantization, which requires convoluted pre-hoc training. In this work, we propose to directly model images and videos as compressed files saved on computers via canonical codecs (e.g., JPEG, AVC/H.264). Using the default Llama architecture without any vision-specific modifications, we pretrain JPEG-LM from scratch to generate images (and AVC-LM to generate videos as a proof of concept), by directly outputting compressed file bytes in JPEG and AVC formats. Evaluation of image generation shows that this simple and straightforward approach is more effective than pixel-based modeling and sophisticated vector quantization baselines (on which our method yields a 31% reduction in FID). Our analysis shows that JPEG-LM has an especial advantage over vector quantization models in generating long-tail visual elements. Overall, we show that using canonical codec representations can help lower the barriers between language generation and visual generation, facilitating future research on multi-modal language/image/video LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent discoveries by neutrino telescopes, such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, relied extensively on machine learning (ML) tools to infer physical quantities from the raw photon hits detected. Neutrino telescope reconstruction algorithms are limited by the sparse sampling of photons by the optical modules due to the relatively large spacing ($10-100\,{\rm m})$ between them. In this letter, we propose a novel technique that learns photon transport through the detector medium through the use of deep learning-driven super-resolution of data events. These ``improved'' events can then be reconstructed using traditional or ML techniques, resulting in improved resolution. Our strategy arranges additional ``virtual'' optical modules within an existing detector geometry and trains a convolutional neural network to predict the hits on these virtual optical modules. We show that this technique improves the angular reconstruction of muons in a generic ice-based neutrino telescope. Our results readily extend to water-based neutrino telescopes and other event morphologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huaiyuan Liu, Xianzhang Liu, Donghua Yang, Hongzhi Wang, Yingchi Long, Mengtong Ji, Dongjing Miao, Zhiyu Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Maximum Minimal Cut Problem (MMCP), a NP-hard combinatorial optimization (CO) problem, has not received much attention due to the demanding and challenging bi-connectivity constraint. Moreover, as a CO problem, it is also a daunting task for machine learning, especially without labeled instances. To deal with these problems, this work proposes an unsupervised learning framework combined with heuristics for MMCP that can provide valid and high-quality solutions. As far as we know, this is the first work that explores machine learning and heuristics to solve MMCP. The unsupervised solver is inspired by a relaxation-plus-rounding approach, the relaxed solution is parameterized by graph neural networks, and the cost and penalty of MMCP are explicitly written out, which can train the model end-to-end. A crucial observation is that each solution corresponds to at least one spanning tree. Based on this finding, a heuristic solver that implements tree transformations by adding vertices is utilized to repair and improve the solution quality of the unsupervised solver. Alternatively, the graph is simplified while guaranteeing solution consistency, which reduces the running time. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our framework and give a specific application. The results demonstrate the superiority of our method against two techniques designed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Li, Honghao Lin, David P. Woodruff</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of residual error estimation for matrix and vector norms using a linear sketch. Such estimates can be used, for example, to quickly assess how useful a more expensive low-rank approximation computation will be. The matrix case concerns the Frobenius norm and the task is to approximate the $k$-residual $\|A - A_k\|_F$ of the input matrix $A$ within a $(1+\epsilon)$-factor, where $A_k$ is the optimal rank-$k$ approximation. We provide a tight bound of $\Theta(k^2/\epsilon^4)$ on the size of bilinear sketches, which have the form of a matrix product $SAT$. This improves the previous $O(k^2/\epsilon^6)$ upper bound in (Andoni et al. SODA 2013) and gives the first non-trivial lower bound, to the best of our knowledge. In our algorithm, our sketching matrices $S$ and $T$ can both be sparse matrices, allowing for a very fast update time. We demonstrate that this gives a substantial advantage empirically, for roughly the same sketch size and accuracy as in previous work.
  For the vector case, we consider the $\ell_p$-norm for $p>2$, where the task is to approximate the $k$-residual $\|x - x_k\|_p$ up to a constant factor, where $x_k$ is the optimal $k$-sparse approximation to $x$. Such vector norms are frequently studied in the data stream literature and are useful for finding frequent items or so-called heavy hitters. We establish an upper bound of $O(k^{2/p}n^{1-2/p}\operatorname{poly}(\log n))$ for constant $\epsilon$ on the dimension of a linear sketch for this problem. Our algorithm can be extended to the $\ell_p$ sparse recovery problem with the same sketching dimension, which seems to be the first such bound for $p > 2$. We also show an $\Omega(k^{2/p}n^{1-2/p})$ lower bound for the sparse recovery problem, which is tight up to a $\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$ factor.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning a data representation for downstream supervised learning tasks under unlabeled scenario is both critical and challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised transfer learning approach using adversarial contrastive training (ACT). Our experimental results demonstrate outstanding classification accuracy with both fine-tuned linear probe and K-NN protocol across various datasets, showing competitiveness with existing state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods. Moreover, we provide an end-to-end theoretical guarantee for downstream classification tasks in a misspecified, over-parameterized setting, highlighting how a large amount of unlabeled data contributes to prediction accuracy. Our theoretical findings suggest that the testing error of downstream tasks depends solely on the efficiency of data augmentation used in ACT when the unlabeled sample size is sufficiently large. This offers a theoretical understanding of learning downstream tasks with a small sample size.</p>

These organisations increasingly rely on vast corpora to train and fine-tune advanced AI models, resulting in intricate data supply chains that demand effective data governance mechanisms. In addition, the challenge intensifies as diverse stakeholders may use assorted tools, often without adequate measures to ensure the accountability of data and the reliability of outcomes. In this study, we adapt the concept of ``Software Bill of Materials" into the field of data governance and management to address the above challenges, and introduce ``Data Bill of Materials" (DataBOM) to capture the dependency relationship between different datasets and stakeholders by storing specific metadata. We demonstrate a platform architecture for providing blockchain-based DataBOM services, present the interaction protocol for stakeholders, and discuss the minimal requirements for DataBOM metadata. The proposed solution is evaluated in terms of feasibility and performance via case study and quantitative analysis respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renato Lui Geh, Honghua Zhang, Kareem Ahmed, Benjie Wang, Guy Van den Broeck</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically shipped with tokenizers that deterministically encode text into so-called canonical token sequences, to which the LLMs assign probability values. One common assumption is that the probability of a piece of text is the probability of its canonical token sequence. However, the tokenization of a string is not unique: e.g., the Llama2 tokenizer encodes Tokens as [Tok,ens], but [Tok,en,s] also represents the same text. In this paper, we study non-canonical tokenizations. We prove that, given a string, it is computationally hard to find the most likely tokenization for an autoregressive LLM, as well as to compute the marginal probability over all possible tokenizations. We then show how the marginal is, in most cases, indistinguishable from the canonical probability. Surprisingly, we then empirically demonstrate the existence of a significant amount of signal hidden within tokenization space. Notably, by simply aggregating the probabilities of non-canonical tokenizations, we achieve improvements across a range of LLM evaluation benchmarks for a variety of architectures, including transformers and state space models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative models are crucial for applications like data synthesis and augmentation. Diffusion, Flow Matching and Continuous Normalizing Flows have shown effectiveness across various modalities, and rely on Gaussian latent variables for generation. As any generated object is directly associated with a particular latent variable, we can manipulate the variables to exert control over the generation process. However, standard approaches for combining latent variables, such as spherical interpolation, only apply or work well in special cases. Moreover, current methods for obtaining low-dimensional representations of the data, important for e.g. surrogate models for search and creative applications, are network and data modality specific. In this work we show that the standard methods to combine variables do not yield intermediates following the distribution the models are trained to expect. We propose Combination of Gaussian variables (COG), a novel interpolation method that addresses this, is easy to implement yet matches or improves upon current methods. COG addresses linear combinations in general and, as we demonstrate, also supports other operations including e.g. defining subspaces of the latent space, simplifying the creation of expressive low-dimensional spaces of high-dimensional objects using generative models based on Gaussian latents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Full Field Digital Mammograms (FFDMs) and Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) are the two most widely used imaging modalities for breast cancer screening. Although DBT has increased cancer detection compared to FFDM, its widespread adoption in clinical practice has been slowed by increased interpretation times and a perceived decrease in the conspicuity of specific lesion types. Specifically, the non-inferiority of DBT for microcalcifications remains under debate. Due to concerns about the decrease in visual acuity, combined DBT-FFDM acquisitions remain popular, leading to overall increased exam times and radiation dosage. Enabling DBT to provide diagnostic information present in both FFDM and DBT would reduce reliance on FFDM, resulting in a reduction in both quantities. We propose a machine learning methodology that learns high-level representations leveraging the complementary diagnostic signal from both DBT and FFDM. Experiments on a large-scale data set validate our claims and show that our representations enable more accurate breast lesion detection than any DBT- or FFDM-based model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Omeiza, Pratik Somaiya, Jo-Ann Pattinson, Carolyn Ten-Holter, Jack Stilgoe, Marina Jirotka, Lars Kunze</p>
<p>Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) technology advances, ensuring the robustness and safety of AI-driven systems has become paramount. However, varying perceptions of robustness among AI developers create misaligned evaluation metrics, complicating the assessment and certification of safety-critical and complex AI systems such as autonomous driving (AD) agents. To address this challenge, we introduce Simulation-Based Robustness Assessment Framework (S-RAF) for autonomous driving. S-RAF leverages the CARLA Driving simulator to rigorously assess AD agents across diverse conditions, including faulty sensors, environmental changes, and complex traffic situations. By quantifying robustness and its relationship with other safety-critical factors, such as carbon emissions, S-RAF aids developers and stakeholders in building safe and responsible driving agents, and streamlining safety certification processes. Furthermore, S-RAF offers significant advantages, such as reduced testing costs, and the ability to explore edge cases that may be unsafe to test in the real world. The code for this framework is available here: https://github.com/cognitive-robots/rai-leaderboard</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunpeng Weng, Xing Tang, Zhenhao Xu, Fuyuan Lyu, Dugang Liu, Zexu Sun, Xiuqiang He</p>
<p>Abstract: Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) prediction is a critical task in business applications. Accurately predicting CLTV is challenging in real-world business scenarios, as the distribution of CLTV is complex and mutable. Firstly, there is a large number of users without any consumption consisting of a long-tailed part that is too complex to fit. Secondly, the small set of high-value users spent orders of magnitude more than a typical user leading to a wide range of the CLTV distribution which is hard to capture in a single distribution. Existing approaches for CLTV estimation either assume a prior probability distribution and fit a single group of distribution-related parameters for all samples, or directly learn from the posterior distribution with manually predefined buckets in a heuristic manner. However, all these methods fail to handle complex and mutable distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel optimal distribution selection model OptDist for CLTV prediction, which utilizes an adaptive optimal sub-distribution selection mechanism to improve the accuracy of complex distribution modeling. Specifically, OptDist trains several candidate sub-distribution networks in the distribution learning module (DLM) for modeling the probability distribution of CLTV. Then, a distribution selection module (DSM) is proposed to select the sub-distribution for each sample, thus making the selection automatically and adaptively. Besides, we design an alignment mechanism that connects both modules, which effectively guides the optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on both two public and one private dataset to verify that OptDist outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, OptDist has been deployed on a large-scale financial platform for customer acquisition marketing campaigns and the online experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of OptDist.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geonhee Kim, Marco Valentino, Andr\'e Freitas</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies on logical reasoning in auto-regressive Language Models (LMs) have sparked a debate on whether such models can learn systematic reasoning principles during pre-training or merely exploit superficial patterns in the training data. This paper presents a mechanistic interpretation of syllogistic reasoning in LMs to further enhance our understanding of internal dynamics. Specifically, we present a methodology for circuit discovery aimed at disentangling content-independent reasoning mechanisms from world knowledge acquired during pre-training. Through two distinct intervention methods, we uncover a sufficient and necessary circuit involving middle-term suppression that elucidates how LMs transfer information to derive valid conclusions from premises. Furthermore, we investigate how belief biases manifest in syllogistic reasoning, finding evidence of partial contamination from additional attention heads responsible for encoding commonsense and contextualized knowledge. Finally, we explore the generalization of the discovered mechanisms across various syllogistic schemes and model sizes, finding that the identified circuit is sufficient and necessary for all the schemes on which the model achieves high downstream accuracy ($\geq$ 60\%). Overall, our findings suggest that LMs indeed learn transferable content-independent reasoning mechanisms, but that, at the same time, such mechanisms do not involve generalisable and abstract logical primitives, being susceptible to contamination by the same world knowledge acquired during pre-training.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents our method for the generative track of The First Dataset Distillation Challenge at ECCV 2024. Since the diffusion model has become the mainstay of generative models because of its high-quality generative effects, we focus on distillation methods based on the diffusion model. Considering that the track can only generate a fixed number of images in 10 minutes using a generative model for CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets, we need to use a generative model that can generate images at high speed. In this study, we proposed a novel generative dataset distillation method based on Stable Diffusion. Specifically, we use the SDXL-Turbo model which can generate images at high speed and quality. Compared to other diffusion models that can only generate images per class (IPC) = 1, our method can achieve an IPC = 10 for Tiny-ImageNet and an IPC = 20 for CIFAR-100, respectively. Additionally, to generate high-quality distilled datasets for CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, we use the class information as text prompts and post data augmentation for the SDXL-Turbo model. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, and we achieved third place in the generative track of the ECCV 2024 DD Challenge.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timothy Heightman, Edward Jiang, Antonio Ac\'in</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and characterising quantum many-body dynamics remains a significant challenge due to both the exponential complexity required to represent quantum many-body Hamiltonians, and the need to accurately track states in time under the action of such Hamiltonians. This inherent complexity limits our ability to characterise quantum many-body systems, highlighting the need for innovative approaches to unlock their full potential. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method to solve the Hamiltonian Learning (HL) problem-inferring quantum dynamics from many-body state trajectories-using Neural Differential Equations combined with an Ansatz Hamiltonian. Our method is reliably convergent, experimentally friendly, and interpretable, making it a stable solution for HL on a set of Hamiltonians previously unlearnable in the literature. In addition to this, we propose a new quantitative benchmark based on power laws, which can objectively compare the reliability and generalisation capabilities of any two HL algorithms. Finally, we benchmark our method against state-of-the-art HL algorithms with a 1D spin-1/2 chain proof of concept.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florentin Bieder, Paul Friedrich, H\'el\`ene Corbaz, Alicia Durrer, Julia Wolleb, Philippe C. Cattin</p>
<p>Abstract: The human brain undergoes rapid development during the third trimester of pregnancy. In this work, we model the neonatal development of the infant brain in this age range. As a basis, we use MR images of preterm- and term-birth neonates from the developing human connectome project (dHCP). We propose a neural network, specifically an implicit neural representation (INR), to predict 2D- and 3D images of varying time points. In order to model a subject-specific development process, it is necessary to disentangle the age from the subjects' identity in the latent space of the INR. We propose two methods, Subject Specific Latent Vectors (SSL) and Stochastic Global Latent Augmentation (SGLA), enabling this disentanglement. We perform an analysis of the results and compare our proposed model to an age-conditioned denoising diffusion model as a baseline. We also show that our method can be applied in a memory-efficient way, which is especially important for 3D data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjie Fu, Huandong Wang, Chen Gao, Guanghua Liu, Yong Li, Tao Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing parameters and expansive dataset of large language models (LLMs) highlight the urgent demand for a technical solution to audit the underlying privacy risks and copyright issues associated with LLMs. Existing studies have partially addressed this need through an exploration of the pre-training data detection problem, which is an instance of a membership inference attack (MIA). This problem involves determining whether a given piece of text has been used during the pre-training phase of the target LLM. Although existing methods have designed various sophisticated MIA score functions to achieve considerable detection performance in pre-trained LLMs, how to achieve high-confidence detection and how to perform MIA on aligned LLMs remain challenging. In this paper, we propose MIA-Tuner, a novel instruction-based MIA method, which instructs LLMs themselves to serve as a more precise pre-training data detector internally, rather than design an external MIA score function. Furthermore, we design two instruction-based safeguards to respectively mitigate the privacy risks brought by the existing methods and MIA-Tuner. To comprehensively evaluate the most recent state-of-the-art LLMs, we collect a more up-to-date MIA benchmark dataset, named WIKIMIA-24, to replace the widely adopted benchmark WIKIMIA. We conduct extensive experiments across various aligned and unaligned LLMs over the two benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that MIA-Tuner increases the AUC of MIAs from 0.7 to a significantly high level of 0.9.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brandon J. O'Connell, Max D. Champneys, Timothy J. Rogers</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of operational modal analysis (OMA), obtained modal information is frequently used to assess the current state of aerospace, mechanical, offshore and civil structures. However, the stochasticity of operational systems and the lack of forcing information can lead to inconsistent results. Quantifying the uncertainty of the recovered modal parameters through OMA is therefore of significant value. In this article, a new perspective on Bayesian OMA is proposed: a Bayesian stochastic subspace identification (SSI) algorithm. Distinct from existing approaches to Bayesian OMA, a hierarchical probabilistic model is embedded at the core of covariance-driven SSI. Through substitution of canonical correlation analysis with a Bayesian equivalent, posterior distributions over the modal properties are obtained. Two inference schemes are presented for the proposed Bayesian formulation: Markov Chain Monte Carlo and variational Bayes. Two case studies are then explored. The first is benchmark study using data from a simulated, multi degree-of-freedom, linear system. Following application of Bayesian SSI, it is shown that the same posterior is targeted and recovered by both inference schemes, with good agreement between the posterior mean and the conventional SSI result. The second study applies the variational form to data obtained from an in-service structure: The Z24 bridge. The results of this study are presented at single model orders, and then using a stabilisation diagram. The recovered posterior uncertainty is presented and compared to the classic SSI result. It is observed that the posterior distributions with mean values coinciding with the natural frequencies exhibit lower variance than values situated away from the natural frequencies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> The Tien Mai</p>
<p>Abstract: PAC-Bayesian bounds have proven to be a valuable tool for deriving generalization bounds and for designing new learning algorithms in machine learning. However, it typically focus on providing generalization bounds with respect to a chosen loss function. In classification tasks, due to the non-convex nature of the 0-1 loss, a convex surrogate loss is often used, and thus current PAC-Bayesian bounds are primarily specified for this convex surrogate. This work shifts its focus to providing misclassification excess risk bounds for PAC-Bayesian classification when using a convex surrogate loss. Our key ingredient here is to leverage PAC-Bayesian relative bounds in expectation rather than relying on PAC-Bayesian bounds in probability. We demonstrate our approach in several important applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianzhen Luo, Yixuan Wang, Qingfu Zhu, Zhiming Zhang, Xuanyu Zhang, Qing Yang, Dongliang Xu, Wanxiang Che</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth in the parameters of large language models (LLMs) has made inference latency a fundamental bottleneck, limiting broader application of LLMs. Speculative decoding represents a lossless approach to accelerate inference through a guess-and-verify paradigm, leveraging the parallel capabilities of modern hardware. Some speculative decoding methods rely on additional structures to guess draft tokens, such as small models or parameter-efficient architectures, which need extra training before use. Alternatively, retrieval-based train-free techniques build libraries from pre-existing corpora or by n-gram generation. However, they face challenges like large storage requirements, time-consuming retrieval, and limited adaptability. Observing that candidate tokens generated during the decoding process are likely to reoccur in future sequences, we propose Token Recycling. This approach stores candidate tokens in an adjacency matrix and employs a breadth-first search (BFS)-like algorithm on the matrix to construct a draft tree. The tree is then validated through tree attention. New candidate tokens from the decoding process are then used to update the matrix. Token Recycling requires \textless2MB of additional storage and achieves approximately 2x speedup across all sizes of LLMs. It significantly outperforms existing train-free methods by 30\% and even a training method by 25\%. It can be directly applied to any existing LLMs and tasks without the need for adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maris F. L. Galesloot, Marnix Suilen, Thiago D. Sim\~ao, Steven Carr, Matthijs T. J. Spaan, Ufuk Topcu, Nils Jansen</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust partially observable Markov decision processes (robust POMDPs) extend classical POMDPs to handle additional uncertainty on the transition and observation probabilities via so-called uncertainty sets. Policies for robust POMDPs must not only be memory-based to account for partial observability but also robust against model uncertainty to account for the worst-case instances from the uncertainty sets. We propose the pessimistic iterative planning (PIP) framework, which finds robust memory-based policies for robust POMDPs. PIP alternates between two main steps: (1) selecting an adversarial (non-robust) POMDP via worst-case probability instances from the uncertainty sets; and (2) computing a finite-state controller (FSC) for this adversarial POMDP. We evaluate the performance of this FSC on the original robust POMDP and use this evaluation in step (1) to select the next adversarial POMDP. Within PIP, we propose the rFSCNet algorithm. In each iteration, rFSCNet finds an FSC through a recurrent neural network trained using supervision policies optimized for the adversarial POMDP. The empirical evaluation in four benchmark environments showcases improved robustness against a baseline method in an ablation study and competitive performance compared to a state-of-the-art robust POMDP solver.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Omeiza, Raunak Bhattacharyya, Marina Jirotka, Nick Hawes, Lars Kunze</p>
<p>Abstract: Transparency in automated systems could be afforded through the provision of intelligible explanations. While transparency is desirable, might it lead to catastrophic outcomes (such as anxiety), that could outweigh its benefits? It's quite unclear how the specificity of explanations (level of transparency) influences recipients, especially in autonomous driving (AD). In this work, we examined the effects of transparency mediated through varying levels of explanation specificity in AD. We first extended a data-driven explainer model by adding a rule-based option for explanation generation in AD, and then conducted a within-subject lab study with 39 participants in an immersive driving simulator to study the effect of the resulting explanations. Specifically, our investigation focused on: (1) how different types of explanations (specific vs. abstract) affect passengers' perceived safety, anxiety, and willingness to take control of the vehicle when the vehicle perception system makes erroneous predictions; and (2) the relationship between passengers' behavioural cues and their feelings during the autonomous drives. Our findings showed that passengers felt safer with specific explanations when the vehicle's perception system had minimal errors, while abstract explanations that hid perception errors led to lower feelings of safety. Anxiety levels increased when specific explanations revealed perception system errors (high transparency). We found no significant link between passengers' visual patterns and their anxiety levels. Our study suggests that passengers prefer clear and specific explanations (high transparency) when they originate from autonomous vehicles (AVs) with optimal perceptual accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel de Marchi, Michael Kosorok, Scott de Marchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Shapley values have seen widespread use in machine learning as a way to explain model predictions and estimate the importance of covariates. Accurately explaining models is critical in real-world models to both aid in decision making and to infer the properties of the true data-generating process (DGP). In this paper, we demonstrate that while model-based Shapley values might be accurate explainers of model predictions, machine learning models themselves are often poor explainers of the DGP even if the model is highly accurate. Particularly in the presence of interrelated or noisy variables, the output of a highly predictive model may fail to account for these relationships. This implies explanations of a trained model's behavior may fail to provide meaningful insight into the DGP. In this paper we introduce a novel variable importance algorithm, Shapley Marginal Surplus for Strong Models, that samples the space of possible models to come up with an inferential measure of feature importance. We compare this method to other popular feature importance methods, both Shapley-based and non-Shapley based, and demonstrate significant outperformance in inferential capabilities relative to other methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In pathological research, education, and clinical practice, the decision-making process based on pathological images is critically important. This significance extends to digital pathology image analysis: its adequacy is demonstrated by the extensive information contained within tissue structures, which is essential for accurate cancer classification and grading. Additionally, its necessity is highlighted by the inherent requirement for interpretability in the conclusions generated by algorithms. For humans, determining tumor type and grade typically involves multi-scale analysis, which presents a significant challenge for AI algorithms. Traditional patch-based methods are inadequate for modeling such complex structures, as they fail to capture the intricate, multi-scale information inherent in whole slide images. Consequently, there is a pressing need for advanced AI techniques capable of efficiently and accurately replicating this complex analytical process. To address this issue, we introduce HistoGym, an open-source reinforcement learning environment for histopathological image analysis. Following OpenAI Gym APIs, HistoGym aims to foster whole slide image diagnosis by mimicking the real-life processes of doctors. Leveraging the pyramid feature of WSIs and the OpenSlide API, HistoGym provides a unified framework for various clinical tasks, including tumor detection and classification. We detail the observation, action, and reward specifications tailored for the histopathological image analysis domain and provide an open-source Python-based interface for both clinicians and researchers. To accommodate different clinical demands, we offer various scenarios for different organs and cancers, including both WSI-based and selected region-based scenarios, showcasing several noteworthy results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumanth Prabhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-ensembling techniques with diverse reasoning paths such as Self-Consistency have demonstrated remarkable gains in accuracy for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, such techniques depend on the availability of an accurate answer extraction process to aggregate across multiple outputs. Moreover, they acquire higher inference cost, in comparison to Greedy Decoding, due to generation of relatively higher number of output tokens. Research has shown that the free form text outputs from Self-Consistency can be aggregated reliably using LLMs to produce the final output. Additionally, recent advancements in LLM inference have demonstrated that usage of diverse exemplars in prompts have the ability to induce diversity in the LLM outputs. Such proven techniques can be easily extended to self-ensembling based approaches to achieve enhanced results in text generation. In this paper, we introduce PEDAL (Prompts based on Exemplar Diversity Aggregated using LLMs), a hybrid self-ensembling approach, that combines the strengths of diverse exemplar based prompts and LLM based aggregation to achieve improvement in overall performance. On the publicly available SVAMP and ARC datasets, our experiments reveal that PEDAL can achieve better accuracy than Greedy Decoding based strategies with lower inference cost compared to Self Consistency based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caleb Lammers, Miles Cranmer, Sam Hadden, Shirley Ho, Norman Murray, Daniel Tamayo</p>
<p>Abstract: Constraining planet formation models based on the observed exoplanet population requires generating large samples of synthetic planetary systems, which can be computationally prohibitive. A significant bottleneck is simulating the giant impact phase, during which planetary embryos evolve gravitationally and combine to form planets, which may themselves experience later collisions. To accelerate giant impact simulations, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to predicting collisional outcomes in multiplanet systems. Trained on more than 500,000 $N$-body simulations of three-planet systems, we develop an ML model that can accurately predict which two planets will experience a collision, along with the state of the post-collision planets, from a short integration of the system's initial conditions. Our model greatly improves on non-ML baselines that rely on metrics from dynamics theory, which struggle to accurately predict which pair of planets will experience a collision. By combining with a model for predicting long-term stability, we create an efficient ML-based giant impact emulator, which can predict the outcomes of giant impact simulations with a speedup of up to four orders of magnitude. We expect our model to enable analyses that would not otherwise be computationally feasible. As such, we release our full training code, along with an easy-to-use API for our collision outcome model and giant impact emulator.</p>

Nonetheless, current endeavors mostly focus on Euclidean data, and its formulation for graph-structured data is not clear and remains under-explored, given two-fold fundamental challenges: 1) the inter-connection among nodes in one graph, which induces non-IID generation of data points even under the same environment, and 2) the structural information in the input graph, which is also informative for prediction. In this paper, we formulate the OOD problem on graphs and develop a new invariant learning approach, Explore-to-Extrapolate Risk Minimization (EERM), that facilitates graph neural networks to leverage invariance principles for prediction. EERM resorts to multiple context explorers (specified as graph structure editers in our case) that are adversarially trained to maximize the variance of risks from multiple virtual environments. Such a design enables the model to extrapolate from a single observed environment which is the common case for node-level prediction. We prove the validity of our method by theoretically showing its guarantee of a valid OOD solution and further demonstrate its power on various real-world datasets for handling distribution shifts from artificial spurious features, cross-domain transfers and dynamic graph evolution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony Geglio, Eisa Hedayati, Mark Tascillo, Dyche Anderson, Jonathan Barker, Timothy C. Havens</p>
<p>Abstract: This work investigates a practical and novel method for automated unsupervised fault detection in vehicles using a fully convolutional autoencoder. The results demonstrate the algorithm we developed can detect anomalies which correspond to powertrain faults by learning patterns in the multivariate time-series data of hybrid-electric vehicle powertrain sensors. Data was collected by engineers at Ford Motor Company from numerous sensors over several drive cycle variations. This study provides evidence of the anomaly detecting capability of our trained autoencoder and investigates the suitability of our autoencoder relative to other unsupervised methods for automatic fault detection in this data set. Preliminary results of testing the autoencoder on the powertrain sensor data indicate the data reconstruction approach availed by the autoencoder is a robust technique for identifying the abnormal sequences in the multivariate series. These results support that irregularities in hybrid-electric vehicles' powertrains are conveyed via sensor signals in the embedded electronic communication system, and therefore can be identified mechanistically with a trained algorithm. Additional unsupervised methods are tested and show the autoencoder performs better at fault detection than outlier detectors and other novel deep learning techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Beck, Risto Vuorio, Evan Zheran Liu, Zheng Xiong, Luisa Zintgraf, Chelsea Finn, Shimon Whiteson</p>
<p>Abstract: While deep reinforcement learning (RL) has fueled multiple high-profile successes in machine learning, it is held back from more widespread adoption by its often poor data efficiency and the limited generality of the policies it produces. A promising approach for alleviating these limitations is to cast the development of better RL algorithms as a machine learning problem itself in a process called meta-RL. Meta-RL is most commonly studied in a problem setting where, given a distribution of tasks, the goal is to learn a policy that is capable of adapting to any new task from the task distribution with as little data as possible. In this survey, we describe the meta-RL problem setting in detail as well as its major variations. We discuss how, at a high level, meta-RL research can be clustered based on the presence of a task distribution and the learning budget available for each individual task. Using these clusters, we then survey meta-RL algorithms and applications. We conclude by presenting the open problems on the path to making meta-RL part of the standard toolbox for a deep RL practitioner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongshuo Zong, Oisin Mac Aodha, Timothy Hospedales</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning, which aims to understand and analyze information from multiple modalities, has achieved substantial progress in the supervised regime in recent years. However, the heavy dependence on data paired with expensive human annotations impedes scaling up models. Meanwhile, given the availability of large-scale unannotated data in the wild, self-supervised learning has become an attractive strategy to alleviate the annotation bottleneck. Building on these two directions, self-supervised multimodal learning (SSML) provides ways to learn from raw multimodal data. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in SSML, in which we elucidate three major challenges intrinsic to self-supervised learning with multimodal data: (1) learning representations from multimodal data without labels, (2) fusion of different modalities, and (3) learning with unaligned data. We then detail existing solutions to these challenges. Specifically, we consider (1) objectives for learning from multimodal unlabeled data via self-supervision, (2) model architectures from the perspective of different multimodal fusion strategies, and (3) pair-free learning strategies for coarse-grained and fine-grained alignment. We also review real-world applications of SSML algorithms in diverse fields such as healthcare, remote sensing, and machine translation. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions for SSML.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qitian Wu, Wentao Zhao, Chenxiao Yang, Hengrui Zhang, Fan Nie, Haitian Jiang, Yatao Bian, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning representations on large-sized graphs is a long-standing challenge due to the inter-dependence nature involved in massive data points. Transformers, as an emerging class of foundation encoders for graph-structured data, have shown promising performance on small graphs due to its global attention capable of capturing all-pair influence beyond neighboring nodes. Even so, existing approaches tend to inherit the spirit of Transformers in language and vision tasks, and embrace complicated models by stacking deep multi-head attentions. In this paper, we critically demonstrate that even using a one-layer attention can bring up surprisingly competitive performance across node property prediction benchmarks where node numbers range from thousand-level to billion-level. This encourages us to rethink the design philosophy for Transformers on large graphs, where the global attention is a computation overhead hindering the scalability. We frame the proposed scheme as Simplified Graph Transformers (SGFormer), which is empowered by a simple attention model that can efficiently propagate information among arbitrary nodes in one layer. SGFormer requires none of positional encodings, feature/graph pre-processing or augmented loss. Empirically, SGFormer successfully scales to the web-scale graph ogbn-papers100M and yields up to 141x inference acceleration over SOTA Transformers on medium-sized graphs. Beyond current results, we believe the proposed methodology alone enlightens a new technical path of independent interest for building Transformers on large graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Schoepf, Jack Foster, Alexandra Brintrup</p>
<p>Abstract: Organisations often struggle to identify the causes of change in metrics such as product quality and delivery duration. This task becomes increasingly challenging when the cause lies outside of company borders in multi-echelon supply chains that are only partially observable. Although traditional supply chain management has advocated for data sharing to gain better insights, this does not take place in practice due to data privacy concerns. We propose the use of explainable artificial intelligence for decentralised computing of estimated contributions to a metric of interest in a multi-stage production process. This approach mitigates the need to convince supply chain actors to share data, as all computations occur in a decentralised manner. Our method is empirically validated using data collected from a real multi-stage manufacturing process. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting the source of quality variations compared to a centralised approach using Shapley additive explanations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhang Tian, Bernie Chen, Allan Guo, Shiyi Jiang, Anru R. Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are rich sources of patient-level data, offering valuable resources for medical data analysis. However, privacy concerns often restrict access to EHRs, hindering downstream analysis. Current EHR de-identification methods are flawed and can lead to potential privacy leakage. Additionally, existing publicly available EHR databases are limited, preventing the advancement of medical research using EHR. This study aims to overcome these challenges by generating realistic and privacy-preserving synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) time series efficiently. We introduce a new method for generating diverse and realistic synthetic EHR time series data using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). We conducted experiments on six databases: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III and IV (MIMIC-III/IV), the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU), and non-EHR datasets on Stocks and Energy. We compared our proposed method with eight existing methods. Our results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of data fidelity while requiring less training effort. Additionally, data generated by our method yields a lower discriminative accuracy compared to other baseline methods, indicating the proposed method can generate data with less privacy risk. The proposed diffusion-model-based method can reliably and efficiently generate synthetic EHR time series, which facilitates the downstream medical data analysis. Our numerical results show the superiority of the proposed method over all other existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Yang, Shicong Cen, Yuting Wei, Yuxin Chen, Yuejie Chi</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated reinforcement learning (RL) enables collaborative decision making of multiple distributed agents without sharing local data trajectories. In this work, we consider a multi-task setting, in which each agent has its own private reward function corresponding to different tasks, while sharing the same transition kernel of the environment. Focusing on infinite-horizon Markov decision processes, the goal is to learn a globally optimal policy that maximizes the sum of the discounted total rewards of all the agents in a decentralized manner, where each agent only communicates with its neighbors over some prescribed graph topology.
  We develop federated vanilla and entropy-regularized natural policy gradient (NPG) methods in the tabular setting under softmax parameterization, where gradient tracking is applied to estimate the global Q-function to mitigate the impact of imperfect information sharing. We establish non-asymptotic global convergence guarantees under exact policy evaluation, where the rates are nearly independent of the size of the state-action space and illuminate the impacts of network size and connectivity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that near dimension-free global convergence is established for federated multi-task RL using policy optimization. We further go beyond the tabular setting by proposing a federated natural actor critic (NAC) method for multi-task RL with function approximation, and establish its finite-time sample complexity taking the errors of function approximation into account.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenz Kummer, Samir Moustafa, Nils N. Kriege, Wilfried N. Gansterer</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior attacks on graph neural networks have mostly focused on graph poisoning and evasion, neglecting the network's weights and biases. Traditional weight-based fault injection attacks, such as bit flip attacks used for convolutional neural networks, do not consider the unique properties of graph neural networks. We propose the Injectivity Bit Flip Attack, the first bit flip attack designed specifically for graph neural networks. Our attack targets the learnable neighborhood aggregation functions in quantized message passing neural networks, degrading their ability to distinguish graph structures and losing the expressivity of the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Our findings suggest that exploiting mathematical properties specific to certain graph neural network architectures can significantly increase their vulnerability to bit flip attacks. Injectivity Bit Flip Attacks can degrade the maximal expressive Graph Isomorphism Networks trained on various graph property prediction datasets to random output by flipping only a small fraction of the network's bits, demonstrating its higher destructive power compared to a bit flip attack transferred from convolutional neural networks. Our attack is transparent and motivated by theoretical insights which are confirmed by extensive empirical results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ray Zirui Zhang, Ivan Ezhov, Michal Balcerak, Andy Zhu, Benedikt Wiestler, Bjoern Menze, John S. Lowengrub</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting the infiltration of Glioblastoma (GBM) from medical MRI scans is crucial for understanding tumor growth dynamics and designing personalized radiotherapy treatment plans.Mathematical models of GBM growth can complement the data in the prediction of spatial distributions of tumor cells. However, this requires estimating patient-specific parameters of the model from clinical data, which is a challenging inverse problem due to limited temporal data and the limited time between imaging and diagnosis. This work proposes a method that uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to estimate patient-specific parameters of a reaction-diffusion PDE model of GBM growth from a single 3D structural MRI snapshot. PINNs embed both the data and the PDE into a loss function, thus integrating theory and data. Key innovations include the identification and estimation of characteristic non-dimensional parameters, a pre-training step that utilizes the non-dimensional parameters and a fine-tuning step to determine the patient specific parameters. Additionally, the diffuse domain method is employed to handle the complex brain geometry within the PINN framework. Our method is validated both on synthetic and patient datasets, and shows promise for real-time parametric inference in the clinical setting for personalized GBM treatment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujin Choi, Jinseong Park, Hoki Kim, Jaewook Lee, Saeroom Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown their effectiveness in generation tasks by well-approximating the underlying probability distribution. However, diffusion models are known to suffer from an amplified inherent bias from the training data in terms of fairness. While the sampling process of diffusion models can be controlled by conditional guidance, previous works have attempted to find empirical guidance to achieve quantitative fairness. To address this limitation, we propose a fairness-aware sampling method called \textit{attribute switching} mechanism for diffusion models. Without additional training, the proposed sampling can obfuscate sensitive attributes in generated data without relying on classifiers. We mathematically prove and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two key aspects: (i) the generation of fair data and (ii) the preservation of the utility of the generated data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gregory Hyde, Eugene Santos Jr</p>
<p>Abstract: Many Reinforcement Learning algorithms assume a Markov reward function to guarantee optimality. However, not all reward functions are Markov. This paper proposes a framework for mapping non-Markov reward functions into equivalent Markov ones by learning specialized reward automata, Reward Machines. Unlike the general practice of learning Reward Machines, we do not require a set of high-level propositional symbols from which to learn. Rather, we learn hidden triggers, directly from data, that construct them. We demonstrate the importance of learning Reward Machines over their Deterministic Finite-State Automata counterparts given their ability to model reward dependencies. We formalize this distinction in our learning objective. Our mapping process is constructed as an Integer Linear Programming problem. We prove that our mappings form a suitable proxy for maximizing reward expectations. We empirically validate our approach by learning black-box, non-Markov reward functions in the Officeworld domain. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of learning reward dependencies in a new domain, Breakfastworld.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixiao Wang, Dong Qiao, Jicong Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: The discrete distribution is often used to describe complex instances in machine learning, such as images, sequences, and documents. Traditionally, clustering of discrete distributions (D2C) has been approached using Wasserstein barycenter methods. These methods operate under the assumption that clusters can be well-represented by barycenters, which is seldom true in many real-world applications. Additionally, these methods are not scalable for large datasets due to the high computational cost of calculating Wasserstein barycenters. In this work, we explore the feasibility of using spectral clustering combined with distribution affinity measures (e.g., maximum mean discrepancy and Wasserstein distance) to cluster discrete distributions. We demonstrate that these methods can be more accurate and efficient than barycenter methods. To further enhance scalability, we propose using linear optimal transport to construct affinity matrices efficiently for large datasets. We provide theoretical guarantees for the success of our methods in clustering distributions. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show that our methods outperform existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Yang, Weimin Tan, Yuqi Sun, Bo Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models, pre-trained on massive datasets, have achieved unprecedented generalizability. However, is it truly necessary to involve such vast amounts of data in pre-training, consuming extensive computational resources? This paper introduces data-effective learning, aiming to use data in the most impactful way to pre-train foundation models. This involves strategies that focus on data quality rather than quantity, ensuring the data used for training has high informational value. Data-effective learning plays a profound role in accelerating foundation model training, reducing computational costs, and saving data storage, which is very important as the volume of medical data in recent years has grown beyond many people's expectations. However, due to the lack of standards and comprehensive benchmarks, research on medical data-effective learning is poorly studied. To address this gap, our paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark specifically for evaluating data-effective learning in the medical field. This benchmark includes a dataset with millions of data samples from 31 medical centers (DataDEL), a baseline method for comparison (MedDEL), and a new evaluation metric (NormDEL) to objectively measure data-effective learning performance. Our extensive experimental results show the baseline MedDEL can achieve performance comparable to the original large dataset with only 5% of the data. Establishing such an open data-effective learning benchmark is crucial for the medical foundation model research community because it facilitates efficient data use, promotes collaborative breakthroughs, and fosters the development of cost-effective, scalable, and impactful healthcare solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data-driven weather forecast based on machine learning (ML) has experienced rapid development and demonstrated superior performance in the global medium-range forecast compared to traditional physics-based dynamical models. However, most of these ML models struggle with accurately predicting extreme weather, which is related to training loss and the uncertainty of weather systems. Through mathematical analysis, we prove that the use of symmetric losses, such as the Mean Squared Error (MSE), leads to biased predictions and underestimation of extreme values. To address this issue, we introduce Exloss, a novel loss function that performs asymmetric optimization and highlights extreme values to obtain accurate extreme weather forecast. Beyond the evolution in training loss, we introduce a training-free extreme value enhancement module named ExBooster, which captures the uncertainty in prediction outcomes by employing multiple random samples, thereby increasing the hit rate of low-probability extreme events. Combined with an advanced global weather forecast model, extensive experiments show that our solution can achieve state-of-the-art performance in extreme weather prediction, while maintaining the overall forecast accuracy comparable to the top medium-range forecast models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shayan Shirahmad Gale Bagi, Zahra Gharaee, Oliver Schulte, Mark Crowley</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning causal representations from observational and interventional data in the absence of known ground-truth graph structures necessitates implicit latent causal representation learning. Implicit learning of causal mechanisms typically involves two categories of interventional data: hard and soft interventions. In real-world scenarios, soft interventions are often more realistic than hard interventions, as the latter require fully controlled environments. Unlike hard interventions, which directly force changes in a causal variable, soft interventions exert influence indirectly by affecting the causal mechanism. However, the subtlety of soft interventions impose several challenges for learning causal models. One challenge is that soft intervention's effects are ambiguous, since parental relations remain intact. In this paper, we tackle the challenges of learning causal models using soft interventions while retaining implicit modelling. We propose ICLR-SM, which models the effects of soft interventions by employing a causal mechanism switch variable designed to toggle between different causal mechanisms. In our experiments, we consistently observe improved learning of identifiable, causal representations, compared to baseline approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qitian Wu, Fan Nie, Chenxiao Yang, Tianyi Bao, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization has gained increasing attentions for learning on graphs, as graph neural networks (GNNs) often exhibit performance degradation with distribution shifts. The challenge is that distribution shifts on graphs involve intricate interconnections between nodes, and the environment labels are often absent in data. In this paper, we adopt a bottom-up data-generative perspective and reveal a key observation through causal analysis: the crux of GNNs' failure in OOD generalization lies in the latent confounding bias from the environment. The latter misguides the model to leverage environment-sensitive correlations between ego-graph features and target nodes' labels, resulting in undesirable generalization on new unseen nodes. Built upon this analysis, we introduce a conceptually simple yet principled approach for training robust GNNs under node-level distribution shifts, without prior knowledge of environment labels. Our method resorts to a new learning objective derived from causal inference that coordinates an environment estimator and a mixture-of-expert GNN predictor. The new approach can counteract the confounding bias in training data and facilitate learning generalizable predictive relations. Extensive experiment demonstrates that our model can effectively enhance generalization with various types of distribution shifts and yield up to 27.4\% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-arts on graph OOD generalization benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Domenique Zipperling, Simeon Allmendinger, Lukas Struppek, Niklas K\"uhl</p>
<p>Abstract: In the landscape of generative artificial intelligence, diffusion-based models present challenges for socio-technical systems in data requirements and privacy. Traditional approaches like federated learning distribute the learning process but strain individual clients, especially with constrained resources (e.g., edge devices). In response to these challenges, we introduce CollaFuse, a novel framework inspired by split learning. Tailored for efficient and collaborative use of denoising diffusion probabilistic models, CollaFuse enables shared server training and inference, alleviating client computational burdens. This is achieved by retaining data and computationally inexpensive GPU processes locally at each client while outsourcing the computationally expensive processes to the shared server. Demonstrated in a healthcare context, CollaFuse enhances privacy by highly reducing the need for sensitive information sharing. These capabilities hold the potential to impact various application areas, such as the design of edge computing solutions, healthcare research, or autonomous driving. In essence, our work advances distributed machine learning, shaping the future of collaborative GenAI networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Feature selection is a crucial task in settings where data is high-dimensional or acquiring the full set of features is costly. Recent developments in neural network-based embedded feature selection show promising results across a wide range of applications. Concrete Autoencoders (CAEs), considered state-of-the-art in embedded feature selection, may struggle to achieve stable joint optimization, hurting their training time and generalization. In this work, we identify that this instability is correlated with the CAE learning duplicate selections. To remedy this, we propose a simple and effective improvement: Indirectly Parameterized CAEs (IP-CAEs). IP-CAEs learn an embedding and a mapping from it to the Gumbel-Softmax distributions' parameters. Despite being simple to implement, IP-CAE exhibits significant and consistent improvements over CAE in both generalization and training time across several datasets for reconstruction and classification. Unlike CAE, IP-CAE effectively leverages non-linear relationships and does not require retraining the jointly optimized decoder. Furthermore, our approach is, in principle, generalizable to Gumbel-Softmax distributions beyond feature selection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effectively representing heterogeneous tabular datasets for meta-learning purposes remains an open problem. Previous approaches rely on predefined meta-features, for example, statistical measures or landmarkers. The emergence of dataset encoders opens new possibilities for the extraction of meta-features because they do not involve any handmade design. Moreover, they are proven to generate dataset representations with desired spatial properties. In this research, we evaluate an encoder-based approach to one of the most established meta-tasks - warm-starting of the Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization. To broaden our analysis we introduce a new approach for representation learning on tabular data based on [Tomoharu Iwata and Atsutoshi Kumagai. Meta-learning from Tasks with Heterogeneous Attribute Spaces. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020]. The validation on over 100 datasets from UCI and an independent metaMIMIC set of datasets highlights the nuanced challenges in representation learning. We show that general representations may not suffice for some meta-tasks where requirements are not explicitly considered during extraction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungmin Cha, Kyunghyun Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we argue that the conventional evaluation protocol in continual learning (CL) research deviates from the fundamental principle in machine learning evaluation. The primary objective of CL algorithm is to balance the trade-off between plasticity (learning new knowledge from new tasks) and stability (retaining knowledge from previous tasks). To evaluate it, a CL scenario is constructed by using a benchmark dataset, where a neural network model is continually trained on the training data of each task, and the best hyperparameters for a CL algorithm are selected based on validation data.The final evaluation involves assessing the model trained with these hyperparameters on the test data from the same scenario. This evaluation protocol primarily aims to assess how well a CL algorithm performs on unseen data within that specific scenario. However, to accurately evaluate the CL algorithm, the focus should be on assessing generalizability of each algorithm's CL capacity to handle unseen scenarios. To achieve this evaluation goal, we propose a revised evaluation protocol. Our protocol consists of two phases: hyperparameter tuning and evaluation. Both phases share the same scenario configuration (e.g., the number of tasks) but the scenarios for each phase are generated from different datasets. During the hyperparameter tuning phase, the best hyperparameters are identified, which are then used to train the model using the CL algorithm in the evaluation phase. Finally, the result from this phase is reported as the final evaluation. We apply the proposed evaluation protocol to class-incremental learning algorithms, both with and without a pretrained model. Through extensive experiments involving approximately 5000 trials, we demonstrate that most state-of-the-art algorithms fail to exhibit the reported performance, revealing a lack of generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baoyu Jing, Dawei Zhou, Kan Ren, Carl Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatiotemporal time series are usually collected via monitoring sensors placed at different locations, which usually contain missing values due to various mechanical failures. Imputing the missing values is crucial for analyzing time series. When recovering a specific data point, most existing methods consider all the information relevant to that point regardless of the cause-and-effect relationship. During data collection, it is inevitable that some unknown confounders are included, e.g., background noise in time series and non-causal shortcut edges in the constructed sensor network. These confounders could open backdoor paths and establish non-causal correlations between the input and output. Over-exploiting these non-causal correlations could cause overfitting. In this paper, we first revisit spatiotemporal time series imputation from a causal perspective and show how to block the confounders via the frontdoor adjustment. Based on the results of frontdoor adjustment, we introduce a novel Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (Casper), which contains a novel Prompt Based Decoder (PBD) and a Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA). PBD could reduce the impact of confounders and SCA could discover the sparse causal relationships among embeddings. Theoretical analysis reveals that SCA discovers causal relationships based on the values of gradients. We evaluate Casper on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that Casper could outperform the baselines and could effectively discover causal relationships.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baoyu Jing, Yansen Wang, Guoxin Sui, Jing Hong, Jingrui He, Yuqing Yang, Dongsheng Li, Kan Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Contrastive Learning (CL) has become a predominant representation learning paradigm for time series. Most existing methods manually build specific CL Strategies (CLS) by human heuristics for certain datasets and tasks. However, manually developing CLS usually requires excessive prior knowledge about the data, and massive experiments to determine the detailed CL configurations. In this paper, we present an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) practice at Microsoft, which automatically learns CLS for time series datasets and tasks, namely Automated Contrastive Learning (AutoCL). We first construct a principled search space of size over $3\times10^{12}$, covering data augmentation, embedding transformation, contrastive pair construction, and contrastive losses. Further, we introduce an efficient reinforcement learning algorithm, which optimizes CLS from the performance on the validation tasks, to obtain effective CLS within the space. Experimental results on various real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoCL could automatically find the suitable CLS for the given dataset and task. From the candidate CLS found by AutoCL on several public datasets/tasks, we compose a transferable Generally Good Strategy (GGS), which has a strong performance for other datasets. We also provide empirical analysis as a guide for the future design of CLS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Lari, Reza Arablouei, Vinay Chakravarthi Gogineni, Stefan Werner</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows training machine learning models on distributed data without compromising privacy. However, FL is vulnerable to model-poisoning attacks where malicious clients tamper with their local models to manipulate the global model. In this work, we investigate the resilience of the partial-sharing online FL (PSO-Fed) algorithm against such attacks. PSO-Fed reduces communication overhead by allowing clients to share only a fraction of their model updates with the server. We demonstrate that this partial sharing mechanism has the added advantage of enhancing PSO-Fed's robustness to model-poisoning attacks. Through theoretical analysis, we show that PSO-Fed maintains convergence even under Byzantine attacks, where malicious clients inject noise into their updates. Furthermore, we derive a formula for PSO-Fed's mean square error, considering factors like stepsize, attack probability, and the number of malicious clients. Interestingly, we find a non-trivial optimal stepsize that maximizes PSO-Fed's resistance to these attacks. Extensive numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings and showcase PSO-Fed's superior performance against model-poisoning attacks compared to other leading FL algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenhui Xu, Fuxun Yu, Zirui Xu, Nathan Inkawhich, Xiang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research underscores the pivotal role of the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) feature representation field scale in determining the efficacy of models in OOD detection. Consequently, the adoption of model ensembles has emerged as a prominent strategy to augment this feature representation field, capitalizing on anticipated model diversity.
  However, our introduction of novel qualitative and quantitative model ensemble evaluation methods, specifically Loss Basin/Barrier Visualization and the Self-Coupling Index, reveals a critical drawback in existing ensemble methods. We find that these methods incorporate weights that are affine-transformable, exhibiting limited variability and thus failing to achieve the desired diversity in feature representation.
  To address this limitation, we elevate the dimensions of traditional model ensembles, incorporating various factors such as different weight initializations, data holdout, etc., into distinct supervision tasks. This innovative approach, termed Multi-Comprehension (MC) Ensemble, leverages diverse training tasks to generate distinct comprehensions of the data and labels, thereby extending the feature representation field.
  Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the MC Ensemble strategy in OOD detection compared to both the naive Deep Ensemble method and a standalone model of comparable size. This underscores the effectiveness of our proposed approach in enhancing the model's capability to detect instances outside its training distribution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omar Ghannou, Youn\`es Bennani</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-source Domain Adaptation (MDA) seeks to adapt models trained on data from multiple labeled source domains to perform effectively on an unlabeled target domain data, assuming access to sources data. To address the challenges of model adaptation and data privacy, we introduce Collaborative MDA Through Optimal Transport (CMDA-OT), a novel framework consisting of two key phases. In the first phase, each source domain is independently adapted to the target domain using optimal transport methods. In the second phase, a centralized collaborative learning architecture is employed, which aggregates the N models from the N sources without accessing their data, thereby safeguarding privacy. During this process, the server leverages a small set of pseudo-labeled samples from the target domain, known as the target validation subset, to refine and guide the adaptation. This dual-phase approach not only improves model performance on the target domain but also addresses vital privacy challenges inherent in domain adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ray Zirui Zhang, Xiaohui Xie, John S. Lowengrub</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new neural network based method for solving inverse problems for partial differential equations (PDEs) by formulating the PDE inverse problem as a bilevel optimization problem. At the upper level, we minimize the data loss with respect to the PDE parameters. At the lower level, we train a neural network to locally approximate the PDE solution operator in the neighborhood of a given set of PDE parameters, which enables an accurate approximation of the descent direction for the upper level optimization problem. The lower level loss function includes the L2 norms of both the residual and its derivative with respect to the PDE parameters. We apply gradient descent simultaneously on both the upper and lower level optimization problems, leading to an effective and fast algorithm. The method, which we refer to as BiLO (Bilevel Local Operator learning), is also able to efficiently infer unknown functions in the PDEs through the introduction of an auxiliary variable. Through extensive experiments over multiple PDE systems, we demonstrate that our method enforces strong PDE constraints, is robust to sparse and noisy data, and eliminates the need to balance the residual and the data loss, which is inherent to the soft PDE constraints in many existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A N M Nafiz Abeer, Sanket Jantre, Nathan M Urban, Byung-Jun Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep generative models have been accelerating the inverse design process in material and drug design. Unlike their counterpart property predictors in typical molecular design frameworks, generative molecular design models have seen fewer efforts on uncertainty quantification (UQ) due to computational challenges in Bayesian inference posed by their large number of parameters. In this work, we focus on the junction-tree variational autoencoder (JT-VAE), a popular model for generative molecular design, and address this issue by leveraging the low dimensional active subspace to capture the uncertainty in the model parameters. Specifically, we approximate the posterior distribution over the active subspace parameters to estimate the epistemic model uncertainty in an extremely high dimensional parameter space. The proposed UQ scheme does not require alteration of the model architecture, making it readily applicable to any pre-trained model. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the AS-based UQ and its potential impact on molecular optimization by exploring the model diversity under epistemic uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor Kolev, Rafael Rafailov, Kyle Hatch, Jiajun Wu, Chelsea Finn</p>
<p>Abstract: We tackle the problem of policy learning from expert demonstrations without a reward function. A central challenge in this space is that these policies fail upon deployment due to issues of distributional shift, environment stochasticity, or compounding errors. Adversarial imitation learning alleviates this issue but requires additional on-policy training samples for stability, which presents a challenge in realistic domains due to inefficient learning and high sample complexity. One approach to this issue is to learn a world model of the environment, and use synthetic data for policy training. While successful in prior works, we argue that this is sub-optimal due to additional distribution shifts between the learned model and the real environment. Instead, we re-frame imitation learning as a fine-tuning problem, rather than a pure reinforcement learning one. Drawing theoretical connections to offline RL and fine-tuning algorithms, we argue that standard online world model algorithms are not well suited to the imitation learning problem. We derive a principled conservative optimization bound and demonstrate empirically that it leads to improved performance on two very challenging manipulation environments from high-dimensional raw pixel observations. We set a new state-of-the-art performance on the Franka Kitchen environment from images, requiring only 10 demos on no reward labels, as well as solving a complex dexterity manipulation task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adriana Hugessen, Roger Creus Castanyer, Faisal Mohamed, Glen Berseth</p>
<p>Abstract: Both entropy-minimizing and entropy-maximizing (curiosity) objectives for unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) have been shown to be effective in different environments, depending on the environment's level of natural entropy. However, neither method alone results in an agent that will consistently learn intelligent behavior across environments. In an effort to find a single entropy-based method that will encourage emergent behaviors in any environment, we propose an agent that can adapt its objective online, depending on the entropy conditions by framing the choice as a multi-armed bandit problem. We devise a novel intrinsic feedback signal for the bandit, which captures the agent's ability to control the entropy in its environment. We demonstrate that such agents can learn to control entropy and exhibit emergent behaviors in both high- and low-entropy regimes and can learn skillful behaviors in benchmark tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ekaterina Kukleva, Vitaly Vanchurin</p>
<p>Abstract: In artificial neural networks, the activation dynamics of non-trainable variables is strongly coupled to the learning dynamics of trainable variables. During the activation pass, the boundary neurons (e.g., input neurons) are mapped to the bulk neurons (e.g., hidden neurons), and during the learning pass, both bulk and boundary neurons are mapped to changes in trainable variables (e.g., weights and biases). For example, in feed-forward neural networks, forward propagation is the activation pass and backward propagation is the learning pass. We show that a composition of the two maps establishes a duality map between a subspace of non-trainable boundary variables (e.g., dataset) and a tangent subspace of trainable variables (i.e., learning). In general, the dataset-learning duality is a complex non-linear map between high-dimensional spaces, but in a learning equilibrium, the problem can be linearized and reduced to many weakly coupled one-dimensional problems. We use the duality to study the emergence of criticality, or the power-law distributions of fluctuations of the trainable variables. In particular, we show that criticality can emerge in the learning system even from the dataset in a non-critical state, and that the power-law distribution can be modified by changing either the activation function or the loss function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seong-Hyeon Hwang, Minsu Kim, Steven Euijong Whang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of robust data augmentation for regression tasks in the presence of noisy data. Data augmentation is essential for generalizing deep learning models, but most of the techniques like the popular Mixup are primarily designed for classification tasks on image data. Recently, there are also Mixup techniques that are specialized to regression tasks like C-Mixup. In comparison to Mixup, which takes linear interpolations of pairs of samples, C-Mixup is more selective in which samples to mix based on their label distances for better regression performance. However, C-Mixup does not distinguish noisy versus clean samples, which can be problematic when mixing and lead to suboptimal model performance. At the same time, robust training has been heavily studied where the goal is to train accurate models against noisy data through multiple rounds of model training. We thus propose our data augmentation strategy RC-Mixup, which tightly integrates C-Mixup with multi-round robust training methods for a synergistic effect. In particular, C-Mixup improves robust training in identifying clean data, while robust training provides cleaner data to C-Mixup for it to perform better. A key advantage of RC-Mixup is that it is data-centric where the robust model training algorithm itself does not need to be modified, but can simply benefit from data mixing. We show in our experiments that RC-Mixup significantly outperforms C-Mixup and robust training baselines on noisy data benchmarks and can be integrated with various robust training methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity, ensuring the reproducibility of AI-driven research is critical to maintaining the reliability and integrity of security systems. This paper addresses the reproducibility crisis within the domain of adversarial robustness -- a key area in AI-based cybersecurity that focuses on defending deep neural networks against malicious perturbations. Through a detailed case study, we attempt to validate results from prior work on certified robustness using the VeriGauge toolkit, revealing significant challenges due to software and hardware incompatibilities, version conflicts, and obsolescence. Our findings underscore the urgent need for standardized methodologies, containerization, and comprehensive documentation to ensure the reproducibility of AI models deployed in critical cybersecurity applications. By tackling these reproducibility challenges, we aim to contribute to the broader discourse on securing AI systems against advanced persistent threats, enhancing network and IoT security, and protecting critical infrastructure. This work advocates for a concerted effort within the research community to prioritize reproducibility, thereby strengthening the foundation upon which future cybersecurity advancements are built.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Schoepf, Jack Foster, Alexandra Brintrup</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks by malicious actors on machine learning systems, such as introducing poison triggers into training datasets, pose significant risks. The challenge in resolving such an attack arises in practice when only a subset of the poisoned data can be identified. This necessitates the development of methods to remove, i.e. unlearn, poison triggers from already trained models with only a subset of the poison data available. The requirements for this task significantly deviate from privacy-focused unlearning where all of the data to be forgotten by the model is known. Previous work has shown that the undiscovered poisoned samples lead to a failure of established unlearning methods, with only one method, Selective Synaptic Dampening (SSD), showing limited success. Even full retraining, after the removal of the identified poison, cannot address this challenge as the undiscovered poison samples lead to a reintroduction of the poison trigger in the model. Our work addresses two key challenges to advance the state of the art in poison unlearning. First, we introduce a novel outlier-resistant method, based on SSD, that significantly improves model protection and unlearning performance. Second, we introduce Poison Trigger Neutralisation (PTN) search, a fast, parallelisable, hyperparameter search that utilises the characteristic "unlearning versus model protection" trade-off to find suitable hyperparameters in settings where the forget set size is unknown and the retain set is contaminated. We benchmark our contributions using ResNet-9 on CIFAR10 and WideResNet-28x10 on CIFAR100. Experimental results show that our method heals 93.72% of poison compared to SSD with 83.41% and full retraining with 40.68%. We achieve this while also lowering the average model accuracy drop caused by unlearning from 5.68% (SSD) to 1.41% (ours).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy Kedziora</p>
<p>Abstract: In machine learning ensembles predictions from multiple models are aggregated. Despite widespread use and strong performance of ensembles in applied problems little is known about the mathematical properties of aggregating models and associated consequences for safe, explainable use of such models. In this paper we prove a theorem that shows that any ensemble will exhibit at least one of the following forms of prediction instability. It will either ignore agreement among all underlying models, change its mind when none of the underlying models have done so, or be manipulable through inclusion or exclusion of options it would never actually predict. As a consequence, ensemble aggregation procedures will always need to balance the benefits of information use against the risk of these prediction instabilities. This analysis also sheds light on what specific forms of prediction instability to expect from particular ensemble algorithms; for example popular tree ensembles like random forest, or xgboost will violate basic, intuitive fairness properties. Finally, we show that this can be ameliorated by using consistent models in asymptotic conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Owing to their remarkable representation capabilities for heterogeneous graph data, Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted in many critical real-world domains such as recommendation systems and medical analysis. Prior to their practical application, identifying the optimal HGNN model parameters tailored to specific tasks through extensive training is a time-consuming and costly process. To enhance the efficiency of HGNN training, it is essential to characterize and analyze the execution semantics and patterns within the training process to identify performance bottlenecks. In this study, we conduct an in-depth quantification and analysis of two mainstream HGNN training scenarios, including single-GPU and multi-GPU distributed training. Based on the characterization results, we disclose the performance bottlenecks and their underlying causes in different HGNN training scenarios and provide optimization guidelines from both software and hardware perspectives.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose DropKAN (Dropout Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks) a regularization method that prevents co-adaptation of activation function weights in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). DropKAN functions by embedding the drop mask directly within the KAN layer, randomly masking the outputs of some activations within the KANs' computation graph. We show that this simple procedure that require minimal coding effort has a regularizing effect and consistently lead to better generalization of KANs. We analyze the adaptation of the standard Dropout with KANs and demonstrate that Dropout applied to KANs' neurons can lead to unpredictable behavior in the feedforward pass. We carry an empirical study with real world Machine Learning datasets to validate our findings. Our results suggest that DropKAN is consistently a better alternative to using standard Dropout with KANs, and improves the generalization performance of KANs.

<p>Abstract: Are score function estimators an underestimated approach to learning with $k$-subset sampling? Sampling $k$-subsets is a fundamental operation in many machine learning tasks that is not amenable to differentiable parametrization, impeding gradient-based optimization. Prior work has focused on relaxed sampling or pathwise gradient estimators. Inspired by the success of score function estimators in variational inference and reinforcement learning, we revisit them within the context of $k$-subset sampling. Specifically, we demonstrate how to efficiently compute the $k$-subset distribution's score function using a discrete Fourier transform, and reduce the estimator's variance with control variates. The resulting estimator provides both exact samples and unbiased gradient estimates while also applying to non-differentiable downstream models, unlike existing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiying Liu, Zekun Zhang, Honghao Li, Qilin Wu, Yiwen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid improvement in the recent years, and have been used in a wider range of applications. After being trained on large text corpus, LLMs obtain the capability of extracting rich features from textual data. Such capability is potentially useful for the web service recommendation task, where the web users and services have intrinsic attributes that can be described using natural language sentences and are useful for recommendation. In this paper, we explore the possibility and practicality of using LLMs for web service recommendation. We propose the large language model aided QoS prediction (llmQoS) model, which use LLMs to extract useful information from attributes of web users and services via descriptive sentences. This information is then used in combination with the QoS values of historical interactions of users and services, to predict QoS values for any given user-service pair. On the WSDream dataset, llmQoS is shown to overcome the data sparsity issue inherent to the QoS prediction problem, and outperforms comparable baseline models consistently.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khanh Nguyen, Huy Hoang Nguyen, Egor Panfilov, Aleksei Tiulpin</p>
<p>Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal disease, which has no cure. Knee OA (KOA) is one of the highest causes of disability worldwide, and it costs billions of United States dollars to the global community. Prediction of KOA progression has been of high interest to the community for years, as it can advance treatment development through more efficient clinical trials and improve patient outcomes through more efficient healthcare utilization. Existing approaches for predicting KOA, however, are predominantly static, i.e. consider data from a single time point to predict progression many years into the future, and knee level, i.e. consider progression in a single joint only. Due to these and related reasons, these methods fail to deliver the level of predictive performance, which is sufficient to result in cost savings and better patient outcomes. Collecting extensive data from all patients on a regular basis could address the issue, but it is limited by the high cost at a population level. In this work, we propose to go beyond static prediction models in OA, and bring a novel Active Sensing (AS) approach, designed to dynamically follow up patients with the objective of maximizing the number of informative data acquisitions, while minimizing their total cost over a period of time. Our approach is based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), and it leverages a novel reward function designed specifically for AS of disease progression in more than one part of a human body. Our method is end-to-end, relies on multi-modal Deep Learning, and requires no human input at inference time. Throughout an exhaustive experimental evaluation, we show that using RL can provide a higher monetary benefit when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chandramouli Kamanchi, Sumanta Mukherjee, Kameshwaran Sampath, Pankaj Dayama, Arindam Jati, Vijay Ekambaram, Dzung Phan</p>
<p>Abstract: Activation functions are non-linearities in neural networks that allow them to learn complex mapping between inputs and outputs. Typical choices for activation functions are ReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid etc., where the choice generally depends on the application domain. In this work, we propose a framework/strategy that unifies several works on activation functions and theoretically explains the performance benefits of these works. We also propose novel techniques that originate from the framework and allow us to obtain ``extensions'' (i.e. special generalizations of a given neural network) of neural networks through operations on activation functions. We theoretically and empirically show that ``extensions'' of neural networks have performance benefits compared to vanilla neural networks with insignificant space and time complexity costs on standard test functions. We also show the benefits of neural network ``extensions'' in the time-series domain on real-world datasets.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05807">Kernel Density Estimators in Large Dimensions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Giulio Biroli, Marc M\'ezard</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies Kernel density estimation for a high-dimensional distribution $\rho(x)$. Traditional approaches have focused on the limit of large number of data points $n$ and fixed dimension $d$. We analyze instead the regime where both the number $n$ of data points $y_i$ and their dimensionality $d$ grow with a fixed ratio $\alpha=(\log n)/d$. Our study reveals three distinct statistical regimes for the kernel-based estimate of the density $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)=\frac{1}{n h^d}\sum_{i=1}^n K\left(\frac{x-y_i}{h}\right)$, depending on the bandwidth $h$: a classical regime for large bandwidth where the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) holds, which is akin to the one found in traditional approaches. Below a certain value of the bandwidth, $h_{CLT}(\alpha)$, we find that the CLT breaks down. The statistics of $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)$ for a fixed $x$ drawn from $\rho(x)$ is given by a heavy-tailed distribution (an alpha-stable distribution). In particular below a value $h_G(\alpha)$, we find that $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)$ is governed by extreme value statistics: only a few points in the database matter and give the dominant contribution to the density estimator. We provide a detailed analysis for high-dimensional multivariate Gaussian data. We show that the optimal bandwidth threshold based on Kullback-Leibler divergence lies in the new statistical regime identified in this paper. Our findings reveal limitations of classical approaches, show the relevance of these new statistical regimes, and offer new insights for Kernel density estimation in high-dimensional settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mario Padilla Rodriguez, Mohamed Nafea</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide, highlighting the need for accurate diagnostic methods. This study benchmarks centralized and federated machine learning algorithms for heart disease classification using the UCI dataset which includes 920 patient records from four hospitals in the USA, Hungary and Switzerland. Our benchmark is supported by Shapley-value interpretability analysis to quantify features' importance for classification. In the centralized setup, various binary classification algorithms are trained on pooled data, with a support vector machine (SVM) achieving the highest testing accuracy of 83.3\%, surpassing the established benchmark of 78.7\% with logistic regression. Additionally, federated learning algorithms with four clients (hospitals) are explored, leveraging the dataset's natural partition to enhance privacy without sacrificing accuracy. Federated SVM, an uncommon approach in the literature, achieves a top testing accuracy of 73.8\%. Our interpretability analysis aligns with existing medical knowledge of heart disease indicators. Overall, this study establishes a benchmark for efficient and interpretable pre-screening tools for heart disease while maintaining patients' privacy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jannatul Ferdaus, Sameera Pisupati, Mahedi Hasan, Sathwick Paladugu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning enables robots to learn from each other's experiences without relying on centralized data collection. Each robot independently maintains a model of crop conditions and chemical spray effectiveness, which is periodically shared with other robots in the fleet. A communication protocol is designed to optimize chemical spray applications by facilitating the exchange of information about crop conditions, weather, and other critical factors. The federated learning algorithm leverages this shared data to continuously refine the chemical spray strategy, reducing waste and improving crop yields. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the agriculture industry by offering a scalable and efficient solution for crop protection. However, significant challenges remain, including the development of a secure and robust communication protocol, the design of a federated learning algorithm that effectively integrates data from multiple sources, and ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous robots. The proposed cluster-based federated learning approach also effectively reduces the computational load on the global server and minimizes communication overhead among clients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanjie Dong, Haijun Zhang, Gang Wang, Shisheng Cui, Xiping Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: By using an parametric value function to replace the Monte-Carlo rollouts for value estimation, the actor-critic (AC) algorithms can reduce the variance of stochastic policy gradient so that to improve the convergence rate. While existing works mainly focus on analyzing convergence rate of AC algorithms under Markovian noise, the impacts of momentum on AC algorithms remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first propose a heavy-ball momentum based advantage actor-critic (\mbox{HB-A2C}) algorithm by integrating the heavy-ball momentum into the critic recursion that is parameterized by a linear function. When the sample trajectory follows a Markov decision process, we quantitatively certify the acceleration capability of the proposed HB-A2C algorithm. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the proposed HB-A2C finds an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point with $\oo{\epsilon^{-2}}$ iterations for reinforcement learning tasks with Markovian noise. Moreover, we also reveal the dependence of learning rates on the length of the sample trajectory. By carefully selecting the momentum factor of the critic recursion, the proposed HB-A2C can balance the errors introduced by the initialization and the stoschastic approximation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyudan Jung, Sieun Hyeon, Jeong Youn Kwon, Nam-Joon Kim, Hyun Gon Ryu, Hyuk-Jae Lee, Jaeyoung Do</p>
<p>Abstract: Improving the readability of mathematical expressions in text-based document such as subtitle of mathematical video, is an significant task. To achieve this, mathematical expressions should be convert to compiled formulas. For instance, the spoken expression ``x equals minus b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four a c, all over two a'' from automatic speech recognition is more readily comprehensible when displayed as a compiled formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. To convert mathematical spoken sentences to compiled formulas, two processes are required: spoken sentences are converted into LaTeX formulas, and LaTeX formulas are converted into compiled formulas. The latter can be managed by using LaTeX engines. However, there is no way to do the former effectively. Even if we try to solve this using language models, there is no paired data between spoken sentences and LaTeX formulas to train it. In this paper, we introduce MathBridge, the first extensive dataset for translating mathematical spoken sentences into LaTeX formulas. MathBridge comprises approximately 23 million LaTeX formulas paired with the corresponding mathematical spoken sentences. Through comprehensive evaluations, including fine-tuning with proposed data, we discovered that MathBridge significantly enhances the capabilities of pretrained language models for converting to LaTeX formulas from mathematical spoken sentences. Specifically, for the T5-large model, the sacreBLEU score increased from 4.77 to 46.8, demonstrating substantial enhancement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Yang, Weimin Tan, Hanyu Zhang, Bo Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-training foundation models on large-scale datasets demonstrates exceptional performance. However, recent research questions this traditional notion, exploring whether an increase in pre-training data always leads to enhanced model performance. To address this issue, data-effective learning approaches have been introduced. However, current methods in this area lack a clear standard for sample selection. Our experiments reveal that by maximizing V-information, sample selection can be framed as an optimization problem, enabling effective improvement in model performance even with fewer samples. Under this guidance, we develop an optimal data-effective learning method (OptiDEL) to maximize V-information. The OptiDEL method generates hard samples to achieve or even exceed the performance of models trained on the full dataset while using substantially less data. We compare the OptiDEL method with state-of-the-art approaches finding that OptiDEL consistently outperforms existing approaches across different datasets, with foundation models trained on only 5% of the pre-training data surpassing the performance of those trained on the full dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and have been applied across various scientific fields, including chemistry. However, many chemical tasks require the processing of visual information, which cannot be successfully handled by existing chemical LLMs. This brings a growing need for models capable of integrating multimodal information in the chemical domain. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ChemVLM}, an open-source chemical multimodal large language model specifically designed for chemical applications. ChemVLM is trained on a carefully curated bilingual multimodal dataset that enhances its ability to understand both textual and visual chemical information, including molecular structures, reactions, and chemistry examination questions. We develop three datasets for comprehensive evaluation, tailored to Chemical Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Chemical Reasoning (MMCR), and Multimodal Molecule Understanding tasks. We benchmark ChemVLM against a range of open-source and proprietary multimodal large language models on various tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ChemVLM achieves competitive performance across all evaluated tasks. Our model can be found at https://huggingface.co/AI4Chem/ChemVLM-26B.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning motivated by convolutional neural networks has been highly successful in a range of medical imaging problems like image classification, image segmentation, image synthesis etc. However for validation and interpretability, not only do we need the predictions made by the model but also how confident it is while making those predictions. This is important in safety critical applications for the people to accept it. In this work, we used an encoder decoder architecture based on variational inference techniques for segmenting brain tumour images. We evaluate our work on the publicly available BRATS dataset using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Intersection Over Union (IOU) as the evaluation metrics. Our model is able to segment brain tumours while taking into account both aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty in a principled bayesian manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luke A. Bauer, James K. Howes IV, Sam A. Markelon, Vincent Bindschaedler, Thomas Shrimpton</p>
<p>Abstract: State of the art generative models of human-produced content are the focus of many recent papers that explore their use for steganographic communication. In particular, generative models of natural language text. Loosely, these works (invertibly) encode message-carrying bits into a sequence of samples from the model, ultimately yielding a plausible natural language covertext. By focusing on this narrow steganographic piece, prior work has largely ignored the significant algorithmic challenges, and performance-security tradeoffs, that arise when one actually tries to build a messaging pipeline around it. We make these challenges concrete, by considering the natural application of such a pipeline: namely, "dead-drop" covert messaging over large, public internet platforms (e.g. social media sites). We explicate the challenges and describe approaches to overcome them, surfacing in the process important performance and security tradeoffs that must be carefully tuned. We implement a system around this model-based format-transforming encryption pipeline, and give an empirical analysis of its performance and (heuristic) security.</p>

<p>Abstract: Annotating data for supervised learning can be costly. When the annotation budget is limited, active learning can be used to select and annotate those observations that are likely to give the most gain in model performance. We propose an active learning algorithm that, in addition to selecting which observation to annotate, selects the precision of the annotation that is acquired. Assuming that annotations with low precision are cheaper to obtain, this allows the model to explore a larger part of the input space, with the same annotation budget. We build our acquisition function on the previously proposed BALD objective for Gaussian Processes, and empirically demonstrate the gains of being able to adjust the annotation precision in the active learning loop.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ian Waudby-Smith, Lili Wu, Aaditya Ramdas, Nikos Karampatziakis, Paul Mineiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Contextual bandit algorithms are ubiquitous tools for active sequential experimentation in healthcare and the tech industry. They involve online learning algorithms that adaptively learn policies over time to map observed contexts $X_t$ to actions $A_t$ in an attempt to maximize stochastic rewards $R_t$. This adaptivity raises interesting but hard statistical inference questions, especially counterfactual ones: for example, it is often of interest to estimate the properties of a hypothetical policy that is different from the logging policy that was used to collect the data -- a problem known as ``off-policy evaluation'' (OPE). Using modern martingale techniques, we present a comprehensive framework for OPE inference that relax unnecessary conditions made in some past works, significantly improving on them both theoretically and empirically. Importantly, our methods can be employed while the original experiment is still running (that is, not necessarily post-hoc), when the logging policy may be itself changing (due to learning), and even if the context distributions are a highly dependent time-series (such as if they are drifting over time). More concretely, we derive confidence sequences for various functionals of interest in OPE. These include doubly robust ones for time-varying off-policy mean reward values, but also confidence bands for the entire cumulative distribution function of the off-policy reward distribution. All of our methods (a) are valid at arbitrary stopping times (b) only make nonparametric assumptions, (c) do not require importance weights to be uniformly bounded and if they are, we do not need to know these bounds, and (d) adapt to the empirical variance of our estimators. In summary, our methods enable anytime-valid off-policy inference using adaptively collected contextual bandit data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiazhen Pan, Wenqi Huang, Daniel Rueckert, Thomas K\"ustner, Kerstin Hammernik</p>
<p>Abstract: In cardiac CINE, motion-compensated MR reconstruction (MCMR) is an effective approach to address highly undersampled acquisitions by incorporating motion information between frames. In this work, we propose a novel perspective for addressing the MCMR problem and a more integrated and efficient solution to the MCMR field. Contrary to state-of-the-art (SOTA) MCMR methods which break the original problem into two sub-optimization problems, i.e. motion estimation and reconstruction, we formulate this problem as a single entity with one single optimization. Our approach is unique in that the motion estimation is directly driven by the ultimate goal, reconstruction, but not by the canonical motion-warping loss (similarity measurement between motion-warped images and target images). We align the objectives of motion estimation and reconstruction, eliminating the drawbacks of artifacts-affected motion estimation and therefore error-propagated reconstruction. Further, we can deliver high-quality reconstruction and realistic motion without applying any regularization/smoothness loss terms, circumventing the non-trivial weighting factor tuning. We evaluate our method on two datasets: 1) an in-house acquired 2D CINE dataset for the retrospective study and 2) the public OCMR cardiac dataset for the prospective study. The conducted experiments indicate that the proposed MCMR framework can deliver artifact-free motion estimation and high-quality MR images even for imaging accelerations up to 20x, outperforming SOTA non-MCMR and MCMR methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluation across all experiments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingxuan He, Martin Vechev</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (large LMs) are increasingly trained on massive codebases and used to generate code. However, LMs lack awareness of security and are found to frequently produce unsafe code. This work studies the security of LMs along two important axes: (i) security hardening, which aims to enhance LMs' reliability in generating secure code, and (ii) adversarial testing, which seeks to evaluate LMs' security at an adversarial standpoint. We address both of these by formulating a new security task called controlled code generation. The task is parametric and takes as input a binary property to guide the LM to generate secure or unsafe code, while preserving the LM's capability of generating functionally correct code. We propose a novel learning-based approach called SVEN to solve this task. SVEN leverages property-specific continuous vectors to guide program generation towards the given property, without modifying the LM's weights. Our training procedure optimizes these continuous vectors by enforcing specialized loss terms on different regions of code, using a high-quality dataset carefully curated by us. Our extensive evaluation shows that SVEN is highly effective in achieving strong security control. For instance, a state-of-the-art CodeGen LM with 2.7B parameters generates secure code for 59.1% of the time. When we employ SVEN to perform security hardening (or adversarial testing) on this LM, the ratio is significantly boosted to 92.3% (or degraded to 36.8%). Importantly, SVEN closely matches the original LMs in functional correctness.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce S-BDT: a novel $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private distributed gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT) learner that improves the protection of single training data points (privacy) while achieving meaningful learning goals, such as accuracy or regression error (utility). S-BDT uses less noise by relying on non-spherical multivariate Gaussian noise, for which we show tight subsampling bounds for privacy amplification and incorporate that into a R\'enyi filter for individual privacy accounting. We experimentally reach the same utility while saving $50\%$ in terms of epsilon for $\varepsilon \le 0.5$ on the Abalone regression dataset (dataset size $\approx 4K$), saving $30\%$ in terms of epsilon for $\varepsilon \le 0.08$ for the Adult classification dataset (dataset size $\approx 50K$), and saving $30\%$ in terms of epsilon for $\varepsilon\leq0.03$ for the Spambase classification dataset (dataset size $\approx 5K$). Moreover, we show that for situations where a GBDT is learning a stream of data that originates from different subpopulations (non-IID), S-BDT improves the saving of epsilon even further.</p>

<p>Abstract: Several recent advances in AI systems solve problems by providing a "scaffolding" program that structures multiple calls to language models (LMs) to generate better outputs. A scaffolding program is written in a programming language such as Python. In this work, we use a language-model-infused scaffolding program to improve itself. We start with a seed "improver" that improves an input program according to a given utility function by querying an LM several times and returning the best solution. We then run this seed improver to improve itself. Across a small set of downstream tasks, the resulting improved improver generates programs with significantly better performance than its seed improver. A variety of self-improvement strategies are proposed by the language model, including beam search, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing. Since the language models themselves are not altered, this is not full recursive self-improvement. Nonetheless, it demonstrates that a modern language model, GPT-4 in our experiments, is capable of writing code that can call itself to improve itself. We consider concerns around the development of self-improving technologies and evaluate the frequency with which the generated code bypasses a sandbox.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danny Wood, Theodore Papamarkou, Matt Benatan, Richard Allmendinger</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to trust the predictions of a machine learning algorithm, it is necessary to understand the factors that contribute to those predictions. In the case of probabilistic and uncertainty-aware models, it is necessary to understand not only the reasons for the predictions themselves, but also the reasons for the model's level of confidence in those predictions. In this paper, we show how existing methods in explainability can be extended to uncertainty-aware models and how such extensions can be used to understand the sources of uncertainty in a model's predictive distribution. In particular, by adapting permutation feature importance, partial dependence plots, and individual conditional expectation plots, we demonstrate that novel insights into model behaviour may be obtained and that these methods can be used to measure the impact of features on both the entropy of the predictive distribution and the log-likelihood of the ground truth labels under that distribution. With experiments using both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the utility of these approaches to understand both the sources of uncertainty and their impact on model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonghyeon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion Manifold Primitives (MMP), a manifold-based approach for encoding basic motion skills, can produce diverse trajectories, enabling the system to adapt to unseen constraints. Nonetheless, we argue that current MMP models lack crucial functionalities of movement primitives, such as temporal and via-points modulation, found in traditional approaches. This shortfall primarily stems from MMP's reliance on discrete-time trajectories. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Motion Manifold Primitives++ (MMP++), a new model that integrates the strengths of both MMP and traditional methods by incorporating parametric curve representations into the MMP framework. Furthermore, we identify a significant challenge with MMP++: performance degradation due to geometric distortions in the latent space, meaning that similar motions are not closely positioned. To address this, Isometric Motion Manifold Primitives++ (IMMP++) is proposed to ensure the latent space accurately preserves the manifold's geometry. Our experimental results across various applications, including 2-DoF planar motions, 7-DoF robot arm motions, and SE(3) trajectory planning, show that MMP++ and IMMP++ outperform existing methods in trajectory generation tasks, achieving substantial improvements in some cases. Moreover, they enable the modulation of latent coordinates and via-points, thereby allowing efficient online adaptation to dynamic environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is a key issue when considering the application of deep neural network methods in science and engineering. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that quantifies epistemic uncertainty via Monte Carlo sampling from a tempered posterior distribution. It combines the well established Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) with momentum-based optimization using Adam and leverages a prolate proposal distribution, to efficiently draw from the posterior. We prove that the constructed chain admits the Gibbs posterior as an invariant distribution and converges to this Gibbs posterior in total variation distance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficiency of the resulting algorithm and the merit of the proposed changes on a state-of-the-art classifier from high-energy particle physics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marie-Christine Par\'e, Vasken Dermardiros, Antoine Lesage-Landry</p>
<p>Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) has been shown to significantly improve the energy efficiency of buildings while maintaining thermal comfort. Data-driven approaches based on neural networks have been proposed to facilitate system modelling. However, such approaches are generally nonconvex and result in computationally intractable optimization problems. In this work, we design a readily implementable energy management method for small commercial buildings. We then leverage our approach to formulate a real-time demand bidding strategy. We propose a data-driven and mixed-integer convex MPC which is solved via derivative-free optimization given a limited computational time of 5 minutes to respect operational constraints. We consider rooftop unit heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems with discrete controls to accurately model the operation of most commercial buildings. Our approach uses an input convex recurrent neural network to model the thermal dynamics. We apply our approach in several demand response (DR) settings, including a demand bidding, a time-of-use, and a critical peak rebate program. Controller performance is evaluated on a state-of-the-art building simulation. The proposed approach improves thermal comfort while reducing energy consumption and cost through DR participation, when compared to other data-driven approaches or a set-point controller.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Susan Hao, Renee Shelby, Yuchi Liu, Hansa Srinivasan, Mukul Bhutani, Burcu Karagol Ayan, Ryan Poplin, Shivani Poddar, Sarah Laszlo</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have emerged as a significant advancement in generative AI; however, there exist safety concerns regarding their potential to produce harmful image outputs even when users input seemingly safe prompts. This phenomenon, where T2I models generate harmful representations that were not explicit in the input prompt, poses a potentially greater risk than adversarial prompts, leaving users unintentionally exposed to harms. Our paper addresses this issue by formalizing a definition for this phenomenon which we term harm amplification. We further contribute to the field by developing a framework of methodologies to quantify harm amplification in which we consider the harm of the model output in the context of user input. We then empirically examine how to apply these different methodologies to simulate real-world deployment scenarios including a quantification of disparate impacts across genders resulting from harm amplification. Together, our work aims to offer researchers tools to comprehensively address safety challenges in T2I systems and contribute to the responsible deployment of generative AI models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerry Ngo, Yoon Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: This work explores whether language models encode meaningfully grounded representations of sounds of objects. We learn a linear probe that retrieves the correct text representation of an object given a snippet of audio related to that object, where the sound representation is given by a pretrained audio model. This probe is trained via a contrastive loss that pushes the language representations and sound representations of an object to be close to one another. After training, the probe is tested on its ability to generalize to objects that were not seen during training. Across different language models and audio models, we find that the probe generalization is above chance in many cases, indicating that despite being trained only on raw text, language models encode grounded knowledge of sounds for some objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Potter, Murat Akcakaya, Marius Necsoiu, Gunar Schirner, Deniz Erdogmus, Tales Imbiriba</p>
<p>Abstract: Radar Automated Target Recognition (RATR) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) involves transmitting Electromagnetic Waves (EMWs) and performing target type recognition on the received radar echo, crucial for defense and aerospace applications. Previous studies highlighted the advantages of multistatic radar configurations over monostatic ones in RATR. However, fusion methods in multistatic radar configurations often suboptimally combine classification vectors from individual radars probabilistically. To address this, we propose a fully Bayesian RATR framework employing Optimal Bayesian Fusion (OBF) to aggregate classification probability vectors from multiple radars. OBF, based on expected 0-1 loss, updates a Recursive Bayesian Classification (RBC) posterior distribution for target UAV type, conditioned on historical observations across multiple time steps. We evaluate the approach using simulated random walk trajectories for seven drones, correlating target aspect angles to Radar Cross Section (RCS) measurements in an anechoic chamber. Comparing against single radar Automated Target Recognition (ATR) systems and suboptimal fusion methods, our empirical results demonstrate that the OBF method integrated with RBC significantly enhances classification accuracy compared to other fusion methods and single radar configurations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cristiano Mesquita Garcia, Alessandro Lameiras Koerich, Alceu de Souza Britto Jr, Jean Paul Barddal</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of textual data on the Internet presents a unique opportunity for institutions and companies to monitor public opinion about their services and products. Given the rapid generation of such data, the text stream mining setting, which handles sequentially arriving, potentially infinite text streams, is often more suitable than traditional batch learning. While pre-trained language models are commonly employed for their high-quality text vectorization capabilities in streaming contexts, they face challenges adapting to concept drift - the phenomenon where the data distribution changes over time, adversely affecting model performance. Addressing the issue of concept drift, this study explores the efficacy of seven text sampling methods designed to selectively fine-tune language models, thereby mitigating performance degradation. We precisely assess the impact of these methods on fine-tuning the SBERT model using four different loss functions. Our evaluation, focused on Macro F1-score and elapsed time, employs two text stream datasets and an incremental SVM classifier to benchmark performance. Our findings indicate that Softmax loss and Batch All Triplets loss are particularly effective for text stream classification, demonstrating that larger sample sizes generally correlate with improved macro F1-scores. Notably, our proposed WordPieceToken ratio sampling method significantly enhances performance with the identified loss functions, surpassing baseline results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhendong Cao, Xiaoshan Luo, Jian Lv, Lei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce CrystalFormer, a transformer-based autoregressive model specifically designed for space group-controlled generation of crystalline materials. The incorporation of space group symmetry significantly simplifies the crystal space, which is crucial for data and compute efficient generative modeling of crystalline materials. Leveraging the prominent discrete and sequential nature of the Wyckoff positions, CrystalFormer learns to generate crystals by directly predicting the species and locations of symmetry-inequivalent atoms in the unit cell. We demonstrate the advantages of CrystalFormer in standard tasks such as symmetric structure initialization and element substitution compared to conventional methods implemented in popular crystal structure prediction software. Moreover, we showcase the application of CrystalFormer of property-guided materials design in a plug-and-play manner. Our analysis shows that CrystalFormer ingests sensible solid-state chemistry knowledge and heuristics by compressing the material dataset, thus enabling systematic exploration of crystalline materials. The simplicity, generality, and flexibility of CrystalFormer position it as a promising architecture to be the foundational model of the entire crystalline materials space, heralding a new era in materials modeling and discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyang Zhang, Cristian Emanuel Ocampo Rivera, Kyle Tyni, Steven Nguyen, Ulices Santa Cruz Leal, Yasser Shoukry</p>
<p>Abstract: Navigation precision, speed and stability are crucial for safe UAV flight maneuvers and effective flight mission executions in dynamic environments. Different flight missions may have varying objectives, such as minimizing energy consumption, achieving precise positioning, or maximizing speed. A controller that can adapt to different objectives on the fly is highly valuable. Proportional Integral Derivative controllers are one of the most popular and widely used control algorithms for drones control systems, but their linear control algorithm fails to capture the nonlinear nature of the dynamic wind conditions and complex drone system. Manually tuning the PID gains for various missions can be time-consuming and requires significant expertise. This paper aims to revolutionize drone flight control by presenting the AirPilot, a nonlinear Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) - enhanced PID drone controller using Proximal Policy Optimization. AirPilot controller combines the simplicity and effectiveness of traditional PID control with the adaptability, learning capability, and optimization potential of DRL. This makes it better suited for modern drone applications where the environment is dynamic, and mission-specific performance demands are high. We employed a COEX Clover autonomous drone for training the DRL agent within the Gazebo simulator and subsequently implemented it in a real-world lab setting, which marks a significant milestone as one of the first attempts to apply a DRL-based flight controller on an actual drone. Airpilot is capable of reducing the navigation error by more than 82% and improving overshoot, speed and settling time significantly.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15019">Agentic Skill Discovery</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xufeng Zhao, Cornelius Weber, Stefan Wermter</p>
<p>Abstract: Language-conditioned robotic skills make it possible to apply the high-level reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) to low-level robotic control. A remaining challenge is to acquire a diverse set of fundamental skills. Existing approaches either manually decompose a complex task into atomic robotic actions in a top-down fashion, or bootstrap as many combinations as possible in a bottom-up fashion to cover a wider range of task possibilities. These decompositions or combinations, however, require an initial skill library. For example, a ``grasping'' capability can never emerge from a skill library containing only diverse ``pushing'' skills. Existing skill discovery techniques with reinforcement learning acquire skills by an exhaustive exploration but often yield non-meaningful behaviors. In this study, we introduce a novel framework for skill discovery that is entirely driven by LLMs. The framework begins with an LLM generating task proposals based on the provided scene description and the robot's configurations, aiming to incrementally acquire new skills upon task completion. For each proposed task, a series of reinforcement learning processes are initiated, utilizing reward and success determination functions sampled by the LLM to develop the corresponding policy. The reliability and trustworthiness of learned behaviors are further ensured by an independent vision-language model. We show that starting with zero skill, the skill library emerges and expands to more and more meaningful and reliable skills, enabling the robot to efficiently further propose and complete advanced tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Tian, Xiaotong Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the accuracy of generative models and the impact of knowledge transfer on their generation precision. Specifically, we examine a generative model for a target task, fine-tuned using a pre-trained model from a source task. Building on the "Shared Embedding" concept, which bridges the source and target tasks, we introduce a novel framework for transfer learning under distribution metrics such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This framework underscores the importance of leveraging inherent similarities between diverse tasks despite their distinct data distributions. Our theory suggests that the shared structures can augment the generation accuracy for a target task, reliant on the capability of a source model to identify shared structures and effective knowledge transfer from source to target learning. To demonstrate the practical utility of this framework, we explore the theoretical implications for two specific generative models: diffusion and normalizing flows. The results show enhanced performance in both models over their non-transfer counterparts, indicating advancements for diffusion models and providing fresh insights into normalizing flows in transfer and non-transfer settings. These results highlight the significant contribution of knowledge transfer in boosting the generation capabilities of these models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) hold immense promise for real-world applications, but their generic knowledge often falls short of domain-specific needs. Fine-tuning, a common approach, can suffer from catastrophic forgetting and hinder generalizability. In-Context Learning (ICL) offers an alternative, which can leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide LLMs with relevant demonstrations for few-shot learning tasks. This paper explores the desired qualities of a demonstration retrieval system for ICL. We argue that ICL retrieval in this context resembles item-cold-start recommender systems, prioritizing discovery and maximizing information gain over strict relevance. We propose a novel evaluation method that measures the LLM's subsequent performance on NLP tasks, eliminating the need for subjective diversity scores. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of diversity and quality bias in retrieved demonstrations for effective ICL, and highlight the potential of recommender system techniques in this domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: The 2024 Brain Tumor Segmentation Meningioma Radiotherapy (BraTS-MEN-RT) challenge aims to advance automated segmentation algorithms using the largest known multi-institutional dataset of radiotherapy planning brain MRIs with expert-annotated target labels for patients with intact or postoperative meningioma that underwent either conventional external beam radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery. Each case includes a defaced 3D post-contrast T1-weighted radiotherapy planning MRI in its native acquisition space, accompanied by a single-label "target volume" representing the gross tumor volume (GTV) and any at-risk postoperative site. Target volume annotations adhere to established radiotherapy planning protocols, ensuring consistency across cases and institutions. For preoperative meningiomas, the target volume encompasses the entire GTV and associated nodular dural tail, while for postoperative cases, it includes at-risk resection cavity margins as determined by the treating institution. Case annotations were reviewed and approved by expert neuroradiologists and radiation oncologists. Participating teams will develop, containerize, and evaluate automated segmentation models using this comprehensive dataset. Model performance will be assessed using an adapted lesion-wise Dice Similarity Coefficient and the 95% Hausdorff distance. The top-performing teams will be recognized at the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Conference in October 2024. BraTS-MEN-RT is expected to significantly advance automated radiotherapy planning by enabling precise tumor segmentation and facilitating tailored treatment, ultimately improving patient outcomes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Domain specific digital twins, representing a digital replica of various segments of the smart grid, are foreseen as able to model, simulate, and control the respective segments. At the same time, knowledge-based digital twins, coupled with AI, may also empower humans to understand aspects of the system through natural language interaction in view of planning and policy making. This paper is the first to assess and report on the potential of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) question answers related to household electrical energy measurement aspects leveraging a knowledge-based energy digital twin. Relying on the recently published electricity consumption knowledge graph that actually represents a knowledge-based digital twin, we study the capabilities of ChatGPT, Gemini and Llama in answering electricity related questions. Furthermore, we compare the answers with the ones generated through a RAG techniques that leverages an existing electricity knowledge-based digital twin. Our findings illustrate that the RAG approach not only reduces the incidence of incorrect information typically generated by LLMs but also significantly improves the quality of the output by grounding responses in verifiable data. This paper details our methodology, presents a comparative analysis of responses with and without RAG, and discusses the implications of our findings for future applications of AI in specialized sectors like energy data analysis.</p>

The significant memory demands during training pose a major challenge in terms of resource consumption. This substantial size places a heavy load on memory resources, raising considerable practical concerns. In this paper, we introduce DP-MemArc, a novel training framework aimed at reducing the memory costs of large language models while emphasizing the protection of user data privacy. DP-MemArc incorporates side network or reversible network designs to support a variety of differential privacy memory-efficient fine-tuning schemes. Our approach not only achieves in memory optimization but also ensures robust privacy protection, keeping user data secure and confidential.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Schebek, Michele Invernizzi, Frank No\'e, Jutta Rogal</p>
<p>Abstract: The accurate prediction of phase diagrams is of central importance for both the fundamental understanding of materials as well as for technological applications in material sciences. However, the computational prediction of the relative stability between phases based on their free energy is a daunting task, as traditional free energy estimators require a large amount of simulation data to obtain uncorrelated equilibrium samples over a grid of thermodynamic states. In this work, we develop deep generative machine learning models based on the Boltzmann Generator approach for entire phase diagrams, employing normalizing flows conditioned on the thermodynamic states, e.g., temperature and pressure, that they map to. By training a single normalizing flow to transform the equilibrium distribution sampled at only one reference thermodynamic state to a wide range of target temperatures and pressures, we can efficiently generate equilibrium samples across the entire phase diagram. Using a permutation-equivariant architecture allows us, thereby, to treat solid and liquid phases on the same footing. We demonstrate our approach by predicting the solid-liquid coexistence line for a Lennard-Jones system in excellent agreement with state-of-the-art free energy methods while significantly reducing the number of energy evaluations needed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lynn Chua, Badih Ghazi, Yangsibo Huang, Pritish Kamath, Ravi Kumar, Daogao Liu, Pasin Manurangsi, Amer Sinha, Chiyuan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for tackling complex tasks across diverse domains, but they also raise privacy concerns when fine-tuned on sensitive data due to potential memorization. While differential privacy (DP) offers a promising solution by ensuring models are 'almost indistinguishable' with or without any particular privacy unit, current evaluations on LLMs mostly treat each example (text record) as the privacy unit. This leads to uneven user privacy guarantees when contributions per user vary. We therefore study user-level DP motivated by applications where it necessary to ensure uniform privacy protection across users. We present a systematic evaluation of user-level DP for LLM fine-tuning on natural language generation tasks. Focusing on two mechanisms for achieving user-level DP guarantees, Group Privacy and User-wise DP-SGD, we investigate design choices like data selection strategies and parameter tuning for the best privacy-utility tradeoff.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in neural information retrieval (IR) models have significantly enhanced their effectiveness over various IR tasks. The robustness of these models, essential for ensuring their reliability in practice, has also garnered significant attention. With a wide array of research on robust IR being proposed, we believe it is the opportune moment to consolidate the current status, glean insights from existing methodologies, and lay the groundwork for future development. We view the robustness of IR to be a multifaceted concept, emphasizing its necessity against adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and performance variance. With a focus on adversarial and OOD robustness, we dissect robustness solutions for dense retrieval models (DRMs) and neural ranking models (NRMs), respectively, recognizing them as pivotal components of the neural IR pipeline. We provide an in-depth discussion of existing methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, shedding light on challenges and future directions in the era of large language models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey on the robustness of neural IR models, and we will also be giving our first tutorial presentation at SIGIR 2024 \url{https://sigir2024-robust-information-retrieval.github.io}. Along with the organization of existing work, we introduce a Benchmark for robust IR (BestIR), a heterogeneous evaluation benchmark for robust neural information retrieval, which is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Davion-Liu/BestIR}. We hope that this study provides useful clues for future research on the robustness of IR models and helps to develop trustworthy search engines \url{https://github.com/Davion-Liu/Awesome-Robustness-in-Information-Retrieval}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Tang, Ben Abbatematteo, Jiaheng Hu, Rohan Chandra, Roberto Mart\'in-Mart\'in, Peter Stone</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly its combination with deep neural networks referred to as deep RL (DRL), has shown tremendous promise across a wide range of applications, suggesting its potential for enabling the development of sophisticated robotic behaviors. Robotics problems, however, pose fundamental difficulties for the application of RL, stemming from the complexity and cost of interacting with the physical world. This article provides a modern survey of DRL for robotics, with a particular focus on evaluating the real-world successes achieved with DRL in realizing several key robotic competencies. Our analysis aims to identify the key factors underlying those exciting successes, reveal underexplored areas, and provide an overall characterization of the status of DRL in robotics. We highlight several important avenues for future work, emphasizing the need for stable and sample-efficient real-world RL paradigms, holistic approaches for discovering and integrating various competencies to tackle complex long-horizon, open-world tasks, and principled development and evaluation procedures. This survey is designed to offer insights for both RL practitioners and roboticists toward harnessing RL's power to create generally capable real-world robotic systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunyi Shen, Renato Berlinghieri, Tamara Broderick</p>
<p>Abstract: Practitioners frequently aim to infer an unobserved population trajectory using sample snapshots at multiple time points. For instance, in single-cell sequencing, scientists would like to learn how gene expression evolves over time. But sequencing any cell destroys that cell. So we cannot access any cell's full trajectory, but we can access snapshot samples from many cells. Stochastic differential equations are commonly used to analyze systems with full individual-trajectory access; since here we have only sample snapshots, these methods are inapplicable. The deep learning community has recently explored using Schr\"odinger bridges (SBs) and their extensions to estimate these dynamics. However, these methods either (1) interpolate between just two time points or (2) require a single fixed reference dynamic within the SB, which is often just set to be Brownian motion. But learning piecewise from adjacent time points can fail to capture long-term dependencies. And practitioners are typically able to specify a model class for the reference dynamic but not the exact values of the parameters within it. So we propose a new method that (1) learns the unobserved trajectories from sample snapshots across multiple time points and (2) requires specification only of a class of reference dynamics, not a single fixed one. In particular, we suggest an iterative projection method inspired by Schr\"odinger bridges; we alternate between learning a piecewise SB on the unobserved trajectories and using the learned SB to refine our best guess for the dynamics within the reference class. We demonstrate the advantages of our method via a well-known simulated parametric model from ecology, simulated and real data from systems biology, and real motion-capture data.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07075">UniFed: A Universal Federation of a Mixture of Highly Heterogeneous Medical Image Classification Tasks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Atefe Hassani, Islem Rekik</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental challenge in federated learning lies in mixing heterogeneous datasets and classification tasks while minimizing the high communication cost caused by clients as well as the exchange of weight updates with the server over a fixed number of rounds. This results in divergent model convergence rates and performance, which may hinder their deployment in precision medicine. In real-world scenarios, client data is collected from different hospitals with extremely varying components (e.g., imaging modality, organ type, etc). Previous studies often overlooked the convoluted heterogeneity during the training stage where the target learning tasks vary across clients as well as the dataset type and their distributions. To address such limitations, we unprecedentedly introduce UniFed, a universal federated learning paradigm that aims to classify any disease from any imaging modality. UniFed also handles the issue of varying convergence times in the client-specific optimization based on the complexity of their learning tasks. Specifically, by dynamically adjusting both local and global models, UniFed considers the varying task complexities of clients and the server, enhancing its adaptability to real-world scenarios, thereby mitigating issues related to overtraining and excessive communication. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a sequential model transfer mechanism that takes into account the diverse tasks among hospitals and a dynamic task-complexity based ordering. We demonstrate the superiority of our framework in terms of accuracy, communication cost, and convergence time over relevant benchmarks in diagnosing retina, histopathology, and liver tumour diseases under federated learning.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08185">Data-driven identification of latent port-Hamiltonian systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes Rettberg, Jonas Kneifl, Julius Herb, Patrick Buchfink, J\"org Fehr, Bernard Haasdonk</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional physics-based modeling techniques involve high effort, e.g., time and expert knowledge, while data-driven methods often lack interpretability, structure, and sometimes reliability. To mitigate this, we present a data-driven system identification framework that derives models in the port-Hamiltonian (pH) formulation. This formulation is suitable for multi-physical systems while guaranteeing the useful system theoretical properties of passivity and stability. Our framework combines linear and nonlinear reduction with structured, physics-motivated system identification. In this process, high-dimensional state data obtained from possibly nonlinear systems serves as input for an autoencoder, which then performs two tasks: (i) nonlinearly transforming and (ii) reducing this data onto a low-dimensional latent space. In this space, a linear pH system, that satisfies the pH properties per construction, is parameterized by the weights of a neural network. The mathematical requirements are met by defining the pH matrices through Cholesky factorizations. The neural networks that define the coordinate transformation and the pH system are identified in a joint optimization process to match the dynamics observed in the data while defining a linear pH system in the latent space. The learned, low-dimensional pH system can describe even nonlinear systems and is rapidly computable due to its small size. The method is exemplified by a parametric mass-spring-damper and a nonlinear pendulum example, as well as the high-dimensional model of a disc brake with linear thermoelastic behavior.</p>
