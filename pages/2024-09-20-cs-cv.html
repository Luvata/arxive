<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Ling, Yinghui Sun, Quansen Sun, Yuhui Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Perceiving and understanding 3D motion is a core technology in fields such as autonomous driving, robots, and motion prediction. This paper proposes a 3D motion perception method called ScaleFlow++ that is easy to generalize. With just a pair of RGB images, ScaleFlow++ can robustly estimate optical flow and motion-in-depth (MID). Most existing methods directly regress MID from two RGB frames or optical flow, resulting in inaccurate and unstable results. Our key insight is cross-scale matching, which extracts deep motion clues by matching objects in pairs of images at different scales. Unlike previous methods, ScaleFlow++ integrates optical flow and MID estimation into a unified architecture, estimating optical flow and MID end-to-end based on feature matching. Moreover, we also proposed modules such as global initialization network, global iterative optimizer, and hybrid training pipeline to integrate global motion information, reduce the number of iterations, and prevent overfitting during training. On KITTI, ScaleFlow++ achieved the best monocular scene flow estimation performance, reducing SF-all from 6.21 to 5.79. The evaluation of MID even surpasses RGBD-based methods. In addition, ScaleFlow++ has achieved stunning zero-shot generalization performance in both rigid and nonrigid scenes. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/HanLingsgjk/CSCV}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sakhinana Sagar Srinivas, Geethan Sannidhi, Sreeja Gangasani, Chidaksh Ravuru, Venkataramana Runkana</p>
<p>Abstract: Characterizing materials with electron micrographs poses significant challenges for automated labeling due to the complex nature of nanomaterial structures. To address this, we introduce a fully automated, end-to-end pipeline that leverages recent advances in Generative AI. It is designed for analyzing and understanding the microstructures of semiconductor materials with effectiveness comparable to that of human experts, contributing to the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in nanomaterial identification. Our approach utilizes Large MultiModal Models (LMMs) such as GPT-4V, alongside text-to-image models like DALLE-3. We integrate a GPT-4 guided Visual Question Answering (VQA) method to analyze nanomaterial images, generate synthetic nanomaterial images via DALLE-3, and employ in-context learning with few-shot prompting in GPT-4V for accurate nanomaterial identification. Our method surpasses traditional techniques by enhancing the precision of nanomaterial identification and optimizing the process for high-throughput screening.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhe Wu, Yipeng Xu, Tianyu Xu, Jialu Zhang, Jianfeng Ren, Xudong Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Exemplar-Free Counting aims to count objects of interest without intensive annotations of objects or exemplars. To achieve this, we propose Gated Context-Aware Swin-UNet (GCA-SUN) to directly map an input image to the density map of countable objects. Specifically, a Gated Context-Aware Modulation module is designed in the encoder to suppress irrelevant objects or background through a gate mechanism and exploit the attentive support of objects of interest through a self-similarity matrix. The gate strategy is also incorporated into the bottleneck network and the decoder to highlight the features most relevant to objects of interest. By explicitly exploiting the attentive support among countable objects and eliminating irrelevant features through the gate mechanisms, the proposed GCA-SUN focuses on and counts objects of interest without relying on predefined categories or exemplars. Experimental results on the FSC-147 and CARPK datasets demonstrate that GCA-SUN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rolandos Alexandros Potamias, Jinglei Zhang, Jiankang Deng, Stefanos Zafeiriou</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, 3D hand pose estimation methods have garnered significant attention due to their extensive applications in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and robotics. In contrast, there has been a notable gap in hand detection pipelines, posing significant challenges in constructing effective real-world multi-hand reconstruction systems. In this work, we present a data-driven pipeline for efficient multi-hand reconstruction in the wild. The proposed pipeline is composed of two components: a real-time fully convolutional hand localization and a high-fidelity transformer-based 3D hand reconstruction model. To tackle the limitations of previous methods and build a robust and stable detection network, we introduce a large-scale dataset with over than 2M in-the-wild hand images with diverse lighting, illumination, and occlusion conditions. Our approach outperforms previous methods in both efficiency and accuracy on popular 2D and 3D benchmarks. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline to achieve smooth 3D hand tracking from monocular videos, without utilizing any temporal components.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinchi Zhou, Peiyu Duan, Yuexi Du, Nicha C. Dvornek</p>
<p>Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that encompasses a wide variety of symptoms and degrees of impairment, which makes the diagnosis and treatment challenging. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been extensively used to study brain activity in ASD, and machine learning methods have been applied to analyze resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. However, fewer studies have explored the recent transformer-based models on rs-fMRI data. Given the superiority of transformer models in capturing long-range dependencies in sequence data, we have developed a transformer-based self-supervised framework that directly analyzes time-series fMRI data without computing functional connectivity. To address over-fitting in small datasets and enhance the model performance, we propose self-supervised pre-training tasks to reconstruct the randomly masked fMRI time-series data, investigating the effects of various masking strategies. We then finetune the model for the ASD classification task and evaluate it using two public datasets and five-fold cross-validation with different amounts of training data. The experiments show that randomly masking entire ROIs gives better model performance than randomly masking time points in the pre-training step, resulting in an average improvement of 10.8% for AUC and 9.3% for subject accuracy compared with the transformer model trained from scratch across different levels of training data availability.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12318">A large-scale study of performance and equity of commercial remote identity verification technologies across demographics</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaniz Fatima, Michael Schuckers, Gerardo Cruz-Ortiz, Daqing Hou, Sandip Purnapatra, Tiffany Andrews, Ambuj Neupane, Brandeis Marshall, Stephanie Schuckers</p>
<p>Abstract: As more types of transactions move online, there is an increasing need to verify someone's identity remotely. Remote identity verification (RIdV) technologies have emerged to fill this need. RIdV solutions typically use a smart device to validate an identity document like a driver's license by comparing a face selfie to the face photo on the document. Recent research has been focused on ensuring that biometric systems work fairly across demographic groups. This study assesses five commercial RIdV solutions for equity across age, gender, race/ethnicity, and skin tone across 3,991 test subjects. This paper employs statistical methods to discern whether the RIdV result across demographic groups is statistically distinguishable. Two of the RIdV solutions were equitable across all demographics, while two RIdV solutions had at least one demographic that was inequitable. For example, the results for one technology had a false negative rate of 10.5% +/- 4.5% and its performance for each demographic category was within the error bounds, and, hence, were equitable. The other technologies saw either poor overall performance or inequitable performance. For one of these, participants of the race Black/African American (B/AA) as well as those with darker skin tones (Monk scale 7/8/9/10) experienced higher false rejections. Finally, one technology demonstrated more favorable but inequitable performance for the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) demographic. This study confirms that it is necessary to evaluate products across demographic groups to fully understand the performance of remote identity verification technologies.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12319">Large Language Models Are Strong Audio-Visual Speech Recognition Learners</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Umberto Cappellazzo, Minsu Kim, Honglie Chen, Pingchuan Ma, Stavros Petridis, Daniele Falavigna, Alessio Brutti, Maja Pantic</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently become a focal point of research due to their formidable multimodal understanding capabilities. For example, in the audio and speech domains, an LLM can be equipped with (automatic) speech recognition (ASR) abilities by just concatenating the audio tokens, computed with an audio encoder, and the text tokens to achieve state-of-the-art results. On the contrary, tasks like visual and audio-visual speech recognition (VSR/AVSR), which also exploit noise-invariant lip movement information, have received little or no attention. To bridge this gap, we propose Llama-AVSR, a new MLLM with strong audio-visual speech recognition capabilities. It leverages pre-trained audio and video encoders to produce modality-specific tokens which, together with the text tokens, are processed by a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Llama3.1-8B) to yield the resulting response in an auto-regressive fashion. Llama-AVSR requires a small number of trainable parameters as only modality-specific projectors and LoRA modules are trained whereas the multi-modal encoders and LLM are kept frozen. We evaluate our proposed approach on LRS3, the largest public AVSR benchmark, and we achieve new state-of-the-art results for the tasks of ASR and AVSR with a WER of 0.81% and 0.77%, respectively. To bolster our results, we investigate the key factors that underpin the effectiveness of Llama-AVSR: the choice of the pre-trained encoders and LLM, the efficient integration of LoRA modules, and the optimal performance-efficiency trade-off obtained via modality-aware compression rates.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12323">Depth Estimation Based on 3D Gaussian Splatting Siamese Defocus</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinchang Zhang, Ningning Xu, Hao Zhang, Guoyu Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D geometry. While stereo depth estimation can be achieved through triangulation methods, it is not as straightforward for monocular methods, which require the integration of global and local information. The Depth from Defocus (DFD) method utilizes camera lens models and parameters to recover depth information from blurred images and has been proven to perform well. However, these methods rely on All-In-Focus (AIF) images for depth estimation, which is nearly impossible to obtain in real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised framework based on 3D Gaussian splatting and Siamese networks. By learning the blur levels at different focal distances of the same scene in the focal stack, the framework predicts the defocus map and Circle of Confusion (CoC) from a single defocused image, using the defocus map as input to DepthNet for monocular depth estimation. The 3D Gaussian splatting model renders defocused images using the predicted CoC, and the differences between these and the real defocused images provide additional supervision signals for the Siamese Defocus self-supervised network. This framework has been validated on both artificially synthesized and real blurred datasets. Subsequent quantitative and visualization experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework is highly effective as a DFD method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Yang, Lei Zhong, Huiping Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel Recursive Fusion model, dubbed ReFu, designed to integrate point clouds and meshes for exemplar-free 3D Class-Incremental Learning, where the model learns new 3D classes while retaining knowledge of previously learned ones. Unlike existing methods that either rely on storing historical data to mitigate forgetting or focus on single data modalities, ReFu eliminates the need for exemplar storage while utilizing the complementary strengths of both point clouds and meshes. To achieve this, we introduce a recursive method which continuously accumulates knowledge by updating the regularized auto-correlation matrix. Furthermore, we propose a fusion module, featuring a Pointcloud-guided Mesh Attention Layer that learns correlations between the two modalities. This mechanism effectively integrates point cloud and mesh features, leading to more robust and stable continual learning. Experiments across various datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing methods in 3D class-incremental learning. Project Page: https://arlo397.github.io/ReFu/</p>

<p>Abstract: This study uses machine vision and drone technologies to propose a unique method for the diagnosis of cucumber disease in agriculture. The backbone of this research is a painstakingly curated dataset of hyperspectral photographs acquired under genuine field conditions. Unlike earlier datasets, this study included a wide variety of illness types, allowing for precise early-stage detection. The model achieves an excellent 87.5\% accuracy in distinguishing eight unique cucumber illnesses after considerable data augmentation. The incorporation of drone technology for high-resolution images improves disease evaluation. This development has enormous potential for improving crop management, lowering labor costs, and increasing agricultural productivity. This research, which automates disease detection, represents a significant step toward a more efficient and sustainable agricultural future.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12379">Enhancing 3D Robotic Vision Robustness by Minimizing Adversarial Mutual Information through a Curriculum Training Approach</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nastaran Darabi, Dinithi Jayasuriya, Devashri Naik, Theja Tulabandhula, Amit Ranjan Trivedi</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's decision boundaries through small, carefully crafted perturbations that lead to significant mispredictions. In 3D vision, the high dimensionality and sparsity of data greatly expand the attack surface, making 3D vision particularly vulnerable for safety-critical robotics. To enhance 3D vision's adversarial robustness, we propose a training objective that simultaneously minimizes prediction loss and mutual information (MI) under adversarial perturbations to contain the upper bound of misprediction errors. This approach simplifies handling adversarial examples compared to conventional methods, which require explicit searching and training on adversarial samples. However, minimizing prediction loss conflicts with minimizing MI, leading to reduced robustness and catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we integrate curriculum advisors in the training setup that gradually introduce adversarial objectives to balance training and prevent models from being overwhelmed by difficult cases early in the process. The advisors also enhance robustness by encouraging training on diverse MI examples through entropy regularizers. We evaluated our method on ModelNet40 and KITTI using PointNet, DGCNN, SECOND, and PointTransformers, achieving 2-5% accuracy gains on ModelNet40 and a 5-10% mAP improvement in object detection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Li, Shiming Ge, Daichi Zhang, Jia Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world applications today like video surveillance and urban governance need to address the recognition of masked faces, where content replacement by diverse masks often brings in incomplete appearance and ambiguous representation, leading to a sharp drop in accuracy. Inspired by recent progress on amodal perception, we propose to migrate the mechanism of amodal completion for the task of masked face recognition with an end-to-end de-occlusion distillation framework, which consists of two modules. The \textit{de-occlusion} module applies a generative adversarial network to perform face completion, which recovers the content under the mask and eliminates appearance ambiguity. The \textit{distillation} module takes a pre-trained general face recognition model as the teacher and transfers its knowledge to train a student for completed faces using massive online synthesized face pairs. Especially, the teacher knowledge is represented with structural relations among instances in multiple orders, which serves as a posterior regularization to enable the adaptation. In this way, the knowledge can be fully distilled and transferred to identify masked faces. Experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets show the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Zhang, Yutong Xie, Hu Wang, Jodie C Avery, M Louise Hull, Gustavo Carneiro</p>
<p>Abstract: The efficacy of deep learning-based Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) methods for skin diseases relies on analyzing multiple data modalities (i.e., clinical+dermoscopic images, and patient metadata) and addressing the challenges of multi-label classification. Current approaches tend to rely on limited multi-modal techniques and treat the multi-label problem as a multiple multi-class problem, overlooking issues related to imbalanced learning and multi-label correlation. This paper introduces the innovative Skin Lesion Classifier, utilizing a Multi-modal Multi-label TransFormer-based model (SkinM2Former). For multi-modal analysis, we introduce the Tri-Modal Cross-attention Transformer (TMCT) that fuses the three image and metadata modalities at various feature levels of a transformer encoder. For multi-label classification, we introduce a multi-head attention (MHA) module to learn multi-label correlations, complemented by an optimisation that handles multi-label and imbalanced learning problems. SkinM2Former achieves a mean average accuracy of 77.27% and a mean diagnostic accuracy of 77.85% on the public Derm7pt dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Yuan, Hongwei Li, Xingshuo Han, Guowen Xu, Wenbo Jiang, Tao Ni, Qingchuan Zhao, Yuguang Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Physical adversarial patches have emerged as a key adversarial attack to cause misclassification of traffic sign recognition (TSR) systems in the real world. However, existing adversarial patches have poor stealthiness and attack all vehicles indiscriminately once deployed. In this paper, we introduce an invisible and triggered physical adversarial patch (ITPatch) with a novel attack vector, i.e., fluorescent ink, to advance the state-of-the-art. It applies carefully designed fluorescent perturbations to a target sign, an attacker can later trigger a fluorescent effect using invisible ultraviolet light, causing the TSR system to misclassify the sign and potentially resulting in traffic accidents. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to investigate the effectiveness of ITPatch, which shows a success rate of 98.31% in low-light conditions. Furthermore, our attack successfully bypasses five popular defenses and achieves a success rate of 96.72%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Mink, Thomas Monninger, Steffen Staab</p>
<p>Abstract: In autonomous driving, High Definition (HD) maps provide a complete lane model that is not limited by sensor range and occlusions. However, the generation and upkeep of HD maps involves periodic data collection and human annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we investigate automating the lane model generation and the use of sparse vehicle observations instead of dense sensor measurements. For our approach, a pre-processing step generates polylines by aligning and aggregating observed lane boundaries. Aligned driven traces are used as starting points for predicting lane pairs defined by the left and right boundary points. We propose Lane Model Transformer Network (LMT-Net), an encoder-decoder neural network architecture that performs polyline encoding and predicts lane pairs and their connectivity. A lane graph is formed by using predicted lane pairs as nodes and predicted lane connectivity as edges. We evaluate the performance of LMT-Net on an internal dataset that consists of multiple vehicle observations as well as human annotations as Ground Truth (GT). The evaluation shows promising results and demonstrates superior performance compared to the implemented baseline on both highway and non-highway Operational Design Domain (ODD).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shizhou Zhang, Dexuan Kong, Yinghui Xing, Yue Lu, Lingyan Ran, Guoqiang Liang, Hexu Wang, Yanning Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to segment camouflaged objects which exhibit very similar patterns with the surrounding environment. Recent research works have shown that enhancing the feature representation via the frequency information can greatly alleviate the ambiguity problem between the foreground objects and the background.With the emergence of vision foundation models, like InternImage, Segment Anything Model etc, adapting the pretrained model on COD tasks with a lightweight adapter module shows a novel and promising research direction. Existing adapter modules mainly care about the feature adaptation in the spatial domain. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-guided spatial adaptation method for COD task. Specifically, we transform the input features of the adapter into frequency domain. By grouping and interacting with frequency components located within non overlapping circles in the spectrogram, different frequency components are dynamically enhanced or weakened, making the intensity of image details and contour features adaptively adjusted. At the same time, the features that are conducive to distinguishing object and background are highlighted, indirectly implying the position and shape of camouflaged object. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely adopted benchmark datasets and the proposed method outperforms 26 state-of-the-art methods with large margins. Code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> DaDong Jiang, Xianghui Yang, Zibo Zhao, Sheng Zhang, Jiaao Yu, Zeqiang Lai, Shaoxiong Yang, Chunchao Guo, Xiaobo Zhou, Zhihui Ke</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent texture generation methods achieve impressive results due to the powerful generative prior they leverage from large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. However, abstract textual prompts are limited in providing global textural or shape information, which results in the texture generation methods producing blurry or inconsistent patterns. To tackle this, we present FlexiTex, embedding rich information via visual guidance to generate a high-quality texture. The core of FlexiTex is the Visual Guidance Enhancement module, which incorporates more specific information from visual guidance to reduce ambiguity in the text prompt and preserve high-frequency details. To further enhance the visual guidance, we introduce a Direction-Aware Adaptation module that automatically designs direction prompts based on different camera poses, avoiding the Janus problem and maintaining semantically global consistency. Benefiting from the visual guidance, FlexiTex produces quantitatively and qualitatively sound results, demonstrating its potential to advance texture generation for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Ying, Li Liu, Zaipin Lin, Yangsi Shi, Yingqian Wang, Ruojing Li, Xu Cao, Boyang Li, Shilin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-frame infrared small target (MIRST) detection in satellite videos is a long-standing, fundamental yet challenging task for decades, and the challenges can be summarized as: First, extremely small target size, highly complex clutters & noises, various satellite motions result in limited feature representation, high false alarms, and difficult motion analyses. Second, the lack of large-scale public available MIRST dataset in satellite videos greatly hinders the algorithm development. To address the aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we first build a large-scale dataset for MIRST detection in satellite videos (namely IRSatVideo-LEO), and then develop a recurrent feature refinement (RFR) framework as the baseline method. Specifically, IRSatVideo-LEO is a semi-simulated dataset with synthesized satellite motion, target appearance, trajectory and intensity, which can provide a standard toolbox for satellite video generation and a reliable evaluation platform to facilitate the algorithm development. For baseline method, RFR is proposed to be equipped with existing powerful CNN-based methods for long-term temporal dependency exploitation and integrated motion compensation & MIRST detection. Specifically, a pyramid deformable alignment (PDA) module and a temporal-spatial-frequency modulation (TSFM) module are proposed to achieve effective and efficient feature alignment, propagation, aggregation and refinement. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our scheme. The comparative results show that ResUNet equipped with RFR outperforms the state-of-the-art MIRST detection methods. Dataset and code are released at https://github.com/XinyiYing/RFR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mansoor Ali Teevno, Rafael Martinez-Garcia-Pena, Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz, Sharib Ali</p>
<p>Abstract: Frequent monitoring is necessary to stratify individuals based on their likelihood of developing gastrointestinal (GI) cancer precursors. In clinical practice, white-light imaging (WLI) and complementary modalities such as narrow-band imaging (NBI) and fluorescence imaging are used to assess risk areas. However, conventional deep learning (DL) models show degraded performance due to the domain gap when a model is trained on one modality and tested on a different one. In our earlier approach, we used a superpixel-based method referred to as "SUPRA" to effectively learn domain-invariant information using color and space distances to generate groups of pixels. One of the main limitations of this earlier work is that the aggregation does not exploit structural information, making it suboptimal for segmentation tasks, especially for polyps and heterogeneous color distributions. Therefore, in this work, we propose an approach for style-content disentanglement using instance normalization and instance selective whitening (ISW) for improved domain generalization when combined with SUPRA. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: EndoUDA Barrett's Esophagus and EndoUDA polyps, and compare its performance with three state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our findings demonstrate a notable enhancement in performance compared to both baseline and SOTA methods across the target domain data. Specifically, our approach exhibited improvements of 14%, 10%, 8%, and 18% over the baseline and three SOTA methods on the polyp dataset. Additionally, it surpassed the second-best method (EndoUDA) on the Barrett's Esophagus dataset by nearly 2%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sibo Tian, Minghui Zheng, Xiao Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human motion prediction is a cornerstone of human-robot collaboration (HRC), as robots need to infer the future movements of human workers based on past motion cues to proactively plan their motion, ensuring safety in close collaboration scenarios. The diffusion model has demonstrated remarkable performance in predicting high-quality motion samples with reasonable diversity, but suffers from a slow generative process which necessitates multiple model evaluations, hindering real-world applications. To enable real-time prediction, in this work, we propose training a one-step multi-layer perceptron-based (MLP-based) diffusion model for motion prediction using knowledge distillation and Bayesian optimization. Our method contains two steps. First, we distill a pretrained diffusion-based motion predictor, TransFusion, directly into a one-step diffusion model with the same denoiser architecture. Then, to further reduce the inference time, we remove the computationally expensive components from the original denoiser and use knowledge distillation once again to distill the obtained one-step diffusion model into an even smaller model based solely on MLPs. Bayesian optimization is used to tune the hyperparameters for training the smaller diffusion model. Extensive experimental studies are conducted on benchmark datasets, and our model can significantly improve the inference speed, achieving real-time prediction without noticeable degradation in performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Chen, Xingjian Luo, Jinlin Wu, Long Bai, Zhen Lei, Hongliang Ren, Sebastien Ourselin, Hongbin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Surgical phase recognition is critical for assisting surgeons in understanding surgical videos. Existing studies focused more on online surgical phase recognition, by leveraging preceding frames to predict the current frame. Despite great progress, they formulated the task as a series of frame-wise classification, which resulted in a lack of global context of the entire procedure and incoherent predictions. Moreover, besides online analysis, accurate offline surgical phase recognition is also in significant clinical need for retrospective analysis, and existing online algorithms do not fully analyze the entire video, thereby limiting accuracy in offline analysis. To overcome these challenges and enhance both online and offline inference capabilities, we propose a universal Surgical Phase Localization Network, named SurgPLAN++, with the principle of temporal detection. To ensure a global understanding of the surgical procedure, we devise a phase localization strategy for SurgPLAN++ to predict phase segments across the entire video through phase proposals. For online analysis, to generate high-quality phase proposals, SurgPLAN++ incorporates a data augmentation strategy to extend the streaming video into a pseudo-complete video through mirroring, center-duplication, and down-sampling. For offline analysis, SurgPLAN++ capitalizes on its global phase prediction framework to continuously refine preceding predictions during each online inference step, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of phase recognition. We perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness, and our SurgPLAN++ achieves remarkable performance in both online and offline modes, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12470">HSIGene: A Foundation Model For Hyperspectral Image Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Pang, Datao Tang, Shuang Xu, Deyu Meng, Xiangyong Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) plays a vital role in various fields such as agriculture and environmental monitoring. However, due to the expensive acquisition cost, the number of hyperspectral images is limited, degenerating the performance of downstream tasks. Although some recent studies have attempted to employ diffusion models to synthesize HSIs, they still struggle with the scarcity of HSIs, affecting the reliability and diversity of the generated images. Some studies propose to incorporate multi-modal data to enhance spatial diversity, but the spectral fidelity cannot be ensured. In addition, existing HSI synthesis models are typically uncontrollable or only support single-condition control, limiting their ability to generate accurate and reliable HSIs. To alleviate these issues, we propose HSIGene, a novel HSI generation foundation model which is based on latent diffusion and supports multi-condition control, allowing for more precise and reliable HSI generation. To enhance the spatial diversity of the training data while preserving spectral fidelity, we propose a new data augmentation method based on spatial super-resolution, in which HSIs are upscaled first, and thus abundant training patches could be obtained by cropping the high-resolution HSIs. In addition, to improve the perceptual quality of the augmented data, we introduce a novel two-stage HSI super-resolution framework, which first applies RGB bands super-resolution and then utilizes our proposed Rectangular Guided Attention Network (RGAN) for guided HSI super-resolution. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of generating a vast quantity of realistic HSIs for downstream tasks such as denoising and super-resolution.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongqi Wang, Shuo Yang, Xinxiao Wu, Jiebo Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary video visual relationship detection aims to expand video visual relationship detection beyond annotated categories by detecting unseen relationships between both seen and unseen objects in videos. Existing methods usually use trajectory detectors trained on closed datasets to detect object trajectories, and then feed these trajectories into large-scale pre-trained vision-language models to achieve open-vocabulary classification. Such heavy dependence on the pre-trained trajectory detectors limits their ability to generalize to novel object categories, leading to performance degradation. To address this challenge, we propose to unify object trajectory detection and relationship classification into an end-to-end open-vocabulary framework. Under this framework, we propose a relationship-aware open-vocabulary trajectory detector. It primarily consists of a query-based Transformer decoder, where the visual encoder of CLIP is distilled for frame-wise open-vocabulary object detection, and a trajectory associator. To exploit relationship context during trajectory detection, a relationship query is embedded into the Transformer decoder, and accordingly, an auxiliary relationship loss is designed to enable the decoder to perceive the relationships between objects explicitly. Moreover, we propose an open-vocabulary relationship classifier that leverages the rich semantic knowledge of CLIP to discover novel relationships. To adapt CLIP well to relationship classification, we design a multi-modal prompting method that employs spatio-temporal visual prompting for visual representation and vision-guided language prompting for language input. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, VidVRD and VidOR, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our framework is also applied to a more difficult cross-dataset scenario to further demonstrate its generalization ability.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12507">Towards Low-latency Event-based Visual Recognition with Hybrid Step-wise Distillation Spiking Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xian Zhong, Shengwang Hu, Wenxuan Liu, Wenxin Huang, Jianhao Ding, Zhaofei Yu, Tiejun Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered significant attention for their low power consumption and high biological interpretability. Their rich spatio-temporal information processing capability and event-driven nature make them ideally well-suited for neuromorphic datasets. However, current SNNs struggle to balance accuracy and latency in classifying these datasets. In this paper, we propose Hybrid Step-wise Distillation (HSD) method, tailored for neuromorphic datasets, to mitigate the notable decline in performance at lower time steps. Our work disentangles the dependency between the number of event frames and the time steps of SNNs, utilizing more event frames during the training stage to improve performance, while using fewer event frames during the inference stage to reduce latency. Nevertheless, the average output of SNNs across all time steps is susceptible to individual time step with abnormal outputs, particularly at extremely low time steps. To tackle this issue, we implement Step-wise Knowledge Distillation (SKD) module that considers variations in the output distribution of SNNs at each time step. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our method yields competitive performance in classification tasks on neuromorphic datasets, especially at lower time steps.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhikai Wei, Wenhui Dong, Peilin Zhou, Yuliang Gu, Zhou Zhao, Yongchao Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning based methods often suffer from performance degradation caused by domain shift. In recent years, many sophisticated network structures have been designed to tackle this problem. However, the advent of large model trained on massive data, with its exceptional segmentation capability, introduces a new perspective for solving medical segmentation problems. In this paper, we propose a novel Domain-Adaptive Prompt framework for fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model (termed as DAPSAM) to address single-source domain generalization (SDG) in segmenting medical images. DAPSAM not only utilizes a more generalization-friendly adapter to fine-tune the large model, but also introduces a self-learning prototype-based prompt generator to enhance model's generalization ability. Specifically, we first merge the important low-level features into intermediate features before feeding to each adapter, followed by an attention filter to remove redundant information. This yields more robust image embeddings. Then, we propose using a learnable memory bank to construct domain-adaptive prototypes for prompt generation, helping to achieve generalizable medical image segmentation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our DAPSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two SDG medical image segmentation tasks with different modalities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Wang, Shuo Yan, Yixuan Chen, Yujiang Wang, Mingzhi Dong, Xiaochen Yang, Dongsheng Li, Robert P. Dick, Qin Lv, Fan Yang, Tun Lu, Ning Gu, Li Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video generation using diffusion-based models is constrained by high computational costs due to the frame-wise iterative diffusion process. This work presents a Diffusion Reuse MOtion (Dr. Mo) network to accelerate latent video generation. Our key discovery is that coarse-grained noises in earlier denoising steps have demonstrated high motion consistency across consecutive video frames. Following this observation, Dr. Mo propagates those coarse-grained noises onto the next frame by incorporating carefully designed, lightweight inter-frame motions, eliminating massive computational redundancy in frame-wise diffusion models. The more sensitive and fine-grained noises are still acquired via later denoising steps, which can be essential to retain visual qualities. As such, deciding which intermediate steps should switch from motion-based propagations to denoising can be a crucial problem and a key tradeoff between efficiency and quality. Dr. Mo employs a meta-network named Denoising Step Selector (DSS) to dynamically determine desirable intermediate steps across video frames. Extensive evaluations on video generation and editing tasks have shown that Dr. Mo can substantially accelerate diffusion models in video tasks with improved visual qualities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simone Fassio, Simone Monaco, Daniele Apiletti</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized various fields by enabling highly accurate predictions and estimates. One important application is probabilistic prediction, where models estimate the probability of events rather than deterministic outcomes. This approach is particularly relevant and, therefore, still unexplored for segmentation tasks where each pixel in an image needs to be classified. Conventional models often overlook the probabilistic nature of labels, but accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial for improving the reliability and applicability of models.
  In this study, we applied Calibrated Probability Estimation (CaPE) to segmentation tasks to evaluate its impact on model calibration. Our results indicate that while CaPE improves calibration, its effect is less pronounced compared to classification tasks, suggesting that segmentation models can inherently provide better probability estimates. We also investigated the influence of dataset size and bin optimization on the effectiveness of calibration. Our results emphasize the expressive power of segmentation models as probability estimators and incorporate probabilistic reasoning, which is crucial for applications requiring precise uncertainty quantification.</p>

<p>Abstract: In radiation therapy (RT), the reliance on pre-treatment computed tomography (CT) images encounter challenges due to anatomical changes, necessitating adaptive planning. Daily cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging, pivotal for therapy adjustment, falls short in tissue density accuracy. To address this, our innovative approach integrates diffusion models for CT image generation, offering precise control over data synthesis. Leveraging a self-training method with knowledge distillation, we maximize CBCT data during therapy, complemented by sparse paired fan-beam CTs. This strategy, incorporated into state-of-the-art diffusion-based models, surpasses conventional methods like Pix2pix and CycleGAN. A meticulously curated dataset of 2800 paired CBCT and CT scans, supplemented by 4200 CBCT scans, undergoes preprocessing and teacher model training, including the Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM). Pseudo-label CT images are generated, resulting in a dataset combining 5600 CT images with corresponding CBCT images. Thorough evaluation using MSE, SSIM, PSNR and LPIPS demonstrates superior performance against Pix2pix and CycleGAN. Our approach shows promise in generating high-quality CT images from CBCT scans in RT.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pre-training on large-scale, high-quality datasets is crucial for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in specialized domains such as mathematics. Despite the recognized importance, the Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) field currently lacks a comprehensive open-source pre-training dataset specifically designed for mathematical reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce InfiMM-WebMath-40B, a high-quality dataset of interleaved image-text documents. It comprises 24 million web pages, 85 million associated image URLs, and 40 billion text tokens, all meticulously extracted and filtered from CommonCrawl. We provide a detailed overview of our data collection and processing pipeline. To demonstrate the robustness of InfiMM-WebMath-40B, we conducted evaluations in both text-only and multimodal settings. Our evaluations on text-only benchmarks show that, despite utilizing only 40 billion tokens, our dataset significantly enhances the performance of our 1.3B model, delivering results comparable to DeepSeekMath-1.3B, which uses 120 billion tokens for the same model size. Nevertheless, with the introduction of our multi-modal math pre-training dataset, our models set a new state-of-the-art among open-source models on multi-modal math benchmarks such as MathVerse and We-Math.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengguang Zhou, Jing Li, Huaxia Li, Nemo Chen, Xu Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Tuning-free personalized image generation methods have achieved significant success in maintaining facial consistency, i.e., identities, even with multiple characters. However, the lack of holistic consistency in scenes with multiple characters hampers these methods' ability to create a cohesive narrative. In this paper, we introduce StoryMaker, a personalization solution that preserves not only facial consistency but also clothing, hairstyles, and body consistency, thus facilitating the creation of a story through a series of images. StoryMaker incorporates conditions based on face identities and cropped character images, which include clothing, hairstyles, and bodies. Specifically, we integrate the facial identity information with the cropped character images using the Positional-aware Perceiver Resampler (PPR) to obtain distinct character features. To prevent intermingling of multiple characters and the background, we separately constrain the cross-attention impact regions of different characters and the background using MSE loss with segmentation masks. Additionally, we train the generation network conditioned on poses to promote decoupling from poses. A LoRA is also employed to enhance fidelity and quality. Experiments underscore the effectiveness of our approach. StoryMaker supports numerous applications and is compatible with other societal plug-ins.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Malsha Ashani Mahawatta Dona, Beatriz Cabrero-Daniel, Yinan Yu, Christian Berger</p>
<p>Abstract: Today's Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased exemplary capabilities, ranging from simple text generation to advanced image processing. Such models are currently being explored for in-vehicle services such as supporting perception tasks in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) or Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, given the LLMs' capabilities to process multi-modal data. However, LLMs often generate nonsensical or unfaithful information, known as ``hallucinations'': a notable issue that needs to be mitigated. In this paper, we systematically explore the adoption of SelfCheckGPT to spot hallucinations by three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, LLaVA, and Llama3) when analysing visual automotive data from two sources: Waymo Open Dataset, from the US, and PREPER CITY dataset, from Sweden. Our results show that GPT-4o is better at generating faithful image captions than LLaVA, whereas the former demonstrated leniency in mislabeling non-hallucinated content as hallucinations compared to the latter. Furthermore, the analysis of the performance metrics revealed that the dataset type (Waymo or PREPER CITY) did not significantly affect the quality of the captions or the effectiveness of hallucination detection. However, the models showed better performance rates over images captured during daytime, compared to during dawn, dusk or night. Overall, the results show that SelfCheckGPT and its adaptation can be used to filter hallucinations in generated traffic-related image captions for state-of-the-art LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, considerable research has been conducted on vision-language models that handle both image and text data; these models are being applied to diverse downstream tasks, such as "image-related chat," "image recognition by instruction," and "answering visual questions." Vision-language models (VLMs), such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), are also high-performance image classifiers that are being developed into domain adaptation methods that can utilize language information to extend into unseen domains. However, because these VLMs embed images as a single point in a unified embedding space, there is room for improvement in the classification accuracy. Therefore, in this study, we proposed the Latent Augmentation using Regional Embedding (LARE), which embeds the image as a region in the unified embedding space learned by the VLM. By sampling the augmented image embeddings from within this latent region, LARE enables data augmentation to various unseen domains, not just to specific unseen domains. LARE achieves robust image classification for domains in and out using augmented image embeddings to fine-tune VLMs. We demonstrate that LARE outperforms previous fine-tuning models in terms of image classification accuracy on three benchmarks. We also demonstrate that LARE is a more robust and general model that is valid under multiple conditions, such as unseen domains, small amounts of data, and imbalanced data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12612">Enhancing Perception of Key Changes in Remote Sensing Image Change Captioning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Yang, Zuchao Li, Hongzan Jiao, Zhi Gao, Lefei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, while significant progress has been made in remote sensing image change captioning, existing methods fail to filter out areas unrelated to actual changes, making models susceptible to irrelevant features. In this article, we propose a novel multimodal framework for remote sensing image change captioning, guided by Key Change Features and Instruction-tuned (KCFI). This framework aims to fully leverage the intrinsic knowledge of large language models through visual instructions and enhance the effectiveness and accuracy of change features using pixel-level change detection tasks. Specifically, KCFI includes a ViTs encoder for extracting bi-temporal remote sensing image features, a key feature perceiver for identifying critical change areas, a pixel-level change detection decoder to constrain key change features, and an instruction-tuned decoder based on a large language model. Moreover, to ensure that change description and change detection tasks are jointly optimized, we employ a dynamic weight-averaging strategy to balance the losses between the two tasks. We also explore various feature combinations for visual fine-tuning instructions and demonstrate that using only key change features to guide the large language model is the optimal choice. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare it against several state-of-the-art change captioning methods on the LEVIR-CC dataset, achieving the best performance. Our code will be available at https://github.com/yangcong356/KCFI.git.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S\'andor Kuns\'agi-M\'at\'e, Levente Peth\H{o}, Lehel Seres, Tam\'as Matuszka</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D detection of traffic management objects, such as traffic lights and road signs, is vital for self-driving cars, particularly for address-to-address navigation where vehicles encounter numerous intersections with these static objects. This paper introduces a novel method for automatically generating accurate and temporally consistent 3D bounding box annotations for traffic lights and signs, effective up to a range of 200 meters. These annotations are suitable for training real-time models used in self-driving cars, which need a large amount of training data. The proposed method relies only on RGB images with 2D bounding boxes of traffic management objects, which can be automatically obtained using an off-the-shelf image-space detector neural network, along with GNSS/INS data, eliminating the need for LiDAR point cloud data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weichao Pan, Xu Wang, Wenqing Huan</p>
<p>Abstract: As a natural disaster with high suddenness and great destructiveness, fire has long posed a major threat to human society and ecological environment. In recent years, with the rapid development of smart city and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, fire detection systems based on deep learning have gradually become a key means to cope with fire hazards. However, existing fire detection models still have many challenges in terms of detection accuracy and real-time performance in complex contexts. To address these issues, we propose two key modules: EAConv (Efficient Attention Convolution) and EADown (Efficient Attention Downsampling). The EAConv module significantly improves the feature extraction efficiency by combining an efficient attention mechanism with depth-separable convolution, while the EADown module enhances the accuracy and efficiency of feature downsampling by utilizing spatial and channel attention mechanisms in combination with pooling operations. Based on these two modules, we design an efficient and lightweight flame detection model, EFA-YOLO (Efficient Feature Attention YOLO). Experimental results show that EFA-YOLO has a model parameter quantity of only 1.4M, GFLOPs of 4.6, and the inference time per image on the CPU is only 22.19 ms. Compared with existing mainstream models (e.g., YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10), EFA-YOLO exhibits a significant enhancement in detection accuracy (mAP) and inference speed, with model parameter amount is reduced by 94.6 and the inference speed is improved by 88 times.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image inpainting is a valuable technique for enhancing images that have been corrupted. The primary challenge in this research revolves around the extent of corruption in the input image that the deep learning model must restore. To address this challenge, we introduce a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for learning and replicating the missing pixels. Additionally, we have developed a distinct variant of the Super-Resolution GAN (SRGAN), which we refer to as the Semi-SRGAN (SSRGAN). Furthermore, we leveraged three diverse datasets to assess the robustness and accuracy of our proposed model. Our training process involves varying levels of pixel corruption to attain optimal accuracy and generate high-quality images.</p>

<p>Abstract: Plastic waste in aquatic environments poses severe risks to marine life and human health. Autonomous robots can be utilized to collect floating waste, but they require accurate object identification capability. While deep learning has been widely used as a powerful tool for this task, its performance is significantly limited by outdoor light conditions and water surface reflection. Light polarization, abundant in such environments yet invisible to the human eye, can be captured by modern sensors to significantly improve litter detection accuracy on water surfaces. With this goal in mind, we introduce PoTATO, a dataset containing 12,380 labeled plastic bottles and rich polarimetric information. We demonstrate under which conditions polarization can enhance object detection and, by providing raw image data, we offer an opportunity for the research community to explore novel approaches and push the boundaries of state-of-the-art object detection algorithms even further.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linjie Lyu, Ayush Tewari, Marc Habermann, Shunsuke Saito, Michael Zollh\"ofer, Thomas Leimk\"uhler, Christian Theobalt</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiance fields are powerful and, hence, popular models for representing the appearance of complex scenes. Yet, constructing them based on image observations gives rise to ambiguities and uncertainties. We propose a versatile approach for learning Gaussian radiance fields with explicit and fine-grained uncertainty estimates that impose only little additional cost compared to uncertainty-agnostic training. Our key observation is that uncertainties can be modeled as a low-dimensional manifold in the space of radiance field parameters that is highly amenable to Monte Carlo sampling. Importantly, our uncertainties are differentiable and, thus, allow for gradient-based optimization of subsequent captures that optimally reduce ambiguities. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on next-best-view planning tasks, including high-dimensional illumination planning for optimal radiance field relighting quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mujadded Al Rabbani Alif</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of construction safety, the detection of personal protective equipment, such as helmets, plays a critical role in preventing workplace injuries. This paper details the development and evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) designed for the accurate classification of helmet presence on construction sites. Initially, a simple CNN model comprising one convolutional block and one fully connected layer was developed, yielding modest results. To enhance its performance, the model was progressively refined, first by extending the architecture to include an additional convolutional block and a fully connected layer. Subsequently, batch normalization and dropout techniques were integrated, aiming to mitigate overfitting and improve the model's generalization capabilities. The performance of these models is methodically analyzed, revealing a peak F1-score of 84\%, precision of 82\%, and recall of 86\% with the most advanced configuration of the first study phase. Despite these improvements, the accuracy remained suboptimal, thus setting the stage for further architectural and operational enhancements. This work lays a foundational framework for ongoing adjustments and optimization in automated helmet detection technology, with future enhancements expected to address the limitations identified during these initial experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuting Hong, Hui Xiao, Huazheng Hao, Xiaojie Qiu, Baochen Yao, Chengbin Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancement of convolutional neural networks, semantic segmentation has achieved remarkable progress. The training of such networks heavily relies on image annotations, which are very expensive to obtain. Semi-supervised learning can utilize both labeled data and unlabeled data with the help of pseudo-labels. However, in many real-world scenarios where classes are imbalanced, majority classes often play a dominant role during training and the learning quality of minority classes can be undermined. To overcome this limitation, we propose a synergistic training framework, including a professional training module to enhance minority class learning and a general training module to learn more comprehensive semantic information. Based on a pixel selection strategy, they can iteratively learn from each other to reduce error accumulation and coupling. In addition, a dual contrastive learning with anchors is proposed to guarantee more distinct decision boundaries. In experiments, our framework demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12691">A dynamic vision sensor object recognition model based on trainable event-driven convolution and spiking attention mechanism</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Zheng, Qian Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are well-suited for processing event streams from Dynamic Visual Sensors (DVSs) due to their use of sparse spike-based coding and asynchronous event-driven computation. To extract features from DVS objects, SNNs commonly use event-driven convolution with fixed kernel parameters. These filters respond strongly to features in specific orientations while disregarding others, leading to incomplete feature extraction. To improve the current event-driven convolution feature extraction capability of SNNs, we propose a DVS object recognition model that utilizes a trainable event-driven convolution and a spiking attention mechanism. The trainable event-driven convolution is proposed in this paper to update its convolution kernel through gradient descent. This method can extract local features of the event stream more efficiently than traditional event-driven convolution. Furthermore, the spiking attention mechanism is used to extract global dependence features. The classification performances of our model are better than the baseline methods on two neuromorphic datasets including MNIST-DVS and the more complex CIFAR10-DVS. Moreover, our model showed good classification ability for short event streams. It was shown that our model can improve the performance of event-driven convolutional SNNs for DVS objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas M. Dibot, Julien P. Renoult, William Puech</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI has seen major developments in recent years, enhancing the realism of synthetic images, also known as computer-generated images. In addition, generative AI has also made it possible to modify specific image characteristics through image editing. Previous work has developed methods based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) for generating realistic images, in particular faces, but also to modify specific features. However, this work has never been applied to specific animal species. Moreover, the assessment of the results has been generally done subjectively, rather than quantitatively. In this paper, we propose an approach based on methods for generating images of faces of male or female mandrills, a non-human primate. The main novelty of proposed method is the ability to edit their sex by identifying a sex axis in the latent space of a specific GAN. In addition, we have developed an assessment of the sex levels based on statistical features extracted from real image distributions. The experimental results we obtained from a specific database are not only realistic, but also accurate, meeting a need for future work in behavioral experiments with wild mandrills.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation is a key challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring robust and accurate decision-making processes. This research introduces a new end-to-end method that exploits multimodal information from a single monocular camera to improve the steering predictions for self-driving cars. Unlike conventional models that require several sensors which can be costly and complex or rely exclusively on RGB images that may not be robust enough under different conditions, our model significantly improves vehicle steering prediction performance from a single visual sensor. By focusing on the fusion of RGB imagery with depth completion information or optical flow data, we propose a comprehensive framework that integrates these modalities through both early and hybrid fusion techniques.
  We use three distinct neural network models to implement our approach: Convolution Neural Network - Neutral Circuit Policy (CNN-NCP) , Variational Auto Encoder - Long Short-Term Memory (VAE-LSTM) , and Neural Circuit Policy architecture VAE-NCP. By incorporating optical flow into the decision-making process, our method significantly advances autonomous navigation. Empirical results from our comparative study using Boston driving data show that our model, which integrates image and motion information, is robust and reliable. It outperforms state-of-the-art approaches that do not use optical flow, reducing the steering estimation error by 31%. This demonstrates the potential of optical flow data, combined with advanced neural network architectures (a CNN-based structure for fusing data and a Recurrence-based network for inferring a command from latent space), to enhance the performance of autonomous vehicles steering estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas P\"ollabauer, Ashwin Pramod, Volker Knauthe, Michael Wahl</p>
<p>Abstract: 6D object pose estimation involves determining the three-dimensional translation and rotation of an object within a scene and relative to a chosen coordinate system. This problem is of particular interest for many practical applications in industrial tasks such as quality control, bin picking, and robotic manipulation, where both speed and accuracy are critical for real-world deployment. Current models, both classical and deep-learning-based, often struggle with the trade-off between accuracy and latency. Our research focuses on enhancing the speed of a prominent state-of-the-art deep learning model, GDRNPP, while keeping its high accuracy. We employ several techniques to reduce the model size and improve inference time. These techniques include using smaller and quicker backbones, pruning unnecessary parameters, and distillation to transfer knowledge from a large, high-performing model to a smaller, more efficient student model. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed configuration maintains accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art while significantly improving inference time. This advancement could lead to more efficient and practical applications in various industrial scenarios, thereby enhancing the overall applicability of 6D Object Pose Estimation models in real-world settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoqing Zhang, Wenbo Zhao, Jian Liu, Yuanchao Bai, Junjun Jiang, Xianming Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient storage of large-scale point cloud data has become increasingly challenging due to advancements in scanning technology. Recent deep learning techniques have revolutionized this field; However, most existing approaches rely on single-modality contexts, such as octree nodes or voxel occupancy, limiting their ability to capture information across large regions. In this paper, we propose PVContext, a hybrid context model for effective octree-based point cloud compression. PVContext comprises two components with distinct modalities: the Voxel Context, which accurately represents local geometric information using voxels, and the Point Context, which efficiently preserves global shape information from point clouds. By integrating these two contexts, we retain detailed information across large areas while controlling the context size. The combined context is then fed into a deep entropy model to accurately predict occupancy. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to G-PCC, our method reduces the bitrate by 37.95\% on SemanticKITTI LiDAR point clouds and by 48.98\% and 36.36\% on dense object point clouds from MPEG 8i and MVUB, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qijian Tian, Xin Tan, Yuan Xie, Lizhuang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose DrivingForward, a feed-forward Gaussian Splatting model that reconstructs driving scenes from flexible surround-view input. Driving scene images from vehicle-mounted cameras are typically sparse, with limited overlap, and the movement of the vehicle further complicates the acquisition of camera extrinsics. To tackle these challenges and achieve real-time reconstruction, we jointly train a pose network, a depth network, and a Gaussian network to predict the Gaussian primitives that represent the driving scenes. The pose network and depth network determine the position of the Gaussian primitives in a self-supervised manner, without using depth ground truth and camera extrinsics during training. The Gaussian network independently predicts primitive parameters from each input image, including covariance, opacity, and spherical harmonics coefficients. At the inference stage, our model can achieve feed-forward reconstruction from flexible multi-frame surround-view input. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art feed-forward and scene-optimized reconstruction methods in terms of reconstruction.</p>

Using COCO-Occ, we systematically assess and quantify the impact of occlusion on panoptic segmentation on samples having different levels of occlusion. Comparative experiments with SOTA panoptic models demonstrate that the presence of occlusion significantly affects performance with higher occlusion levels resulting in notably poorer performance. Additionally, we propose a straightforward yet effective method as an initial attempt to leverage the occlusion annotation using contrastive learning to render a model that learns a more robust representation capturing different severities of occlusion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach boosts the performance of the baseline model and achieves SOTA performance on the proposed COCO-Occ dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Letian Huang, Jie Guo, Jialin Dan, Ruoyu Fu, Shujie Wang, Yuanqi Li, Yanwen Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has achieved impressive results in novel view synthesis, demonstrating high fidelity and efficiency. However, it easily exhibits needle-like artifacts, especially when increasing the sampling rate. Mip-Splatting tries to remove these artifacts with a 3D smoothing filter for frequency constraints and a 2D Mip filter for approximated supersampling. Unfortunately, it tends to produce over-blurred results, and sometimes needle-like Gaussians still persist. Our spectral analysis of the covariance matrix during optimization and densification reveals that current 3D-GS lacks shape awareness, relying instead on spectral radius and view positional gradients to determine splitting. As a result, needle-like Gaussians with small positional gradients and low spectral entropy fail to split and overfit high-frequency details. Furthermore, both the filters used in 3D-GS and Mip-Splatting reduce the spectral entropy and increase the condition number during zooming in to synthesize novel view, causing view inconsistencies and more pronounced artifacts. Our Spectral-GS, based on spectral analysis, introduces 3D shape-aware splitting and 2D view-consistent filtering strategies, effectively addressing these issues, enhancing 3D-GS's capability to represent high-frequency details without noticeable artifacts, and achieving high-quality photorealistic rendering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyue Zhang, Zhiliu Yang, Xinhe Zuo, Yuxin Tong, Ying Long, Chen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for large-scale scene reconstruction based on 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and aims to address the scalability and accuracy challenges faced by existing methods. For tackling the scalability issue, we split the large scene into multiple cells, and the candidate point-cloud and camera views of each cell are correlated through a visibility-based camera selection and a progressive point-cloud extension. To reinforce the rendering quality, three highlighted improvements are made in comparison with vanilla 3DGS, which are a strategy of the ray-Gaussian intersection and the novel Gaussians density control for learning efficiency, an appearance decoupling module based on ConvKAN network to solve uneven lighting conditions in large-scale scenes, and a refined final loss with the color loss, the depth distortion loss, and the normal consistency loss. Finally, the seamless stitching procedure is executed to merge the individual Gaussian radiance field for novel view synthesis across different cells. Evaluation of Mill19, Urban3D, and MatrixCity datasets shows that our method consistently generates more high-fidelity rendering results than state-of-the-art methods of large-scale scene reconstruction. We further validate the generalizability of the proposed approach by rendering on self-collected video clips recorded by a commercial drone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Zheng, Lin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenging problem of cross-modal (image-to-events) adaptation for event-based recognition without accessing any labeled source image data. This task is arduous due to the substantial modality gap between images and events. With only a pre-trained source model available, the key challenge lies in extracting knowledge from this model and effectively transferring knowledge to the event-based domain. Inspired by the natural ability of language to convey semantics across different modalities, we propose EventDance++, a novel framework that tackles this unsupervised source-free cross-modal adaptation problem from a language-guided perspective. We introduce a language-guided reconstruction-based modality bridging (L-RMB) module, which reconstructs intensity frames from events in a self-supervised manner. Importantly, it leverages a vision-language model to provide further supervision, enriching the surrogate images and enhancing modality bridging. This enables the creation of surrogate images to extract knowledge (i.e., labels) from the source model. On top, we propose a multi-representation knowledge adaptation (MKA) module to transfer knowledge to target models, utilizing multiple event representations to capture the spatiotemporal characteristics of events fully. The L-RMB and MKA modules are jointly optimized to achieve optimal performance in bridging the modality gap. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that EventDance++ performs on par with methods that utilize source data, validating the effectiveness of our language-guided approach in event-based recognition.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive success of text-to-image (TTI) generation models, existing studies overlook the issue of whether these models accurately convey factual information. In this paper, we focus on the problem of image hallucination, where images created by generation models fail to faithfully depict factual content. To address this, we introduce I-HallA (Image Hallucination evaluation with Question Answering), a novel automated evaluation metric that measures the factuality of generated images through visual question answering (VQA). We also introduce I-HallA v1.0, a curated benchmark dataset for this purpose. As part of this process, we develop a pipeline that generates high-quality question-answer pairs using multiple GPT-4 Omni-based agents, with human judgments to ensure accuracy. Our evaluation protocols measure image hallucination by testing if images from existing text-to-image models can correctly respond to these questions. The I-HallA v1.0 dataset comprises 1.2K diverse image-text pairs across nine categories with 1,000 rigorously curated questions covering various compositional challenges. We evaluate five text-to-image models using I-HallA and reveal that these state-of-the-art models often fail to accurately convey factual information. Moreover, we validate the reliability of our metric by demonstrating a strong Spearman correlation (rho=0.95) with human judgments. We believe our benchmark dataset and metric can serve as a foundation for developing factually accurate text-to-image generation models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12813">Autonomous Visual Fish Pen Inspections for Estimating the State of Biofouling Buildup Using ROV -- Extended Abstract</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Matej Fabijani\'c, Nadir Kapetanovi\'c, Nikola Mi\v{s}kovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: The process of fish cage inspections, which is a necessary maintenance task at any fish farm, be it small scale or industrial, is a task that has the potential to be fully automated. Replacing trained divers who perform regular inspections with autonomous marine vehicles would lower the costs of manpower and remove the risks associated with humans performing underwater inspections. Achieving such a level of autonomy implies developing an image processing algorithm that is capable of estimating the state of biofouling buildup. The aim of this work is to propose a complete solution for automating the said inspection process; from developing an autonomous control algorithm for an ROV, to automatically segmenting images of fish cages, and accurately estimating the state of biofouling. The first part is achieved by modifying a commercially available ROV with an acoustic SBL positioning system and developing a closed-loop control system. The second part is realized by implementing a proposed biofouling estimation framework, which relies on AI to perform image segmentation, and by processing images using established computer vision methods to obtain a rough estimate of the distance of the ROV from the fish cage. This also involved developing a labeling tool in order to create a dataset of images for the neural network performing the semantic segmentation to be trained on. The experimental results show the viability of using an ROV fitted with an acoustic transponder for autonomous missions, and demonstrate the biofouling estimation framework's ability to provide accurate assessments, alongside satisfactory distance estimation capabilities. In conclusion, the achieved biofouling estimation accuracy showcases clear potential for use in the aquaculture industry.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12817">Automated Linear Disturbance Mapping via Semantic Segmentation of Sentinel-2 Imagery</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew M. Nagel, Anne Webster, Christopher Henry, Christopher Storie, Ignacio San-Miguel Sanchez, Olivier Tsui, Jason Duffe, Andy Dean</p>
<p>Abstract: In Canada's northern regions, linear disturbances such as roads, seismic exploration lines, and pipelines pose a significant threat to the boreal woodland caribou population (Rangifer tarandus). To address the critical need for management of these disturbances, there is a strong emphasis on developing mapping approaches that accurately identify forest habitat fragmentation. The traditional approach is manually generating maps, which is time-consuming and lacks the capability for frequent updates. Instead, applying deep learning methods to multispectral satellite imagery offers a cost-effective solution for automated and regularly updated map production. Deep learning models have shown promise in extracting paved roads in urban environments when paired with high-resolution (<0.5m) imagery, but their effectiveness for general linear feature extraction in forested areas from lower resolution imagery remains underexplored. This research employs a deep convolutional neural network model based on the VGGNet16 architecture for semantic segmentation of lower resolution (10m) Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, creating precise multi-class linear disturbance maps. The model is trained using ground-truth label maps sourced from the freely available Alberta Institute of Biodiversity Monitoring Human Footprint dataset, specifically targeting the Boreal and Taiga Plains ecozones in Alberta, Canada. Despite challenges in segmenting lower resolution imagery, particularly for thin linear disturbances like seismic exploration lines that can exhibit a width of 1-3 pixels in Sentinel-2 imagery, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the VGGNet model for accurate linear disturbance retrieval. By leveraging the freely available Sentinel-2 imagery, this work advances cost-effective automated mapping techniques for identifying and monitoring linear disturbance fragmentation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12883">Improving Prototypical Parts Abstraction for Case-Based Reasoning Explanations Designed for the Kidney Stone Type Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Flores-Araiza, Francisco Lopez-Tiro, Cl\'ement Larose, Salvador Hinojosa, Andres Mendez-Vazquez, Miguel Gonzalez-Mendoza, Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz, Christian Daul</p>
<p>Abstract: The in-vivo identification of the kidney stone types during an ureteroscopy would be a major medical advance in urology, as it could reduce the time of the tedious renal calculi extraction process, while diminishing infection risks. Furthermore, such an automated procedure would make possible to prescribe anti-recurrence treatments immediately. Nowadays, only few experienced urologists are able to recognize the kidney stone types in the images of the videos displayed on a screen during the endoscopy. Thus, several deep learning (DL) models have recently been proposed to automatically recognize the kidney stone types using ureteroscopic images. However, these DL models are of black box nature whicl limits their applicability in clinical settings. This contribution proposes a case-based reasoning DL model which uses prototypical parts (PPs) and generates local and global descriptors. The PPs encode for each class (i.e., kidney stone type) visual feature information (hue, saturation, intensity and textures) similar to that used by biologists. The PPs are optimally generated due a new loss function used during the model training. Moreover, the local and global descriptors of PPs allow to explain the decisions ("what" information, "where in the images") in an understandable way for biologists and urologists. The proposed DL model has been tested on a database including images of the six most widespread kidney stone types. The overall average classification accuracy was 90.37. When comparing this results with that of the eight other DL models of the kidney stone state-of-the-art, it can be seen that the valuable gain in explanability was not reached at the expense of accuracy which was even slightly increased with respect to that (88.2) of the best method of the literature. These promising and interpretable results also encourage urologists to put their trust in AI-based solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunal Chelani, Assia Benbihi, Torsten Sattler, Fredrik Kahl</p>
<p>Abstract: With their meaningful geometry and their omnipresence in the 3D world, edges are extremely useful primitives in computer vision. 3D edges comprise of lines and curves, and methods to reconstruct them use either multi-view images or point clouds as input. State-of-the-art image-based methods first learn a 3D edge point cloud then fit 3D edges to it. The edge point cloud is obtained by learning a 3D neural implicit edge field from which the 3D edge points are sampled on a specific level set (0 or 1). However, such methods present two important drawbacks: i) it is not realistic to sample points on exact level sets due to float imprecision and training inaccuracies. Instead, they are sampled within a range of levels so the points do not lie accurately on the 3D edges and require further processing. ii) Such implicit representations are computationally expensive and require long training times. In this paper, we address these two limitations and propose a 3D edge mapping that is simpler, more efficient, and preserves accuracy. Our method learns explicitly the 3D edge points and their edge direction hence bypassing the need for point sampling. It casts a 3D edge point as the center of a 3D Gaussian and the edge direction as the principal axis of the Gaussian. Such a representation has the advantage of being not only geometrically meaningful but also compatible with the efficient training optimization defined in Gaussian Splatting. Results show that the proposed method produces edges as accurate and complete as the state-of-the-art while being an order of magnitude faster.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas H\"ollein, Alja\v{z} Bo\v{z}i\v{c}, Michael Zollh\"ofer, Matthias Nie{\ss}ner</p>
<p>Abstract: We present 3DGS-LM, a new method that accelerates the reconstruction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by replacing its ADAM optimizer with a tailored Levenberg-Marquardt (LM). Existing methods reduce the optimization time by decreasing the number of Gaussians or by improving the implementation of the differentiable rasterizer. However, they still rely on the ADAM optimizer to fit Gaussian parameters of a scene in thousands of iterations, which can take up to an hour. To this end, we change the optimizer to LM that runs in conjunction with the 3DGS differentiable rasterizer. For efficient GPU parallization, we propose a caching data structure for intermediate gradients that allows us to efficiently calculate Jacobian-vector products in custom CUDA kernels. In every LM iteration, we calculate update directions from multiple image subsets using these kernels and combine them in a weighted mean. Overall, our method is 30% faster than the original 3DGS while obtaining the same reconstruction quality. Our optimization is also agnostic to other methods that acclerate 3DGS, thus enabling even faster speedups compared to vanilla 3DGS.</p>

<p>Abstract: Monitoring plankton distribution, particularly harmful phytoplankton, is vital for preserving aquatic ecosystems, regulating the global climate, and ensuring environmental protection. Traditional methods for monitoring are often time-consuming, expensive, error-prone, and unsuitable for large-scale applications, highlighting the need for accurate and efficient automated systems. In this study, we evaluate several state-of-the-art CNN models, including ResNet, ResNeXt, DenseNet, and EfficientNet, using three transfer learning approaches: linear probing, fine-tuning, and a combined approach, to classify eleven harmful phytoplankton genera from microscopic images. The best performance was achieved by ResNet-50 using the fine-tuning approach, with an accuracy of 96.97%. The results also revealed that the models struggled to differentiate between four harmful phytoplankton types with similar morphological features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixiang Cheng, Hongxin Xiang, Pengsen Ma, Li Zeng, Xin Jin, Xixi Yang, Jianxin Lin, Yang Deng, Bosheng Song, Xinxin Feng, Changhui Deng, Xiangxiang Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Activity cliffs, which refer to pairs of molecules that are structurally similar but show significant differences in their potency, can lead to model representation collapse and make the model challenging to distinguish them. Our research indicates that as molecular similarity increases, graph-based methods struggle to capture these nuances, whereas image-based approaches effectively retain the distinctions. Thus, we developed MaskMol, a knowledge-guided molecular image self-supervised learning framework. MaskMol accurately learns the representation of molecular images by considering multiple levels of molecular knowledge, such as atoms, bonds, and substructures. By utilizing pixel masking tasks, MaskMol extracts fine-grained information from molecular images, overcoming the limitations of existing deep learning models in identifying subtle structural changes. Experimental results demonstrate MaskMol's high accuracy and transferability in activity cliff estimation and compound potency prediction across 20 different macromolecular targets, outperforming 25 state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning approaches. Visualization analyses reveal MaskMol's high biological interpretability in identifying activity cliff-relevant molecular substructures. Notably, through MaskMol, we identified candidate EP4 inhibitors that could be used to treat tumors. This study not only raises awareness about activity cliffs but also introduces a novel method for molecular image representation learning and virtual screening, advancing drug discovery and providing new insights into structure-activity relationships (SAR).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anselm Haselhoff, Kevin Trelenberg, Fabian K\"uppers, Jonas Schneider</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual counterfactual explanation (CF) methods modify image concepts, e.g, shape, to change a prediction to a predefined outcome while closely resembling the original query image. Unlike self-explainable models (SEMs) and heatmap techniques, they grant users the ability to examine hypothetical "what-if" scenarios. Previous CF methods either entail post-hoc training, limiting the balance between transparency and CF quality, or demand optimization during inference. To bridge the gap between transparent SEMs and CF methods, we introduce the GdVAE, a self-explainable model based on a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), featuring a Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA) classifier and integrated CF explanations. Full transparency is achieved through a generative classifier that leverages class-specific prototypes for the downstream task and a closed-form solution for CFs in the latent space. The consistency of CFs is improved by regularizing the latent space with the explainer function. Extensive comparisons with existing approaches affirm the effectiveness of our method in producing high-quality CF explanations while preserving transparency. Code and models are public.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing vision-language understanding benchmarks largely consist of images of objects in their usual contexts. As a consequence, recent multimodal large language models can perform well with only a shallow visual understanding by relying on background language biases. Thus, strong performance on these benchmarks does not necessarily correlate with strong visual understanding. In this paper, we release JourneyBench, a comprehensive human-annotated benchmark of generated images designed to assess the model's fine-grained multimodal reasoning abilities across five tasks: complementary multimodal chain of thought, multi-image VQA, imaginary image captioning, VQA with hallucination triggers, and fine-grained retrieval with sample-specific distractors. Unlike existing benchmarks, JourneyBench explicitly requires fine-grained multimodal reasoning in unusual imaginary scenarios where language bias and holistic image gist are insufficient. We benchmark state-of-the-art models on JourneyBench and analyze performance along a number of fine-grained dimensions. Results across all five tasks show that JourneyBench is exceptionally challenging for even the best models, indicating that models' visual reasoning abilities are not as strong as they first appear. We discuss the implications of our findings and propose avenues for further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor Rong, Jingxiang Chen, Sherwin Bahmani, Kiriakos N. Kutulakos, David B. Lindell</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian splatting has demonstrated excellent performance for view synthesis and scene reconstruction. The representation achieves photorealistic quality by optimizing the position, scale, color, and opacity of thousands to millions of 2D or 3D Gaussian primitives within a scene. However, since each Gaussian primitive encodes both appearance and geometry, these attributes are strongly coupled--thus, high-fidelity appearance modeling requires a large number of Gaussian primitives, even when the scene geometry is simple (e.g., for a textured planar surface). We propose to texture each 2D Gaussian primitive so that even a single Gaussian can be used to capture appearance details. By employing per-primitive texturing, our appearance representation is agnostic to the topology and complexity of the scene's geometry. We show that our approach, GStex, yields improved visual quality over prior work in texturing Gaussian splats. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our decoupling enables improved novel view synthesis performance compared to 2D Gaussian splatting when reducing the number of Gaussian primitives, and that GStex can be used for scene appearance editing and re-texturing.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing demand for high-quality 3D assets across various industries necessitates efficient and automated 3D content creation. Despite recent advancements in 3D generative models, existing methods still face challenges with optimization speed, geometric fidelity, and the lack of assets for physically based rendering (PBR). In this paper, we introduce 3DTopia-XL, a scalable native 3D generative model designed to overcome these limitations. 3DTopia-XL leverages a novel primitive-based 3D representation, PrimX, which encodes detailed shape, albedo, and material field into a compact tensorial format, facilitating the modeling of high-resolution geometry with PBR assets. On top of the novel representation, we propose a generative framework based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT), which comprises 1) Primitive Patch Compression, 2) and Latent Primitive Diffusion. 3DTopia-XL learns to generate high-quality 3D assets from textual or visual inputs. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate that 3DTopia-XL significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality 3D assets with fine-grained textures and materials, efficiently bridging the quality gap between generative models and real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has paved the way for AI search engines, e.g., SearchGPT, showcasing a new paradigm in human-internet interaction. However, most current AI search engines are limited to text-only settings, neglecting the multimodal user queries and the text-image interleaved nature of website information. Recently, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made impressive strides. Yet, whether they can function as AI search engines remains under-explored, leaving the potential of LMMs in multimodal search an open question. To this end, we first design a delicate pipeline, MMSearch-Engine, to empower any LMMs with multimodal search capabilities. On top of this, we introduce MMSearch, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark to assess the multimodal search performance of LMMs. The curated dataset contains 300 manually collected instances spanning 14 subfields, which involves no overlap with the current LMMs' training data, ensuring the correct answer can only be obtained within searching. By using MMSearch-Engine, the LMMs are evaluated by performing three individual tasks (requery, rerank, and summarization), and one challenging end-to-end task with a complete searching process. We conduct extensive experiments on closed-source and open-source LMMs. Among all tested models, GPT-4o with MMSearch-Engine achieves the best results, which surpasses the commercial product, Perplexity Pro, in the end-to-end task, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline. We further present error analysis to unveil current LMMs still struggle to fully grasp the multimodal search tasks, and conduct ablation study to indicate the potential of scaling test-time computation for AI search engine. We hope MMSearch may provide unique insights to guide the future development of multimodal AI search engine. Project Page: https://mmsearch.github.io</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose the first video diffusion framework for reference-based lineart video colorization. Unlike previous works that rely solely on image generative models to colorize lineart frame by frame, our approach leverages a large-scale pretrained video diffusion model to generate colorized animation videos. This approach leads to more temporally consistent results and is better equipped to handle large motions. Firstly, we introduce Sketch-guided ControlNet which provides additional control to finetune an image-to-video diffusion model for controllable video synthesis, enabling the generation of animation videos conditioned on lineart. We then propose Reference Attention to facilitate the transfer of colors from the reference frame to other frames containing fast and expansive motions. Finally, we present a novel scheme for sequential sampling, incorporating the Overlapped Blending Module and Prev-Reference Attention, to extend the video diffusion model beyond its original fixed-length limitation for long video colorization. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of frame and video quality, as well as temporal consistency. Moreover, our method is capable of generating high-quality, long temporal-consistent animation videos with large motions, which is not achievable in previous works.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zuyan Liu, Yuhao Dong, Ziwei Liu, Winston Hu, Jiwen Lu, Yongming Rao</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual data comes in various forms, ranging from small icons of just a few pixels to long videos spanning hours. Existing multi-modal LLMs usually standardize these diverse visual inputs to a fixed resolution for visual encoders and yield similar numbers of tokens for LLMs. This approach is non-optimal for multimodal understanding and inefficient for processing inputs with long and short visual contents. To solve the problem, we propose Oryx, a unified multimodal architecture for the spatial-temporal understanding of images, videos, and multi-view 3D scenes. Oryx offers an on-demand solution to seamlessly and efficiently process visual inputs with arbitrary spatial sizes and temporal lengths through two core innovations: 1) a pre-trained OryxViT model that can encode images at any resolution into LLM-friendly visual representations; 2) a dynamic compressor module that supports 1x to 16x compression on visual tokens by request. These design features enable Oryx to accommodate extremely long visual contexts, such as videos, with lower resolution and high compression while maintaining high recognition precision for tasks like document understanding with native resolution and no compression. Beyond the architectural improvements, enhanced data curation and specialized training on long-context retrieval and spatial-aware data help Oryx achieve strong capabilities in image, video, and 3D multimodal understanding simultaneously.

<p>Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire various strategies for integrating video modalities. A key approach is Video-LLMs, which incorporate an optimizable interface linking sophisticated video encoders to LLMs. However, due to computation and data limitations, these Video-LLMs are typically pre-trained to process only short videos, limiting their broader application for understanding longer video content. Additionally, fine-tuning Video-LLMs to handle longer videos is cost-prohibitive. Consequently, it becomes essential to explore the interpolation of Video-LLMs under a completely training-free setting. In this paper, we first identify the primary challenges in interpolating Video-LLMs: (1) the video encoder and modality alignment projector are fixed, preventing the integration of additional frames into Video-LLMs, and (2) the LLM backbone is limited in its content length capabilities, which complicates the processing of an increased number of video tokens. To address these challenges, we propose a specific INTerPolation method for Video-LLMs (INTP-Video-LLMs). We introduce an alternative video token rearrangement technique that circumvents limitations imposed by the fixed video encoder and alignment projector. Furthermore, we introduce a training-free LLM context window extension method to enable Video-LLMs to understand a correspondingly increased number of visual tokens.</p>

<p>Abstract: Audio-visual pre-trained models have gained substantial attention recently and demonstrated superior performance on various audio-visual tasks. This study investigates whether pre-trained audio-visual models demonstrate non-arbitrary associations between sounds and visual representations$\unicode{x2013}$known as sound symbolism$\unicode{x2013}$which is also observed in humans.

Our findings reveal a significant correlation between the models' outputs and established patterns of sound symbolism, particularly in models trained on speech data. These results suggest that such models can capture sound-meaning connections akin to human language processing, providing insights into both cognitive architectures and machine learning strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxin Ding, Cathy Y. Li, Shawn Shan, Ben Y. Zhao, Haitao Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works show that text-to-image generative models are surprisingly vulnerable to a variety of poisoning attacks. Empirical results find that these models can be corrupted by altering associations between individual text prompts and associated visual features. Furthermore, a number of concurrent poisoning attacks can induce "model implosion," where the model becomes unable to produce meaningful images for unpoisoned prompts. These intriguing findings highlight the absence of an intuitive framework to understand poisoning attacks on these models. In this work, we establish the first analytical framework on robustness of image generative models to poisoning attacks, by modeling and analyzing the behavior of the cross-attention mechanism in latent diffusion models. We model cross-attention training as an abstract problem of "supervised graph alignment" and formally quantify the impact of training data by the hardness of alignment, measured by an Alignment Difficulty (AD) metric. The higher the AD, the harder the alignment. We prove that AD increases with the number of individual prompts (or concepts) poisoned. As AD grows, the alignment task becomes increasingly difficult, yielding highly distorted outcomes that frequently map meaningful text prompts to undefined or meaningless visual representations. As a result, the generative model implodes and outputs random, incoherent images at large. We validate our analytical framework through extensive experiments, and we confirm and explain the unexpected (and unexplained) effect of model implosion while producing new, unforeseen insights. Our work provides a useful tool for studying poisoning attacks against diffusion models and their defenses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amine Sadikine, Bogdan Badic, Jean-Pierre Tasu, Vincent Noblet, Pascal Ballet, Dimitris Visvikis, Pierre-Henri Conze</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting hepatic vessels from abdominal images is of high interest for clinicians since it allows to divide the liver into functionally-independent Couinaud segments. In this respect, an automated liver blood vessel extraction is widely summoned. Despite the significant growth in performance of semantic segmentation methodologies, preserving the complex multi-scale geometry of main vessels and ramifications remains a major challenge. This paper provides a new deep supervised approach for vessel segmentation, with a strong focus on representations arising from the different scales inherent to the vascular tree geometry. In particular, we propose a new clustering technique to decompose the tree into various scale levels, from tiny to large vessels. Then, we extend standard 3D UNet to multi-task learning by incorporating scale-specific auxiliary tasks and contrastive learning to encourage the discrimination between scales in the shared representation. Promising results, depicted in several evaluation metrics, are revealed on the public 3D-IRCADb dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amine Sadikine, Bogdan Badic, Enzo Ferrante, Vincent Noblet, Pascal Ballet, Dimitris Visvikis, Pierre-Henri Conze</p>
<p>Abstract: The precise delineation of blood vessels in medical images is critical for many clinical applications, including pathology detection and surgical planning. However, fully-automated vascular segmentation is challenging because of the variability in shape, size, and topology. Manual segmentation remains the gold standard but is time-consuming, subjective, and impractical for large-scale studies. Hence, there is a need for automatic and reliable segmentation methods that can accurately detect blood vessels from medical images. The integration of shape and topological priors into vessel segmentation models has been shown to improve segmentation accuracy by offering contextual information about the shape of the blood vessels and their spatial relationships within the vascular tree. To further improve anatomical consistency, we propose a new joint prior encoding mechanism which incorporates both shape and topology in a single latent space. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on the publicly available 3D-IRCADb dataset. More globally, the proposed approach holds promise in overcoming the challenges associated with automatic vessel delineation and has the potential to advance the field of deep priors encoding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual signals can enhance audiovisual speech recognition accuracy by providing additional contextual information. Given the complexity of visual signals, an audiovisual speech recognition model requires robust generalization capabilities across diverse video scenarios, presenting a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce EVA, leveraging the mixture-of-Experts for audioVisual ASR to perform robust speech recognition for ``in-the-wild'' videos. Specifically, we first encode visual information into visual tokens sequence and map them into speech space by a lightweight projection. Then, we build EVA upon a robust pretrained speech recognition model, ensuring its generalization ability. Moreover, to incorporate visual information effectively, we inject visual information into the ASR model through a mixture-of-experts module. Experiments show our model achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks, which demonstrates the generalization ability of EVA across diverse video domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose FD3, a fundus image enhancement method based on direct diffusion bridges, which can cope with a wide range of complex degradations, including haze, blur, noise, and shadow. We first propose a synthetic forward model through a human feedback loop with board-certified ophthalmologists for maximal quality improvement of low-quality in-vivo images.

Through extensive experiments, we show that FD3 establishes \add{superior quality} not only on synthetic degradations but also on in vivo studies with low-quality fundus photos taken from patients with cataracts or small pupils.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bochao Liu, Jianghu Lu, Pengju Wang, Junjie Zhang, Dan Zeng, Zhenxing Qian, Shiming Ge</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models can achieve high inference accuracy by extracting rich knowledge from massive well-annotated data, but may pose the risk of data privacy leakage in practical deployment. In this paper, we present an effective teacher-student learning approach to train privacy-preserving deep learning models via differentially private data-free distillation. The main idea is generating synthetic data to learn a student that can mimic the ability of a teacher well-trained on private data. In the approach, a generator is first pretrained in a data-free manner by incorporating the teacher as a fixed discriminator. With the generator, massive synthetic data can be generated for model training without exposing data privacy. Then, the synthetic data is fed into the teacher to generate private labels. Towards this end, we propose a label differential privacy algorithm termed selective randomized response to protect the label information. Finally, a student is trained on the synthetic data with the supervision of private labels. In this way, both data privacy and label privacy are well protected in a unified framework, leading to privacy-preserving models. Extensive experiments and analysis clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation is a challenging task due to the absence of paired examples, which complicates learning the complex mappings between the distinct distributions of the source and target domains. One of the most commonly used approach for this task is CycleGAN which requires the training of a new pair of generator-discriminator networks for each domain pair. In this paper, we propose a new image-to-image translation framework named Image-to-Image-Generative-Adversarial-CLIP (I2I-Galip) where we utilize a pre-trained multi-model foundation model (i.e., CLIP) to mitigate the need of separate generator-discriminator pairs for each source-target mapping while achieving better and more efficient multi-domain translation. By utilizing the massive knowledge gathered during pre-training a foundation model, our approach makes use of a single lightweight generator network with ~13M parameters for the multi-domain image translation task. Comprehensive experiments on translation performance in public MRI and CT datasets show the superior performance of the proposed framework over the existing approaches.

The advent of deep learning has catalyzed the development of cutting-edge methods for the expedited reconstruction of MRI scans, utilizing convolutional neural networks and, more recently, vision transformers.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Zhong, Di Chen, Pengqin Wang, Wenrui Wang, Shaojie Shen, Yonghong Liu, Meixin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: On-road air pollution exhibits substantial variability over short distances due to emission sources, dilution, and physicochemical processes. Integrating mobile monitoring data with street view images (SVIs) holds promise for predicting local air pollution. However, algorithms, sampling strategies, and image quality introduce extra errors due to a lack of reliable references that quantify their effects. To bridge this gap, we employed 314 taxis to monitor NO, NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 dynamically and sampled corresponding SVIs, aiming to develop a reliable strategy. We extracted SVI features from ~ 382,000 streetscape images, which were collected at various angles (0{\deg}, 90{\deg}, 180{\deg}, 270{\deg}) and ranges (buffers with radii of 100m, 200m, 300m, 400m, 500m). Also, three machine learning algorithms alongside the linear land-used regression (LUR) model were experimented with to explore the influences of different algorithms. Four typical image quality issues were identified and discussed. Generally, machine learning methods outperform linear LUR for estimating the four pollutants, with the ranking: random forest > XGBoost > neural network > LUR. Compared to single-angle sampling, the averaging strategy is an effective method to avoid bias of insufficient feature capture. Therefore, the optimal sampling strategy is to obtain SVIs at a 100m radius buffer and extract features using the averaging strategy. This approach achieved estimation results for each aggregation location with absolute errors almost less than 2.5 {\mu}g/m^2 or ppb. Overexposure, blur, and underexposure led to image misjudgments and incorrect identifications, causing an overestimation of road features and underestimation of human-activity features, contributing to inaccurate NO, NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeng-Lin Li, Ming-Ching Chang, Wei-Chao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for trustworthy AI in real-world applications. Leveraging recent advances in representation learning and latent embeddings, Various scoring algorithms estimate distributions beyond the training data. However, a single embedding space falls short in characterizing in-distribution data and defending against diverse OOD conditions. This paper introduces a novel Multi-Manifold Embedding Learning (MMEL) framework, optimizing hypersphere and hyperbolic spaces jointly for enhanced OOD detection. MMEL generates representative embeddings and employs a prototype-aware scoring function to differentiate OOD samples. It operates with very few OOD samples and requires no model retraining. Experiments on six open datasets demonstrate MMEL's significant reduction in FPR while maintaining a high AUC compared to state-of-the-art distance-based OOD detection methods. We analyze the effects of learning multiple manifolds and visualize OOD score distributions across datasets. Notably, enrolling ten OOD samples without retraining achieves comparable FPR and AUC to modern outlier exposure methods using 80 million outlier samples for model training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable potential in visuomotor control and instruction comprehension through end-to-end learning processes. However, current VLA models face significant challenges: they are slow during inference and require extensive pre-training on large amounts of robotic data, making real-world deployment difficult. In this paper, we introduce a new family of compact vision-language-action models, called TinyVLA, which offers two key advantages over existing VLA models: (1) faster inference speeds, and (2) improved data efficiency, eliminating the need for pre-training stage. Our framework incorporates two essential components to build TinyVLA: (1) initializing the policy backbone with robust, high-speed multimodal models, and (2) integrating a diffusion policy decoder during fine-tuning to enable precise robot actions. We conducted extensive evaluations of TinyVLA in both simulation and on real robots, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model, OpenVLA, in terms of speed and data efficiency, while delivering comparable or superior performance. Additionally, TinyVLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities across various dimensions, including language instructions, novel objects, unseen positions, changes in object appearance, background variations, and environmental shifts, often matching or exceeding the performance of OpenVLA. We believe that \methodname offers an interesting perspective on utilizing pre-trained multimodal models for policy learning. Our project is at https://tiny-vla.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyuan Bian, Nan Xia, Xia Yang, Feifei Wang, Fengjiao Wang, Bin Wei, Qian Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, has significantly advanced 3D medical image segmentation. While CNNs are highly effective at capturing local features, their limited receptive fields may hinder performance in complex clinical scenarios. In contrast, Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies but are computationally intensive, making them expensive to train and deploy. Recently, the Mamba architecture, based on the State Space Model (SSM), has been proposed to efficiently model long-range dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity. However, its application in medical image segmentation reveals shortcomings, particularly in capturing critical local features essential for accurate delineation of clinical regions. In this study, we propose MambaClinix, a novel U-shaped architecture for medical image segmentation that integrates a hierarchical gated convolutional network(HGCN) with Mamba in an adaptive stage-wise framework. This design significantly enhances computational efficiency and high-order spatial interactions, enabling the model to effectively capture both proximal and distal relationships in medical images. Specifically, our HGCN is designed to mimic the attention mechanism of Transformers by a purely convolutional structure, facilitating high-order spatial interactions in feature maps while avoiding the computational complexity typically associated with Transformer-based methods. Additionally, we introduce a region-specific Tversky loss, which emphasizes specific pixel regions to improve auto-segmentation performance, thereby optimizing the model's decision-making process. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MambaClinix achieves high segmentation accuracy while maintaining low model complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyang Yu, Shengxi Li, Danilo Mandic</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models aim to learn the distribution of datasets, such as images, so as to be able to generate samples that statistically resemble real data. However, learning the underlying probability distribution can be very challenging and intractable. To this end, we introduce an approach which employs the characteristic function (CF), a probabilistic descriptor that directly corresponds to the distribution. However, unlike the probability density function (pdf), the characteristic function not only always exists, but also provides an additional degree of freedom, hence enhances flexibility in learning distributions. This removes the critical dependence on pdf-based assumptions, which limit the applicability of traditional methods. While several works have attempted to use CF in generative modeling, they often impose strong constraints on the training process. In contrast, our approach calculates the distance between query points in the CF domain, which is an unconstrained and well defined problem. Next, to deal with the sampling strategy, which is crucial to model performance, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based optimizer for the sampling process, which identifies regions where the difference between CFs is most significant. In addition, our method allows the use of a pre-trained model, such as a well-trained autoencoder, and is capable of learning directly in its feature space, without modifying its parameters. This offers a flexible and robust approach to generative modeling, not only provides broader applicability and improved performance, but also equips any latent space world with the ability to become a generative model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaogang Du, Dongxin Gu, Tao Lei, Yipeng Jiao, Yibin Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, encoder-decoder networks have focused on expanding receptive fields and incorporating multi-scale context to capture global features for objects of varying sizes. However, as networks deepen, they often discard fine spatial details, impairing precise object localization. Additionally, conventional decoders' use of interpolation for upsampling leads to a loss of global context, diminishing edge segmentation accuracy. To address the above problems, we propose a novel parallel multi-resolution encoder-decoder network, namely PMR-Net for short. First, we design a parallel multi-resolution encoder and a multi-resolution context encoder. The parallel multi-resolution encoder can extract and fuse multi-scale fine-grained local features in parallel for input images with different resolutions. The multi-resolution context encoder fuses the global context semantic features of different receptive fields from different encoder branches to maintain effectively the integrity of global information. Secondly, we design a parallel multi-resolution decoder symmetrical to the structure of parallel multi-resolution encoder. The decoder can continuously supplement the global context features of low-resolution branches to the feature maps of high-resolution branches, and effectively solve the problem of global context feature loss caused by upsampling operation in the decoding process. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our proposed PMR-Net can achieve more accurate segmentation results than state-of-the-art methods on five public available datasets. Moreover, PMR-Net is also a flexible network framework, which can meet the requirements of different scenarios by adjusting the number of network layers and the number of parallel encoder-decoder branches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chajin Shin, Sangjin Lee, Sangyoun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, significant improvements in rate-distortion performance of image compression have been achieved with deep-learning techniques. A key factor in this success is the use of additional bits to predict an approximation of the latent vector, which is the output of the encoder, through another neural network. Then, only the difference between the prediction and the latent vector is coded into the bitstream, along with its estimated probability distribution. We introduce a new predictive structure consisting of the auxiliary coarse network and the main network, inspired by neural video compression. The auxiliary coarse network encodes the auxiliary information and predicts the approximation of the original image as multi-scale features. The main network encodes the residual between the predicted feature from the auxiliary coarse network and the feature of the original image. To further leverage our new structure, we propose Auxiliary info-guided Feature Prediction (AFP) module that uses global correlation to predict more accurate predicted features. Moreover, we present Context Junction module that refines the auxiliary feature from AFP module and produces the residuals between the refined features and the original image features. Finally, we introduce Auxiliary info-guided Parameter Estimation (APE) module, which predicts the approximation of the latent vector and estimates the probability distribution of these residuals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules by various ablation studies. Under extensive experiments, our model outperforms other neural image compression models and achieves a 19.49\% higher rate-distortion performance than VVC on Tecnick dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a crucial non-invasive method used to capture the movement of internal organs and tissues, making it a key tool for medical diagnosis. However, dynamic MRI faces a major challenge: long acquisition times needed to achieve high spatial and temporal resolution. This leads to higher costs, patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and lower image quality. Compressed Sensing (CS) addresses this problem by acquiring a reduced amount of MR data in the Fourier domain, based on a chosen sampling pattern, and reconstructing the full image from this partial data. While various deep learning methods have been developed to optimize these sampling patterns and improve reconstruction, they often struggle with slow optimization and inference times or are limited to specific temporal dimensions used during training. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-compressed sensing approach that uses 3D window attention and flexible, temporally extendable acquisition trajectories. Our method significantly reduces both training and inference times compared to existing approaches, while also adapting to different temporal dimensions during inference without requiring additional training. Tests with real data show that our approach outperforms current state-of-theart techniques. The code for reproducing all experiments will be made available upon acceptance of the paper.</p>

Accurate assessment of myocardial tissue viability for post-MI patients is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning, e.g. allowing surgical revascularization, or to determine the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in the future. Fine-grained analysis of the myocardium and its surrounding anatomical structures can be performed by combining the information obtained from complementary medical imaging techniques. In this work, we use late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) magnetic resonance (MR), T2-weighted (T2) MR and balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) cine MR in order to semantically segment the left and right ventricle, healthy and scarred myocardial tissue, as well as edema. To this end, we propose the Multi-Sequence Cascading Refinement CNN (MS-CaRe-CNN), a 2-stage CNN cascade that receives multi-sequence data and generates predictions of the anatomical structures of interest without considering tissue viability at Stage 1. The prediction of Stage 1 is then further refined in Stage 2, where the model additionally distinguishes myocardial tissue based on viability, i.e. healthy, scarred and edema regions. Our proposed method is set up as a 5-fold ensemble and semantically segments scar tissue achieving 62.31% DSC and 82.65% precision, as well as 63.78% DSC and 87.69% precision for the combined scar and edema region. These promising results for such small and challenging structures confirm that MS-CaRe-CNN is well-suited to generate semantic segmentations to assess the viability of myocardial tissue, enabling downstream tasks like personalized therapy planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philippe Zhang, Pierre-Henri Conze, Mathieu Lamard, Gwenol\'e Quellec, Mostafa El Habib Daho</p>
<p>Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema are significant complications of diabetes that can lead to vision loss. Early detection through ultra-widefield fundus imaging enhances patient outcomes but presents challenges in image quality and analysis scale. This paper introduces deep learning solutions for automated UWF image analysis within the framework of the MICCAI 2024 UWF4DR challenge. We detail methods and results across three tasks: image quality assessment, detection of referable DR, and identification of DME. Employing advanced convolutional neural network architectures such as EfficientNet and ResNet, along with preprocessing and augmentation strategies, our models demonstrate robust performance in these tasks. Results indicate that deep learning can significantly aid in the automated analysis of UWF images, potentially improving the efficiency and accuracy of DR and DME detection in clinical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengxu Zhu, Lei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Protection of biometric templates is a critical and urgent area of focus. IronMask demonstrates outstanding recognition performance while protecting facial templates against existing known attacks. In high-level, IronMask can be conceptualized as a fuzzy commitment scheme building on the hypersphere directly. We devise an attack on IronMask targeting on the security notion of renewability. Our attack, termed as Probabilistic Linear Regression Attack, utilizes the linearity of underlying used error correcting code. This attack is the first algorithm to successfully recover the original template when getting multiple protected templates in acceptable time and requirement of storage. We implement experiments on IronMask applied to protect ArcFace that well verify the validity of our attacks. Furthermore, we carry out experiments in noisy environments and confirm that our attacks are still applicable. Finally, we put forward two strategies to mitigate this type of attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vasileios Leon, Panagiotis Minaidis, George Lentaris, Dimitrios Soudris</p>
<p>Abstract: The challenging deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV) algorithms at the edge pushes the community of embedded computing to examine heterogeneous System-on-Chips (SoCs). Such novel computing platforms provide increased diversity in interfaces, processors and storage, however, the efficient partitioning and mapping of AI/CV workloads still remains an open issue. In this context, the current paper develops a hybrid AI/CV system on Intel's Movidius Myriad X, which is an heterogeneous Vision Processing Unit (VPU), for initializing and tracking the satellite's pose in space missions. The space industry is among the communities examining alternative computing platforms to comply with the tight constraints of on-board data processing, while it is also striving to adopt functionalities from the AI domain. At algorithmic level, we rely on the ResNet-50-based UrsoNet network along with a custom classical CV pipeline. For efficient acceleration, we exploit the SoC's neural compute engine and 16 vector processors by combining multiple parallelization and low-level optimization techniques. The proposed single-chip, robust-estimation, and real-time solution delivers a throughput of up to 5 FPS for 1-MegaPixel RGB images within a limited power envelope of 2W.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tsung-Han Wu, Hung-Ting Su, Shang-Tse Chen, Winston H. Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: The robust self-training (RST) framework has emerged as a prominent approach for semi-supervised adversarial training. To explore the possibility of tackling more complicated tasks with even lower labeling budgets, unlike prior approaches that rely on robust pretrained models, we present SNORD - a simple yet effective framework that introduces contemporary semi-supervised learning techniques into the realm of adversarial training. By enhancing pseudo labels and managing noisy training data more effectively, SNORD showcases impressive, state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets and labeling budgets, all without the need for pretrained models. Compared to full adversarial supervision, SNORD achieves a 90% relative robust accuracy under epsilon = 8/255 AutoAttack, requiring less than 0.1%, 2%, and 10% labels for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet-200, respectively. Additional experiments confirm the efficacy of each component and demonstrate the adaptability of integrating SNORD with existing adversarial pretraining strategies to further bolster robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marin Ka\v{c}an, Marko \v{S}evrovi\'c, Sini\v{s}a \v{S}egvi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Road-safety inspection is an indispensable instrument for reducing road-accident fatalities contributed to road infrastructure. Recent work formalizes road-safety assessment in terms of carefully selected risk factors that are also known as road-safety attributes. In current practice, these attributes are manually annotated in geo-referenced monocular video for each road segment. We propose to reduce dependency on tedious human labor by automating recognition with a two-stage neural architecture. The first stage predicts more than forty road-safety attributes by observing a local spatio-temporal context. Our design leverages an efficient convolutional pipeline, which benefits from pre-training on semantic segmentation of street scenes. The second stage enhances predictions through sequential integration across a larger temporal window. Our design leverages per-attribute instances of a lightweight bidirectional LSTM architecture. Both stages alleviate extreme class imbalance by incorporating a multi-task variant of recall-based dynamic loss weighting. We perform experiments on the iRAP-BH dataset, which involves fully labeled geo-referenced video along 2,300 km of public roads in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We also validate our approach by comparing it with the related work on two road-scene classification datasets from the literature: Honda Scenes and FM3m. Experimental evaluation confirms the value of our contributions on all three datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuchong Zhang, Changfeng Sun, Haoliang Han, Hongbin Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that object detection networks are usually vulnerable to adversarial examples. Generally, adversarial attacks for object detection can be categorized into targeted and untargeted attacks. Compared with untargeted attacks, targeted attacks present greater challenges and all existing targeted attack methods launch the attack by misleading detectors to mislabel the detected object as a specific wrong label. However, since these methods must depend on the presence of the detected objects within the victim image, they suffer from limitations in attack scenarios and attack success rates. In this paper, we propose a targeted feature space attack method that can mislead detectors to `fabricate' extra designated objects regardless of whether the victim image contains objects or not. Specifically, we introduce a guided image to extract coarse-grained features of the target objects and design an innovative dual attention mechanism to filter out the critical features of the target objects efficiently. The attack performance of the proposed method is evaluated on MS COCO and BDD100K datasets with FasterRCNN and YOLOv5. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed targeted feature space attack method shows significant improvements in terms of image-specific, universality, and generalization attack performance, compared with the previous targeted attack for object detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Letitia Parcalabescu, Anette Frank</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision and language models (VL) are known to exploit unrobust indicators in individual modalities (e.g., introduced by distributional biases) instead of focusing on relevant information in each modality. That a unimodal model achieves similar accuracy on a VL task to a multimodal one, indicates that so-called unimodal collapse occurred. However, accuracy-based tests fail to detect e.g., when the model prediction is wrong, while the model used relevant information from a modality. Instead, we propose MM-SHAP, a performance-agnostic multimodality score based on Shapley values that reliably quantifies in which proportions a multimodal model uses individual modalities. We apply MM-SHAP in two ways: (1) to compare models for their average degree of multimodality, and (2) to measure for individual models the contribution of individual modalities for different tasks and datasets. Experiments with six VL models -- LXMERT, CLIP and four ALBEF variants -- on four VL tasks highlight that unimodal collapse can occur to different degrees and in different directions, contradicting the wide-spread assumption that unimodal collapse is one-sided. Based on our results, we recommend MM-SHAP for analysing multimodal tasks, to diagnose and guide progress towards multimodal integration.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Ladwig, Rene Ebertowski, Alexander Pech, Ralf D\"orner, Christian Geiger</p>
<p>Abstract: While head-mounted displays (HMDs) for Virtual Reality (VR) have become widely available in the consumer market, they pose a considerable obstacle for a realistic face-to-face conversation in VR since HMDs hide a significant portion of the participants faces. Even with image streams from cameras directly attached to an HMD, stitching together a convincing image of an entire face remains a challenging task because of extreme capture angles and strong lens distortions due to a wide field of view. Compared to the long line of research in VR, reconstruction of faces hidden beneath an HMD is a very recent topic of research. While the current state-of-the-art solutions demonstrate photo-realistic 3D reconstruction results, they require high-cost laboratory equipment and large computational costs. We present an approach that focuses on low-cost hardware and can be used on a commodity gaming computer with a single GPU. We leverage the benefits of an end-to-end pipeline by means of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our GAN produces a frontal-facing 2.5D point cloud based on a training dataset captured with an RGBD camera. In our approach, the training process is offline, while the reconstruction runs in real-time. Our results show adequate reconstruction quality within the 'learned' expressions. Expressions not learned by the network produce artifacts and can trigger the Uncanny Valley effect.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renrui Zhang, Jiaming Han, Chris Liu, Peng Gao, Aojun Zhou, Xiangfei Hu, Shilin Yan, Pan Lu, Hongsheng Li, Yu Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: We present LLaMA-Adapter, a lightweight adaption method to efficiently fine-tune LLaMA into an instruction-following model. Using 52K self-instruct demonstrations, LLaMA-Adapter only introduces 1.2M learnable parameters upon the frozen LLaMA 7B model, and costs less than one hour for fine-tuning on 8 A100 GPUs. Specifically, we adopt a set of learnable adaption prompts, and prepend them to the word tokens at higher transformer layers. Then, a zero-initialized attention mechanism with zero gating is proposed, which adaptively injects the new instructional cues into LLaMA, while effectively preserves its pre-trained knowledge. With our efficient training, LLaMA-Adapter can generate high-quality responses, comparable to Alpaca with fully fine-tuned 7B parameters. Besides language commands, our approach can be simply extended to multi-modal instructions for learning image-conditioned LLaMA model, which achieves superior reasoning performance on ScienceQA and COCO Caption benchmarks. Furthermore, we also evaluate the zero-initialized attention mechanism for fine-tuning other pre-trained models (ViT, RoBERTa) on traditional vision and language tasks, demonstrating the superior generalization capacity of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiming Li, Xueqian Wang, Gang Li, Baocheng Geng, Pramod K. Varshney</p>
<p>Abstract: Change detection (CD) in heterogeneous remote sensing images has been widely used for disaster monitoring and land-use management. In the past decade, the heterogeneous CD problem has significantly benefited from the development of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the purely data-driven DNNs perform like a black box where the lack of interpretability limits the trustworthiness and controllability of DNNs in most practical CD applications. As a powerful knowledge-driven tool, copula theory performs well in modeling relationships among random variables. To enhance the interpretability of existing neural networks for CD, we propose a knowledge-data-driven heterogeneous CD method based on a copula-guided neural network, named NN-Copula-CD. In our NN-Copula-CD, the mathematical characteristics of copula are employed as the loss functions to supervise a neural network to learn the dependence between bi-temporal heterogeneous superpixel pairs, and then the changed regions are identified via binary classification based on the degrees of dependence of all the superpixel pairs in the bi-temporal images. We conduct in-depth experiments on three datasets with heterogeneous images, where both quantitative and visual results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed NN-Copula-CD method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramanathan Rajendiran, Debaditya Roy, Basura Fernando</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans have the natural ability to recognize actions even if the objects involved in the action or the background are changed. Humans can abstract away the action from the appearance of the objects which is referred to as compositionality of actions. We focus on this compositional aspect of action recognition to impart human-like generalization abilities to video action-recognition models. First, we propose an interaction model that captures both fine-grained and long-range interactions between hands and objects. Frame-wise hand-object interactions capture fine-grained movements, while long-range interactions capture broader context and disambiguate actions across time. Second, in order to provide additional contextual cues to differentiate similar actions, we infuse the interaction tokens with global motion information from video tokens. The final global motion refined interaction tokens are used for compositional action recognition. We show the effectiveness of our interaction-centric approach on the compositional Something-Else dataset where we obtain a new state-of-the-art result outperforming recent object-centric methods by a significant margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yash Turkar, Pranay Meshram, Christo Aluckal, Charuvahan Adhivarahan, Karthik Dantu</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in sensors, algorithms, and compute hardware have made 3D perception feasible in real time. Current methods to compare and evaluate the quality of a 3D model, such as Chamfer, Hausdorff, and Earth-Mover's distance, are uni-dimensional and have limitations, including an inability to capture coverage, local variations in density and error, and sensitivity to outliers. In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework for point clouds (Empir3D) that consists of four metrics: resolution to quantify the ability to distinguish between individual parts in the point cloud, accuracy to measure registration error, coverage to evaluate the portion of missing data, and artifact score to characterize the presence of artifacts. Through detailed analysis, we demonstrate the complementary nature of each of these dimensions and the improvements they provide compared to the aforementioned uni-dimensional measures. Furthermore, we illustrate the utility of Empir3D by comparing our metrics with uni-dimensional metrics for two 3D perception applications (SLAM and point cloud completion). We believe that Empir3D advances our ability to reason about point clouds and helps better debug 3D perception applications by providing a richer evaluation of their performance. Our implementation of Empir3D, custom real-world datasets, evaluations on learning methods, and detailed documentation on how to integrate the pipeline will be made available upon publication.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) in practical scenarios is significantly challenged by the presence of missing or incomplete data across different modalities. To overcome these challenges, researchers have aimed to simulate incomplete conditions during the training phase to enhance the system's overall robustness. Traditional methods have often involved discarding data or substituting data segments with zero vectors to approximate these incompletenesses. However, such approaches neither accurately represent real-world conditions nor adequately address the issue of noisy data availability. For instance, a blurry image cannot be simply replaced with zero vectors, while still retaining information. To tackle this issue and develop a more precise MER system, we introduce a novel noise-robust MER model that effectively learns robust multimodal joint representations from noisy data. This approach includes two pivotal components: firstly, a noise scheduler that adjusts the type and level of noise in the data to emulate various realistic incomplete situations. Secondly, a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)-based module is employed to reconstruct these robust multimodal joint representations from the noisy inputs. Notably, the introduction of the noise scheduler enables the exploration of an entirely new type of incomplete data condition, which is impossible with existing methods. Extensive experimental evaluations on the benchmark datasets IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI demonstrate the effectiveness of the noise scheduler and the excellent performance of our proposed model.

<p>Abstract: In this study, we investigate the novel challenge of cross-domain video-based person re-identification (Re-ID). Here, we utilize synthetic video datasets as the source domain for training and real-world videos for testing, notably reducing the reliance on expensive real data acquisition and annotation. To harness the potential of synthetic data, we first propose a self-supervised domain-invariant feature learning strategy for both static and dynamic (temporal) features. Additionally, to enhance person identification accuracy in the target domain, we propose a mean-teacher scheme incorporating a self-supervised ID consistency loss. Experimental results across five real datasets validate the rationale behind cross-synthetic-real domain adaptation and demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Notably, the discovery that synthetic data outperforms real data in the cross-domain scenario is a surprising outcome.

<p>Abstract: We present Capturing the Unseen (CAPUS), a novel facial motion capture (MoCap) technique that operates without visual signals. CAPUS leverages miniaturized Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) as a new sensing modality for facial motion capture. While IMUs have become essential in full-body MoCap for their portability and independence from environmental conditions, their application in facial MoCap remains underexplored. We address this by customizing micro-IMUs, small enough to be placed on the face, and strategically positioning them in alignment with key facial muscles to capture expression dynamics. CAPUS introduces the first facial IMU dataset, encompassing both IMU and visual signals from participants engaged in diverse activities such as multilingual speech, facial expressions, and emotionally intoned auditions. We train a Transformer Diffusion-based neural network to infer Blendshape parameters directly from IMU data. Our experimental results demonstrate that CAPUS reliably captures facial motion in conditions where visual-based methods struggle, including facial occlusions, rapid movements, and low-light environments. Additionally, by eliminating the need for visual inputs, CAPUS offers enhanced privacy protection, making it a robust solution for vision-free facial MoCap.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samar Daou, Achraf Ben-Hamadou, Ahmed Rekik, Abdelaziz Kallel</p>
<p>Abstract: Lipreading involves using visual data to recognize spoken words by analyzing the movements of the lips and surrounding area. It is a hot research topic with many potential applications, such as human-machine interaction and enhancing audio speech recognition. Recent deep-learning based works aim to integrate visual features extracted from the mouth region with landmark points on the lip contours. However, employing a simple combination method such as concatenation may not be the most effective approach to get the optimal feature vector. To address this challenge, firstly, we propose a cross-attention fusion-based approach for large lexicon Arabic vocabulary to predict spoken words in videos. Our method leverages the power of cross-attention networks to efficiently integrate visual and geometric features computed on the mouth region. Secondly, we introduce the first large-scale Lipreading in the Wild for Arabic (LRW-AR) dataset containing 20,000 videos for 100-word classes, uttered by 36 speakers. The experimental results obtained on LRW-AR and ArabicVisual databases showed the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach in recognizing Arabic words. Our work provides insights into the feasibility and effectiveness of applying lipreading techniques to the Arabic language, opening doors for further research in this field.

<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) rely on vision encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs) to exhibit remarkable capabilities on various multi-modal tasks in the joint space of vision and language. However, typographic attacks, which disrupt Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), have also been expected to be a security threat to LVLMs. Firstly, we verify typographic attacks on current well-known commercial and open-source LVLMs and uncover the widespread existence of this threat. Secondly, to better assess this vulnerability, we propose the most comprehensive and largest-scale Typographic Dataset to date. The Typographic Dataset not only considers the evaluation of typographic attacks under various multi-modal tasks but also evaluates the effects of typographic attacks, influenced by texts generated with diverse factors. Based on the evaluation results, we investigate the causes why typographic attacks impacting VLMs and LVLMs, leading to three highly insightful discoveries. During the process of further validating the rationality of our discoveries, we can reduce the performance degradation caused by typographic attacks from 42.07\% to 13.90\%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Huang, Weilin Wan, Yue Yang, Chris Callison-Burch, Mark Yatskar, Lingjie Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-motion models excel at efficient human motion generation, but existing approaches lack fine-grained controllability over the generation process. Consequently, modifying subtle postures within a motion or inserting new actions at specific moments remains a challenge, limiting the applicability of these methods in diverse scenarios. In light of these challenges, we introduce CoMo, a Controllable Motion generation model, adept at accurately generating and editing motions by leveraging the knowledge priors of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, CoMo decomposes motions into discrete and semantically meaningful pose codes, with each code encapsulating the semantics of a body part, representing elementary information such as "left knee slightly bent". Given textual inputs, CoMo autoregressively generates sequences of pose codes, which are then decoded into 3D motions. Leveraging pose codes as interpretable representations, an LLM can directly intervene in motion editing by adjusting the pose codes according to editing instructions. Experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves competitive performance in motion generation compared to state-of-the-art models while, in human studies, CoMo substantially surpasses previous work in motion editing abilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Shape plays an important role in computer graphics, offering informative features to convey an object's morphology and functionality. Shape analysis in brain imaging can help interpret structural and functionality correlations of the human brain. In this work, we investigate the shape of the brain's 3D white matter connections and its potential predictive relationship to human cognitive function. We reconstruct brain connections as sequences of 3D points using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography. To describe each connection, we extract 12 shape descriptors in addition to traditional dMRI connectivity and tissue microstructure features. We introduce a novel framework, Shape--fused Fiber Cluster Transformer (SFFormer), that leverages a multi-head cross-attention feature fusion module to predict subject-specific language performance based on dMRI tractography. We assess the performance of the method on a large dataset including 1065 healthy young adults. The results demonstrate that both the transformer-based SFFormer model and its inter/intra feature fusion with shape, microstructure, and connectivity are informative, and together, they improve the prediction of subject-specific language performance scores. Overall, our results indicate that the shape of the brain's connections is predictive of human language function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongdong Luo, Haojia Lin, Xiawu Zheng, Yigeng Jiang, Fei Chao, Jie Hu, Guannan Jiang, Songan Zhang, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) and 3D Dense Captioning (3DDC) are two crucial tasks in various 3D applications, which require both shared and complementary information in localization and visual-language relationships. Therefore, existing approaches adopt the two-stage "detect-then-describe/discriminate" pipeline, which relies heavily on the performance of the detector, resulting in suboptimal performance. Inspired by DETR, we propose a unified framework, 3DGCTR, to jointly solve these two distinct but closely related tasks in an end-to-end fashion. The key idea is to reconsider the prompt-based localization ability of the 3DVG model. In this way, the 3DVG model with a well-designed prompt as input can assist the 3DDC task by extracting localization information from the prompt. In terms of implementation, we integrate a Lightweight Caption Head into the existing 3DVG network with a Caption Text Prompt as a connection, effectively harnessing the existing 3DVG model's inherent localization capacity, thereby boosting 3DDC capability. This integration facilitates simultaneous multi-task training on both tasks, mutually enhancing their performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. Specifically, on the ScanRefer dataset, 3DGCTR surpasses the state-of-the-art 3DDC method by 4.3% in CIDEr@0.5IoU in MLE training and improves upon the SOTA 3DVG method by 3.16% in Acc@0.25IoU.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Monninger, Vandana Dokkadi, Md Zafar Anwar, Steffen Staab</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an accurate representation of the environment. A strategy toward high accuracy is to fuse data from several sensors. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders can achieve this by mapping data from individual sensors into one joint latent space. For cost-efficient camera-only systems, this provides an effective mechanism to fuse data from multiple cameras with different views. Accuracy can further be improved by aggregating sensor information over time. This is especially important in monocular camera systems to account for the lack of explicit depth and velocity measurements. Thereby, the effectiveness of developed BEV encoders crucially depends on the operators used to aggregate temporal information and on the used latent representation spaces. We analyze BEV encoders proposed in the literature and compare their effectiveness, quantifying the effects of aggregation operators and latent representations. While most existing approaches aggregate temporal information either in image or in BEV latent space, our analyses and performance comparisons suggest that these latent representations exhibit complementary strengths. Therefore, we develop a novel temporal BEV encoder, TempBEV, which integrates aggregated temporal information from both latent spaces. We consider subsequent image frames as stereo through time and leverage methods from optical flow estimation for temporal stereo encoding. Empirical evaluation on the NuScenes dataset shows a significant improvement by TempBEV over the baseline for 3D object detection and BEV segmentation. The ablation uncovers a strong synergy of joint temporal aggregation in the image and BEV latent space. These results indicate the overall effectiveness of our approach and make a strong case for aggregating temporal information in both image and BEV latent spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maitreya Shelare, Neha Shigvan, Atharva Satam, Poonam Sonar</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of remote-sensing image classification has seen immense progress with the rise of convolutional neural networks, and more recently, through vision transformers. These models, with their self-attention mechanism, can effectively capture global relationships and long-range dependencies between the image patches, in contrast with traditional convolutional models. This paper introduces StrideNET, a dual-branch transformer-based model developed for terrain recognition and surface roughness extraction. The terrain recognition branch employs the Swin Transformer to classify varied terrains by leveraging its capability to capture both local and global features. Complementing this, the roughness extraction branch utilizes a statistical texture-feature analysis technique to dynamically extract important land surface properties such as roughness and slipperiness. The model was trained on a custom dataset consisting of four terrain classes - grassy, marshy, sandy, and rocky, and it outperforms benchmark CNN and transformer based models, by achieving an average test accuracy of over 99 % across all classes. The applications of this work extend to different domains such as environmental monitoring, land use and cover classification, disaster response and precision agriculture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianshun Zeng, Wang Li, Yanjie Lv, Shuai Gao, YuChu Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Street-view image has been widely applied as a crucial mobile mapping data source. The inpainting of street-view images is a critical step for street-view image processing, not only for the privacy protection, but also for the urban environment mapping applications. This paper presents a novel Deep Neural Network (DNN), multi-scale semantic prior Feature guided image inpainting Network (MFN) for inpainting street-view images, which generate static street-view images without moving objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). To enhance global context understanding, a semantic prior prompter is introduced to learn rich semantic priors from large pre-trained model. We design the prompter by stacking multiple Semantic Pyramid Aggregation (SPA) modules, capturing a broad range of visual feature patterns. A semantic-enhanced image generator with a decoder is proposed that incorporates a novel cascaded Learnable Prior Transferring (LPT) module at each scale level. For each decoder block, an attention transfer mechanism is applied to capture long-term dependencies, and the semantic prior features are fused with the image features to restore plausible structure in an adaptive manner. Additionally, a background-aware data processing scheme is adopted to prevent the generation of hallucinated objects within holes. Experiments on Apolloscapes and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate better performance than state-of-the-art methods, with MAE, and LPIPS showing improvements of about 9.5% and 41.07% respectively. Visual comparison survey among multi-group person is also conducted to provide performance evaluation, and the results suggest that the proposed MFN offers a promising solution for privacy protection and generate more reliable scene for urban applications with street-view images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aoxue Li, Mingyang Yi, Zhenguo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, text-to-image (T2I) editing has been greatly pushed forward by applying diffusion models. Despite the visual promise of the generated images, inconsistencies with the expected textual prompt remain prevalent. This paper aims to systematically improve the text-guided image editing techniques based on diffusion models, by addressing their limitations. Notably, the common idea in diffusion-based editing firstly reconstructs the source image via inversion techniques e.g., DDIM Inversion. Then following a fusion process that carefully integrates the source intermediate (hidden) states (obtained by inversion) with the ones of the target image. Unfortunately, such a standard pipeline fails in many cases due to the interference of texture retention and the new characters creation in some regions. To mitigate this, we incorporate human annotation as an external knowledge to confine editing within a ``Mask-informed'' region. Then we carefully Fuse the edited image with the source image and a constructed intermediate image within the model's Self-Attention module. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the proposed ``MaSaFusion'' significantly improves the existing T2I editing techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xue Zhang, Si-Yuan Cao, Fang Wang, Runmin Zhang, Zhe Wu, Xiaohan Zhang, Xiaokai Bai, Hui-Liang Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Most recent multispectral object detectors employ a two-branch structure to extract features from RGB and thermal images. While the two-branch structure achieves better performance than a single-branch structure, it overlooks inference efficiency. This conflict is increasingly aggressive, as recent works solely pursue higher performance rather than both performance and efficiency. In this paper, we address this issue by improving the performance of efficient single-branch structures. We revisit the reasons causing the performance gap between these structures. For the first time, we reveal the information interference problem in the naive early-fusion strategy adopted by previous single-branch structures. Besides, we find that the domain gap between multispectral images, and weak feature representation of the single-branch structure are also key obstacles for performance. Focusing on these three problems, we propose corresponding solutions, including a novel shape-priority early-fusion strategy, a weakly supervised learning method, and a core knowledge distillation technique. Experiments demonstrate that single-branch networks equipped with these three contributions achieve significant performance enhancements while retaining high efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sifan Zhou, Zhihang Yuan, Dawei Yang, Ziyu Zhao, Xing Hu, Yuguang Shi, Xiaobo Lu, Qiang Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time and high-performance 3D object detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving and robotics. Recent pillar-based 3D object detectors have gained significant attention due to their compact representation and low computational overhead, making them suitable for onboard deployment and quantization. However, existing pillar-based detectors still suffer from information loss along height dimension and large numerical distribution difference during pillar feature encoding (PFE), which severely limits their performance and quantization potential. To address above issue, we first unveil the importance of different input information during PFE and identify the height dimension as a key factor in enhancing 3D detection performance. Motivated by this observation, we propose a height-aware pillar feature encoder, called PillarHist. Specifically, PillarHist statistics the discrete distribution of points at different heights within one pillar with the information entropy guidance. This simple yet effective design greatly preserves the information along the height dimension while significantly reducing the computation overhead of the PFE. Meanwhile, PillarHist also constrains the arithmetic distribution of PFE input to a stable range, making it quantization-friendly. Notably, PillarHist operates exclusively within the PFE stage to enhance performance, enabling seamless integration into existing pillar-based methods without introducing complex operations. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PillarHist in terms of both efficiency and performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Cheng, Erjia Xiao, Jiayan Yang, Jiahang Cao, Le Yang, Jize Zhang, Kaidi Xu, Jindong Gu, Renjing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Following the advent of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) era of large models, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with the ability to understand cross-modal interactions between vision and text have attracted wide attention. Adversarial examples with human-imperceptible perturbation are shown to possess a characteristic known as transferability, which means that a perturbation generated by one model could also mislead another different model. Augmenting the diversity in input data is one of the most significant methods for enhancing adversarial transferability. This method has been certified as a way to significantly enlarge the threat impact under black-box conditions. Research works also demonstrate that MLLMs can be exploited to generate adversarial examples in the white-box scenario. However, the adversarial transferability of such perturbations is quite limited, failing to achieve effective black-box attacks across different models. In this paper, we propose the Typographic-based Semantic Transfer Attack (TSTA), which is inspired by: (1) MLLMs tend to process semantic-level information; (2) Typographic Attack could effectively distract the visual information captured by MLLMs. In the scenarios of Harmful Word Insertion and Important Information Protection, our TSTA demonstrates superior performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijia An, Boyu Diao, Libo Huang, Ruiqi Liu, Zhulin An, Yongjun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Incremental Object Detection (IOD) methods partially alleviate catastrophic forgetting when incrementally detecting new objects in real-world scenarios. However, many of these methods rely on the assumption that unlabeled old-class objects may co-occur with labeled new-class objects in the incremental data. When unlabeled old-class objects are absent, the performance of existing methods tends to degrade. The absence can be mitigated by generating old-class samples, but it incurs high costs. This paper argues that previous generation-based IOD suffer from redundancy, both in the use of generative models, which require additional training and storage, and in the overproduction of generated samples, many of which do not contribute significantly to performance improvements. To eliminate the redundancy, we propose Inversed Object Replay (IOR). Specifically, we generate old-class samples by inversing the original detectors, thus eliminating the necessity of training and storing additional generative models. We propose augmented replay to reuse the objects in generated samples, reducing redundant generations. Moreover, we propose high-value knowledge distillation focusing on the positions of old-class objects overwhelmed by the background, which transfers the knowledge to the incremental detector. Extensive experiments conducted on MS COCO 2017 demonstrate that our method can efficiently improve detection performance in IOD scenarios with the absence of old-class objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhe Gao, Difei Gu, Mu Zhou, Dimitris Metaxas</p>
<p>Abstract: Although explainability is essential in the clinical diagnosis, most deep learning models still function as black boxes without elucidating their decision-making process. In this study, we investigate the explainable model development that can mimic the decision-making process of human experts by fusing the domain knowledge of explicit diagnostic criteria. We introduce a simple yet effective framework, Explicd, towards Explainable language-informed criteria-based diagnosis. Explicd initiates its process by querying domain knowledge from either large language models (LLMs) or human experts to establish diagnostic criteria across various concept axes (e.g., color, shape, texture, or specific patterns of diseases). By leveraging a pretrained vision-language model, Explicd injects these criteria into the embedding space as knowledge anchors, thereby facilitating the learning of corresponding visual concepts within medical images. The final diagnostic outcome is determined based on the similarity scores between the encoded visual concepts and the textual criteria embeddings. Through extensive evaluation of five medical image classification benchmarks, Explicd has demonstrated its inherent explainability and extends to improve classification performance compared to traditional black-box models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhao Lin, Lei Zhu, Jiaxing Shen, Huazhu Fu, Qing Zhang, Liansheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of depth sensor, more and more RGB-D videos could be obtained. Identifying the foreground in RGB-D videos is a fundamental and important task. However, the existing salient object detection (SOD) works only focus on either static RGB-D images or RGB videos, ignoring the collaborating of RGB-D and video information. In this paper, we first collect a new annotated RGB-D video SOD (ViDSOD-100) dataset, which contains 100 videos within a total of 9,362 frames, acquired from diverse natural scenes. All the frames in each video are manually annotated to a high-quality saliency annotation. Moreover, we propose a new baseline model, named attentive triple-fusion network (ATF-Net), for RGB-D video salient object detection. Our method aggregates the appearance information from an input RGB image, spatio-temporal information from an estimated motion map, and the geometry information from the depth map by devising three modality-specific branches and a multi-modality integration branch. The modality-specific branches extract the representation of different inputs, while the multi-modality integration branch combines the multi-level modality-specific features by introducing the encoder feature aggregation (MEA) modules and decoder feature aggregation (MDA) modules. The experimental findings conducted on both our newly introduced ViDSOD-100 dataset and the well-established DAVSOD dataset highlight the superior performance of the proposed ATF-Net. This performance enhancement is demonstrated both quantitatively and qualitatively, surpassing the capabilities of current state-of-the-art techniques across various domains, including RGB-D saliency detection, video saliency detection, and video object segmentation.

<p>Abstract: Mixup data augmentation approaches have been applied for various tasks of deep learning to improve the generalization ability of deep neural networks. Some existing approaches CutMix, SaliencyMix, etc. randomly replace a patch in one image with patches from another to generate the mixed image. Similarly, the corresponding labels are linearly combined by a fixed ratio $\lambda$ by l. The objects in two images may be overlapped during the mixing process, so some semantic information is corrupted in the mixed samples. In this case, the mixed image does not match the mixed label information. Besides, such a label may mislead the deep learning model training, which results in poor performance. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel approach named SUMix to learn the mixing ratio as well as the uncertainty for the mixed samples during the training process. First, we design a learnable similarity function to compute an accurate mix ratio. Second, an approach is investigated as a regularized term to model the uncertainty of the mixed samples. We conduct experiments on five image benchmarks, and extensive experimental results imply that our method is capable of improving the performance of classifiers with different cutting-based mixup approaches.

<p>Abstract: Parcellation of white matter tractography provides anatomical features for disease prediction, anatomical tract segmentation, surgical brain mapping, and non-imaging phenotype classifications. However, parcellation does not always reach 100\% accuracy due to various factors, including inter-individual anatomical variability and the quality of neuroimaging scan data. The failure to identify parcels causes a problem of missing microstructure data values, which is especially challenging for downstream tasks that analyze large brain datasets. In this work, we propose a novel deep-learning model to impute tissue microstructure: the White Matter Geometry-guided Diffusion (WMG-Diff) model. Specifically, we first propose a deep score-based guided diffusion model to impute tissue microstructure for diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography fiber clusters. Second, we propose a white matter atlas geometric relationship-guided denoising function to guide the reverse denoising process at the subject-specific level. Third, we train and evaluate our model on a large dataset with 9342 subjects. Comprehensive experiments for tissue microstructure imputation and a downstream non-imaging phenotype prediction task demonstrate that our proposed WMG-Diff outperforms the compared state-of-the-art methods in both error and accuracy metrics.

<p>Abstract: The focus of this paper is on 3D motion editing. Given a 3D human motion and a textual description of the desired modification, our goal is to generate an edited motion as described by the text. The key challenges include the scarcity of training data and the need to design a model that accurately edits the source motion. In this paper, we address both challenges. We propose a methodology to semi-automatically collect a dataset of triplets comprising (i) a source motion, (ii) a target motion, and (iii) an edit text, introducing the new MotionFix dataset. Access to this data allows us to train a conditional diffusion model, TMED, that takes both the source motion and the edit text as input. We develop several baselines to evaluate our model, comparing it against models trained solely on text-motion pair datasets, and demonstrate the superior performance of our model trained on triplets. We also introduce new retrieval-based metrics for motion editing, establishing a benchmark on the evaluation set of MotionFix. Our results are promising, paving the way for further research in fine-grained motion generation. Code, models, and data are available at https://motionfix.is.tue.mpg.de/ .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunxiang Fu, Chaoqi Chen, Yizhou Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent Transformer-based diffusion models have shown remarkable performance, largely attributed to the ability of the self-attention mechanism to accurately capture both global and local contexts by computing all-pair interactions among input tokens. However, their quadratic complexity poses significant computational challenges for long-sequence inputs. Conversely, a recent state space model called Mamba offers linear complexity by compressing a filtered global context into a hidden state. Despite its efficiency, compression inevitably leads to information loss of fine-grained local dependencies among tokens, which are crucial for effective visual generative modeling. Motivated by these observations, we introduce Local Attentional Mamba (LaMamba) blocks that combine the strengths of self-attention and Mamba, capturing both global contexts and local details with linear complexity. Leveraging the efficient U-Net architecture, our model exhibits exceptional scalability and surpasses the performance of DiT across various model scales on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution, all while utilizing substantially fewer GFLOPs and a comparable number of parameters. Compared to state-of-the-art diffusion models on ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512, our largest model presents notable advantages, such as a reduction of up to 62% GFLOPs compared to DiT-XL/2, while achieving superior performance with comparable or fewer parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyu Xiao, Runze Chen, Haiyong Luo, Fang Zhao, Juan Wang, Xuepeng Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Map-free relocalization technology is crucial for applications in autonomous navigation and augmented reality, but relying on pre-built maps is often impractical. It faces significant challenges due to limitations in matching methods and the inherent lack of scale in monocular images. These issues lead to substantial rotational and metric errors and even localization failures in real-world scenarios. Large matching errors significantly impact the overall relocalization process, affecting both rotational and translational accuracy. Due to the inherent limitations of the camera itself, recovering the metric scale from a single image is crucial, as this significantly impacts the translation error. To address these challenges, we propose a map-free relocalization method enhanced by instance knowledge and depth knowledge. By leveraging instance-based matching information to improve global matching results, our method significantly reduces the possibility of mismatching across different objects. The robustness of instance knowledge across the scene helps the feature point matching model focus on relevant regions and enhance matching accuracy. Additionally, we use estimated metric depth from a single image to reduce metric errors and improve scale recovery accuracy. By integrating methods dedicated to mitigating large translational and rotational errors, our approach demonstrates superior performance in map-free relocalization techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunwoo Kim, Itai Lang, Noam Aigerman, Thibault Groueix, Vladimir G. Kim, Rana Hanocka</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose MeshUp, a technique that deforms a 3D mesh towards multiple target concepts, and intuitively controls the region where each concept is expressed. Conveniently, the concepts can be defined as either text queries, e.g., "a dog" and "a turtle," or inspirational images, and the local regions can be selected as any number of vertices on the mesh. We can effectively control the influence of the concepts and mix them together using a novel score distillation approach, referred to as the Blended Score Distillation (BSD). BSD operates on each attention layer of the denoising U-Net of a diffusion model as it extracts and injects the per-objective activations into a unified denoising pipeline from which the deformation gradients are calculated. To localize the expression of these activations, we create a probabilistic Region of Interest (ROI) map on the surface of the mesh, and turn it into 3D-consistent masks that we use to control the expression of these activations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BSD empirically and show that it can deform various meshes towards multiple objectives. Our project page is at https://threedle.github.io/MeshUp.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenchen Tang, Zichuan Wang, Bo Peng, Jing Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technologies, AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) have been widely applied in various aspects of daily life. However, due to the immaturity of the technology, the quality of the generated images varies, so it is important to develop quality assessment techniques for the generated images. Although some models have been proposed to assess the quality of generated images, they are inadequate when faced with the ever-increasing and diverse categories of generated images. Consequently, the development of more advanced and effective models for evaluating the quality of generated images is urgently needed. Recent research has explored the significant potential of the visual language model CLIP in image quality assessment, finding that it performs well in evaluating the quality of natural images. However, its application to generated images has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we build on this idea and further explore the potential of CLIP in evaluating the quality of generated images. We design CLIP-AGIQA, a CLIP-based regression model for quality assessment of generated images, leveraging rich visual and textual knowledge encapsulated in CLIP. Particularly, we implement multi-category learnable prompts to fully utilize the textual knowledge in CLIP for quality assessment. Extensive experiments on several generated image quality assessment benchmarks, including AGIQA-3K and AIGCIQA2023, demonstrate that CLIP-AGIQA outperforms existing IQA models, achieving excellent results in evaluating the quality of generated images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seonghoon Yu, Ilchae Jung, Byeongju Han, Taeoh Kim, Yunho Kim, Dongyoon Wee, Jeany Son</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring image segmentation (RIS) requires dense vision-language interactions between visual pixels and textual words to segment objects based on a given description. However, commonly adapted dual-encoders in RIS, e.g., Swin transformer and BERT (uni-modal encoders) or CLIP (a multi-modal dual-encoder), lack dense multi-modal interactions during pre-training, leading to a gap with a pixel-level RIS task. To bridge this gap, existing RIS methods often rely on multi-modal fusion modules that interact two encoders, but this approach leads to high computational costs. In this paper, we present a novel RIS method with a single-encoder, i.e., BEiT-3, maximizing the potential of shared self-attention across all framework components. This enables seamless interactions of two modalities from input to final prediction, producing granularly aligned multi-modal features. Furthermore, we propose lightweight yet effective decoder modules, a Shared FPN and a Shared Mask Decoder, which contribute to the high efficiency of our model. Our simple baseline with a single encoder achieves outstanding performances on the RIS benchmark datasets while maintaining computational efficiency, compared to the most recent SoTA methods based on dual-encoders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongqiu Wang, Yixian Chen, Wu Chen, Huihui Xu, Haoyu Zhao, Bin Sheng, Huazhu Fu, Guang Yang, Lei Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultra-Wide-Field Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (UWF-SLO) images capture high-resolution views of the retina with typically 200 spanning degrees. Accurate segmentation of vessels in UWF-SLO images is essential for detecting and diagnosing fundus disease. Recent studies have revealed that the selective State Space Model (SSM) in Mamba performs well in modeling long-range dependencies, which is crucial for capturing the continuity of elongated vessel structures. Inspired by this, we propose the first Serpentine Mamba (Serp-Mamba) network to address this challenging task. Specifically, we recognize the intricate, varied, and delicate nature of the tubular structure of vessels. Furthermore, the high-resolution of UWF-SLO images exacerbates the imbalance between the vessel and background categories. Based on the above observations, we first devise a Serpentine Interwoven Adaptive (SIA) scan mechanism, which scans UWF-SLO images along curved vessel structures in a snake-like crawling manner. This approach, consistent with vascular texture transformations, ensures the effective and continuous capture of curved vascular structure features. Second, we propose an Ambiguity-Driven Dual Recalibration (ADDR) module to address the category imbalance problem intensified by high-resolution images. Our ADDR module delineates pixels by two learnable thresholds and refines ambiguous pixels through a dual-driven strategy, thereby accurately distinguishing vessels and background regions. Experiment results on three datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our Serp-Mamba on high-resolution vessel segmentation. We also conduct a series of ablation studies to verify the impact of our designs. Our code shall be released upon publication of this work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Cai, Duotun Wang, Yixun Liang, Zhijing Shao, Ying-Cong Chen, Xiaohang Zhan, Zeyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has emerged as a prevalent technique for text-to-3D generation, enabling 3D content creation by distilling view-dependent information from text-to-2D guidance. However, they frequently exhibit shortcomings such as over-saturated color and excess smoothness. In this paper, we conduct a thorough analysis of SDS and refine its formulation, finding that the core design is to model the distribution of rendered images. Following this insight, we introduce a novel strategy called Variational Distribution Mapping (VDM), which expedites the distribution modeling process by regarding the rendered images as instances of degradation from diffusion-based generation. This special design enables the efficient training of variational distribution by skipping the calculations of the Jacobians in the diffusion U-Net. We also introduce timestep-dependent Distribution Coefficient Annealing (DCA) to further improve distilling precision. Leveraging VDM and DCA, we use Gaussian Splatting as the 3D representation and build a text-to-3D generation framework. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate the capability of VDM and DCA to generate high-fidelity and realistic assets with optimization efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Hsi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of drone technology has made accurate Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) detection essential for surveillance, security, and airspace management. This paper presents a novel trajectory-guided approach, the Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC) technique, which generates high-fidelity bounding boxes for UAV detection without manual labeling. This technique forms the foundation of UAVDB, a dedicated database designed specifically for UAV detection. Unlike datasets that often focus on large UAVs or simple backgrounds, UAVDB utilizes high-resolution RGB video to capture UAVs at various scales, from hundreds of pixels to near-single-digit sizes. This extensive scale variation enables robust evaluation of detection algorithms under diverse conditions. Using the PIC technique, bounding boxes can be efficiently generated from trajectory or position data. We benchmark UAVDB using state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLO series detectors, providing a comprehensive performance analysis. Our results demonstrate UAVDB's potential as a critical resource for advancing UAV detection, particularly in high-resolution and long-distance tracking scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinwei Wu, Xianpan Zhou, Bing Ma, Xuefeng Su, Kai Ma, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: While Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models excel at generating visually appealing images of individual instances, they struggle to accurately position and control the features generation of multiple instances. The Layout-to-Image (L2I) task was introduced to address the positioning challenges by incorporating bounding boxes as spatial control signals, but it still falls short in generating precise instance features. In response, we propose the Instance Feature Generation (IFG) task, which aims to ensure both positional accuracy and feature fidelity in generated instances. To address the IFG task, we introduce the Instance Feature Adapter (IFAdapter). The IFAdapter enhances feature depiction by incorporating additional appearance tokens and utilizing an Instance Semantic Map to align instance-level features with spatial locations. The IFAdapter guides the diffusion process as a plug-and-play module, making it adaptable to various community models. For evaluation, we contribute an IFG benchmark and develop a verification pipeline to objectively compare models' abilities to generate instances with accurate positioning and features. Experimental results demonstrate that IFAdapter outperforms other models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> He Wang, Yang Xu, Zebin Wu, Zhihui Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion aims to generate high spectral and spatial resolution hyperspectral images (HR-HSI) by fusing high-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) and low-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI). However, existing fusion methods encounter challenges such as unknown degradation parameters, incomplete exploitation of the correlation between high-dimensional structures and deep image features. To overcome these issues, in this article, an unsupervised blind fusion method for hyperspectral and multispectral images based on Tucker decomposition and spatial spectral manifold learning (DTDNML) is proposed. We design a novel deep Tucker decomposition network that maps LR-HSI and HR-MSI into a consistent feature space, achieving reconstruction through decoders with shared parameter. To better exploit and fuse spatial-spectral features in the data, we design a core tensor fusion network that incorporates a spatial spectral attention mechanism for aligning and fusing features at different scales. Furthermore, to enhance the capacity in capturing global information, a Laplacian-based spatial-spectral manifold constraints is introduced in shared-decoders. Sufficient experiments have validated that this method enhances the accuracy and efficiency of hyperspectral and multispectral fusion on different remote sensing datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Chen, Jiawei Tu, Chao Qi, Yonghao Dang, Feng Zhou, Wei Wei, Jianqin Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of embodied navigation agents in safety-critical environments raises concerns about their vulnerability to adversarial attacks on deep neural networks. However, current attack methods often lack practicality due to challenges in transitioning from the digital to the physical world, while existing physical attacks for object detection fail to achieve both multi-view effectiveness and naturalness. To address this, we propose a practical attack method for embodied navigation by attaching adversarial patches with learnable textures and opacity to objects. Specifically, to ensure effectiveness across varying viewpoints, we employ a multi-view optimization strategy based on object-aware sampling, which uses feedback from the navigation model to optimize the patch's texture. To make the patch inconspicuous to human observers, we introduce a two-stage opacity optimization mechanism, where opacity is refined after texture optimization. Experimental results show our adversarial patches reduce navigation success rates by about 40%, outperforming previous methods in practicality, effectiveness, and naturalness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moein Heidari, Reza Rezaeian, Reza Azad, Dorit Merhof, Hamid Soltanian-Zadeh, Ilker Hacihaliloglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit Neural Representation (INR), leveraging a neural network to transform coordinate input into corresponding attributes, has recently driven significant advances in several vision-related domains. However, the performance of INR is heavily influenced by the choice of the nonlinear activation function used in its multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture. Multiple nonlinearities have been investigated; yet, current INRs face limitations in capturing high-frequency components, diverse signal types, and handling inverse problems. We have identified that these problems can be greatly alleviated by introducing a paradigm shift in INRs. We find that an architecture with learnable activations in initial layers can represent fine details in the underlying signals. Specifically, we propose SL$^{2}$A-INR, a hybrid network for INR with a single-layer learnable activation function, prompting the effectiveness of traditional ReLU-based MLPs. Our method performs superior across diverse tasks, including image representation, 3D shape reconstructions, inpainting, single image super-resolution, CT reconstruction, and novel view synthesis. Through comprehensive experiments, SL$^{2}$A-INR sets new benchmarks in accuracy, quality, and convergence rates for INR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanran Guan, Oliver van Kaick</p>
<p>Abstract: Methods that use neural networks for synthesizing 3D shapes in the form of a part-based representation have been introduced over the last few years. These methods represent shapes as a graph or hierarchy of parts and enable a variety of applications such as shape sampling and reconstruction. However, current methods do not allow easily regenerating individual shape parts according to user preferences. In this paper, we investigate techniques that allow the user to generate multiple, diverse suggestions for individual parts. Specifically, we experiment with multimodal deep generative models that allow sampling diverse suggestions for shape parts and focus on models which have not been considered in previous work on shape synthesis. To provide a comparative study of these techniques, we introduce a method for synthesizing 3D shapes in a part-based representation and evaluate all the part suggestion techniques within this synthesis method. In our method, which is inspired by previous work, shapes are represented as a set of parts in the form of implicit functions which are then positioned in space to form the final shape. Synthesis in this representation is enabled by a neural network architecture based on an implicit decoder and a spatial transformer. We compare the various multimodal generative models by evaluating their performance in generating part suggestions. Our contribution is to show with qualitative and quantitative evaluations which of the new techniques for multimodal part generation perform the best and that a synthesis method based on the top-performing techniques allows the user to more finely control the parts that are generated in the 3D shapes while maintaining high shape fidelity when reconstructing shapes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robot learning of manipulation skills is hindered by the scarcity of diverse, unbiased datasets. While curated datasets can help, challenges remain in generalizability and real-world transfer. Meanwhile, large-scale "in-the-wild" video datasets have driven progress in computer vision through self-supervised techniques. Translating this to robotics, recent works have explored learning manipulation skills by passively watching abundant videos sourced online. Showing promising results, such video-based learning paradigms provide scalable supervision while reducing dataset bias. This survey reviews foundations such as video feature representation learning techniques, object affordance understanding, 3D hand/body modeling, and large-scale robot resources, as well as emerging techniques for acquiring robot manipulation skills from uncontrolled video demonstrations. We discuss how learning only from observing large-scale human videos can enhance generalization and sample efficiency for robotic manipulation. The survey summarizes video-based learning approaches, analyses their benefits over standard datasets, survey metrics, and benchmarks, and discusses open challenges and future directions in this nascent domain at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing, and robot learning.</p>

In this research, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation, showcasing Cobweb4Vs proficiency in learning visual concepts, requiring less data to achieve effective learning outcomes compared to traditional methods, maintaining stable performance over time, and achieving commendable asymptotic behavior, without catastrophic forgetting effects. These characteristics align with learning strategies in human cognition, positioning Cobweb4V as a promising alternative to neural network approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin You, Yixin Lou, Minghui Zhang, Jie Yang, Nassir Navab, Yun Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic and precise multi-class vertebrae segmentation from CT images is crucial for various clinical applications. However, due to a lack of explicit consistency constraints, existing methods especially for single-stage methods, still suffer from the challenge of intra-vertebrae segmentation inconsistency, which refers to multiple label predictions inside a singular vertebra. For multi-stage methods, vertebrae detection serving as the first step, tends to be affected by the pathology and metal implants. Thus, imprecise detections cause biased patches before segmentation, which then leads to inaccurate contour delineation and inconsistent segmentation. In our work, we intend to label individual and complete binary masks to address that challenge. Specifically, a contour generation network is proposed based on Structural Low-Rank Descriptors for shape consistency, termed SLoRD. For a structural representation of vertebral contours, we adopt the spherical coordinate system and devise the spherical centroid to calculate contour descriptors. Due to vertebrae's similar appearances, basic contour descriptors can be acquired to restore original contours. Therefore, SLoRD leverages these contour priors and explicit shape constraints to facilitate regressed contour points close to vertebral surfaces. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on VerSe 2019 and 2020 demonstrate the superior performance of our framework over other single-stage and multi-stage state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Further, SLoRD is a plug-and-play framework to refine the segmentation inconsistency existing in coarse predictions from other approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures, have become the focus of extensive research in medical image segmentation, achieving impressive results. However, CNNs come with inductive biases that limit their effectiveness in more complex, varied segmentation scenarios. Conversely, while Transformer-based methods excel at capturing global and long-range semantic details, they suffer from high computational demands. In this study, we propose CSWin-UNet, a novel U-shaped segmentation method that incorporates the CSWin self-attention mechanism into the UNet to facilitate horizontal and vertical stripes self-attention. This method significantly enhances both computational efficiency and receptive field interactions. Additionally, our innovative decoder utilizes a content-aware reassembly operator that strategically reassembles features, guided by predicted kernels, for precise image resolution restoration. Our extensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets, including synapse multi-organ CT, cardiac MRI, and skin lesions, demonstrate that CSWin-UNet maintains low model complexity while delivering high segmentation accuracy.

<p>Abstract: Denoising, the process of reducing random fluctuations in a signal to emphasize essential patterns, has been a fundamental problem of interest since the dawn of modern scientific inquiry. Recent denoising techniques, particularly in imaging, have achieved remarkable success, nearing theoretical limits by some measures. Yet, despite tens of thousands of research papers, the wide-ranging applications of denoising beyond noise removal have not been fully recognized. This is partly due to the vast and diverse literature, making a clear overview challenging.
  This paper aims to address this gap. We present a clarifying perspective on denoisers, their structure, and desired properties. We emphasize the increasing importance of denoising and showcase its evolution into an essential building block for complex tasks in imaging, inverse problems, and machine learning. Despite its long history, the community continues to uncover unexpected and groundbreaking uses for denoising, further solidifying its place as a cornerstone of scientific and engineering practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is crucial for accurately diagnosing and analyzing various diseases. However, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, the most commonly used architectures for this task, struggle to effectively capture long-range dependencies due to the inherent locality of CNNs and the computational complexity of Transformers. To address this limitation, we introduce TTT-Unet, a novel framework that integrates Test-Time Training (TTT) layers into the traditional U-Net architecture for biomedical image segmentation. TTT-Unet dynamically adjusts model parameters during the testing time, enhancing the model's ability to capture both local and long-range features. We evaluate TTT-Unet on multiple medical imaging datasets, including 3D abdominal organ segmentation in CT and MR images, instrument segmentation in endoscopy images, and cell segmentation in microscopy images. The results demonstrate that TTT-Unet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-based and Transformer-based segmentation models across all tasks.

However, traditional optimization-based reconstruction is slow and can not yield an exact image in practice. Deep learning-based reconstruction has been a promising alternative to optimization-based reconstruction, outperforming it in accuracy and computation speed. Finding an efficient sampling method with deep learning-based reconstruction, especially for Fourier CS remains a challenge. Existing joint optimization of sampling-reconstruction works ($\mathcal{H}_1$) optimize the sampling mask but have low potential as it is not adaptive to each data point. Adaptive sampling ($\mathcal{H}_2$) has also disadvantages of difficult optimization and Pareto sub-optimality. Here, we propose a novel adaptive selection of sampling-reconstruction ($\mathcal{H}_{1.5}$) framework that selects the best sampling mask and reconstruction network for each input data. We provide theorems that our method has a higher potential than $\mathcal{H}_1$ and effectively solves the Pareto sub-optimality problem in sampling-reconstruction by using separate reconstruction networks for different sampling masks. To select the best sampling mask, we propose to quantify the high-frequency Bayesian uncertainty of the input, using a super-resolution space generation model. Our method outperforms joint optimization of sampling-reconstruction ($\mathcal{H}_1$) and adaptive sampling ($\mathcal{H}_2$) by achieving significant improvements on several Fourier CS problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in tumor segmentation within the field of digital pathology. However, variations in organs, tissue preparation methods, and image acquisition processes can lead to domain discrepancies among digital pathology images. To address this problem, in this paper, we use Rein, a fine-tuning method, to parametrically and efficiently fine-tune various vision foundation models (VFMs) for MICCAI 2024 Cross-Organ and Cross-Scanner Adenocarcinoma Segmentation (COSAS2024). The core of Rein consists of a set of learnable tokens, which are directly linked to instances, improving functionality at the instance level in each layer. In the data environment of the COSAS2024 Challenge, extensive experiments demonstrate that Rein fine-tuned the VFMs to achieve satisfactory results. Specifically, we used Rein to fine-tune ConvNeXt and DINOv2. Our team used the former to achieve scores of 0.7719 and 0.7557 on the preliminary test phase and final test phase in task1, respectively, while the latter achieved scores of 0.8848 and 0.8192 on the preliminary test phase and final test phase in task2. Code is available at GitHub.</p>
