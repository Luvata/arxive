<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah Mushtaq, Muhammad Rafay Naeem, Muhammad Imran Taj, Ibrahim Ghaznavi, Junaid Qadir</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Llama 3 become integral to educational contexts, concerns are mounting over the cultural biases, power imbalances, and ethical limitations embedded within these technologies. Though generative AI tools aim to enhance learning experiences, they often reflect values rooted in Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) cultural paradigms, potentially sidelining diverse global perspectives. This paper proposes a framework to assess and mitigate cultural bias within LLMs through the lens of applied multiplexity. Multiplexity, inspired by Senturk et al. and rooted in Islamic and other wisdom traditions, emphasizes the coexistence of diverse cultural viewpoints, supporting a multi-layered epistemology that integrates both empirical sciences and normative values. Our analysis reveals that LLMs frequently exhibit cultural polarization, with biases appearing in both overt responses and subtle contextual cues. To address inherent biases and incorporate multiplexity in LLMs, we propose two strategies: \textit{Contextually-Implemented Multiplex LLMs}, which embed multiplex principles directly into the system prompt, influencing LLM outputs at a foundational level and independent of individual prompts, and \textit{Multi-Agent System (MAS)-Implemented Multiplex LLMs}, where multiple LLM agents, each representing distinct cultural viewpoints, collaboratively generate a balanced, synthesized response. Our findings demonstrate that as mitigation strategies evolve from contextual prompting to MAS-implementation, cultural inclusivity markedly improves, evidenced by a significant rise in the Perspectives Distribution Score (PDS) and a PDS Entropy increase from 3.25\% at baseline to 98\% with the MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs. Sentiment analysis further shows a shift towards positive sentiment across cultures,...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a critical approach for aligning large language models with human preferences, witnessing rapid algorithmic evolution through methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), REINFORCE Leave One-Out (RLOO), ReMax, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We present REINFORCE++, an enhanced variant of the classical REINFORCE algorithm that incorporates key optimization techniques from PPO while eliminating the need for a critic network. REINFORCE++ achieves three primary objectives: (1) simplicity (2) enhanced training stability, and (3) reduced computational overhead. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that REINFORCE++ exhibits superior stability compared to GRPO and achieves greater computational efficiency than PPO while maintaining comparable performance. The implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Pasch</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM safety and ethical alignment are widely discussed, but the impact of content moderation on user satisfaction remains underexplored. To address this, we analyze nearly 50,000 Chatbot Arena response-pairs using a novel fine-tuned RoBERTa model, that we trained on hand-labeled data to disentangle refusals due to ethical concerns from other refusals due to technical disabilities or lack of information. Our findings reveal a significant refusal penalty on content moderation, with users choosing ethical-based refusals roughly one-fourth as often as their preferred LLM response compared to standard responses. However, the context and phrasing play critical roles: refusals on highly sensitive prompts, such as illegal content, achieve higher win rates than less sensitive ethical concerns, and longer responses closely aligned with the prompt perform better. These results emphasize the need for nuanced moderation strategies that balance ethical safeguards with user satisfaction. Moreover, we find that the refusal penalty is notably lower in evaluations using the LLM-as-a-Judge method, highlighting discrepancies between user and automated assessments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoel Zeldes, Amir Zait, Ilia Labzovsky, Danny Karmon, Efrat Farkash</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at a wide range of tasks, but adapting them to new data, particularly for personalized applications, poses significant challenges due to resource and computational constraints. Existing methods either rely on exposing fresh data to the model through the prompt, which is limited by context size and computationally expensive at inference time, or fine-tuning, which incurs substantial training and update costs. In this paper, we introduce ComMer - Compress and Merge - a novel framework that efficiently personalizes LLMs by compressing users' documents into compact representations, which are then merged and fed into a frozen LLM. We evaluate ComMer on two types of personalization tasks - personalized skill learning, using the tweet paraphrasing dataset and the personalized news headline generation dataset from the LaMP benchmark, and knowledge-intensive, using the PerLTQA dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that in constrained inference budget scenarios ComMer achieves superior quality in skill learning tasks, while highlighting limitations in knowledge-intensive settings due to the loss of detailed information. These results offer insights into trade-offs and potential optimizations in multi-document compression for personalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueze Liu, Yichi Zhang, Shaan Om Patel, Zhaoyang Zhu, Shilong Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern conversational agents, including anime-themed chatbots, are frequently reactive and personality-driven but fail to capture the dynamic nature of human interactions. We propose an event-driven dialogue framework to address these limitations by embedding dynamic events in conversation prompts and fine-tuning models on character-specific data. Evaluations on GPT-4 and comparisons with industry-leading baselines demonstrate that event-driven prompts significantly improve conversational engagement and naturalness while reducing hallucinations. This paper explores the application of this approach in creating lifelike chatbot interactions within the context of Honkai: Star Rail, showcasing the potential for dynamic event-based systems to transform role-playing and interactive dialogue.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03291">ADePT: Adaptive Decomposed Prompt Tuning for Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengwei Tang, Xiaolin Hu, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt Tuning (PT) enables the adaptation of Pre-trained Large Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks by optimizing a small amount of soft virtual tokens, which are prepended to the input token embeddings. Recently, Decomposed Prompt Tuning (DePT) has demonstrated superior adaptation capabilities by decomposing the soft prompt into a shorter soft prompt and a pair of low-rank matrices. The product of the pair of low-rank matrices is added to the input token embeddings to offset them. Additionally, DePT achieves faster inference compared to PT due to the shorter soft prompt. However, in this paper, we find that the position-based token embedding offsets of DePT restricts its ability to generalize across diverse model inputs, and that the shared embedding offsets across many token embeddings result in sub-optimization. To tackle these issues, we introduce \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{De}composed \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning (ADePT), which is composed of a short soft prompt and a shallow token-shared feed-forward neural network. ADePT utilizes the token-shared feed-forward neural network to learn the embedding offsets for each token, enabling adaptive embedding offsets that vary according to the model input and better optimization of token embedding offsets. This enables ADePT to achieve superior adaptation performance without requiring more inference time or additional trainable parameters compared to vanilla PT and its variants. In comprehensive experiments across 23 natural language processing (NLP) tasks and 4 typical PLMs of different scales, we show that ADePT consistently surpasses the leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, and even outperforms the full fine-tuning baseline in certain scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sabine Wehnert, Muhammet Ertas, Ernesto William De Luca</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is vital for computers to process and respond accurately to human language. However, biases in training data can introduce unfairness, especially in predicting legal judgment. This study focuses on analyzing biases within the Swiss Judgment Prediction Dataset (SJP-Dataset). Our aim is to ensure unbiased factual descriptions essential for fair decision making by NLP models in legal contexts. We analyze the dataset using social bias descriptors from the Holistic Bias dataset and employ advanced NLP techniques, including attention visualization, to explore the impact of dispreferred descriptors on model predictions. The study identifies biases and examines their influence on model behavior. Challenges include dataset imbalance and token limits affecting model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olga Kolesnikova, Moein Shahiki Tash, Zahra Ahani, Ameeta Agrawal, Raul Monroy, Grigori Sidorov</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of social media highlights the need to understand its impact, particularly the role of online social support. This study uses a dataset focused on online social support, which includes binary and multiclass classifications of social support content on social media. The classification of social support is divided into three tasks. The first task focuses on distinguishing between supportive and non-supportive. The second task aims to identify whether the support is directed toward an individual or a group. The third task categorizes the specific type of social support, grouping it into categories such as Nation, LGBTQ, Black people, Women, Religion, and Other (if it does not fit into the previously mentioned categories). To address data imbalances in these tasks, we employed K-means clustering for balancing the dataset and compared the results with the original unbalanced data. Using advanced machine learning techniques, including transformers and zero-shot learning approaches with GPT3, GPT4, and GPT4-o, we predict social support levels in various contexts. The effectiveness of the dataset is evaluated using baseline models across different learning approaches, with transformer-based methods demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, we achieved a 0.4\% increase in the macro F1 score for the second task and a 0.7\% increase for the third task, compared to previous work utilizing traditional machine learning with psycholinguistic and unigram-based TF-IDF values.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI humanizers are a new class of online software tools meant to paraphrase and rewrite AI-generated text in a way that allows them to evade AI detection software. We study 19 AI humanizer and paraphrasing tools and qualitatively assess their effects and faithfulness in preserving the meaning of the original text. We show that many existing AI detectors fail to detect humanized text. Finally, we demonstrate a robust model that can detect humanized AI text while maintaining a low false positive rate using a data-centric augmentation approach. We attack our own detector, training our own fine-tuned model optimized against our detector's predictions, and show that our detector's cross-humanizer generalization is sufficient to remain robust to this attack.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarah E. Finch, Ellie S. Paek, Sejung Kwon, Ikseon Choi, Jessica Wells, Rasheeta Chandler, Jinho D. Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: As chatbots become increasingly integrated into everyday tasks, designing systems that accommodate diverse user populations is crucial for fostering trust, engagement, and inclusivity. This study investigates the ability of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and evaluates the impact of AAVE usage on user experiences in chatbot applications. We analyze the performance of three LLM families (Llama, GPT, and Claude) in producing AAVE-like utterances at varying dialect intensities and assess user preferences across multiple domains, including healthcare and education. Despite LLMs' proficiency in generating AAVE-like language, findings indicate that AAVE-speaking users prefer Standard American English (SAE) chatbots, with higher levels of AAVE correlating with lower ratings for a variety of characteristics, including chatbot trustworthiness and role appropriateness. These results highlight the complexities of creating inclusive AI systems and underscore the need for further exploration of diversity to enhance human-computer interactions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03456">Text to Band Gap: Pre-trained Language Models as Encoders for Semiconductor Band Gap Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying-Ting Yeh, Janghoon Ock, Amir Barati Farimani</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we explore the use of a transformer-based language model as an encoder to predict the band gaps of semiconductor materials directly from their text descriptions. Quantum chemistry simulations, including Density Functional Theory (DFT), are computationally intensive and time-consuming, which limits their practicality for high-throughput material screening, particularly for complex systems. Shallow machine learning (ML) models, while effective, often require extensive data preprocessing to convert non-numerical material properties into numerical inputs. In contrast, our approach leverages textual data directly, bypassing the need for complex feature engineering. We generate material descriptions in two formats: formatted strings combining features and natural language text generated using the ChatGPT API. We demonstrate that the RoBERTa model, pre-trained on natural language processing tasks, performs effectively as an encoder for prediction tasks. With minimal fine-tuning, it achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 0.33 eV, performing better than shallow machine learning models such as Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Even when only the linear regression head is trained while keeping the RoBERTa encoder layers frozen, the accuracy remains nearly identical to that of the fully trained model. This demonstrates that the pre-trained RoBERTa encoder is highly adaptable for processing domain-specific text related to material properties, such as the band gap, significantly reducing the need for extensive retraining. This study highlights the potential of transformer-based language models to serve as efficient and versatile encoders for semiconductor materials property prediction tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Cheng Liu, An-Zi Yen</p>
<p>Abstract: Vocabulary acquisition is essential to second language learning, as it underpins all core language skills. Accurate vocabulary assessment is particularly important in standardized exams, where test items evaluate learners' comprehension and contextual use of words. Previous research has explored methods for generating distractors to aid in the design of English vocabulary tests. However, current approaches often rely on lexical databases or predefined rules, and frequently produce distractors that risk invalidating the question by introducing multiple correct options. In this study, we focus on English vocabulary questions from Taiwan's university entrance exams. We analyze student response distributions to gain insights into the characteristics of these test items and provide a reference for future research. Additionally, we identify key limitations in how large language models (LLMs) support teachers in generating distractors for vocabulary test design. To address these challenges, we propose the iterative selection with self-review (ISSR) framework, which makes use of a novel LLM-based self-review mechanism to ensure that the distractors remain valid while offering diverse options. Experimental results show that ISSR achieves promising performance in generating plausible distractors, and the self-review mechanism effectively filters out distractors that could invalidate the question.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has recently become a very popular task for Large Language Models (LLMs). Evaluating them on multi-turn RAG conversations, where the system is asked to generate a response to a question in the context of a preceding conversation is an important and often overlooked task with several additional challenges. We present MTRAG: an end-to-end human-generated multi-turn RAG benchmark that reflects several real-world properties across diverse dimensions for evaluating the full RAG pipeline. MTRAG contains 110 conversations averaging 7.7 turns each across four domains for a total of 842 tasks. We also explore automation paths via synthetic data and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation. Our human and automatic evaluations show that even state-of-the-art LLM RAG systems struggle on MTRAG. We demonstrate the need for strong retrieval and generation systems that can handle later turns, unanswerable questions, non-standalone questions, and multiple domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Reichman, Adar Avsian, Larry Heck</p>
<p>Abstract: Queries to large language models (LLMs) can be divided into two parts: the instruction/question and the accompanying context. The context for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in most benchmarks comes from Wikipedia or Wikipedia-like texts which are written in a neutral and factual tone. However, when RAG systems retrieve internet-based content, they encounter text with diverse tones and linguistic styles, introducing challenges for downstream tasks. The Reading with Intent task addresses this issue by evaluating how varying tones in context passages affect model performance. Building on prior work that focused on sarcasm, we extend this paradigm by constructing a dataset where context passages are transformed to $11$ distinct emotions using a better synthetic data generation approach. Using this dataset, we train an emotion translation model to systematically adapt passages to specified emotional tones. The human evaluation shows that the LLM fine-tuned to become the emotion-translator benefited from the synthetically generated data. Finally, the emotion-translator is used in the Reading with Intent task to transform the passages to a neutral tone. By neutralizing the passages, it mitigates the challenges posed by sarcastic passages and improves overall results on this task by about $3\%$.</p>

<p>Abstract: Honorifics serve as powerful linguistic markers that reflect social hierarchies and cultural values. This paper presents a large-scale, cross-linguistic exploration of usage of honorific pronouns in Bengali and Hindi Wikipedia articles, shedding light on how socio-cultural factors shape language. Using LLM (GPT-4o), we annotated 10, 000 articles of real and fictional beings in each language for several sociodemographic features such as gender, age, fame, and exoticness, and the use of honorifics. We find that across all feature combinations, use of honorifics is consistently more common in Bengali than Hindi. For both languages, the use non-honorific pronouns is more commonly observed for infamous, juvenile, and exotic beings. Notably, we observe a gender bias in use of honorifics in Hindi, with men being more commonly referred to with honorifics than women.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyang Wang, Somayeh Moazeni, Diego Klabjan</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing effective prompts is essential to guiding large language models (LLMs) toward desired responses. Automated prompt engineering aims to reduce reliance on manual effort by streamlining the design, refinement, and optimization of natural language prompts. This paper proposes an optimal learning framework for automated prompt engineering, designed to sequentially identify effective prompt features while efficiently allocating a limited evaluation budget. We introduce a feature-based method to express prompts, which significantly broadens the search space. Bayesian regression is employed to utilize correlations among similar prompts, accelerating the learning process. To efficiently explore the large space of prompt features for a high quality prompt, we adopt the forward-looking Knowledge-Gradient (KG) policy for sequential optimal learning. The KG policy is computed efficiently by solving mixed-integer second-order cone optimization problems, making it scalable and capable of accommodating prompts characterized only through constraints. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms a set of benchmark strategies assessed on instruction induction tasks. The results highlight the advantages of using the KG policy for prompt learning given a limited evaluation budget. Our framework provides a solution to deploying automated prompt engineering in a wider range applications where prompt evaluation is costly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Samarinas, Alexander Krubner, Alireza Salemi, Youngwoo Kim, Hamed Zamani</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents ICAT, an evaluation framework for measuring coverage of diverse factual information in long-form text generation. ICAT breaks down a long output text into a list of atomic claims and not only verifies each claim through retrieval from a (reliable) knowledge source, but also computes the alignment between the atomic factual claims and various aspects expected to be presented in the output. We study three implementations of the ICAT framework, each with a different assumption on the availability of aspects and alignment method. By adopting data from the diversification task in the TREC Web Track and the ClueWeb corpus, we evaluate the ICAT framework. We demonstrate strong correlation with human judgments and provide comprehensive evaluation across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our framework further offers interpretable and fine-grained analysis of diversity and coverage. Its modular design allows for easy adaptation to different domains and datasets, making it a valuable tool for evaluating the qualitative aspects of long-form responses produced by LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zelin Zhou, Simone Conia, Daniel Lee, Min Li, Shenglei Huang, Umar Farooq Minhas, Saloni Potdar, Henry Xiao, Yunyao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multilingual knowledge graphs (KGs) provide high-quality relational and textual information for various NLP applications, but they are often incomplete, especially in non-English languages. Previous research has shown that combining information from KGs in different languages aids either Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), the task of predicting missing relations between entities, or Knowledge Graph Enhancement (KGE), the task of predicting missing textual information for entities. Although previous efforts have considered KGC and KGE as independent tasks, we hypothesize that they are interdependent and mutually beneficial. To this end, we introduce KG-TRICK, a novel sequence-to-sequence framework that unifies the tasks of textual and relational information completion for multilingual KGs. KG-TRICK demonstrates that: i) it is possible to unify the tasks of KGC and KGE into a single framework, and ii) combining textual information from multiple languages is beneficial to improve the completeness of a KG. As part of our contributions, we also introduce WikiKGE10++, the largest manually-curated benchmark for textual information completion of KGs, which features over 25,000 entities across 10 diverse languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Zhang, Guangyou Zhou, Zhiwen Xie, Jinjin Ma, Jimmy Xiangji Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Math Word Problem (MWP) solving is a critical task in natural language processing, has garnered significant research interest in recent years. Various recent studies heavily rely on Seq2Seq models and their extensions (e.g., Seq2Tree and Graph2Tree) to generate mathematical equations. While effective, these models struggle to generate diverse but counterpart solution equations, limiting their generalization across various math problem scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel Diversity-enhanced Knowledge Distillation (DivKD) model for practical MWP solving. Our approach proposes an adaptive diversity distillation method, in which a student model learns diverse equations by selectively transferring high-quality knowledge from a teacher model. Additionally, we design a diversity prior-enhanced student model to better capture the diversity distribution of equations by incorporating a conditional variational auto-encoder. Extensive experiments on {four} MWP benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves higher answer accuracy than strong baselines while maintaining high efficiency for practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchun Fan, Yongyu Mu, Yilin Wang, Lei Huang, Junhao Ruan, Bei Li, Tong Xiao, Shujian Huang, Xiaocheng Feng, Jingbo Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the significant improvements achieved by large language models (LLMs) in English reasoning tasks, these models continue to struggle with multilingual reasoning. Recent studies leverage a full-parameter and two-stage training paradigm to teach models to first understand non-English questions and then reason. However, this method suffers from both substantial computational resource computing and catastrophic forgetting. The fundamental cause is that, with the primary goal of enhancing multilingual comprehension, an excessive number of irrelevant layers and parameters are tuned during the first stage. Given our findings that the representation learning of languages is merely conducted in lower-level layers, we propose an efficient multilingual reasoning alignment approach that precisely identifies and fine-tunes the layers responsible for handling multilingualism. Experimental results show that our method, SLAM, only tunes 6 layers' feed-forward sub-layers including 6.5-8% of all parameters within 7B and 13B LLMs, achieving superior average performance than all strong baselines across 10 languages. Meanwhile, SLAM only involves one training stage, reducing training time by 4.1-11.9 compared to the two-stage method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avishai Elmakies, Omri Abend, Yossi Adi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised approach for Speech Segmentation, which builds on previously researched approaches, e.g., Speaker Diarization, while being applicable to an inclusive set of acoustic-semantic distinctions, paving a path towards a general Unsupervised Speech Segmentation approach. Unlike traditional speech and audio segmentation, which mainly focuses on spectral changes in the input signal, e.g., phone segmentation, our approach tries to segment the spoken utterance into chunks with differing acoustic-semantic styles, focusing on acoustic-semantic information that does not translate well into text, e.g., emotion or speaker. While most Speech Segmentation tasks only handle one style change, e.g., emotion diarization, our approach tries to handle multiple acoustic-semantic style changes. Leveraging recent advances in Speech Language Models (SLMs), we propose a simple unsupervised method to segment a given speech utterance. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by considering several setups. Results suggest that the proposed method is superior to the evaluated baselines on boundary detection, segment purity, and over-segmentation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yindu Su, Huike Zou, Lin Sun, Ting Zhang, Haiyang Yang, Liyu Chen, David Lo, Qingheng Zhang, Shuguang Han, Jufeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Product Attribute Value Identification (PAVI) involves identifying attribute values from product profiles, a key task for improving product search, recommendations, and business analytics on e-commerce platforms. However, existing PAVI methods face critical challenges, such as inferring implicit values, handling out-of-distribution (OOD) values, and producing normalized outputs. To address these limitations, we introduce Taxonomy-Aware Contrastive Learning Retrieval (TACLR), the first retrieval-based method for PAVI. TACLR formulates PAVI as an information retrieval task by encoding product profiles and candidate values into embeddings and retrieving values based on their similarity to the item embedding. It leverages contrastive training with taxonomy-aware hard negative sampling and employs adaptive inference with dynamic thresholds. TACLR offers three key advantages: (1) it effectively handles implicit and OOD values while producing normalized outputs; (2) it scales to thousands of categories, tens of thousands of attributes, and millions of values; and (3) it supports efficient inference for high-load industrial scenarios. Extensive experiments on proprietary and public datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of TACLR. Moreover, it has been successfully deployed in a real-world e-commerce platform, processing millions of product listings daily while supporting dynamic, large-scale attribute taxonomies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexis Matzopoulos, Charl Hendriks, Hishaam Mahomed, Francois Meyer</p>
<p>Abstract: The BabyLM challenge called on participants to develop sample-efficient language models. Submissions were pretrained on a fixed English corpus, limited to the amount of words children are exposed to in development (<100m). The challenge produced new architectures for data-efficient language modelling, which outperformed models trained on trillions of words. This is promising for low-resource languages, where available corpora are limited to much less than 100m words. In this paper, we explore the potential of BabyLMs for low-resource languages, using the isiXhosa language as a case study. We pretrain two BabyLM architectures, ELC-BERT and MLSM, on an isiXhosa corpus. They outperform a vanilla pretrained model on POS tagging and NER, achieving notable gains (+3.2 F1) for the latter. In some instances, the BabyLMs even outperform XLM-R. Our findings show that data-efficient models are viable for low-resource languages, but highlight the continued importance, and lack of, high-quality pretraining data. Finally, we visually analyse how BabyLM architectures encode isiXhosa.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dengzhao Fang, Jipeng Qiang, Yi Zhu, Yunhao Yuan, Wei Li, Yan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Research on text simplification has primarily focused on lexical and sentence-level changes. Long document-level simplification (DS) is still relatively unexplored. Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have excelled in many natural language processing tasks. However, their performance on DS tasks is unsatisfactory, as they often treat DS as merely document summarization. For the DS task, the generated long sequences not only must maintain consistency with the original document throughout, but complete moderate simplification operations encompassing discourses, sentences, and word-level simplifications. Human editors employ a hierarchical complexity simplification strategy to simplify documents. This study delves into simulating this strategy through the utilization of a multi-stage collaboration using LLMs. We propose a progressive simplification method (ProgDS) by hierarchically decomposing the task, including the discourse-level, topic-level, and lexical-level simplification. Experimental results demonstrate that ProgDS significantly outperforms existing smaller models or direct prompting with LLMs, advancing the state-of-the-art in the document simplification task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xaver Maria Kr\"uckl, Verena Blaschke, Barbara Plank</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable slot and intent detection (SID) is crucial in natural language understanding for applications like digital assistants. Encoder-only transformer models fine-tuned on high-resource languages generally perform well on SID. However, they struggle with dialectal data, where no standardized form exists and training data is scarce and costly to produce. We explore zero-shot transfer learning for SID, focusing on multiple Bavarian dialects, for which we release a new dataset for the Munich dialect. We evaluate models trained on auxiliary tasks in Bavarian, and compare joint multi-task learning with intermediate-task training. We also compare three types of auxiliary tasks: token-level syntactic tasks, named entity recognition (NER), and language modelling. We find that the included auxiliary tasks have a more positive effect on slot filling than intent classification (with NER having the most positive effect), and that intermediate-task training yields more consistent performance gains. Our best-performing approach improves intent classification performance on Bavarian dialects by 5.1 and slot filling F1 by 8.4 percentage points.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Verena Blaschke, Felicia K\"orner, Barbara Plank</p>
<p>Abstract: Slot and intent detection (SID) is a classic natural language understanding task. Despite this, research has only more recently begun focusing on SID for dialectal and colloquial varieties. Many approaches for low-resource scenarios have not yet been applied to dialectal SID data, or compared to each other on the same datasets. We participate in the VarDial 2025 shared task on slot and intent detection in Norwegian varieties, and compare multiple set-ups: varying the training data (English, Norwegian, or dialectal Norwegian), injecting character-level noise, training on auxiliary tasks, and applying Layer Swapping, a technique in which layers of models fine-tuned on different datasets are assembled into a model. We find noise injection to be beneficial while the effects of auxiliary tasks are mixed. Though some experimentation was required to successfully assemble a model from layers, it worked surprisingly well; a combination of models trained on English and small amounts of dialectal data produced the most robust slot predictions. Our best models achieve 97.6% intent accuracy and 85.6% slot F1 in the shared task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aman Gupta, Shao Tang, Qingquan Song, Sirou Zhu, Jiwoo Hong, Ankan Saha, Viral Gupta, Noah Lee, Eunki Kim, Jason Zhu, Natesh Pillai, S. Sathiya Keerthi</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and its variants have made huge strides toward the effective alignment of large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions and reflect human values. More recently, Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) have emerged in which the reward modeling stage of RLHF is skipped by characterizing the reward directly as a function of the policy being learned. Examples include Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO). These methods often suffer from likelihood displacement, a phenomenon by which the probabilities of preferred responses are often reduced undesirably.
  In this paper, we argue that, for DAAs the reward (function) shape matters. We introduce AlphaPO, a new DAA method that leverages an $\alpha$-parameter to help change the shape of the reward function beyond the standard log reward. AlphaPO helps maintain fine-grained control over likelihood displacement and over-optimization. Compared to SimPO, one of the best performing DAAs, AlphaPO leads to about 7\% to 10\% relative improvement in alignment performance for the instruct versions of Mistral-7B and Llama3-8B. The analysis and results presented highlight the importance of the reward shape, and how one can systematically change it to affect training dynamics, as well as improve alignment performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pablo Miralles-Gonz\'alez, Javier Huertas-Tato, Alejandro Mart\'in, David Camacho</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, raising concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content and making it critical to detect it. However, the task remains challenging, particularly in unseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distribution outputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they encapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse corpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize these outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of the problems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics across tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and should be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity Attention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM and positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from the next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot, our method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token distribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource requirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performance in-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction of their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen domains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary across distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and if the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent generalization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B reaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have transformed our expectations of modern language technologies, concerns over data privacy often restrict the use of commercially available LLMs hosted outside of EU jurisdictions. This limits their application in governmental, defence, and other data-sensitive sectors. In this work, we evaluate the extent to which locally deployable open-weight LLMs support lesser-spoken languages such as Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian. We examine various size and precision variants of the top-performing multilingual open-weight models, Llama~3, Gemma~2, Phi, and NeMo, on machine translation, multiple-choice question answering, and free-form text generation. The results indicate that while certain models like Gemma~2 perform close to the top commercially available models, many LLMs struggle with these languages. Most surprisingly, however, we find that these models, while showing close to state-of-the-art translation performance, are still prone to lexical hallucinations with errors in at least 1 in 20 words for all open-weight multilingual LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> N J Karthika, Adyasha Patra, Nagasai Saketh Naidu, Arnab Bhattacharya, Ganesh Ramakrishnan, Chaitali Dangarikar</p>
<p>Abstract: Indian languages are inflectional and agglutinative and typically follow clause-free word order. The structure of sentences across most major Indian languages are similar when their dependency parse trees are considered. While some differences in the parsing structure occur due to peculiarities of a language or its preferred natural way of conveying meaning, several apparent differences are simply due to the granularity of representation of the smallest semantic unit of processing in a sentence. The semantic unit is typically a word, typographically separated by whitespaces. A single whitespace-separated word in one language may correspond to a group of words in another. Hence, grouping of words based on semantics helps unify the parsing structure of parallel sentences across languages and, in the process, morphology. In this work, we propose word grouping as a major preprocessing step for any computational or linguistic processing of sentences for Indian languages. Among Indian languages, since Hindi is one of the least agglutinative, we expect it to benefit the most from word-grouping. Hence, in this paper, we focus on Hindi to study the effects of grouping. We perform quantitative assessment of our proposal with an intrinsic method that perturbs sentences by shuffling words as well as an extrinsic evaluation that verifies the importance of word grouping for the task of Machine Translation (MT) using decomposed prompting. We also qualitatively analyze certain aspects of the syntactic structure of sentences. Our experiments and analyses show that the proposed grouping technique brings uniformity in the syntactic structures, as well as aids underlying NLP tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxi Xia, Pedro Henrique Luz de Araujo, Klim Zaporojets, Benjamin Roth</p>
<p>Abstract: Calibration, the alignment between model confidence and prediction accuracy, is critical for the reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs). Existing works neglect to measure the generalization of their methods to other prompt styles and different sizes of LLMs. To address this, we define a controlled experimental setting covering 12 LLMs and four prompt styles. We additionally investigate if incorporating the response agreement of multiple LLMs and an appropriate loss function can improve calibration performance. Concretely, we build Calib-n, a novel framework that trains an auxiliary model for confidence estimation that aggregates responses from multiple LLMs to capture inter-model agreement. To optimize calibration, we integrate focal and AUC surrogate losses alongside binary cross-entropy. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate that both response agreement and focal loss improve calibration from baselines. We find that few-shot prompts are the most effective for auxiliary model-based methods, and auxiliary models demonstrate robust calibration performance across accuracy variations, outperforming LLMs' internal probabilities and verbalized confidences. These insights deepen the understanding of influence factors in LLM calibration, supporting their reliable deployment in diverse applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Ciferri, Matteo Ferrante, Nicola Toschi</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the neural mechanisms behind auditory and linguistic processing is key to advancing cognitive neuroscience. In this study, we use Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to analyze brain responses to spoken language stimuli. We develop two distinct encoding models: an audio-to-MEG encoder, which uses time-frequency decompositions (TFD) and wav2vec2 latent space representations, and a text-to-MEG encoder, which leverages CLIP and GPT-2 embeddings. Both models successfully predict neural activity, demonstrating significant correlations between estimated and observed MEG signals. However, the text-to-MEG model outperforms the audio-based model, achieving higher Pearson Correlation (PC) score. Spatially, we identify that auditory-based embeddings (TFD and wav2vec2) predominantly activate lateral temporal regions, which are responsible for primary auditory processing and the integration of auditory signals. In contrast, textual embeddings (CLIP and GPT-2) primarily engage the frontal cortex, particularly Broca's area, which is associated with higher-order language processing, including semantic integration and language production, especially in the 8-30 Hz frequency range. The strong involvement of these regions suggests that auditory stimuli are processed through more direct sensory pathways, while linguistic information is encoded via networks that integrate meaning and cognitive control. Our results reveal distinct neural pathways for auditory and linguistic information processing, with higher encoding accuracy for text representations in the frontal regions. These insights refine our understanding of the brain's functional architecture in processing auditory and textual information, offering quantitative advancements in the modelling of neural responses to complex language stimuli.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Zhang, Tian-Hao Zhang, Chao Luo, Hui Zhou, Chao Yang, Xinyuan Qian, Xu-Cheng Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, end-to-end automatic speech recognition has become the mainstream approach in both industry and academia. To optimize system performance in specific scenarios, the Weighted Finite-State Transducer (WFST) is extensively used to integrate acoustic and language models, leveraging its capacity to implicitly fuse language models within static graphs, thereby ensuring robust recognition while also facilitating rapid error correction. However, WFST necessitates a frame-by-frame search of CTC posterior probabilities through autoregression, which significantly hampers inference speed. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the spike property of CTC outputs and further propose the conjecture that adjacent frames to non-blank spikes carry semantic information beneficial to the model. Building on this, we propose the Spike Window Decoding algorithm, which greatly improves the inference speed by making the number of frames decoded in WFST linearly related to the number of spiking frames in the CTC output, while guaranteeing the recognition performance. Our method achieves SOTA recognition accuracy with significantly accelerates decoding speed, proven across both AISHELL-1 and large-scale In-House datasets, establishing a pioneering approach for integrating CTC output with WFST.</p>

We propose DPO-Kernels, which integrates kernel methods to address these issues through four key contributions: (i) Kernelized Representations with polynomial, RBF, Mahalanobis, and spectral kernels for richer transformations, plus a hybrid loss combining embedding-based and probability-based objectives; (ii) Divergence Alternatives (Jensen-Shannon, Hellinger, Renyi, Bhattacharyya, Wasserstein, and f-divergences) for greater stability; (iii) Data-Driven Selection metrics that automatically choose the best kernel-divergence pair; and (iv) a Hierarchical Mixture of Kernels for both local precision and global modeling. Evaluations on 12 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in factuality, safety, reasoning, and instruction following. Grounded in Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization, DPO-Kernels maintains robust generalization for LLMs, offering a comprehensive resource for further alignment research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peihai Jiang, Xixiang Lyu, Yige Li, Jing Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning has become the predominant method for adapting large pretrained models to downstream tasks. However, recent studies have revealed that these models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where even a small number of malicious samples can successfully embed backdoor triggers into the model. While most existing defense methods focus on post-training backdoor defense, efficiently defending against backdoor attacks during training phase remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel defense method called Backdoor Token Unlearning (BTU), which proactively detects and neutralizes trigger tokens during the training stage. Our work is based on two key findings: 1) backdoor learning causes distinctive differences between backdoor token parameters and clean token parameters in word embedding layers, and 2) the success of backdoor attacks heavily depends on backdoor token parameters. The BTU defense leverages these properties to identify aberrant embedding parameters and subsequently removes backdoor behaviors using a fine-grained unlearning technique. Extensive evaluations across three datasets and four types of backdoor attacks demonstrate that BTU effectively defends against these threats while preserving the model's performance on primary tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Shoaibur Rahman</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates transformer model compression by systematically pruning its layers. We evaluated 14 pruning strategies across nine diverse datasets, including 12 strategies based on different signals obtained from layer activations, mutual information, gradients, weights, and attention. To address the limitations of single-signal strategies, we introduced two fusion strategies, linear regression and random forest, which combine individual strategies (i.e., strategic fusion), for more informed pruning decisions. Additionally, we applied knowledge distillation to mitigate any accuracy loss during layer pruning. Our results reveal that random forest strategic fusion outperforms individual strategies in seven out of nine datasets and achieves near-optimal performance in the other two. The distilled random forest surpasses the original accuracy in six datasets and mitigates accuracy drops in the remaining three. Knowledge distillation also improves the accuracy-to-size ratio by an average factor of 18.84 across all datasets. Supported by mathematical foundations and biological analogies, our findings suggest that strategically combining multiple signals can lead to efficient, high-performing transformer models for resource-constrained applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ammar Ahmed, Margarida Fresco, Fredrik Forsberg, Hallvard Grotli</p>
<p>Abstract: Web accessibility ensures that individuals with disabilities can access and interact with digital content without barriers, yet a significant majority of most used websites fail to meet accessibility standards. This study evaluates ChatGPT's (GPT-4o) ability to generate and improve web pages in line with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). While ChatGPT can effectively address accessibility issues when prompted, its default code often lacks compliance, reflecting limitations in its training data and prevailing inaccessible web practices. Automated and manual testing revealed strengths in resolving simple issues but challenges with complex tasks, requiring human oversight and additional iterations. Unlike prior studies, we incorporate manual evaluation, dynamic elements, and use the visual reasoning capability of ChatGPT along with the prompts to fix accessibility issues. Providing screenshots alongside prompts enhances the LLM's ability to address accessibility issues by allowing it to analyze surrounding components, such as determining appropriate contrast colors. We found that effective prompt engineering, such as providing concise, structured feedback and incorporating visual aids, significantly enhances ChatGPT's performance. These findings highlight the potential and limitations of large language models for accessible web development, offering practical guidance for developers to create more inclusive websites.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained significant attention in short text clustering, yet it has an inherent drawback of mistakenly identifying samples from the same category as negatives and then separating them in the feature space (false negative separation), which hinders the generation of superior representations. To generate more discriminative representations for efficient clustering, we propose a novel short text clustering method, called Discriminative Representation learning via \textbf{A}ttention-\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{L}earning for Short Text Clustering (\textbf{AECL}). The \textbf{AECL} consists of two modules which are the pseudo-label generation module and the contrastive learning module. Both modules build a sample-level attention mechanism to capture similarity relationships between samples and aggregate cross-sample features to generate consistent representations. Then, the former module uses the more discriminative consistent representation to produce reliable supervision information for assist clustering, while the latter module explores similarity relationships and consistent representations optimize the construction of positive samples to perform similarity-guided contrastive learning, effectively addressing the false negative separation issue. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed \textbf{AECL} outperforms state-of-the-art methods. If the paper is accepted, we will open-source the code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaoussou Youssouf Kebe, Jeffrey M. Girard, Einat Liebenthal, Justin Baker, Fernando De la Torre, Louis-Philippe Morency</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces LlaMADRS, a novel framework leveraging open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate depression severity assessment using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). We employ a zero-shot prompting strategy with carefully designed cues to guide the model in interpreting and scoring transcribed clinical interviews. Our approach, tested on 236 real-world interviews from the Context-Adaptive Multimodal Informatics (CAMI) dataset, demonstrates strong correlations with clinician assessments. The Qwen 2.5--72b model achieves near-human level agreement across most MADRS items, with Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) closely approaching those between human raters. We provide a comprehensive analysis of model performance across different MADRS items, highlighting strengths and current limitations. Our findings suggest that LLMs, with appropriate prompting, can serve as efficient tools for mental health assessment, potentially increasing accessibility in resource-limited settings. However, challenges remain, particularly in assessing symptoms that rely on non-verbal cues, underscoring the need for multimodal approaches in future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiao Hu, Qian Li, Dongxiao Zhang, Jinyue Yan, Yuntian Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series (TS) tasks has gained increasing attention, which involves activating and enhancing LLMs' capabilities. Many methods aim to activate LLMs' capabilities based on token-level alignment but overlook LLMs' inherent strength on natural language processing -- their deep understanding of linguistic logic and structure rather than superficial embedding processing. We propose Context-Alignment, a new paradigm that aligns TS with a linguistic component in the language environments familiar to LLMs to enable LLMs to contextualize and comprehend TS data, thereby activating their capabilities. Specifically, such context-level alignment comprises structural alignment and logical alignment, which is achieved by a Dual-Scale Context-Alignment GNNs (DSCA-GNNs) applied to TS-language multimodal inputs. Structural alignment utilizes dual-scale nodes to describe hierarchical structure in TS-language, enabling LLMs treat long TS data as a whole linguistic component while preserving intrinsic token features. Logical alignment uses directed edges to guide logical relationships, ensuring coherence in the contextual semantics. Demonstration examples prompt are employed to construct Demonstration Examples based Context-Alignment (DECA) following DSCA-GNNs framework. DECA can be flexibly and repeatedly integrated into various layers of pre-trained LLMs to improve awareness of logic and structure, thereby enhancing performance. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of DECA and the importance of Context-Alignment across tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot forecasting, confirming that Context-Alignment provide powerful prior knowledge on context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangqian Bi, Yao Wan, Zhaoyang Chu, Yufei Hu, Junyi Zhang, Hongyu Zhang, Guandong Xu, Hai Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-training a language model and then fine-tuning it has shown to be an efficient and effective technique for a wide range of code intelligence tasks, such as code generation, code summarization, and vulnerability detection. However, pretraining language models on a large-scale code corpus is computationally expensive. Fortunately, many off-the-shelf Pre-trained Code Models (PCMs), such as CodeBERT, CodeT5, CodeGen, and Code Llama, have been released publicly. These models acquire general code understanding and generation capability during pretraining, which enhances their performance on downstream code intelligence tasks. With an increasing number of these public pre-trained models, selecting the most suitable one to reuse for a specific task is essential. In this paper, we systematically investigate the reusability of PCMs. We first explore three intuitive model selection methods that select by size, training data, or brute-force fine-tuning. Experimental results show that these straightforward techniques either perform poorly or suffer high costs. Motivated by these findings, we explore learning-based model selection strategies that utilize pre-trained models without altering their parameters. Specifically, we train proxy models to gauge the performance of pre-trained models, and measure the distribution deviation between a model's latent features and the task's labels, using their closeness as an indicator of model transferability. We conduct experiments on 100 widely-used opensource PCMs for code intelligence tasks, with sizes ranging from 42.5 million to 3 billion parameters. The results demonstrate that learning-based selection methods reduce selection time to 100 seconds, compared to 2,700 hours with brute-force fine-tuning, with less than 6% performance degradation across related tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural speech editing advancements have raised concerns about their misuse in spoofing attacks. Traditional partially edited speech corpora primarily focus on cut-and-paste edits, which, while maintaining speaker consistency, often introduce detectable discontinuities. Recent methods, like A\textsuperscript{3}T and Voicebox, improve transitions by leveraging contextual information. To foster spoofing detection research, we introduce the Speech INfilling Edit (SINE) dataset, created with Voicebox. We detailed the process of re-implementing Voicebox training and dataset creation. Subjective evaluations confirm that speech edited using this novel technique is more challenging to detect than conventional cut-and-paste methods. Despite human difficulty, experimental results demonstrate that self-supervised-based detectors can achieve remarkable performance in detection, localization, and generalization across different edit methods. The dataset and related models will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: As short text data in native languages like Hindi increasingly appear in modern media, robust methods for topic modeling on such data have gained importance. This study investigates the performance of BERTopic in modeling Hindi short texts, an area that has been under-explored in existing research. Using contextual embeddings, BERTopic can capture semantic relationships in data, making it potentially more effective than traditional models, especially for short and diverse texts. We evaluate BERTopic using 6 different document embedding models and compare its performance against 8 established topic modeling techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), Additive Regularization of Topic Models (ARTM), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), Embedded Topic Model (ETM), Combined Topic Model (CTM), and Top2Vec. The models are assessed using coherence scores across a range of topic counts. Our results reveal that BERTopic consistently outperforms other models in capturing coherent topics from short Hindi texts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaolei Zhang, Qingkai Fang, Zhe Yang, Yang Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of real-time large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4o has sparked considerable interest in efficient LMMs. LMM frameworks typically encode visual inputs into vision tokens (continuous representations) and integrate them and textual instructions into the context of large language models (LLMs), where large-scale parameters and numerous context tokens (predominantly vision tokens) result in substantial computational overhead. Previous efforts towards efficient LMMs always focus on replacing the LLM backbone with smaller models, while neglecting the crucial issue of token quantity. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal vision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while preserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision tokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early layers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into text tokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to fuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the extreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token. LLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support the understanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient manner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token instead of 576. Efficiency analyses reveal that LLaVA-Mini can reduce FLOPs by 77%, deliver low-latency responses within 40 milliseconds, and process over 10,000 frames of video on the GPU hardware with 24GB of memory.</p>

<p>Abstract: The scientific research paradigm is undergoing a profound transformation owing to the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recent works demonstrate that various AI-assisted research methods can largely improve research efficiency by improving data analysis, accelerating computation, and fostering novel idea generation. To further move towards the ultimate goal (i.e., automatic scientific research), in this paper, we propose Dolphin, the first closed-loop open-ended auto-research framework to further build the entire process of human scientific research. Dolphin can generate research ideas, perform experiments, and get feedback from experimental results to generate higher-quality ideas. More specifically, Dolphin first generates novel ideas based on relevant papers which are ranked by the topic and task attributes. Then, the codes are automatically generated and debugged with the exception-traceback-guided local code structure. Finally, Dolphin automatically analyzes the results of each idea and feeds the results back to the next round of idea generation. Experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets of different topics and results show that Dolphin can generate novel ideas continuously and complete the experiment in a loop. We highlight that Dolphin can automatically propose methods that are comparable to the state-of-the-art in some tasks such as 2D image classification and 3D point classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mihai Croicu, Simon Polichinel von der Maase</p>
<p>Abstract: This study advances the field of conflict forecasting by using text-based actor embeddings with transformer models to predict dynamic changes in violent conflict patterns at the actor level. More specifically, we combine newswire texts with structured conflict event data and leverage recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to forecast escalations and de-escalations among conflicting actors, such as governments, militias, separatist movements, and terrorists. This new approach accurately and promptly captures the inherently volatile patterns of violent conflicts, which existing methods have not been able to achieve. To create this framework, we began by curating and annotating a vast international newswire corpus, leveraging hand-labeled event data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program. By using this hybrid dataset, our models can incorporate the textual context of news sources along with the precision and detail of structured event data. This combination enables us to make both dynamic and granular predictions about conflict developments. We validate our approach through rigorous back-testing against historical events, demonstrating superior out-of-sample predictive power. We find that our approach is quite effective in identifying and predicting phases of conflict escalation and de-escalation, surpassing the capabilities of traditional models. By focusing on actor interactions, our explicit goal is to provide actionable insights to policymakers, humanitarian organizations, and peacekeeping operations in order to enable targeted and effective intervention strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatically generating presentations from documents is a challenging task that requires balancing content quality, visual design, and structural coherence. Existing methods primarily focus on improving and evaluating the content quality in isolation, often overlooking visual design and structural coherence, which limits their practical applicability. To address these limitations, we propose PPTAgent, which comprehensively improves presentation generation through a two-stage, edit-based approach inspired by human workflows. PPTAgent first analyzes reference presentations to understand their structural patterns and content schemas, then drafts outlines and generates slides through code actions to ensure consistency and alignment. To comprehensively evaluate the quality of generated presentations, we further introduce PPTEval, an evaluation framework that assesses presentations across three dimensions: Content, Design, and Coherence. Experiments show that PPTAgent significantly outperforms traditional automatic presentation generation methods across all three dimensions.

This paper addresses the critical challenge of improving multilingual performance without extensive fine-tuning. We introduce a novel dynamic learning approach that optimizes prompt strategy, embedding model, and LLM per query at runtime. By adapting configurations dynamically, our method achieves significant improvements over static, best and random baselines. It operates efficiently in both offline and online settings, generalizing seamlessly across new languages and datasets. Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with state-of-the-art multilingual embeddings, we achieve superior task performance across diverse linguistic contexts. Through systematic investigation and evaluation across 18 diverse languages using popular question-answering (QA) datasets we show our approach results in 10-15% improvements in multilingual performance over pre-trained models and 4x gains compared to fine-tuned, language-specific models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyi Zeng, Lizheng Wang, Yuncong Hu, Yi Xu, Chenghu Zhou, Xinbing Wang, Yu Yu, Zhouhan Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Protecting the copyright of large language models (LLMs) has become crucial due to their resource-intensive training and accompanying carefully designed licenses. However, identifying the original base model of an LLM is challenging due to potential parameter alterations. In this study, we introduce HuRef, a human-readable fingerprint for LLMs that uniquely identifies the base model without interfering with training or exposing model parameters to the public. We first observe that the vector direction of LLM parameters remains stable after the model has converged during pretraining, with negligible perturbations through subsequent training steps, including continued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and RLHF, which makes it a sufficient condition to identify the base model. The necessity is validated by continuing to train an LLM with an extra term to drive away the model parameters' direction and the model becomes damaged. However, this direction is vulnerable to simple attacks like dimension permutation or matrix rotation, which significantly change it without affecting performance. To address this, leveraging the Transformer structure, we systematically analyze potential attacks and define three invariant terms that identify an LLM's base model. Due to the potential risk of information leakage, we cannot publish invariant terms directly. Instead, we map them to a Gaussian vector using an encoder, then convert it into a natural image using StyleGAN2, and finally publish the image. In our black-box setting, all fingerprinting steps are internally conducted by the LLMs owners. To ensure the published fingerprints are honestly generated, we introduced Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). Experimental results across various LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/LUMIA-Group/HuRef.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite recent advances, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are still far from perfect. Typical errors include acronyms, named entities, and domain-specific special words for which little or no labeled data is available. To address the problem of recognizing these words, we propose a self-supervised continual learning approach: Given the audio of a lecture talk with the corresponding slides, we bias the model towards decoding new words from the slides by using a memory-enhanced ASR model from the literature. Then, we perform inference on the talk, collecting utterances that contain detected new words into an adaptation data set. Continual learning is then performed by training adaptation weights added to the model on this data set. The whole procedure is iterated for many talks. We show that with this approach, we obtain increasing performance on the new words when they occur more frequently (more than 80% recall) while preserving the general performance of the model.</p>

<p>Abstract: The reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on a wide range of problems critically relies on chain-of-thought prompting, which involves providing a few chain of thought demonstrations as exemplars in prompts. Recent work, e.g., Tree of Thoughts, has pointed out the importance of exploration and self-evaluation in reasoning step selection for complex problem solving. In this paper, we present Boosting of Thoughts (BoT), an automated prompting framework for problem solving with LLMs by iteratively exploring and self-evaluating many trees of thoughts in order to acquire an ensemble of trial-and-error reasoning experiences, which will serve as a new form of prompting to solve the complex problem. Starting from a simple prompt without requiring examples, BoT iteratively explores and evaluates a large collection of reasoning steps, and more importantly, uses error analysis obtained from the LLM on them to explicitly revise prompting, which in turn enhances reasoning step generation, until a final answer is attained. Our experiments with GPT-4 and Llama2 across extensive complex mathematical problems demonstrate that BoT consistently achieves higher or comparable problem-solving rates than other advanced prompting approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> B. N. Kausik</p>
<p>Abstract: Trained LLMs are typically sparse in that most of the parameters are zero, raising questions on efficiency. In response, we inquire into efficient LLMs, i.e. those with the fewest parameters that achieve the desired accuracy on a training corpus. Specifically, we compare theoretical and empirical estimates for training loss to obtain upper and lower bounds on the number of unique sequences in a natural training corpus as a function of its size. Our result implies (1) to double the number of skills represented in a training corpus, the corpus must scale more than four fold (2) for efficient LLMs, the number of parameters N and the size D of a natural training corpus scale as $N \propto D^{0.44}$; (3) if the number of parameters of an LLM is smaller than the number of unique sequences in the training corpus, scaling up can uncover emergent skills.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeeun Kim, Hyunseo Shin, Eunkyung Choi, Hongseok Oh, Hyunjun Kim, Wonseok Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Open source is a driving force behind scientific advancement.However, this openness is also a double-edged sword, with the inherent risk that innovative technologies can be misused for purposes harmful to society. What is the likelihood that an open source AI model or dataset will be used to commit a real-world crime, and if a criminal does exploit it, will the people behind the technology be able to escape legal liability? To address these questions, we explore a legal domain where individual choices can have a significant impact on society. Specifically, we build the EVE-V1 dataset that comprises 200 question-answer pairs related to criminal offenses based on 200 Korean precedents first to explore the possibility of malicious models emerging. We further developed EVE-V2 using 600 fraud-related precedents to confirm the existence of malicious models that can provide harmful advice on a wide range of criminal topics to test the domain generalization ability. Remarkably, widely used open-source large-scale language models (LLMs) provide unethical and detailed information about criminal activities when fine-tuned with EVE. We also take an in-depth look at the legal issues that malicious language models and their builders could realistically face. Our findings highlight the paradoxical dilemma that open source accelerates scientific progress, but requires great care to minimize the potential for misuse. Warning: This paper contains content that some may find unethical.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates remarkable multilingual capabilities in natural language processing, attracting global attention in both academia and industry. To mitigate potential discrimination and enhance the overall usability and accessibility for diverse language user groups, it is important for the development of language-fair technology. Despite the breakthroughs of LLMs, the investigation into the multilingual scenario remains insufficient, where a comprehensive survey to summarize recent approaches, developments, limitations, and potential solutions is desirable. To this end, we provide a survey with multiple perspectives on the utilization of LLMs in the multilingual scenario. We first rethink the transitions between previous and current research on pre-trained language models. Then we introduce several perspectives on the multilingualism of LLMs, including training and inference methods, information retrieval, model security, multi-domain with language culture, and usage of datasets. We also discuss the major challenges that arise in these aspects, along with possible solutions. Besides, we highlight future research directions that aim at further enhancing LLMs with multilingualism. The survey aims to help the research community address multilingual problems and provide a comprehensive understanding of the core concepts, key techniques, and latest developments in multilingual natural language processing based on LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadi Pouransari, Chun-Liang Li, Jen-Hao Rick Chang, Pavan Kumar Anasosalu Vasu, Cem Koc, Vaishaal Shankar, Oncel Tuzel</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly trained on datasets consisting of fixed-length token sequences. These datasets are created by randomly concatenating documents of various lengths and then chunking them into sequences of a predetermined target length (concat-and-chunk). Recent attention implementations mask cross-document attention, reducing the effective length of a chunk of tokens. Additionally, training on long sequences becomes computationally prohibitive due to the quadratic cost of attention. In this study, we introduce dataset decomposition, a novel variable sequence length training technique, to tackle these challenges. We decompose a dataset into a union of buckets, each containing sequences of the same size extracted from a unique document. During training, we use variable sequence length and batch-size, sampling simultaneously from all buckets with a curriculum. In contrast to the concat-and-chunk baseline, which incurs a fixed attention cost at every step of training, our proposed method incurs a computational cost proportional to the actual document lengths at each step, resulting in significant savings in training time. We train an 8k context-length 1B model at the same cost as a 2k context-length model trained with the baseline approach. Experiments on a web-scale corpus demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances performance on standard language evaluations and long-context benchmarks, reaching target accuracy with up to 6x faster training compared to the baseline. Our method not only enables efficient pretraining on long sequences but also scales effectively with dataset size. Lastly, we shed light on a critical yet less studied aspect of training large language models: the distribution and curriculum of sequence lengths, which results in a non-negligible difference in performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing use of social media to share lived and living experiences of substance use presents a unique opportunity to obtain information on side effects, use patterns, and opinions on novel psychoactive substances. However, due to the large volume of data, obtaining useful insights through natural language processing technologies such as large language models is challenging. This paper aims to develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture for medical question answering pertaining to clinicians' queries on emerging issues associated with health-related topics, using user-generated medical information on social media. We proposed a two-layer RAG framework for query-focused answer generation and evaluated a proof of concept for the framework in the context of query-focused summary generation from social media forums, focusing on emerging drug-related information. Our modular framework generates individual summaries followed by an aggregated summary to answer medical queries from large amounts of user-generated social media data in an efficient manner. We compared the performance of a quantized large language model (Nous-Hermes-2-7B-DPO), deployable in low-resource settings, with GPT-4. For this proof-of-concept study, we used user-generated data from Reddit to answer clinicians' questions on the use of xylazine and ketamine. Our framework achieves comparable median scores in terms of relevance, length, hallucination, coverage, and coherence when evaluated using GPT-4 and Nous-Hermes-2-7B-DPO, evaluated for 20 queries with 76 samples. There was no statistically significant difference between the two for coverage, coherence, relevance, length, and hallucination. A statistically significant difference was noted for the Coleman-Liau Index. Our RAG framework can effectively answer medical questions about targeted topics and can be deployed in resource-constrained settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bj\"orn Deiseroth, Manuel Brack, Patrick Schramowski, Kristian Kersting, Samuel Weinbach</p>
<p>Abstract: Tokenizers are crucial for encoding information in Large Language Models, but their development has recently stagnated, and they contain inherent weaknesses. Major limitations include computational overhead, ineffective vocabulary use, and unnecessarily large embedding and head layers. Additionally, their performance is biased towards a reference corpus, leading to reduced effectiveness for underrepresented languages.
  To remedy these issues, we propose T-FREE, which directly embeds words through sparse activation patterns over character triplets, and does not require a reference corpus. T-FREE inherently exploits morphological similarities and allows for strong compression of embedding layers. In our exhaustive experimental evaluation, we achieve competitive downstream performance with a parameter reduction of more than 85% on these layers. Further, T-FREE shows significant improvements in cross-lingual transfer learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the Faetar Automatic Speech Recognition Benchmark, a benchmark corpus designed to push the limits of current approaches to low-resource speech recognition. Faetar, a Franco-Proven\c{c}al variety spoken primarily in Italy, has no standard orthography, has virtually no existing textual or speech resources other than what is included in the benchmark, and is quite different from other forms of Franco-Proven\c{c}al. The corpus comes from field recordings, most of which are noisy, for which only 5 hrs have matching transcriptions, and for which forced alignment is of variable quality. The corpus contains an additional 20 hrs of unlabelled speech. We report baseline results from state-of-the-art multilingual speech foundation models with a best phone error rate of 30.4%, using a pipeline that continues pre-training on the foundation model using the unlabelled set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Zhang, Scott Viteri</p>
<p>Abstract: As language models grow more influential and trusted in our society, our ability to reliably steer them toward favorable behaviors becomes increasingly paramount. For this, we investigate the technique of steering vectors: biasing the forward pass of language models using a "steering vector" derived from a specific task. We apply them to steer language models toward performing Chain of Thought (CoT) Reasoning without the need to prompt through natural language. We demonstrate this approach on Llama3 8b and Mistral 7b v0.2, and obtain competitive results compared to CoT-prompted performances on a series of reasoning benchmarks (GSM8k, MMLU, AGI Eval, ARC AI2) and qualitative examples. We find this approach yields consistent steering towards CoT responses and takes less compute than traditional methods of fine-tuning models towards CoT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Han, Tong Zhu, Xiang Zhang, Mengsong Wu, Hao Xiong, Wenliang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) combined with tool learning have gained impressive results in real-world applications. During tool learning, LLMs may call multiple tools in nested orders, where the latter tool call may take the former response as its input parameters. However, current research on the nested tool learning capabilities is still under-explored, since the existing benchmarks lack relevant data instances. To address this problem, we introduce NesTools to bridge the current gap in comprehensive nested tool learning evaluations. NesTools comprises a novel automatic data generation method to construct large-scale nested tool calls with different nesting structures. With manual review and refinement, the dataset is in high quality and closely aligned with real-world scenarios. Therefore, NesTools can serve as a new benchmark to evaluate the nested tool learning abilities of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on 22 LLMs, and provide in-depth analyses with NesTools, which shows that current LLMs still suffer from the complex nested tool learning task.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents the process of building a neural machine translation system with support for English, Romanian, and Aromanian - an endangered Eastern Romance language. The primary contribution of this research is twofold: (1) the creation of the most extensive Aromanian-Romanian parallel corpus to date, consisting of 79,000 sentence pairs, and (2) the development and comparative analysis of several machine translation models optimized for Aromanian. To accomplish this, we introduce a suite of auxiliary tools, including a language-agnostic sentence embedding model for text mining and automated evaluation, complemented by a diacritics conversion system for different writing standards. This research brings contributions to both computational linguistics and language preservation efforts by establishing essential resources for a historically under-resourced language.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lester James V. Miranda, Yizhong Wang, Yanai Elazar, Sachin Kumar, Valentina Pyatkin, Faeze Brahman, Noah A. Smith, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Pradeep Dasigi</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from human feedback has enabled the alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences. However, directly collecting human preferences can be expensive, time-consuming, and can have high variance. An appealing alternative is to distill preferences from LMs as a source of synthetic annotations as they are more consistent, cheaper, and scale better than human annotation; however, they are also prone to biases and errors. In this work, we introduce a routing framework that combines inputs from humans and LMs to achieve better annotation quality, while reducing the total cost of human annotation. The crux of our approach is to identify preference instances that will benefit from human annotations. We formulate this as an optimization problem: given a preference dataset and an evaluation metric, we train a performance prediction model to predict a reward model's performance on an arbitrary combination of human and LM annotations and employ a routing strategy that selects a combination that maximizes predicted performance. We train the performance prediction model on MultiPref, a new preference dataset with 10K instances paired with human and LM labels. We show that the selected hybrid mixture of LM and direct human preferences using our routing framework achieves better reward model performance compared to using either one exclusively. We simulate selective human preference collection on three other datasets and show that our method generalizes well to all three. We analyze features from the routing model to identify characteristics of instances that can benefit from human feedback, e.g., prompts with a moderate safety concern or moderate intent complexity. We release the dataset, annotation platform, and source code used in this study to foster more efficient and accurate preference collection in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohit Chandra, Siddharth Sriraman, Gaurav Verma, Harneet Singh Khanuja, Jose Suarez Campayo, Zihang Li, Michael L. Birnbaum, Munmun De Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) from psychiatric medications are the leading cause of hospitalizations among mental health patients. With healthcare systems and online communities facing limitations in resolving ADR-related issues, Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to fill this gap. Despite the increasing capabilities of LLMs, past research has not explored their capabilities in detecting ADRs related to psychiatric medications or in providing effective harm reduction strategies. To address this, we introduce the Psych-ADR benchmark and the Adverse Drug Reaction Response Assessment (ADRA) framework to systematically evaluate LLM performance in detecting ADR expressions and delivering expert-aligned mitigation strategies. Our analyses show that LLMs struggle with understanding the nuances of ADRs and differentiating between types of ADRs. While LLMs align with experts in terms of expressed emotions and tone of the text, their responses are more complex, harder to read, and only 70.86% aligned with expert strategies. Furthermore, they provide less actionable advice by a margin of 12.32% on average. Our work provides a comprehensive benchmark and evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in strategy-driven tasks within high-risk domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Backgrounds: Information extraction (IE) is critical in clinical natural language processing (NLP). While large language models (LLMs) excel on generative tasks, their performance on extractive tasks remains debated. Methods: We investigated Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) using 1,588 clinical notes from four sources (UT Physicians, MTSamples, MIMIC-III, and i2b2). We developed an annotated corpus covering 4 clinical entities and 16 modifiers, and compared instruction-tuned LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 against BERT in terms of performance, generalizability, computational resources, and throughput to BERT. Results: LLaMA models outperformed BERT across datasets. With sufficient training data, LLaMA showed modest improvements (1% on NER, 1.5-3.7% on RE); improvements were larger with limited training data. On unseen i2b2 data, LLaMA-3-70B outperformed BERT by 7% (F1) on NER and 4% on RE. However, LLaMA models required more computing resources and ran up to 28 times slower. We implemented "Kiwi," a clinical IE package featuring both models, available at https://kiwi.clinicalnlp.org/. Conclusion: This study is among the first to develop and evaluate a comprehensive clinical IE system using open-source LLMs. Results indicate that LLaMA models outperform BERT for clinical NER and RE but with higher computational costs and lower throughputs. These findings highlight that choosing between LLMs and traditional deep learning methods for clinical IE applications should remain task-specific, taking into account both performance metrics and practical considerations such as available computing resources and the intended use case scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rithvik Prakki</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to creating adaptive language agents by integrating active inference with large language models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities, their reliance on static prompts limits adaptation to new information and changing environments. We address this by implementing an active inference framework that acts as a cognitive layer above an LLM-based agent, dynamically adjusting prompts and search strategies through principled information-seeking behavior. Our framework models the environment using three state factors (prompt, search, and information states) with seven observation modalities capturing quality metrics. By framing the agent's learning through the free energy principle, we enable systematic exploration of prompt combinations and search strategies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with the agent developing accurate models of environment dynamics evidenced by emergent structure in observation matrices. Action selection patterns reveal sophisticated exploration-exploitation behavior, transitioning from initial information-gathering to targeted prompt testing. The integration of thermodynamic principles with language model capabilities provides a principled framework for creating robust, adaptable agents, extending active inference beyond traditional low-dimensional control problems to high-dimensional, language-driven environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a major challenge when adapting large language models (LLMs) to new tasks or domains. Conventional fine-tuning often overwrites existing knowledge, causing performance degradation on original tasks. We introduce Superposition in Transformers, a novel architecture that leverages autoencoders to superimpose the hidden representations of a base model and a fine-tuned model within a shared parameter space. By using B-spline-based blending coefficients and autoencoders that adaptively reconstruct hidden states based on the input data distribution, our method effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables a new paradigm of "in-model" superposition. This approach preserves original model capabilities while allowing compact domain-specific expertise to be added, and it supports dynamic switching between model states during inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective evaluation of multi-hop tool use is critical for analyzing the understanding, reasoning, and function-calling capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, progress has been hindered by a lack of reliable evaluation datasets. To address this, we present ToolHop, a dataset comprising 995 user queries and 3,912 associated tools, specifically designed for rigorous evaluation of multi-hop tool use. ToolHop ensures diverse queries, meaningful interdependencies, locally executable tools, detailed feedback, and verifiable answers through a novel query-driven data construction approach that includes tool creation, document refinement, and code generation. We evaluate 14 LLMs across five model families (i.e., LLaMA3.1, Qwen2.5, Gemini1.5, Claude3.5, and GPT), uncovering significant challenges in handling multi-hop tool-use scenarios. The leading model, GPT-4o, achieves an accuracy of 49.04%, underscoring substantial room for improvement. Further analysis reveals variations in tool-use strategies for various families, offering actionable insights to guide the development of more effective approaches.

<p>Abstract: We propose Samba ASR,the first state of the art Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR)model leveraging the novel Mamba architecture as both encoder and decoder,built on the foundation of state space models(SSMs).Unlike transformerbased ASR models,which rely on self-attention mechanisms to capture dependencies,Samba ASR effectively models both local and global temporal dependencies using efficient statespace dynamics,achieving remarkable performance gains.By addressing the limitations of transformers,such as quadratic scaling with input length and difficulty in handling longrange dependencies,Samba ASR achieves superior accuracy and efficiency.Experimental results demonstrate that Samba ASR surpasses existing opensource transformerbased ASR models across various standard benchmarks,establishing it as the new state of theart in ASR.Extensive evaluations on the benchmark dataset show significant improvements in Word Error Rate(WER),with competitive performance even in lowresource scenarios.Furthermore,the inherent computational efficiency and parameter optimization of the Mamba architecture make Samba ASR a scalable and robust solution for diverse ASR tasks.Our contributions include the development of a new Samba ASR architecture for automatic speech recognition(ASR),demonstrating the superiority of structured statespace models(SSMs)over transformer based models for speech sequence processing.We provide a comprehensive evaluation on public benchmarks,showcasing stateoftheart(SOTA)performance,and present an indepth analysis of computational efficiency,robustness to noise,and sequence generalization.This work highlights the viability of Mamba SSMs as a transformerfree alternative for efficient and accurate ASR.By leveraging the advancements of statespace modeling,Samba ASR redefines ASR performance standards and sets a new benchmark for future research in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyang Song, Zhaochen Su, Xiaoye Qu, Jiawei Zhou, Yu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for complex reasoning and decision-making tasks, where each intermediate step plays an important role in the reasoning process. Since language models are prone to various types of errors during the reasoning process, PRMs are required to possess nuanced capabilities for detecting various implicit error types in real-world scenarios. However, current benchmarks primarily focus on step correctness, failing to evaluate PRMs' performance systematically. To address this gap, we introduce PRMBench, a process-level benchmark specifically designed to assess the fine-grained error detection capabilities of PRMs. PRMBench comprises 6,216 carefully designed problems and 83,456 step-level labels, evaluating models across multiple dimensions, including simplicity, soundness, and sensitivity. In our experiments on 15 models, spanning both open-source PRMs and closed-source large language models prompted as critic models, we uncover significant weaknesses in current PRMs. These findings underscore the challenges inherent in process-level evaluation and highlight key directions for future research. We hope PRMBench can be a robust bench for advancing research on PRM evaluation and development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yosuke Higuchi, Tetsuji Ogawa, Tetsunori Kobayashi</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose to utilize an instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) for guiding the text generation process in automatic speech recognition (ASR). Modern large language models (LLMs) are adept at performing various text generation tasks through zero-shot learning, prompted with instructions designed for specific objectives. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to derive linguistic information that can facilitate text generation in end-to-end ASR models. Specifically, we instruct an LLM to correct grammatical errors in an ASR hypothesis and use the LLM-derived representations to refine the output further. The proposed model is built on the joint CTC and attention architecture, with the LLM serving as a front-end feature extractor for the decoder. The ASR hypothesis, subject to correction, is obtained from the encoder via CTC decoding and fed into the LLM along with a specific instruction. The decoder subsequently takes as input the LLM output to perform token predictions, combining acoustic information from the encoder and the powerful linguistic information provided by the LLM. Experimental results show that the proposed LLM-guided model achieves a relative gain of approximately 13\% in word error rates across major benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Zheng, Ge Zhang, Tianhao Shen, Xueling Liu, Bill Yuchen Lin, Jie Fu, Wenhu Chen, Xiang Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: The introduction of large language models has significantly advanced code generation. However, open-source models often lack the execution capabilities and iterative refinement of advanced systems like the GPT-4 Code Interpreter. To address this, we introduce OpenCodeInterpreter, a family of open-source code systems designed for generating, executing, and iteratively refining code. Supported by Code-Feedback, a dataset featuring 68K multi-turn interactions, OpenCodeInterpreter integrates execution and human feedback for dynamic code refinement. Our comprehensive evaluation of OpenCodeInterpreter across key benchmarks such as HumanEval, MBPP, and their enhanced versions from EvalPlus reveals its exceptional performance. Notably, OpenCodeInterpreter-33B achieves an accuracy of 83.2 (76.4) on the average (and plus versions) of HumanEval and MBPP, closely rivaling GPT-4's 84.2 (76.2) and further elevates to 91.6 (84.6) with synthesized human feedback from GPT-4. OpenCodeInterpreter brings the gap between open-source code generation models and proprietary systems like GPT-4 Code Interpreter.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeonghwan Kim, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-tuned Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have imbued the models with the ability to generate high-level, image-grounded explanations with ease. While such capability is largely attributed to the rich world knowledge contained within the Large Language Models (LLMs), our work reveals their shortcomings in fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) across six different benchmark settings. Most recent state-of-the-art LVLMs like LLaVa-1.5, InstructBLIP and GPT-4V not only severely deteriorate in terms of classification performance, e.g., average drop of 65.58 in EM for Stanford Dogs for LLaVA-1.5, but also struggle to generate an accurate explanation with detailed attributes based on the concept that appears within an input image despite their capability to generate holistic image-level descriptions. In-depth analyses show that instruction-tuned LVLMs exhibit modality gap, showing discrepancy when given textual and visual inputs that correspond to the same concept, preventing the image modality from leveraging the rich parametric knowledge within the LLMs. In an effort to further the community's endeavor in this direction, we propose a multiple granularity attribute-centric evaluation benchmark, Finer, which aims to establish a ground to evaluate LVLMs' fine-grained visual comprehension ability and provide significantly improved explainability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Query-focused summarization (QFS) aims to produce summaries that answer particular questions of interest, enabling greater user control and personalization. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), shows their impressive capability of textual understanding through large-scale pretraining, which implies the great potential of extractive snippet generation. In this paper, we systematically investigated two indispensable characteristics that the LLMs-based QFS models should be harnessed, Lengthy Document Summarization and Efficiently Fine-grained Query-LLM Alignment, respectively. Correspondingly, we propose two modules called Query-aware HyperExpert and Query-focused Infini-attention to access the aforementioned characteristics. These innovations pave the way for broader application and accessibility in the field of QFS technology. Extensive experiments conducted on existing QFS benchmarks indicate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simen Eide, Arnoldo Frigessi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Bayesian Hierarchical Low-Rank Adaption (BoRA), a novel method for finetuning multi-task Large Language Models (LLMs). Current finetuning approaches, such as Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA), perform exeptionally well in reducing training parameters and memory usage but face limitations when applied to multiple similar tasks. Practitioners usually have to choose between training separate models for each task or a single model for all tasks, both of which come with trade-offs in specialization and data utilization. BoRA addresses these trade-offs by leveraging a Bayesian hierarchical model that allows tasks to share information through global hierarchical priors. This enables tasks with limited data to benefit from the overall structure derived from related tasks while allowing tasks with more data to specialize. Our experimental results show that BoRA outperforms both individual and unified model approaches, achieving lower perplexity and better generalization across tasks. This method provides a scalable and efficient solution for multi-task LLM finetuning, with significant practical implications for diverse applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to perform well for many downstream tasks. Transfer learning can enable LLMs to acquire skills that were not targeted during pre-training. In financial contexts, LLMs can sometimes beat well-established benchmarks. This paper investigates how well LLMs perform in the task of forecasting corporate credit ratings. We show that while LLMs are very good at encoding textual information, traditional methods are still very competitive when it comes to encoding numeric and multimodal data. For our task, current LLMs perform worse than a more traditional XGBoost architecture that combines fundamental and macroeconomic data with high-density text-based embedding features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei He, Yuzheng Hu, Yong Lin, Tong Zhang, Han Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging offers an effective strategy to combine the strengths of multiple finetuned models into a unified model that preserves the specialized capabilities of each. Existing methods merge models in a global manner, performing arithmetic operations across all model parameters. However, such global merging often leads to task interference, degrading the performance of the merged model. In this work, we introduce Localize-and-Stitch, a novel approach that merges models in a localized way. Our algorithm works in two steps: i) Localization: identify tiny ($1\%$ of the total parameters) localized regions in the finetuned models containing essential skills for the downstream tasks, and ii) Stitching: reintegrate only these essential regions back into the pretrained model for task synergy. We demonstrate that our approach effectively locates sparse regions responsible for finetuned performance, and the localized regions could be treated as compact and interpretable representations of the finetuned models (tasks). Empirically, we evaluate our method on various vision and language benchmarks, showing that it outperforms existing model merging methods under different data availability scenarios. Beyond strong empirical performance, our algorithm also facilitates model compression and preserves pretrained knowledge, enabling flexible and continual skill composition from multiple finetuned models with minimal storage and computational overhead.

<p>Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a crucial component in developing general-purpose AI agents capable of natural human-computer interaction. However, building robust multilingual SER systems remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data in languages other than English and Chinese. In this paper, we propose an approach to enhance SER performance in low SER resource languages by leveraging data from high-resource languages. Specifically, we employ expressive Speech-to-Speech translation (S2ST) combined with a novel bootstrapping data selection pipeline to generate labeled data in the target language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and generalizable across different upstream models and languages. Our results suggest that this approach can facilitate the development of more scalable and robust multilingual SER systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahrad Mohammadzadeh, Juan David Guerra, Marco Bonizzato, Reihaneh Rabbany, Golnoosh Farnadi</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across various industries, concerns regarding their reliability, particularly due to hallucinations - outputs that are factually inaccurate or irrelevant to user input - have grown. Our research investigates the relationship between the training process and the emergence of hallucinations to address a key gap in existing research that focuses primarily on post hoc detection and mitigation strategies. Using models from the Pythia suite (70M - 12B parameters) and several hallucination detection metrics, we analyze hallucination trends throughout training and explore LLM internal dynamics. We introduce Sensitivity Dropout (SenD), a novel training protocol designed to mitigate hallucinations by reducing variance during training. SenD achieves this by deterministically dropping embedding indices with significant variability, referred to as Sensitive Embedding Indices. In addition, we develop an unsupervised hallucination detection metric, Efficient EigenScore (EES), which approximates the traditional EigenScore at 2x speed. This efficient metric is integrated into our protocol, allowing SenD to be both computationally scalable and effective at reducing hallucinations. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach improves LLM reliability at test time by up to 40% compared to normal training while also providing an efficient method to improve factual accuracy when adapting LLMs to Wikipedia, Medical, and LegalBench domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongmin Park, Sebin Kim, Taehong Moon, Minkyu Kim, Kangwook Lee, Jaewoong Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often struggle to generate rare compositions of concepts, e.g., objects with unusual attributes. In this paper, we show that the compositional generation power of diffusion models on such rare concepts can be significantly enhanced by the Large Language Model (LLM) guidance. We start with empirical and theoretical analysis, demonstrating that exposing frequent concepts relevant to the target rare concepts during the diffusion sampling process yields more accurate concept composition. Based on this, we propose a training-free approach, R2F, that plans and executes the overall rare-to-frequent concept guidance throughout the diffusion inference by leveraging the abundant semantic knowledge in LLMs. Our framework is flexible across any pre-trained diffusion models and LLMs, and can be seamlessly integrated with the region-guided diffusion approaches. Extensive experiments on three datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, RareBench, containing various prompts with rare compositions of concepts, R2F significantly surpasses existing models including SD3.0 and FLUX by up to 28.1%p in T2I alignment.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate outstanding performance in their reservoir of knowledge and understanding capabilities, but they have also been shown to be prone to illegal or unethical reactions when subjected to jailbreak attacks. To ensure their responsible deployment in critical applications, it is crucial to understand the safety capabilities and vulnerabilities of LLMs. Previous works mainly focus on jailbreak in single-round dialogue, overlooking the potential jailbreak risks in multi-round dialogues, which are a vital way humans interact with and extract information from LLMs. Some studies have increasingly concentrated on the risks associated with jailbreak in multi-round dialogues. These efforts typically involve the use of manually crafted templates or prompt engineering techniques. However, due to the inherent complexity of multi-round dialogues, their jailbreak performance is limited. To solve this problem, we propose a novel multi-round dialogue jailbreaking agent, emphasizing the importance of stealthiness in identifying and mitigating potential threats to human values posed by LLMs. We propose a risk decomposition strategy that distributes risks across multiple rounds of queries and utilizes psychological strategies to enhance attack strength. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method surpasses other attack methods and achieves state-of-the-art attack success rate. We will make the corresponding code and dataset available for future research. The code will be released soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential in the field of time series forecasting, offering impressive capabilities in handling complex temporal data. However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like TimeGPT and LLM-Time with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhe Bi, Yujun Wang, Haokun Chen, Xun Xiao, Artur Hecker, Volker Tresp, Yunpu Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced visual tasks by integrating visual representations into large language models (LLMs). The textual modality, inherited from LLMs, equips MLLMs with abilities like instruction following and in-context learning. In contrast, the visual modality enhances performance in downstream tasks by leveraging rich semantic content, spatial information, and grounding capabilities. These intrinsic modalities work synergistically across various visual tasks. Our research initially reveals a persistent imbalance between these modalities, with text often dominating output generation during visual instruction tuning. This imbalance occurs when using both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. We then found that re-balancing these modalities can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters required, inspiring a direction for further optimizing visual instruction tuning. We introduce Modality Linear Representation-Steering (MoReS) to achieve the goal. MoReS effectively re-balances the intrinsic modalities throughout the model, where the key idea is to steer visual representations through linear transformations in the visual subspace across each model layer. To validate our solution, we composed LLaVA Steering, a suite of models integrated with the proposed MoReS method. Evaluation results show that the composed LLaVA Steering models require, on average, 500 times fewer trainable parameters than LoRA needs while still achieving comparable performance across three visual benchmarks and eight visual question-answering tasks. Last, we present the LLaVA Steering Factory, an in-house developed platform that enables researchers to quickly customize various MLLMs with component-based architecture for seamlessly integrating state-of-the-art models, and evaluate their intrinsic modality imbalance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehun Kim, Ji-Hoon Kim, Yeunju Choi, Tan Dat Nguyen, Seongkyu Mun, Joon Son Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of voice conversion is to transform the speech of a source speaker to sound like that of a reference speaker while preserving the original content. A key challenge is to extract disentangled linguistic content from the source and voice style from the reference. While existing approaches leverage various methods to isolate the two, a generalization still requires further attention, especially for robustness in zero-shot scenarios. In this paper, we achieve successful disentanglement of content and speaker features by tuning self-supervised speech features with adapters. The adapters are trained to dynamically encode nuanced features from rich self-supervised features, and the decoder fuses them to produce speech that accurately resembles the reference with minimal loss of content. Moreover, we leverage a conditional flow matching decoder with cross-attention speaker conditioning to further boost the synthesis quality and efficiency. Subjective and objective evaluations in a zero-shot scenario demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing models in speech quality and similarity to the reference speech.</p>
