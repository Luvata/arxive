<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaeheun Jung, Donghun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Structured pruning aims to reduce the size and computational cost of deep neural networks by removing entire filters or channels. The traditional regularizers such as L1 or Group Lasso and its variants lead to magnitude-biased pruning decisions, such that the filters with small magnitudes are likely to be pruned. Also, they often entail pruning results with almost zero margin around pruning decision boundary, such that tiny perturbation in a filter magnitude can flip the pruning decision. In this paper, we identify the precise algebraic condition under which pruning operations preserve model performance, and use the condition to construct a novel regularizer defined in an extended parameter space via auxiliary catalyst variables. The proposed Catalyst regularization ensures fair pruning chance for each filters with theoretically provable zero bias to their magnitude and robust pruning behavior achieved by wide-margin bifurcation of magnitudes between the preserved and the pruned filters. The theoretical properties naturally lead to real-world effectiveness, as shown by empirical validations of Catalyst Pruning algorithm. Pruning results on various datasets and models are superior to state-of-the-art filter pruning methods, and at the same time confirm the predicted robust and fair pruning characteristics of Catalyst pruning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14171">IPPRO: Importance-based Pruning with PRojective Offset for Magnitude-indifferent Structural Pruning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaeheun Jung, Jaehyuk Lee, Yeajin Lee, Donghun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growth of demand on neural network compression methods, the structured pruning methods including importance-based approach are actively studied. The magnitude importance and many correlated modern importance criteria often limit the capacity of pruning decision, since the filters with larger magnitudes are not likely to be pruned if the smaller one didn't, even if it is redundant. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning strategy to challenge this dominating effect of magnitude and provide fair chance to each filter to be pruned, by placing it on projective space. After that, we observe the gradient descent movement whether the filters move toward the origin or not, to measure how the filter is likely to be pruned. This measurement is used to construct PROscore, a novel importance score for IPPRO, a novel importance-based structured pruning with magnitude-indifference. Our evaluation results shows that the proposed importance criteria using the projective space achieves near-lossless pruning by reducing the performance drop in pruning, with promising performance after the finetuning. Our work debunks the ``size-matters'' myth in pruning and expands the frontier of importance-based pruning both theoretically and empirically.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14172">Self-Improving Language Models for Evolutionary Program Synthesis: A Case Study on ARC-AGI</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Julien Pourcel, C\'edric Colas, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Many program synthesis tasks prove too challenging for even state-of-the-art language models to solve in single attempts. Search-based evolutionary methods offer a promising alternative by exploring solution spaces iteratively, but their effectiveness remain limited by the fixed capabilities of the underlying generative model.
  We propose SOAR, a method that learns program synthesis by integrating language models into a self-improving evolutionary loop.
  SOAR alternates between (1) an evolutionary search that uses an LLM to sample and refine candidate solutions, and (2) a hindsight learning phase that converts search attempts into valid problem-solution pairs used to fine-tune the LLM's sampling and refinement capabilities\, -- \,enabling increasingly effective search in subsequent iterations.
  On the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, SOAR achieves significant performance gains across model scales and iterations, leveraging positive transfer between the sampling and refinement finetuning tasks. These improvements carry over to test-time adaptation, enabling SOAR to solve 52\% of the public test set. Our code is open-sourced at: https://github.com/flowersteam/SOAR</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14175">Latent Space Data Fusion Outperforms Early Fusion in Multimodal Mental Health Digital Phenotyping Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Youcef Barkat, Dylan Hamitouche, Deven Parekh, Ivy Guo, David Benrimoh</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety require improved methods for early detection and personalized intervention. Traditional predictive models often rely on unimodal data or early fusion strategies that fail to capture the complex, multimodal nature of psychiatric data. Advanced integration techniques, such as intermediate (latent space) fusion, may offer better accuracy and clinical utility. Methods: Using data from the BRIGHTEN clinical trial, we evaluated intermediate (latent space) fusion for predicting daily depressive symptoms (PHQ-2 scores). We compared early fusion implemented with a Random Forest (RF) model and intermediate fusion implemented via a Combined Model (CM) using autoencoders and a neural network. The dataset included behavioral (smartphone-based), demographic, and clinical features. Experiments were conducted across multiple temporal splits and data stream combinations. Performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). Results: The CM outperformed both RF and Linear Regression (LR) baselines across all setups, achieving lower MSE (0.4985 vs. 0.5305 with RF) and higher R2 (0.4695 vs. 0.4356). The RF model showed signs of overfitting, with a large gap between training and test performance, while the CM maintained consistent generalization. Performance was best when integrating all data modalities in the CM (in contradistinction to RF), underscoring the value of latent space fusion for capturing non-linear interactions in complex psychiatric datasets. Conclusion: Latent space fusion offers a robust alternative to traditional fusion methods for prediction with multimodal mental health data. Future work should explore model interpretability and individual-level prediction for clinical deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'es Morales-Forero (Polytechnique Montr\'eal), Lili J. Rueda (Universidad El Bosque), Ronald Herrera (Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH), Samuel Bassetto (Polytechnique Montr\'eal), Eric Coatanea (Tampere University)</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly inform medical decision-making, yet concerns about algorithmic bias and inequitable outcomes persist, particularly for historically marginalized populations. This paper introduces the concept of Predictive Representativity (PR), a framework of fairness auditing that shifts the focus from the composition of the data set to outcomes-level equity. Through a case study in dermatology, we evaluated AI-based skin cancer classifiers trained on the widely used HAM10000 dataset and on an independent clinical dataset (BOSQUE Test set) from Colombia. Our analysis reveals substantial performance disparities by skin phototype, with classifiers consistently underperforming for individuals with darker skin, despite proportional sampling in the source data. We argue that representativity must be understood not as a static feature of datasets but as a dynamic, context-sensitive property of model predictions. PR operationalizes this shift by quantifying how reliably models generalize fairness across subpopulations and deployment contexts. We further propose an External Transportability Criterion that formalizes the thresholds for fairness generalization. Our findings highlight the ethical imperative for post-hoc fairness auditing, transparency in dataset documentation, and inclusive model validation pipelines. This work offers a scalable tool for diagnosing structural inequities in AI systems, contributing to discussions on equity, interpretability, and data justice and fostering a critical re-evaluation of fairness in data-driven healthcare.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper aims to understand the training solution, which is obtained by the back-propagation algorithm, of two-layer neural networks whose hidden layer is composed of the units with smooth activation functions, including the usual sigmoid type most commonly used before the advent of ReLUs. The mechanism contains four main principles: construction of Taylor series expansions, strict partial order of knots, smooth-spline implementation and smooth-continuity restriction. The universal approximation for arbitrary input dimensionality is proved and experimental verification is given, through which the mystery of ``black box'' of the solution space is largely revealed. The new proofs employed also enrich approximation theory.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14178">Feature Bank Enhancement for Distance-based Out-of-Distribution Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Liu, Yuefei Wu, Bin Shi, Bo Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical to ensuring the reliability of deep learning applications and has attracted significant attention in recent years. A rich body of literature has emerged to develop efficient score functions that assign high scores to in-distribution (ID) samples and low scores to OOD samples, thereby helping distinguish OOD samples. Among these methods, distance-based score functions are widely used because of their efficiency and ease of use. However, deep learning often leads to a biased distribution of data features, and extreme features are inevitable. These extreme features make the distance-based methods tend to assign too low scores to ID samples. This limits the OOD detection capabilities of such methods. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, Feature Bank Enhancement (FBE), that uses statistical characteristics from dataset to identify and constrain extreme features to the separation boundaries, therapy making the distance between samples inside and outside the distribution farther. We conducted experiments on large-scale ImageNet-1k and CIFAR-10 respectively, and the results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both benchmark. Additionally, theoretical analysis and supplementary experiments are conducted to provide more insights into our method.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14179">A Sparsity Predicting Approach for Large Language Models via Activation Pattern Clustering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nobel Dhar, Bobin Deng, Md Romyull Islam, Xinyue Zhang, Kazi Fahim Ahmad Nasif, Kun Suo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant activation sparsity, where only a subset of neurons are active for a given input. Although this sparsity presents opportunities to reduce computational cost, efficiently utilizing it requires predicting activation patterns in a scalable manner. However, direct prediction at the neuron level is computationally expensive due to the vast number of neurons in modern LLMs. To enable efficient prediction and utilization of activation sparsity, we propose a clustering-based activation pattern compression framework. Instead of treating each neuron independently, we group similar activation patterns into a small set of representative clusters. Our method achieves up to 79.34% clustering precision, outperforming standard binary clustering approaches while maintaining minimal degradation in perplexity (PPL) scores. With a sufficiently large number of clusters, our approach attains a PPL score as low as 12.49, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving model quality while reducing computational overhead. By predicting cluster assignments rather than individual neuron states, future models can efficiently infer activation patterns from pre-computed centroids. We detail the clustering algorithm, analyze its effectiveness in capturing meaningful activation structures, and demonstrate its potential to improve sparse computation efficiency. This clustering-based formulation serves as a foundation for future work on activation pattern prediction, paving the way for efficient inference in large-scale language models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14180">Digital Twin-Assisted Explainable AI for Robust Beam Prediction in mmWave MIMO Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nasir Khan, Asmaa Abdallah, Abdulkadir Celik, Ahmed M. Eltawil, Sinem Coleri</p>
<p>Abstract: In line with the AI-native 6G vision, explainability and robustness are crucial for building trust and ensuring reliable performance in millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems. Efficient beam alignment is essential for initial access, but deep learning (DL) solutions face challenges, including high data collection overhead, hardware constraints, lack of explainability, and susceptibility to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a robust and explainable DL-based beam alignment engine (BAE) for mmWave multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) systems. The BAE uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements from wide beams to predict the best narrow beam, reducing the overhead of exhaustive beam sweeping. To overcome the challenge of real-world data collection, this work leverages a site-specific digital twin (DT) to generate synthetic channel data closely resembling real-world environments. A model refinement via transfer learning is proposed to fine-tune the pre-trained model residing in the DT with minimal real-world data, effectively bridging mismatches between the digital replica and real-world environments. To reduce beam training overhead and enhance transparency, the framework uses deep Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to rank input features by importance, prioritizing key spatial directions and minimizing beam sweeping. It also incorporates the Deep k-nearest neighbors (DkNN) algorithm, providing a credibility metric for detecting out-of-distribution inputs and ensuring robust, transparent decision-making. Experimental results show that the proposed framework reduces real-world data needs by 70%, beam training overhead by 62%, and improves outlier detection robustness by up to 8.5x, achieving near-optimal spectral efficiency and transparent decision making compared to traditional softmax based DL models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14181">Semi-Supervised Federated Learning via Dual Contrastive Learning and Soft Labeling for Intelligent Fault Diagnosis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yajiao Dai, Jun Li, Zhen Mei, Yiyang Ni, Shi Jin, Zengxiang Li, Sheng Guo, Wei Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD) plays a crucial role in ensuring the safe operation of industrial machinery and improving production efficiency. However, traditional supervised deep learning methods require a large amount of training data and labels, which are often located in different clients. Additionally, the cost of data labeling is high, making labels difficult to acquire. Meanwhile, differences in data distribution among clients may also hinder the model's performance. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a semi-supervised federated learning framework, SSFL-DCSL, which integrates dual contrastive loss and soft labeling to address data and label scarcity for distributed clients with few labeled samples while safeguarding user privacy. It enables representation learning using unlabeled data on the client side and facilitates joint learning among clients through prototypes, thereby achieving mutual knowledge sharing and preventing local model divergence. Specifically, first, a sample weighting function based on the Laplace distribution is designed to alleviate bias caused by low confidence in pseudo labels during the semi-supervised training process. Second, a dual contrastive loss is introduced to mitigate model divergence caused by different data distributions, comprising local contrastive loss and global contrastive loss. Third, local prototypes are aggregated on the server with weighted averaging and updated with momentum to share knowledge among clients. To evaluate the proposed SSFL-DCSL framework, experiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets and a dataset collected on motors from the factory. In the most challenging task, where only 10\% of the data are labeled, the proposed SSFL-DCSL can improve accuracy by 1.15% to 7.85% over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14182">From Bias to Behavior: Learning Bull-Bear Market Dynamics with Contrastive Modeling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaotong Luo, Shengda Zhuo, Min Chen, Lichun Li, Ruizhao Lu, Wenqi Fan, Shuqiang Huang, Yin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Financial markets exhibit highly dynamic and complex behaviors shaped by both historical price trajectories and exogenous narratives, such as news, policy interpretations, and social media sentiment. The heterogeneity in these data and the diverse insight of investors introduce biases that complicate the modeling of market dynamics. Unlike prior work, this paper explores the potential of bull and bear regimes in investor-driven market dynamics. Through empirical analysis on real-world financial datasets, we uncover a dynamic relationship between bias variation and behavioral adaptation, which enhances trend prediction under evolving market conditions. To model this mechanism, we propose the Bias to Behavior from Bull-Bear Dynamics model (B4), a unified framework that jointly embeds temporal price sequences and external contextual signals into a shared latent space where opposing bull and bear forces naturally emerge, forming the foundation for bias representation. Within this space, an inertial pairing module pairs temporally adjacent samples to preserve momentum, while the dual competition mechanism contrasts bullish and bearish embeddings to capture behavioral divergence. Together, these components allow B4 to model bias-driven asymmetry, behavioral inertia, and market heterogeneity. Experimental results on real-world financial datasets demonstrate that our model not only achieves superior performance in predicting market trends but also provides interpretable insights into the interplay of biases, investor behaviors, and market dynamics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred interest in numerous applications requiring robust long-range capabilities, essential for processing extensive input contexts and continuously generating extended outputs. As sequence lengths increase, the number of Key-Value (KV) pairs in LLMs escalates, creating a significant efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a new KV cache optimization paradigm called LaCache, a training-free method for efficient and accurate generative inference of LLMs. LaCache enables LLMs to simultaneously address both of the critical challenges in long-range modeling: robust long-range capabilities and continuous generation without running out-of-memory (OOM). Specifically, LaCache integrates two key innovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only sequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from shallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range dependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range capabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively compresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache size. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective continuous generation under constrained cache budgets. Experiments across various tasks, benchmarks, and LLM models consistently validate LaCache's effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' long-range capabilities.

<p>Abstract: This study aims to develop a deep learning system for an accessibility device for the deaf or hearing impaired. The device will accurately localize and identify sound sources in real time. This study will fill an important gap in current research by leveraging machine learning techniques to target the underprivileged community. The system includes three main components. 1. JerryNet: A custom designed CNN architecture that determines the direction of arrival (DoA) for nine possible directions. 2. Audio Classification: This model is based on fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) model to identify the exact sound classes only based on audio. 3. Multimodal integration model: This is an accurate sound localization model that combines audio, visual, and text data to locate the exact sound sources in the images. The part consists of two modules, one object detection using Yolov9 to generate all the bounding boxes of the objects, and an audio visual localization model to identify the optimal bounding box using complete Intersection over Union (CIoU). The hardware consists of a four-microphone rectangular formation and a camera mounted on glasses with a wristband for displaying necessary information like direction. On a custom collected data set, JerryNet achieved a precision of 91. 1% for the sound direction, outperforming all the baseline models. The CLAP model achieved 98.5% and 95% accuracy on custom and AudioSet datasets, respectively. The audio-visual localization model within component 3 yielded a cIoU of 0.892 and an AUC of 0.658, surpassing other similar models. There are many future potentials to this study, paving the way to creating a new generation of accessibility devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Obumneme Zimuzor Nwafor, Mohammed Abdul Majeed Al Hooti</p>
<p>Abstract: As nations seek sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, green hydrogen has emerged as a promising strategic pathway toward decarbonisation, particularly in solar-rich arid regions. However, identifying optimal locations for hydrogen production requires the integration of complex environmental, atmospheric, and infrastructural factors, often compounded by limited availability of direct hydrogen yield data. This study presents a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework for computing green hydrogen yield and site suitability index using mean absolute SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. This framework consists of a multi-stage pipeline of unsupervised multi-variable clustering, supervised machine learning classifier and SHAP algorithm. The pipeline trains on an integrated meteorological, topographic and temporal dataset and the results revealed distinct spatial patterns of suitability and relative influence of the variables. With model predictive accuracy of 98%, the result also showed that water proximity, elevation and seasonal variation are the most influential factors determining green hydrogen site suitability in Oman with mean absolute shap values of 2.470891, 2.376296 and 1.273216 respectively. Given limited or absence of ground-truth yield data in many countries that have green hydrogen prospects and ambitions, this study offers an objective and reproducible alternative to subjective expert weightings, thus allowing the data to speak for itself and potentially discover novel latent groupings without pre-imposed assumptions. This study offers industry stakeholders and policymakers a replicable and scalable tool for green hydrogen infrastructure planning and other decision making in data-scarce regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khoi Do, Duong Nguyen, Nam-Khanh Le, Quoc-Viet Pham, Binh-Son Hua, Won-Joo Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we address the gradient-based domain generalization problem, where predictors aim for consistent gradient directions across different domains. Existing methods have two main challenges. First, minimization of gradient empirical distance or gradient inner products (GIP) leads to gradient fluctuations among domains, thereby hindering straightforward learning. Second, the direct application of gradient learning to the joint loss function can incur high computation overheads due to second-order derivative approximation. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new Pareto Optimality Gradient Matching (POGM) method. In contrast to existing methods that add gradient matching as regularization, we leverage gradient trajectories as collected data and apply independent training at the meta-learner. In the meta-update, we maximize GIP while limiting the learned gradient from deviating too far from the empirical risk minimization gradient trajectory. By doing so, the aggregate gradient can incorporate knowledge from all domains without suffering gradient fluctuation towards any particular domain. Experimental evaluations on datasets from DomainBed demonstrate competitive results yielded by POGM against other baselines while achieving computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengjie Yu, Kenneth A. Dawson, Haiyun Yang, Shuya Liu, Yan Yan, Yaochu Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlocking the potential of nanomaterials in medicine and environmental science hinges on understanding their interactions with proteins, a complex decision space where AI is poised to make a transformative impact. However, progress has been hindered by limited datasets and the restricted generalizability of existing models. Here, we propose NanoPro-3M, the largest nanomaterial-protein interaction dataset to date, comprising over 3.2 million samples and 37,000 unique proteins. Leveraging this, we present NanoProFormer, a foundational model that predicts nanomaterial-protein affinities through multimodal representation learning, demonstrating strong generalization, handling missing features, and unseen nanomaterials or proteins. We show that multimodal modeling significantly outperforms single-modality approaches and identifies key determinants of corona formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate its applicability to a range of downstream tasks through zero-shot inference and fine-tuning. Together, this work establishes a solid foundation for high-performance and generalized prediction of nanomaterial-protein interaction endpoints, reducing experimental reliance and accelerating various in vitro applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julio Candanedo</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the Linearized Diffusion Map (LDM), a novel linear dimensionality reduction method constructed via a linear approximation of the diffusion-map kernel. LDM integrates the geometric intuition of diffusion-based nonlinear methods with the computational simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability inherent in linear embeddings such as PCA and classical MDS. Through comprehensive experiments on synthetic datasets (Swiss roll and hyperspheres) and real-world benchmarks (MNIST and COIL-20), we illustrate that LDM captures distinct geometric features of datasets compared to PCA, offering complementary advantages. Specifically, LDM embeddings outperform PCA in datasets exhibiting explicit manifold structures, particularly in high-dimensional regimes, whereas PCA remains preferable in scenarios dominated by variance or noise. Furthermore, the complete positivity of LDM's kernel matrix allows direct applicability of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), suggesting opportunities for interpretable latent-structure discovery. Our analysis positions LDM as a valuable new linear dimensionality reduction technique with promising theoretical and practical extensions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Licheng Liu, Zihan Wang, Linjie Li, Chenwei Xu, Yiping Lu, Han Liu, Avirup Sil, Manling Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-turn problem solving is critical yet challenging for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to reflect on their reasoning and revise from feedback. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a single-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models trained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems across multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual feedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect their answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training models with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., "Let's try again") after wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn reasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement learning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative problem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training setups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn performance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling language models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To further minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while encouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures that guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Rafid Haque, Abu Raihan Mostofa Kamal, Md. Azam Hossain</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a paradigm for privacy-preserving collaborative AI, but its decentralized nature creates significant vulnerabilities to model poisoning attacks. While numerous static defenses exist, their effectiveness is highly context-dependent, often failing against adaptive adversaries or in heterogeneous data environments. This paper introduces FedStrategist, a novel meta-learning framework that reframes robust aggregation as a real-time, cost-aware control problem. We design a lightweight contextual bandit agent that dynamically selects the optimal aggregation rule from an arsenal of defenses based on real-time diagnostic metrics. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that no single static rule is universally optimal. We show that our adaptive agent successfully learns superior policies across diverse scenarios, including a ``Krum-favorable" environment and against a sophisticated "stealth" adversary designed to neutralize specific diagnostic signals. Critically, we analyze the paradoxical scenario where a non-robust baseline achieves high but compromised accuracy, and demonstrate that our agent learns a conservative policy to prioritize model integrity. Furthermore, we prove the agent's policy is controllable via a single "risk tolerance" parameter, allowing practitioners to explicitly manage the trade-off between performance and security. Our work provides a new, practical, and analyzable approach to creating resilient and intelligent decentralized AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryana Hou, Li Lin, Justin Li, Shu Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI models have substantially improved the realism of synthetic media, yet their misuse through sophisticated DeepFakes poses significant risks. Despite recent advances in deepfake detection, fairness remains inadequately addressed, enabling deepfake markers to exploit biases against specific populations. While previous studies have emphasized group-level fairness, individual fairness (i.e., ensuring similar predictions for similar individuals) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify for the first time that the original principle of individual fairness fundamentally fails in the context of deepfake detection, revealing a critical gap previously unexplored in the literature. To mitigate it, we propose the first generalizable framework that can be integrated into existing deepfake detectors to enhance individual fairness and generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on leading deepfake datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves individual fairness while maintaining robust detection performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aidan Furlong, Xingang Zhao, Robert Salko, Xu Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of critical heat flux (CHF) is an essential component of safety analysis in pressurized and boiling water reactors. To support reliable prediction of this quantity, several empirical correlations and lookup tables have been constructed from physical experiments over the past several decades. With the onset of accessible machine learning (ML) frameworks, multiple initiatives have been established with the goal of predicting CHF more accurately than these traditional methods. While purely data-driven surrogate modeling has been extensively investigated, these approaches lack interpretability, lack resilience to data scarcity, and have been developed mostly using data from tube experiments. As a result, bias-correction hybrid approaches have become increasingly popular, which correct initial "low-fidelity" estimates provided by deterministic base models by using ML-predicted residuals. This body of work has mostly considered round tube geometries; annular geometry-specific ML models have not yet been deployed in thermal hydraulic codes. This study developed, deployed, and validated four ML models to predict CHF in annular geometries using the CTF subchannel code. Three empirical correlation models, Biasi, Bowring, and Katto, were used as base models for comparison. The ML models were trained and tested using 577 experimental annulus data points from four datasets: Becker, Beus, Janssen, and Mortimore. Baseline CHF predictions were obtained from the empirical correlations, with mean relative errors above 26%. The ML-driven models achieved mean relative errors below 3.5%, with no more than one point exceeding the 10% error envelope. In all cases, the hybrid ML models significantly outperformed their empirical counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Fein, Gabriela Aranguiz-Dias</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models are commonly fine-tuned via reinforcement learning to alter their behavior or elicit new capabilities. Datasets used for these purposes, and particularly human preference datasets, are often noisy. The relatively small size post-training datasets, combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, enable the use of influence functions approximations to detect and prune training examples that are harmful to performance on a validation set. In this work, we adapt the TL;DR dataset for reward model training to demonstrate how conjugate-gradient approximated influence functions can be used to filter datasets. In our experiments, influence function filtering yields a small retraining accuracy uplift of 1.5% after removing 10% of training examples. We also show that gradient similarity outperforms influence functions for detecting helpful training examples. This suggests that local curvature is important for detecting harmful training examples, but less so for identifying helpful examples.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14353">Solo Connection: A Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning Technique for Transformers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Harsh Nilesh Pathak, Randy Paffenroth</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT) is a versatile and extensible approach for adapting a Large Language Model (LLM) for newer tasks. One of the most prominent PEFT approaches, Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), primarily focuses on adjusting the attention weight matrices within individual decoder blocks of a Generative Pre trained Transformer (GPT2). In contrast, we introduce Solo Connection a novel method that adapts the representation at the decoder-block level rather than modifying individual weight matrices. Not only does Solo Connection outperform LoRA on E2E natural language generation benchmarks, but it also reduces the number of trainable parameters by 59% relative to LoRA and by more than 99% compared to full fine-tuning of GPT2, an early version of Large Language Models (LLMs). Solo Connection is also motivated by homotopy theory: we introduce a trainable linear transformation that gradually interpolates between a zero vector and the task-specific representation, enabling smooth and stable adaptation over time. While skip connections in the original 12 layer GPT2 are typically confined to individual decoder blocks, subsequent GPT2 variants scale up to 48 layers, and even larger language models can include 128 or more decoder blocks. These expanded architectures underscore the need to revisit how skip connections are employed during fine-tuning. This paper focuses on long skip connections that link outputs of different decoder blocks, potentially enhancing the model's ability to adapt to new tasks while leveraging pre-trained knowledge.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14387">Incremental Causal Graph Learning for Online Cyberattack Detection in Cyber-Physical Infrastructures</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Arun Vignesh Malarkkan, Dongjie Wang, Haoyue Bai, Yanjie Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: The escalating threat of cyberattacks on real-time critical infrastructures poses serious risks to public safety, demanding detection methods that effectively capture complex system interdependencies and adapt to evolving attack patterns. Traditional real-time anomaly detection techniques often suffer from excessive false positives due to their statistical sensitivity to high data variance and class imbalance. To address these limitations, recent research has explored modeling causal relationships among system components. However, prior work mainly focuses on offline causal graph-based approaches that require static historical data and fail to generalize to real-time settings. These methods are fundamentally constrained by: (1) their inability to adapt to dynamic shifts in data distribution without retraining, and (2) the risk of catastrophic forgetting when lacking timely supervision in live systems. To overcome these challenges, we propose INCADET, a novel framework for incremental causal graph learning tailored to real-time cyberattack detection. INCADET dynamically captures evolving system behavior by incrementally updating causal graphs across streaming time windows. The framework comprises three modules: 1) Early Symptom Detection: Detects transitions in system status using divergence in edge-weight distributions across sequential causal graphs. 2) Incremental Causal Graph Learning: Leverages experience replay and edge reinforcement to continually refine causal structures while preserving prior knowledge. 3) Causal Graph Classification: Employs Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to classify system status using the learned causal graphs. Extensive experiments on real-world critical infrastructure datasets demonstrate that INCADET achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability compared to both static causal and deep temporal baselines in evolving attack scenarios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14419">It&#x27;s Not That Simple. An Analysis of Simple Test-Time Scaling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Guojun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior work proposed simple test-time scaling, a method for replicating this scaling behavior with models distilled from o1-like models by manually controlling test-time compute: either scaling down by enforcing a maximum length or scaling up by iteratively appending "Wait" when the model is about to terminate its generation. This paper presents an analysis of simple test-time scaling and finds that the scaling behavior is largely attributed to scaling down by enforcing a maximum length. In contrast, fine-tuning on long CoT data distilled from o1-like models has no significant impact on scaling behavior, and scaling up by appending "Wait" leads to inconsistencies, as the model may oscillate between solutions. A key distinction exists between scaling down by enforcing a maximum length and scaling up test-time compute in o1-like models, such as DeepSeek-R1\@. These models are typically allowed to utilize as much compute as needed, with the only constraint being the model's maximum supported length. By learning to naturally scale up test-time compute during reinforcement learning, o1-like models surpass their peak performance when scaling up. In contrast, simple test-time scaling progressively imposes a lower upper limit on model performance as it scales down. While replicating the test-time scaling behavior of o1 models can be straightforward by scaling down, it is crucial to recognize that the goal of scaling test-time compute is to unlock higher performance -- beyond what the model could originally achieve -- rather than merely reproducing the appearance of scaling behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we study how to efficiently apply reinforcement learning (RL) for solving large-scale stochastic optimization problems by leveraging intervention models. The key of the proposed methodology is to better explore the solution space by simulating and composing the stochastic processes using pre-trained deep learning (DL) models. We demonstrate our approach on a challenging real-world application, the multi-sourcing multi-period inventory management problem in supply chain optimization. In particular, we employ deep RL models for learning and forecasting the stochastic supply chain processes under a range of assumptions. Moreover, we also introduce a constraint coordination mechanism, designed to forecast dual costs given the cross-products constraints in the inventory network. We highlight that instead of directly modeling the complex physical constraints into the RL optimization problem and solving the stochastic problem as a whole, our approach breaks down those supply chain processes into scalable and composable DL modules, leading to improved performance on large real-world datasets. We also outline open problems for future research to further investigate the efficacy of such models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yule Li, Yifeng Lu, Zhen Wang, Zhewei Wei, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNN) have achieved unprecedented successes in node classification tasks. Although GNNs inherently encode specific inductive biases (e.g., acting as low-pass or high-pass filters), most existing methods implicitly assume conditional independence among node labels in their optimization objectives. While this assumption is suitable for traditional classification tasks such as image recognition, it contradicts the intuitive observation that node labels in graphs remain correlated, even after conditioning on the graph structure. To make structured predictions for node labels, we propose ReDiSC, namely, Reparameterized masked Diffusion model for Structured node Classification. ReDiSC estimates the joint distribution of node labels using a reparameterized masked diffusion model, which is learned through the variational expectation-maximization (EM) framework. Our theoretical analysis shows the efficiency advantage of ReDiSC in the E-step compared to DPM-SNC, a state-of-the-art model that relies on a manifold-constrained diffusion model in continuous domain. Meanwhile, we explicitly link ReDiSC's M-step objective to popular GNN and label propagation hybrid approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReDiSC achieves superior or highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GNN, label propagation, and diffusion-based baselines across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs of varying sizes. Notably, ReDiSC scales effectively to large-scale datasets on which previous structured diffusion methods fail due to computational constraints, highlighting its significant practical advantage in structured node classification tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate a Federated Reinforcement Learning with Environment Heterogeneity (FRL-EH) framework, where local environments exhibit statistical heterogeneity. Within this framework, agents collaboratively learn a global policy by aggregating their collective experiences while preserving the privacy of their local trajectories. To better reflect real-world scenarios, we introduce a robust FRL-EH framework by presenting a novel global objective function. This function is specifically designed to optimize a global policy that ensures robust performance across heterogeneous local environments and their plausible perturbations. We propose a tabular FRL algorithm named FedRQ and theoretically prove its asymptotic convergence to an optimal policy for the global objective function. Furthermore, we extend FedRQ to environments with continuous state space through the use of expectile loss, addressing the key challenge of minimizing a value function over a continuous subset of the state space. This advancement facilitates the seamless integration of the principles of FedRQ with various Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based RL algorithms. Extensive empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness and robustness of our FRL algorithms across diverse heterogeneous environments, consistently achieving superior performance over the existing state-of-the-art FRL algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many critical decision-making tasks are now delegated to machine-learned models, and it is imperative that their decisions are trustworthy and reliable, and their outputs are consistent across similar inputs. We identify a new source of unreliable behaviors-called glitches-which may significantly impair the reliability of AI models having steep decision boundaries. Roughly speaking, glitches are small neighborhoods in the input space where the model's output abruptly oscillates with respect to small changes in the input. We provide a formal definition of glitches, and use well-known models and datasets from the literature to demonstrate that they have widespread existence and argue they usually indicate potential model inconsistencies in the neighborhood of where they are found. We proceed to the algorithmic search of glitches for widely used gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) models. We prove that the problem of detecting glitches is NP-complete for tree ensembles, already for trees of depth 4. Our glitch-search algorithm for GBDT models uses an MILP encoding of the problem, and its effectiveness and computational feasibility are demonstrated on a set of widely used GBDT benchmarks taken from the literature.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the knowledge distillation (KD) as a conditional generative problem and propose the \textit{Generative Distribution Distillation (GenDD)} framework. A naive \textit{GenDD} baseline encounters two major challenges: the curse of high-dimensional optimization and the lack of semantic supervision from labels. To address these issues, we introduce a \textit{Split Tokenization} strategy, achieving stable and effective unsupervised KD. Additionally, we develop the \textit{Distribution Contraction} technique to integrate label supervision into the reconstruction objective. Our theoretical proof demonstrates that \textit{GenDD} with \textit{Distribution Contraction} serves as a gradient-level surrogate for multi-task learning, realizing efficient supervised training without explicit classification loss on multi-step sampling image representations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on balanced, imbalanced, and unlabeled data. Experimental results show that \textit{GenDD} performs competitively in the unsupervised setting, significantly surpassing KL baseline by \textbf{16.29\%} on ImageNet validation set. With label supervision, our ResNet-50 achieves \textbf{82.28\%} top-1 accuracy on ImageNet in 600 epochs training, establishing a new state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeyoung Lee, Hochul Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose the Signal Dice Similarity Coefficient (SDSC), a structure-aware metric function for time series self-supervised representation learning. Most Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for signals commonly adopt distance-based objectives such as mean squared error (MSE), which are sensitive to amplitude, invariant to waveform polarity, and unbounded in scale. These properties hinder semantic alignment and reduce interpretability. SDSC addresses this by quantifying structural agreement between temporal signals based on the intersection of signed amplitudes, derived from the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).Although SDSC is defined as a structure-aware metric, it can be used as a loss by subtracting from 1 and applying a differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function for gradient-based optimization. A hybrid loss formulation is also proposed to combine SDSC with MSE, improving stability and preserving amplitude where necessary. Experiments on forecasting and classification benchmarks demonstrate that SDSC-based pre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, particularly in in-domain and low-resource scenarios. The results suggest that structural fidelity in signal representations enhances the semantic representation quality, supporting the consideration of structure-aware metrics as viable alternatives to conventional distance-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilias Tsoumas, Dimitrios Bormpoudakis, Vasileios Sitokonstantinou, Athanasios Askitopoulos, Andreas Kalogeras, Charalampos Kontoes, Ioannis Athanasiadis</p>
<p>Abstract: In causal inference, whether through randomized controlled trials or observational studies, access to both treated and control units is essential for estimating the effect of a treatment on an outcome of interest. When treatment assignment is random, the average treatment effect (ATE) can be estimated directly by comparing outcomes between groups. In non-randomized settings, various techniques are employed to adjust for confounding and approximate the counterfactual scenario to recover an unbiased ATE. A common challenge, especially in observational studies, is the absence of units clearly labeled as controls-that is, units known not to have received the treatment. To address this, we propose positive-unlabeled (PU) learning as a framework for identifying, with high confidence, control units from a pool of unlabeled ones, using only the available treated (positive) units. We evaluate this approach using both simulated and real-world data. We construct a causal graph with diverse relationships and use it to generate synthetic data under various scenarios, assessing how reliably the method recovers control groups that allow estimates of true ATE. We also apply our approach to real-world data on optimal sowing and fertilizer treatments in sustainable agriculture. Our findings show that PU learning can successfully identify control (negative) units from unlabeled data based only on treated units and, through the resulting control group, estimate an ATE that closely approximates the true value. This work has important implications for observational causal inference, especially in fields where randomized experiments are difficult or costly. In domains such as earth, environmental, and agricultural sciences, it enables a plethora of quasi-experiments by leveraging available earth observation and climate data, particularly when treated units are available but control units are lacking.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider the maximum causal entropy inverse reinforcement learning problem for infinite-horizon stationary mean-field games, in which we model the unknown reward function within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This allows the inference of rich and potentially nonlinear reward structures directly from expert demonstrations, in contrast to most existing inverse reinforcement learning approaches for mean-field games that typically restrict the reward function to a linear combination of a fixed finite set of basis functions. We also focus on the infinite-horizon cost structure, whereas prior studies primarily rely on finite-horizon formulations. We introduce a Lagrangian relaxation to this maximum causal entropy inverse reinforcement learning problem that enables us to reformulate it as an unconstrained log-likelihood maximization problem, and obtain a solution \lk{via} a gradient ascent algorithm. To illustrate the theoretical consistency of the algorithm, we establish the smoothness of the log-likelihood objective by proving the Fr\'echet differentiability of the related soft Bellman operators with respect to the parameters in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a mean-field traffic routing game, where it accurately recovers expert behavior.</p>

This paper traces the conceptual origins of self-attention across multiple domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and graph learning, through their shared reliance on an affinity matrix, denoted as A. We highlight Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS) as a foundational approach that generalizes the idea of affinity-based weighting. Unlike the fixed dot-product structure used in Transformers, Inf-FS defines A either through domain knowledge or by learning, and computes feature relevance through multi-hop propagation over the affinity graph. From this perspective, self-attention can be seen as a special case of Inf-FS: it uses a single-hop affinity computation where A is dynamically built from token similarities. We argue that the underlying structure, reasoning over pairwise relationships, is preserved across both approaches, and the key differences lie in how the affinity matrix is defined and applied. By situating self-attention within the broader paradigm of affinity-based computation, we unify several strands of machine learning research and highlight a common mathematical foundation that underpins diverse models and tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Cheng, Liang Yao, Feng He, Yukuo Cen, Yufei He, Chenhui Zhang, Wenzheng Feng, Hongyun Cai, Jie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for various graph mining tasks, yet existing scalable solutions often struggle to balance execution efficiency with prediction accuracy. These difficulties stem from iterative message-passing techniques, which place significant computational demands and require extensive GPU memory, particularly when dealing with the neighbor explosion issue inherent in large-scale graphs. This paper introduces a scalable, low-cost, flexible, and efficient GNN framework called LPS-GNN, which can perform representation learning on 100 billion graphs with a single GPU in 10 hours and shows a 13.8% improvement in User Acquisition scenarios. We examine existing graph partitioning methods and design a superior graph partition algorithm named LPMetis. In particular, LPMetis outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on various evaluation metrics. In addition, our paper proposes a subgraph augmentation strategy to enhance the model's predictive performance. It exhibits excellent compatibility, allowing the entire framework to accommodate various GNN algorithms. Successfully deployed on the Tencent platform, LPS-GNN has been tested on public and real-world datasets, achieving performance lifts of 8. 24% to 13. 89% over SOTA models in online applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haochen Liu, Jia Bi, Xiaomin Wang, Xin Yang, Ling Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in surveillance, logistics, agriculture, disaster management, and military operations. Accurate detection and classification of UAV flight states, such as hovering, cruising, ascending, or transitioning, which are essential for safe and effective operations. However, conventional time series classification (TSC) methods often lack robustness and generalization for dynamic UAV environments, while state of the art(SOTA) models like Transformers and LSTM based architectures typically require large datasets and entail high computational costs, especially with high-dimensional data streams. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates a Transformer-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with Multiple Instance Locally Explainable Learning (MILET) to address these challenges in UAV flight state classification. The Transformer encoder captures long-range temporal dependencies and complex telemetry dynamics, while the GAN module augments limited datasets with realistic synthetic samples. MIL is incorporated to focus attention on the most discriminative input segments, reducing noise and computational overhead. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy 96.5% on the DroneDetect dataset and 98.6% on the DroneRF dataset that outperforming other SOTA approaches. The framework also demonstrates strong computational efficiency and robust generalization across diverse UAV platforms and flight states, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in resource constrained environments.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14631">$k$-PCA for (non-squared) Euclidean Distances: Polynomial Time Approximation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Greenhut, Dan Feldman</p>
<p>Abstract: Given an integer $k\geq1$ and a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\REAL^d$, the classic $k$-PCA (Principle Component Analysis) approximates the affine \emph{$k$-subspace mean} of $P$, which is the $k$-dimensional affine linear subspace that minimizes its sum of squared Euclidean distances ($\ell_{2,2}$-norm) over the points of $P$, i.e., the mean of these distances. The \emph{$k$-subspace median} is the subspace that minimizes its sum of (non-squared) Euclidean distances ($\ell_{2,1}$-mixed norm), i.e., their median. The median subspace is usually more sparse and robust to noise/outliers than the mean, but also much harder to approximate since, unlike the $\ell_{z,z}$ (non-mixed) norms, it is non-convex for $k<d-1$.
  We provide the first polynomial-time deterministic algorithm whose both running time and approximation factor are not exponential in $k$. More precisely, the multiplicative approximation factor is $\sqrt{d}$, and the running time is polynomial in the size of the input. We expect that our technique would be useful for many other related problems, such as $\ell_{2,z}$ norm of distances for $z\not \in \br{1,2}$, e.g., $z=\infty$, and handling outliers/sparsity.
  Open code and experimental results on real-world datasets are also provided.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunfeng Li, Junhong Liu, Zhaohui Yang, Guofu Liao, Chuyun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models have been widely adopted for False Data Injection Attack (FDIA) detection in smart grids due to their ability to capture unstructured and sparse features. However, the increasing system scale and data dimensionality introduce significant computational and memory burdens, particularly in large-scale industrial datasets, limiting detection efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes Rec-AD, a computationally efficient framework that integrates Tensor Train decomposition with the Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM). Rec-AD enhances training and inference efficiency through embedding compression, optimized data access via index reordering, and a pipeline training mechanism that reduces memory communication overhead. Fully compatible with PyTorch, Rec-AD can be integrated into existing FDIA detection systems without code modifications. Experimental results show that Rec-AD significantly improves computational throughput and real-time detection performance, narrowing the attack window and increasing attacker cost. These advancements strengthen edge computing capabilities and scalability, providing robust technical support for smart grid security.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14677">Revisiting Graph Contrastive Learning on Anomaly Detection: A Structural Imbalance Perspective</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Xu, Zhen Peng, Bin Shi, Xu Hua, Bo Dong, Song Wang, Chen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The superiority of graph contrastive learning (GCL) has prompted its application to anomaly detection tasks for more powerful risk warning systems. Unfortunately, existing GCL-based models tend to excessively prioritize overall detection performance while neglecting robustness to structural imbalance, which can be problematic for many real-world networks following power-law degree distributions. Particularly, GCL-based methods may fail to capture tail anomalies (abnormal nodes with low degrees). This raises concerns about the security and robustness of current anomaly detection algorithms and therefore hinders their applicability in a variety of realistic high-risk scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, research on the robustness of graph anomaly detection to structural imbalance has received little scrutiny. To address the above issues, this paper presents a novel GCL-based framework named AD-GCL. It devises the neighbor pruning strategy to filter noisy edges for head nodes and facilitate the detection of genuine tail nodes by aligning from head nodes to forged tail nodes. Moreover, AD-GCL actively explores potential neighbors to enlarge the receptive field of tail nodes through anomaly-guided neighbor completion. We further introduce intra- and inter-view consistency loss of the original and augmentation graph for enhanced representation. The performance evaluation of the whole, head, and tail nodes on multiple datasets validates the comprehensive superiority of the proposed AD-GCL in detecting both head anomalies and tail anomalies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixin Xu, Zhijie Wang, Zhiyuan Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: The exponential growth of spam text on the Internet necessitates robust detection mechanisms to mitigate risks such as information leakage and social instability. This work addresses two principal challenges: adversarial strategies employed by spammers and the scarcity of labeled data. We propose a novel spam-text detection framework GCC-Spam, which integrates three core innovations. First, a character similarity network captures orthographic and phonetic features to counter character-obfuscation attacks and furthermore produces sentence embeddings for downstream classification. Second, contrastive learning enhances discriminability by optimizing the latent-space distance between spam and normal texts. Third, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) generates realistic pseudo-spam samples to alleviate data scarcity while improving model robustness and classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline approaches, achieving higher detection rates with significantly fewer labeled examples.</p>

<p>Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition plays an important role in developing adaptive brain-computer communication systems, yet faces two fundamental challenges in practical implementations: (1) effective integration of non-stationary spatial-temporal neural patterns, (2) robust adaptation to dynamic emotional intensity variations in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes SST-CL, a novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Claudio Giusti, Luca Guarnera, Mirko Casu, Sebastiano Battiato</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions remains a significant challenge, due to the extreme class imbalance in real-world data and the often subtle patterns that separate fraud from legitimate activity. Existing research commonly attempts to address this by generating synthetic samples for the minority class using approaches such as GANs, VAEs, or hybrid generative models. However, these techniques, particularly when applied only to minority-class data, tend to result in overconfident classifiers and poor latent cluster separation, ultimately limiting real-world detection performance. In this study, we propose the Causal Prototype Attention Classifier (CPAC), an interpretable architecture that promotes class-aware clustering and improved latent space structure through prototype-based attention mechanisms and we will couple it with the encoder in a VAE-GAN allowing it to offer a better cluster separation moving beyond post-hoc sample augmentation. We compared CPAC-augmented models to traditional oversamplers, such as SMOTE, as well as to state-of-the-art generative models, both with and without CPAC-based latent classifiers. Our results show that classifier-guided latent shaping with CPAC delivers superior performance, achieving an F1-score of 93.14\% percent and recall of 90.18\%, along with improved latent cluster separation. Further ablation studies and visualizations provide deeper insight into the benefits and limitations of classifier-driven representation learning for fraud detection. The codebase for this work will be available at final submission.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14715">Exploring the Dynamic Scheduling Space of Real-Time Generative AI Applications on Emerging Heterogeneous Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachid Karami, Rajeev Patwari, Hyoukjun Kwon, Ashish Sirasao</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of generative AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), into real-time multi-model AI applications such as video conferencing and gaming is giving rise to a new class of workloads: real-time generative AI (RTGen). These workloads combine the compute intensity and dynamic execution patterns of generative models with the stringent latency and concurrency constraints of real-time inference. To meet the diverse demands of RTGen workloads, modern edge platforms increasingly adopt heterogeneous system-on-chip (SoC) architectures that integrate CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs. Despite the potential of heterogeneous SoC, the scheduling space complexity and performance implications of RTGen workloads on such platforms remain underexplored. In this work, we perform a comprehensive characterization of RTGen workloads on AMD's latest heterogeneous SoC, Ryzen AI. We construct realistic multi-model scenarios inspired by industry use cases and profile model performance across all available backends. Using this data, we evaluate five scheduling policies and their impact on both real-time metrics (e.g., deadline violation rate) and LLM performance (e.g., time-to-first-token and tokens-per-second). Our results show that scheduling decisions significantly affect workload performance (e.g., leading to a 41.7% difference in deadline violation rates on average), and highlight the need for scheduling strategies that are aware of workload dynamics and hardware heterogeneity. Our findings underscore the importance of workload-aware, dynamic heterogeneous scheduling in enabling high-performance, on-device RTGen applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mat\v{e}j Kripner, Michal \v{S}ustr, Milan Straka</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated theorem proving (ATP) has been a classical problem in artificial intelligence since its inception, yet it remains challenging due to its vast state and action space. Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising heuristic for ATP, but they lack correctness guarantees and thus require interaction with a proof verifier. Such interactions typically follow one of two approaches: black-box interaction, which does not utilize intermediate proof states, or white-box approaches, which allow for incremental proof construction and examination of intermediate states. While black-box approaches have directly benefited from recent LLM advances, white-box methods have comparatively lagged behind. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing LeanTree, which consists of (i) a tool built in the Lean 4 language that factorizes complex proof states into simpler, independent branches, and (ii) a dataset of these factorized intermediate states. Our white-box tooling offers several advantages over black-box approaches: it simplifies evaluation, reduces necessary context, generates richer training data, enables parallel search across multiple states, supports efficient reuse of states, and provides feedback in case of errors. Our preliminary results hint that white-box approaches outperform black-box alternatives in some settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anushka Tiwari, Sayantan Pal, Rohini K. Srihari, Kaiyi Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning (CL) offers a parameter-efficient way to adapt large language models (LLMs) across task sequences. However, most existing methods assume task-aware inference and maintain a growing list of task-specific prompts, which limits scalability and hides latent forgetting. In this work, we introduce GRID, a unified framework that addresses two key limitations: (1) latent forgetting under task-agnostic inference, and (2) prompt memory explosion as task sequences grow. GRID integrates a task-aware decoding mechanism that improves backward transfer by leveraging representative inputs, automatic task identification, and constrained decoding. Additionally, we propose a gradient-based prompt selection strategy that compresses less informative prompts into a single aggregated representation, enabling scalable and memory-efficient lifelong learning. Extensive experiments across short-sequence, long-sequence, and negative transfer benchmarks show that GRID significantly improves backward transfer, achieves competitive forward transfer, and reduces forgotten tasks by up to 80\%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on T5 and Flan-T5 backbones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafa{\l} Surdej, Micha{\l} Bortkiewicz, Alex Lewandowski, Mateusz Ostaszewski, Clare Lyle</p>
<p>Abstract: Trainable activation functions, whose parameters are optimized alongside network weights, offer increased expressivity compared to fixed activation functions. Specifically, trainable activation functions defined as ratios of polynomials (rational functions) have been proposed to enhance plasticity in reinforcement learning. However, their impact on training stability remains unclear. In this work, we study trainable rational activations in both reinforcement and continual learning settings. We find that while their flexibility enhances adaptability, it can also introduce instability, leading to overestimation in RL and feature collapse in longer continual learning scenarios. Our main result is demonstrating a trade-off between expressivity and plasticity in rational activations. To address this, we propose a constrained variant that structurally limits excessive output scaling while preserving adaptability. Experiments across MetaWorld and DeepMind Control Suite (DMC) environments show that our approach improves training stability and performance. In continual learning benchmarks, including MNIST with reshuffled labels and Split CIFAR-100, we reveal how different constraints affect the balance between expressivity and long-term retention. While preliminary experiments in discrete action domains (e.g., Atari) did not show similar instability, this suggests that the trade-off is particularly relevant for continuous control. Together, our findings provide actionable design principles for robust and adaptable trainable activations in dynamic, non-stationary environments.

<p>Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) provides insights into which training data is responsible for a learned model behavior. Gradient-based TDA methods such as influence functions and unrolled differentiation both involve a computation that resembles an inverse Hessian-vector product (iHVP), which is difficult to approximate efficiently. We introduce an algorithm (ASTRA) which uses the EKFAC-preconditioner on Neumann series iterations to arrive at an accurate iHVP approximation for TDA. ASTRA is easy to tune, requires fewer iterations than Neumann series iterations, and is more accurate than EKFAC-based approximations. Using ASTRA, we show that improving the accuracy of the iHVP approximation can significantly improve TDA performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mustafa Cavus, Jan N. van Rijn, Przemys{\l}aw Biecek</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated machine learning systems efficiently streamline model selection but often focus on a single best-performing model, overlooking explanation uncertainty, an essential concern in human centered explainable AI. To address this, we propose a novel framework that incorporates model multiplicity into explanation generation by aggregating partial dependence profiles (PDP) from a set of near optimal models, known as the Rashomon set. The resulting Rashomon PDP captures interpretive variability and highlights areas of disagreement, providing users with a richer, uncertainty aware view of feature effects. To evaluate its usefulness, we introduce two quantitative metrics, the coverage rate and the mean width of confidence intervals, to evaluate the consistency between the standard PDP and the proposed Rashomon PDP. Experiments on 35 regression datasets from the OpenML CTR23 benchmark suite show that in most cases, the Rashomon PDP covers less than 70% of the best model's PDP, underscoring the limitations of single model explanations. Our findings suggest that Rashomon PDP improves the reliability and trustworthiness of model interpretations by adding additional information that would otherwise be neglected. This is particularly useful in high stakes domains where transparency and confidence are critical.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bach Do, Nafeezat A. Ajenifuja, Taiwo A. Adebiyi, Ruda Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: High-fidelity simulations and physical experiments are essential for engineering analysis and design. However, their high cost often limits their applications in two critical tasks: global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and optimization. This limitation motivates the common use of Gaussian processes (GPs) as proxy regression models to provide uncertainty-aware predictions based on a limited number of high-quality observations. GPs naturally enable efficient sampling strategies that support informed decision-making under uncertainty by extracting information from a subset of possible functions for the model of interest. Despite their popularity in machine learning and statistics communities, sampling from GPs has received little attention in the community of engineering optimization. In this paper, we present the formulation and detailed implementation of two notable sampling methods -- random Fourier features and pathwise conditioning -- for generating posterior samples from GPs. Alternative approaches are briefly described. Importantly, we detail how the generated samples can be applied in GSA, single-objective optimization, and multi-objective optimization. We show successful applications of these sampling methods through a series of numerical examples.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inspired by the prevalence of recurrent circuits in biological brains, we investigate the degree to which directionality is a helpful inductive bias for artificial neural networks. Taking directionality as topologically-ordered information flow between neurons, we formalise a perceptron layer with all-to-all connections (mathematically equivalent to a weight-tied recurrent neural network) and demonstrate that directionality, a hallmark of modern feed-forward networks, can be induced rather than hard-wired by applying appropriate pruning techniques. Across different random seeds our pruning schemes successfully induce greater topological ordering in information flow between neurons without compromising performance, suggesting that directionality is not a prerequisite for learning, but may be an advantageous inductive bias discoverable by gradient descent and sparsification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrik Reizinger, B\'alint Mucs\'anyi, Siyuan Guo, Benjamin Eysenbach, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf, Wieland Brendel</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised feature learning and pretraining methods in reinforcement learning (RL) often rely on information-theoretic principles, termed mutual information skill learning (MISL). These methods aim to learn a representation of the environment while also incentivizing exploration thereof. However, the role of the representation and mutual information parametrization in MISL is not yet well understood theoretically. Our work investigates MISL through the lens of identifiable representation learning by focusing on the Contrastive Successor Features (CSF) method. We prove that CSF can provably recover the environment's ground-truth features up to a linear transformation due to the inner product parametrization of the features and skill diversity in a discriminative sense. This first identifiability guarantee for representation learning in RL also helps explain the implications of different mutual information objectives and the downsides of entropy regularizers. We empirically validate our claims in MuJoCo and DeepMind Control and show how CSF provably recovers the ground-truth features both from states and pixels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehak Arora, Ayman Ali, Kaiyuan Wu, Carolyn Davis, Takashi Shimazui, Mahmoud Alwakeel, Victor Moas, Philip Yang, Annette Esper, Rishikesan Kamaleswaran</p>
<p>Abstract: In intensive care units (ICUs), patients with complex clinical conditions require vigilant monitoring and prompt interventions. Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a vital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their irregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR interpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal framework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports with high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and respiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in critically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision encoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through interpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at each hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a retrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy in forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became radiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds significant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial and diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution in prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights that can directly improve clinical outcomes.</p>

In this paper, we study whether memorization can be avoided when optimally learning a language, and whether the privacy threat posed by memorization is exaggerated or not. To this end, we re-examine existing privacy-focused measures of memorization, namely recollection-based and counterfactual memorization, along with a newly proposed contextual memorization.
  Relating memorization to local over-fitting during learning, contextual memorization aims to disentangle memorization from the contextual learning ability of LLMs. Informally, a string is contextually memorized if its recollection due to training exceeds the optimal contextual recollection, a learned threshold denoting the best contextual learning without training. Conceptually, contextual recollection avoids the fallacy of recollection-based memorization, where any form of high recollection is a sign of memorization. Theoretically, contextual memorization relates to counterfactual memorization, but imposes stronger conditions. Memorization measures differ in outcomes and information requirements.
  Experimenting on 18 LLMs from 6 families and multiple formal languages of different entropy, we show that (a) memorization measures disagree on memorization order of varying frequent strings, (b) optimal learning of a language cannot avoid partial memorization of training strings, and (c) improved learning decreases contextual and counterfactual memorization but increases recollection-based memorization. Finally, (d) we revisit existing reports of memorized strings by recollection that neither pose a privacy threat nor are contextually or counterfactually memorized.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Derek Li, Jiaming Zhou, Amirreza Kazemi, Qianyi Sun, Abbas Ghaddar, Mohammad Ali Alomrani, Liheng Ma, Yu Luo, Dong Li, Feng Wen, Jianye Hao, Mark Coates, Yingxue Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of general-purpose artificial intelligence relies on large language models (LLMs) that excel across a wide range of tasks, from structured reasoning to creative generation. However, post-training methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) often struggle with generalization, favoring memorization over transferable learning. In this work, we introduce Omni-Think, a unified reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enhances LLM performance across diverse tasks by combining rule-based verifiable rewards with generative preference signals via LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Our approach enables consistent optimization across task types and scales RL-based training to subjective domains. We further investigate training strategies, demonstrating that a curriculum-based progression that orders tasks from structured to open-ended improves performance and reduces forgetting. Experimental results across four domains reveal that curriculum learning improves performance by 5.2\% over joint training and 9.1\% over model merging. These results highlight the importance of task-aware sampling and hybrid supervision in scaling RL-based post-training for general-purpose LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erfan Pirmorad</p>
<p>Abstract: The complexity and interconnectivity of entities involved in money laundering demand investigative reasoning over graph-structured data. This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines over localized subgraphs extracted from a financial knowledge graph. We propose a lightweight pipeline that retrieves k-hop neighborhoods around entities of interest, serializes them into structured text, and prompts an LLM via few-shot in-context learning to assess suspiciousness and generate justifications. Using synthetic anti-money laundering (AML) scenarios that reflect common laundering behaviors, we show that LLMs can emulate analyst-style logic, highlight red flags, and provide coherent explanations. While this study is exploratory, it illustrates the potential of LLM-based graph reasoning in AML and lays groundwork for explainable, language-driven financial crime analytics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> T. Anderson Keller</p>
<p>Abstract: Data arrives at our senses as a continuous stream, smoothly transforming from one instant to the next. These smooth transformations can be viewed as continuous symmetries of the environment that we inhabit, defining equivalence relations between stimuli over time. In machine learning, neural network architectures that respect symmetries of their data are called equivariant and have provable benefits in terms of generalization ability and sample efficiency. To date, however, equivariance has been considered only for static transformations and feed-forward networks, limiting its applicability to sequence models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and corresponding time-parameterized sequence transformations. In this work, we extend equivariant network theory to this regime of `flows' -- one-parameter Lie subgroups capturing natural transformations over time, such as visual motion. We begin by showing that standard RNNs are generally not flow equivariant: their hidden states fail to transform in a geometrically structured manner for moving stimuli. We then show how flow equivariance can be introduced, and demonstrate that these models significantly outperform their non-equivariant counterparts in terms of training speed, length generalization, and velocity generalization, on both next step prediction and sequence classification. We present this work as a first step towards building sequence models that respect the time-parameterized symmetries which govern the world around us.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Cloud, Minh Le, James Chua, Jan Betley, Anna Sztyber-Betley, Jacob Hilton, Samuel Marks, Owain Evans</p>
<p>Abstract: We study subliminal learning, a surprising phenomenon where language models transmit behavioral traits via semantically unrelated data. In our main experiments, a "teacher" model with some trait T (such as liking owls or being misaligned) generates a dataset consisting solely of number sequences. Remarkably, a "student" model trained on this dataset learns T. This occurs even when the data is filtered to remove references to T. We observe the same effect when training on code or reasoning traces generated by the same teacher model. However, we do not observe the effect when the teacher and student have different base models. To help explain our findings, we prove a theoretical result showing that subliminal learning occurs in all neural networks under certain conditions, and demonstrate subliminal learning in a simple MLP classifier. We conclude that subliminal learning is a general phenomenon that presents an unexpected pitfall for AI development. Distillation could propagate unintended traits, even when developers try to prevent this via data filtering.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as a powerful approach for processing electronic health records (EHRs), offering flexibility to handle diverse medical data modalities. In this study, we present a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the performance, fairness, and interpretability of foundation models, both as unimodal encoders and as multimodal learners, using the publicly available MIMIC-IV database. To support consistent and reproducible evaluation, we developed a standardized data processing pipeline that harmonizes heterogeneous clinical records into an analysis-ready format. We systematically compared eight foundation models, encompassing both unimodal and multimodal models, as well as domain-specific and general-purpose variants. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating multiple data modalities leads to consistent improvements in predictive performance without introducing additional bias. Through this benchmark, we aim to support the development of effective and trustworthy multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) systems for real-world clinical applications.

<p>Abstract: We revisit previous contrastive learning frameworks to investigate the effect of introducing an adaptive margin into the contrastive loss function for time series representation learning. Specifically, we explore whether an adaptive margin (eMargin), adjusted based on a predefined similarity threshold, can improve the separation between adjacent but dissimilar time steps and subsequently lead to better performance in downstream tasks. Our study evaluates the impact of this modification on clustering performance and classification in three benchmark datasets. Our findings, however, indicate that achieving high scores on unsupervised clustering metrics does not necessarily imply that the learned embeddings are meaningful or effective in downstream tasks. To be specific, eMargin added to InfoNCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unsupervised clustering metrics, but struggles to achieve competitive results in downstream classification with linear probing.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14843">The Invisible Leash: Why RLVR May Not Escape Its Origin</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fang Wu, Weihao Xuan, Ximing Lu, Zaid Harchaoui, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models highlight Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a promising method for enhancing AI's capabilities, particularly in solving complex logical tasks. However, it remains unclear whether RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or merely amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows for improved precision. This study presents a theoretical and empirical investigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR. First, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the base model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial probability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may restrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an entropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may progressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet underrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while RLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally outweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets, failing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base model. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases token-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step, answer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain paths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken together, these findings reveal potential limits of RLVR in extending reasoning horizons. Breaking this invisible leash may require future algorithmic innovations such as explicit exploration mechanisms or hybrid strategies that seed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhan Yu, Zhunyi Feng, Junwei Lu, Tianxi Cai, Doudou Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) contain valuable clinical information for predicting patient outcomes and guiding healthcare decisions. However, effectively modeling Electronic Health Records (EHRs) requires addressing data heterogeneity and complex temporal patterns. Standard approaches often struggle with irregular time intervals between clinical events. We propose TALE-EHR, a Transformer-based framework featuring a novel time-aware attention mechanism that explicitly models continuous temporal gaps to capture fine-grained sequence dynamics. To complement this temporal modeling with robust semantics, TALE-EHR leverages embeddings derived from standardized code descriptions using a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM), providing a strong foundation for understanding clinical concepts. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV and PIC dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on tasks such as disease progression forecasting. TALE-EHR underscores the benefit of integrating explicit, continuous temporal modeling with strong semantic representations provides a powerful solution for advancing EHR analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> H. M. Sabbir Ahmad, Ehsan Sabouni, Alexander Wasilkoff, Param Budhraja, Zijian Guo, Songyuan Zhang, Chuchu Fan, Christos Cassandras, Wenchao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the problem of safe policy learning in multi-agent safety-critical autonomous systems. In such systems, it is necessary for each agent to meet the safety requirements at all times while also cooperating with other agents to accomplish the task. Toward this end, we propose a safe Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HMARL) approach based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Our proposed hierarchical approach decomposes the overall reinforcement learning problem into two levels learning joint cooperative behavior at the higher level and learning safe individual behavior at the lower or agent level conditioned on the high-level policy. Specifically, we propose a skill-based HMARL-CBF algorithm in which the higher level problem involves learning a joint policy over the skills for all the agents and the lower-level problem involves learning policies to execute the skills safely with CBFs. We validate our approach on challenging environment scenarios whereby a large number of agents have to safely navigate through conflicting road networks. Compared with existing state of the art methods, our approach significantly improves the safety achieving near perfect (within 5%) success/safety rate while also improving performance across all the environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pattern recognition with concise and flat AND-rules makes the Tsetlin Machine (TM) both interpretable and efficient, while the power of Tsetlin automata enables accuracy comparable to deep learning on an increasing number of datasets. We introduce the Graph Tsetlin Machine (GraphTM) for learning interpretable deep clauses from graph-structured input. Moving beyond flat, fixed-length input, the GraphTM gets more versatile, supporting sequences, grids, relations, and multimodality. Through message passing, the GraphTM builds nested deep clauses to recognize sub-graph patterns with exponentially fewer clauses, increasing both interpretability and data utilization. For image classification, GraphTM preserves interpretability and achieves 3.86%-points higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 than a convolutional TM. For tracking action coreference, faced with increasingly challenging tasks, GraphTM outperforms other reinforcement learning methods by up to 20.6%-points. In recommendation systems, it tolerates increasing noise to a greater extent than a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN), e.g., for noise ratio 0.1, GraphTM obtains accuracy 89.86% compared to GCN's 70.87%. Finally, for viral genome sequence data, GraphTM is competitive with BiLSTM-CNN and GCN accuracy-wise, training 2.5x faster than GCN. The GraphTM's application to these varied fields demonstrates how graph representation learning and deep clauses bring new possibilities for TM learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ganesh Sundaram, Jonas Ulmen, Amjad Haider, Daniel G\"orges</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) offer significant versatility and performance benefits, but their widespread adoption is often hindered by high model complexity and computational demands. Model compression techniques such as pruning have emerged as promising solutions to these challenges. However, it remains critical to ensure that application-specific performance characteristics are preserved during compression. In structured pruning, where groups of structurally coherent elements are removed, conventional importance metrics frequently fail to maintain these essential performance attributes. In this work, we propose an enhanced importance metric framework that not only reduces model size but also explicitly accounts for application-specific performance constraints. We employ multiple strategies to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each group, ensuring a balance between compression and task performance. Our approach is evaluated on an autoencoder tasked with reconstructing MNIST images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively preserves task-relevant performance, maintaining the model's usability even after substantial pruning, by satisfying the required application-specific criteria.</p>

<p>Abstract: One of the key obstacles in traditional deep learning is the reduction in model transparency caused by increasingly intricate model functions, which can lead to problems such as overfitting and excessive confidence in predictions. With the advent of quantum machine learning offering possible advances in computational power and latent space complexity, we notice the same opaque behavior. Despite significant research in classical contexts, there has been little advancement in addressing the black-box nature of quantum machine learning. Consequently, we approach this gap by building upon existing work in classical uncertainty quantification and initial explorations in quantum Bayesian modeling to theoretically develop and empirically evaluate techniques to map classical uncertainty quantification methods to the quantum machine learning domain. Our findings emphasize the necessity of leveraging classical insights into uncertainty quantification to include uncertainty awareness in the process of designing new quantum machine learning models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training while preserving data privacy. Despite its benefits, FL faces challenges with non-identically distributed (non-IID) data, especially in long-tailed scenarios with imbalanced class samples. Momentum-based FL methods, often used to accelerate FL convergence, struggle with these distributions, resulting in biased models and making FL hard to converge. To understand this challenge, we conduct extensive investigations into this phenomenon, accompanied by a layer-wise analysis of neural network behavior. Based on these insights, we propose FedWCM, a method that dynamically adjusts momentum using global and per-round data to correct directional biases introduced by long-tailed distributions. Extensive experiments show that FedWCM resolves non-convergence issues and outperforms existing methods, enhancing FL's efficiency and effectiveness in handling client heterogeneity and data imbalance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunfeng Li, Junhong Liu, Zhaohui Yang, Guofu Liao, Chuyun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose severe security risks to smart grids by manipulating measurement data collected from spatially distributed devices such as SCADA systems and PMUs. These measurements typically exhibit Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) characteristics across different regions, which significantly challenges the generalization ability of detection models. Traditional centralized training approaches not only face privacy risks and data sharing constraints but also incur high transmission costs, limiting their scalability and deployment feasibility. To address these issues, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed Federated Cluster Average (FedClusAvg), designed to improve FDIA detection in Non-IID and resource-constrained environments. FedClusAvg incorporates cluster-based stratified sampling and hierarchical communication (client-subserver-server) to enhance model generalization and reduce communication overhead. By enabling localized training and weighted parameter aggregation, the algorithm achieves accurate model convergence without centralizing sensitive data. Experimental results on benchmark smart grid datasets demonstrate that FedClusAvg not only improves detection accuracy under heterogeneous data distributions but also significantly reduces communication rounds and bandwidth consumption. This work provides an effective solution for secure and efficient FDIA detection in large-scale distributed power systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical across various domains, yet current approaches often limit analysis to mere binary anomaly classification without detailed categorization or further explanatory reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly (Time-RA) that transforms classical time series anomaly detection from a discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive task leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal benchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning, comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset and task pave the way for significant advancements in interpretable time series anomaly detection and reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bing He, Mustaque Ahamad, Srijan Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting bad actors is critical to ensure the safety and integrity of internet platforms. Several deep learning-based models have been developed to identify such users. These models should not only accurately detect bad actors, but also be robust against adversarial attacks that aim to evade detection. However, past deep learning-based detection models do not meet the robustness requirement because they are sensitive to even minor changes in the input sequence. To address this issue, we focus on (1) improving the model understanding capability and (2) enhancing the model knowledge such that the model can recognize potential input modifications when making predictions. To achieve these goals, we create a novel transformer-based classification model, called ROBAD (RObust adversary-aware local-global attended Bad Actor Detection model), which uses the sequence of user posts to generate user embedding to detect bad actors. Particularly, ROBAD first leverages the transformer encoder block to encode each post bidirectionally, thus building a post embedding to capture the local information at the post level. Next, it adopts the transformer decoder block to model the sequential pattern in the post embeddings by using the attention mechanism, which generates the sequence embedding to obtain the global information at the sequence level. Finally, to enrich the knowledge of the model, embeddings of modified sequences by mimicked attackers are fed into a contrastive-learning-enhanced classification layer for sequence prediction. In essence, by capturing the local and global information (i.e., the post and sequence information) and leveraging the mimicked behaviors of bad actors in training, ROBAD can be robust to adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on Yelp and Wikipedia datasets show that ROBAD can effectively detect bad actors when under state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Flow-matching policies have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generalist robotics. These models are trained to imitate an action chunk, conditioned on sensor observations and textual instructions. Often, training demonstrations are generated by a suboptimal policy, such as a human operator. This work explores training flow-matching policies via reinforcement learning to surpass the original demonstration policy performance. We particularly note minimum-time control as a key application and present a simple scheme for variable-horizon flow-matching planning. We then introduce two families of approaches: a simple Reward-Weighted Flow Matching (RWFM) scheme and a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) approach with a learned reward surrogate. Our policies are trained on an illustrative suite of simulated unicycle dynamics tasks, and we show that both approaches dramatically improve upon the suboptimal demonstrator performance, with the GRPO approach in particular generally incurring between $50\%$ and $85\%$ less cost than a naive Imitation Learning Flow Matching (ILFM) approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arkadiusz Lipiecki, Bartosz Uniejewski</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty of forecasting models is essential to assess and mitigate the risks associated with data-driven decisions, especially in volatile domains such as electricity markets. Machine learning methods can provide highly accurate electricity price forecasts, critical for informing the decisions of market participants. However, these models often lack uncertainty estimates, which limits the ability of decision makers to avoid unnecessary risks. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating probabilistic forecasts from ensembles of point forecasts, called Isotonic Quantile Regression Averaging (iQRA). Building on the established framework of Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA), we introduce stochastic order constraints to improve forecast accuracy, reliability, and computational costs. In an extensive forecasting study of the German day-ahead electricity market, we show that iQRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art postprocessing methods in terms of both reliability and sharpness. It produces well-calibrated prediction intervals across multiple confidence levels, providing superior reliability to all benchmark methods, particularly coverage-based conformal prediction. In addition, isotonic regularization decreases the complexity of the quantile regression problem and offers a hyperparameter-free approach to variable selection.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15082">Robust Control with Gradient Uncertainty</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel extension to robust control theory that explicitly addresses uncertainty in the value function's gradient, a form of uncertainty endemic to applications like reinforcement learning where value functions are approximated. We formulate a zero-sum dynamic game where an adversary perturbs both system dynamics and the value function gradient, leading to a new, highly nonlinear partial differential equation: the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs Equation with Gradient Uncertainty (GU-HJBI). We establish its well-posedness by proving a comparison principle for its viscosity solutions under a uniform ellipticity condition. Our analysis of the linear-quadratic (LQ) case yields a key insight: we prove that the classical quadratic value function assumption fails for any non-zero gradient uncertainty, fundamentally altering the problem structure. A formal perturbation analysis characterizes the non-polynomial correction to the value function and the resulting nonlinearity of the optimal control law, which we validate with numerical studies. Finally, we bridge theory to practice by proposing a novel Gradient-Uncertainty-Robust Actor-Critic (GURAC) algorithm, accompanied by an empirical study demonstrating its effectiveness in stabilizing training. This work provides a new direction for robust control, holding significant implications for fields where function approximation is common, including reinforcement learning and computational finance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiufeng Li, Shu Hong, Jian Gao, Xuan Zhang, Tian Lan, Weidong Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in AI/ML offer exciting opportunities to revolutionize analog design automation through data-driven approaches. In particular, researchers are increasingly fascinated by harnessing the power of generative AI to automate the discovery of novel analog circuit topologies. Unlocking the full potential of generative AI in these data-driven discoveries requires access to large and diverse datasets.Yet, there is a significant barrier in the analog domain--Analog circuit design is inherently proprietary, involving not only confidential circuit structures but also the underlying commercial semiconductor processes. As a result, current generative AI research is largely confined to individual researchers who construct small, narrowly focused private datasets. This fragmentation severely limits collaborative innovation and impedes progress across the research community. To address these challenges, we propose AnalogFed. AnalogFed enables collaborative topology discovery across decentralized clients (e.g., individual researchers or institutions) without requiring the sharing of raw private data. To make this vision practical, we introduce a suite of techniques tailored to the unique challenges of applying FedL in analog design--from generative model development and data heterogeneity handling to privacy-preserving strategies that ensure both flexibility and security for circuit designers and semiconductor manufacturers. Extensive experiments across varying client counts and dataset sizes demonstrate that AnalogFed achieves performance comparable to centralized baselines--while maintaining strict data privacy. Specifically, the generative AI model within AnalogFed achieves state-of-the-art efficiency and scalability in the design of analog circuit topologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youssef Allouah, Rachid Guerraoui, Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove unwanted information from trained models, initially at the individual-sample level, but increasingly at the level of entire sub-populations. In many deployments, models must delete whole topical domains to satisfy privacy, legal, or quality requirements, e.g., removing several users' posts under GDPR or copyrighted web content. Existing unlearning tools remain largely sample-oriented, and straightforward point deletion often leaves enough residual signal for downstream learners to recover the unwanted domain. We introduce distributional unlearning, a data-centric, model-agnostic framework that asks: Given examples from an unwanted distribution and a retained distribution, what is the smallest set of points whose removal makes the edited dataset far from the unwanted domain yet close to the retained one? Using Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify removal and preservation, we derive the exact Pareto frontier in the Gaussian case and prove that any model retrained on the edited data incurs log-loss shifts bounded by the divergence thresholds. We propose a simple distance-based selection rule satisfying these constraints with a quadratic reduction in deletion budget compared to random removal. Experiments on synthetic Gaussians, Jigsaw Toxic Comments, SMS spam, and CIFAR-10 show 15-72% fewer deletions than random, with negligible impact on retained performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15119">Are We Overlooking the Dimensions? Learning Latent Hierarchical Channel Structure for High-Dimensional Time Series Forecasting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Juntong Ni, Shiyu Wang, Zewen Liu, Xiaoming Shi, Xinyue Zhong, Zhou Ye, Wei Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) is a central problem in time series analysis. However, as the number of channels in time series datasets scales to the thousands or more, a scenario we define as High-Dimensional Time Series Forecasting (HDTSF), it introduces significant new modeling challenges that are often not the primary focus of traditional TSF research. HDTSF is challenging because the channel correlation often forms complex and hierarchical patterns. Existing TSF models either ignore these interactions or fail to scale as dimensionality grows. To address this issue, we propose U-Cast, a channel-dependent forecasting architecture that learns latent hierarchical channel structures with an innovative query-based attention. To disentangle highly correlated channel representation, U-Cast adds a full-rank regularization during training. We also release Time-HD, a benchmark of large, diverse, high-dimensional datasets. Our theory shows that exploiting cross-channel information lowers forecasting risk, and experiments on Time-HD demonstrate that U-Cast surpasses strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. Together, U-Cast and Time-HD provide a solid basis for future HDTSF research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joanna Komorniczak</p>
<p>Abstract: The research community continues to seek increasingly more advanced synthetic data generators to reliably evaluate the strengths and limitations of machine learning methods. This work aims to increase the availability of datasets encompassing a diverse range of problem complexities by proposing a genetic algorithm that optimizes a set of problem complexity measures for classification and regression tasks towards specific targets. For classification, a set of 10 complexity measures was used, while for regression tasks, 4 measures demonstrating promising optimization capabilities were selected. Experiments confirmed that the proposed genetic algorithm can generate datasets with varying levels of difficulty by transforming synthetically created datasets to achieve target complexity values through linear feature projections. Evaluations involving state-of-the-art classifiers and regressors revealed a correlation between the complexity of the generated data and the recognition quality.</p>

We look at an architecture in which classifiers for individual labels are fed into an expressive sequential model, which produces a joint distribution. One of the potential advantages for such an expressive model is its ability to modelling correlations, as can arise from constraints. We empirically demonstrate the ability of the architecture both to exploit constraints in training and to enforce constraints at inference time.</p>

<p>Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to push into real-time, edge-based and resource-constrained environments, there is an urgent need for novel, hardware-efficient computational models. In this study, we present and validate a neuromorphic computing architecture based on resonant-tunnelling diodes (RTDs), which exhibit the nonlinear characteristics ideal for physical reservoir computing (RC). We theoretically formulate and numerically implement an RTD-based RC system and demonstrate its effectiveness on two image recognition benchmarks: handwritten digit classification and object recognition using the Fruit~360 dataset. Our results show that this circuit-level architecture delivers promising performance while adhering to the principles of next-generation RC -- eliminating random connectivity in favour of a deterministic nonlinear transformation of input signals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Firdaus Ahmed Choudhury, Ethan Leicht, Jude Ethan Bislig, Hangzhi Guo, Amulya Yadav</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning-based decision models are increasingly being used to make decisions that significantly impact people's lives, but their opaque nature leaves end users without a clear understanding of why a decision was made. Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) have grown in popularity as a means of offering actionable guidance by identifying the minimum changes in feature values required to flip a model's prediction to something more desirable. Unfortunately, most prior research in CFEs relies on artificial evaluation metrics, such as proximity, which may overlook end-user preferences and constraints, e.g., the user's perception of effort needed to make certain feature changes may differ from that of the model designer. To address this research gap, this paper makes three novel contributions. First, we conduct a pilot study with 20 crowd-workers on Amazon MTurk to experimentally validate the alignment of existing CF evaluation metrics with real-world user preferences. Results show that user-preferred CFEs matched those based on proximity in only 63.81% of cases, highlighting the limited applicability of these metrics in real-world settings. Second, inspired by the need to design a user-informed evaluation metric for CFEs, we conduct a more detailed two-day user study with 41 participants facing realistic credit application scenarios to find experimental support for or against three intuitive hypotheses that may explain how end users evaluate CFEs. Third, based on the findings of this second study, we propose the AWP model, a novel user-centric, two-stage model that describes one possible mechanism by which users evaluate and select CFEs. Our results show that AWP predicts user-preferred CFEs with 84.37% accuracy. Our study provides the first human-centered validation for personalized cost models in CFE generation and highlights the need for adaptive, user-centered evaluation metrics.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15173">Better Models and Algorithms for Learning Ising Models from Dynamics</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Gaitonde, Ankur Moitra, Elchanan Mossel</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning the structure and parameters of the Ising model, a fundamental model of high-dimensional data, when observing the evolution of an associated Markov chain. A recent line of work has studied the natural problem of learning when observing an evolution of the well-known Glauber dynamics [Bresler, Gamarnik, Shah, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2018, Gaitonde, Mossel STOC 2024], which provides an arguably more realistic generative model than the classical i.i.d. setting. However, this prior work crucially assumes that all site update attempts are observed, \emph{even when this attempt does not change the configuration}: this strong observation model is seemingly essential for these approaches. While perhaps possible in restrictive contexts, this precludes applicability to most realistic settings where we can observe \emph{only} the stochastic evolution itself, a minimal and natural assumption for any process we might hope to learn from. However, designing algorithms that succeed in this more realistic setting has remained an open problem [Bresler, Gamarnik, Shah, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2018, Gaitonde, Moitra, Mossel, STOC 2025].
  In this work, we give the first algorithms that efficiently learn the Ising model in this much more natural observation model that only observes when the configuration changes. For Ising models with maximum degree $d$, our algorithm recovers the underlying dependency graph in time $\mathsf{poly}(d)\cdot n^2\log n$ and then the actual parameters in additional $\widetilde{O}(2^d n)$ time, which qualitatively matches the state-of-the-art even in the i.i.d. setting in a much weaker observation model. Our analysis holds more generally for a broader class of reversible, single-site Markov chains that also includes the popular Metropolis chain by leveraging more robust properties of reversible Markov chains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Turnau, Longchao Da, Khoa Vo, Ferdous Al Rafi, Shreyas Bachiraju, Tiejin Chen, Hua Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for managing urban traffic flow and reducing congestion. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers an adaptive method for TSC by responding to dynamic traffic patterns, with multi-agent RL (MARL) gaining traction as intersections naturally function as coordinated agents. However, due to shifts in environmental dynamics, implementing MARL-based TSC policies in the real world often leads to a significant performance drop, known as the sim-to-real gap. Grounded Action Transformation (GAT) has successfully mitigated this gap in single-agent RL for TSC, but real-world traffic networks, which involve numerous interacting intersections, are better suited to a MARL framework. In this work, we introduce JL-GAT, an application of GAT to MARL-based TSC that balances scalability with enhanced grounding capability by incorporating information from neighboring agents. JL-GAT adopts a decentralized approach to GAT, allowing for the scalability often required in real-world traffic networks while still capturing key interactions between agents. Comprehensive experiments on various road networks under simulated adverse weather conditions, along with ablation studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of JL-GAT.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anwar Said, Yifan Wei, Obaid Ullah Ahmad, Mudassir Shabbir, Waseem Abbas, Xenofon Koutsoukos</p>
<p>Abstract: In this article, we utilize the concept of average controllability in graphs, along with a novel rank encoding method, to enhance the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in social network classification tasks. GNNs have proven highly effective in various network-based learning applications and require some form of node features to function. However, their performance is heavily influenced by the expressiveness of these features. In social networks, node features are often unavailable due to privacy constraints or the absence of inherent attributes, making it challenging for GNNs to achieve optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose two strategies for constructing expressive node features. First, we introduce average controllability along with other centrality metrics (denoted as NCT-EFA) as node-level metrics that capture critical aspects of network topology. Building on this, we develop a rank encoding method that transforms average controllability or any other graph-theoretic metric into a fixed-dimensional feature space, thereby improving feature representation. We conduct extensive numerical evaluations using six benchmark GNN models across four social network datasets to compare different node feature construction methods. Our results demonstrate that incorporating average controllability into the feature space significantly improves GNN performance. Moreover, the proposed rank encoding method outperforms traditional one-hot degree encoding, improving the ROC AUC from 68.7% to 73.9% using GraphSAGE on the GitHub Stargazers dataset, underscoring its effectiveness in generating expressive and efficient node representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinran Li, Xiujuan Xu, Jiaqi Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is a practical and challenging task. This paper proposes a novel multimodal approach, the Long-Short Distance Graph Neural Network (LSDGNN). Based on the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), it constructs a long-distance graph neural network and a short-distance graph neural network to obtain multimodal features of distant and nearby utterances, respectively. To ensure that long- and short-distance features are as distinct as possible in representation while enabling mutual influence between the two modules, we employ a Differential Regularizer and incorporate a BiAffine Module to facilitate feature interaction. In addition, we propose an Improved Curriculum Learning (ICL) to address the challenge of data imbalance. By computing the similarity between different emotions to emphasize the shifts in similar emotions, we design a "weighted emotional shift" metric and develop a difficulty measurer, enabling a training process that prioritizes learning easy samples before harder ones. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Le Peng, Yash Travadi, Chuan He, Ying Cui, Ju Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: For classification with imbalanced class frequencies, i.e., imbalanced classification (IC), standard accuracy is known to be misleading as a performance measure. While most existing methods for IC resort to optimizing balanced accuracy (i.e., the average of class-wise recalls), they fall short in scenarios where the significance of classes varies or certain metrics should reach prescribed levels. In this paper, we study two key classification metrics, precision and recall, under three practical binary IC settings: fix precision optimize recall (FPOR), fix recall optimize precision (FROP), and optimize $F_\beta$-score (OFBS). Unlike existing methods that rely on smooth approximations to deal with the indicator function involved, \textit{we introduce, for the first time, exact constrained reformulations for these direct metric optimization (DMO) problems}, which can be effectively solved by exact penalty methods. Experiment results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the practical superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods for the three DMO problems. We also expect our exact reformulation and optimization (ERO) framework to be applicable to a wide range of DMO problems for binary IC and beyond.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rabia Latief Bhat, Iqra Altaf Gillani</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is critical for enhancing the efficiency and responsiveness of food delivery platforms, where spatial heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations in order volumes directly influence operational decisions. This paper proposes an attention-based Graph Neural Network framework that captures spatial-temporal dependencies by modeling the food delivery environment as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent urban delivery zones, while edges reflect spatial proximity and inter-regional order flow patterns derived from historical data. The attention mechanism dynamically weighs the influence of neighboring zones, enabling the model to focus on the most contextually relevant areas during prediction. Temporal trends are jointly learned alongside spatial interactions, allowing the model to adapt to evolving demand patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world food delivery datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in forecasting future order volumes with high accuracy. The framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution to support proactive fleet positioning, resource allocation, and dispatch optimization in urban food delivery operations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Han, Haotian Ye, Puheng Li, Minkai Xu, James Zou, Stefano Ermon</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have become dominant generators of high-fidelity images and videos but remain limited by their computationally expensive inference procedures. Existing acceleration techniques either require extensive model retraining or compromise significantly on sample quality. This paper explores a general, training-free, and model-agnostic acceleration strategy via multi-core parallelism. Our framework views multi-core diffusion sampling as an ODE solver pipeline, where slower yet accurate solvers progressively rectify faster solvers through a theoretically justified inter-core communication mechanism. This motivates our multi-core training-free diffusion sampling accelerator, CHORDS, which is compatible with various diffusion samplers, model architectures, and modalities. Through extensive experiments, CHORDS significantly accelerates sampling across diverse large-scale image and video diffusion models, yielding up to 2.1x speedup with four cores, improving by 50% over baselines, and 2.9x speedup with eight cores, all without quality degradation. This advancement enables CHORDS to establish a solid foundation for real-time, high-fidelity diffusion generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew J. Bryan, Felix Schwock, Azadeh Yazdan-Shahmorad, Rajesh P N Rao</p>
<p>Abstract: Closed-loop neural stimulation provides novel therapies for neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), but it is not yet clear whether artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can tailor closed-loop stimulation to individual patients or identify new therapies. Progress requires us to address a number of translational issues, including sample efficiency, training time, and minimizing loop latency such that stimulation may be shaped in response to changing brain activity. We propose temporal basis function models (TBFMs) to address these difficulties, and explore this approach in the context of excitatory optogenetic stimulation. We demonstrate the ability of TBF models to provide a single-trial, spatiotemporal forward prediction of the effect of optogenetic stimulation on local field potentials (LFPs) measured in two non-human primates. We further use simulations to demonstrate the use of TBF models for closed-loop stimulation, driving neural activity towards target patterns. The simplicity of TBF models allow them to be sample efficient, rapid to train (2-4min), and low latency (0.2ms) on desktop CPUs. We demonstrate the model on 40 sessions of previously published excitatory optogenetic stimulation data. For each session, the model required 15-20min of data collection to successfully model the remainder of the session. It achieved a prediction accuracy comparable to a baseline nonlinear dynamical systems model that requires hours to train, and superior accuracy to a linear state-space model. In our simulations, it also successfully allowed a closed-loop stimulator to control a neural circuit. Our approach begins to bridge the translational gap between complex AI-based approaches to modeling dynamical systems and the vision of using such forward prediction models to develop novel, clinically useful closed-loop stimulation protocols.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaofei Shen, Chenhao Zhang, Yawen Zhao, Alina Bialkowski, Weitong Chen, Miao Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove knowledge of the specific training data in a well-trained model. Currently, machine unlearning methods typically handle all forgetting data in a single batch, removing the corresponding knowledge all at once upon request. However, in practical scenarios, requests for data removal often arise in a streaming manner rather than in a single batch, leading to reduced efficiency and effectiveness in existing methods. Such challenges of streaming forgetting have not been the focus of much research. In this paper, to address the challenges of performance maintenance, efficiency, and data access brought about by streaming unlearning requests, we introduce a streaming unlearning paradigm, formalizing the unlearning as a distribution shift problem. We then estimate the altered distribution and propose a novel streaming unlearning algorithm to achieve efficient streaming forgetting without requiring access to the original training data. Theoretical analyses confirm an $O(\sqrt{T} + V_T)$ error bound on the streaming unlearning regret, where $V_T$ represents the cumulative total variation in the optimal solution over $T$ learning rounds. This theoretical guarantee is achieved under mild conditions without the strong restriction of convex loss function. Experiments across various models and datasets validate the performance of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elias Malomgr\'e, Pieter Simoens</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent trends in Reinforcement Learning (RL) highlight the need for agents to learn from reward-free interactions and alternative supervision signals, such as unlabeled or incomplete demonstrations, rather than relying solely on explicit reward maximization. Additionally, developing generalist agents that can adapt efficiently in real-world environments often requires leveraging these reward-free signals to guide learning and behavior. However, while intrinsic motivation techniques provide a means for agents to seek out novel or uncertain states in the absence of explicit rewards, they are often challenged by dense reward environments or the complexity of high-dimensional state and action spaces. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely directly on the unprocessed intrinsic reward signals, which can make it difficult to shape or control the agent's exploration effectively. We propose a framework that can effectively utilize expert demonstrations, even when they are incomplete and imperfect. By applying a mapping function to transform the similarity between an agent's state and expert data into a shaped intrinsic reward, our method allows for flexible and targeted exploration of expert-like behaviors. We employ a Mixture of Autoencoder Experts to capture a diverse range of behaviors and accommodate missing information in demonstrations. Experiments show our approach enables robust exploration and strong performance in both sparse and dense reward environments, even when demonstrations are sparse or incomplete. This provides a practical framework for RL in realistic settings where optimal data is unavailable and precise reward control is needed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omid G. Sani, Maryam M. Shanechi</p>
<p>Abstract: System identification methods for multivariate time-series, such as neural and behavioral recordings, have been used to build models for predicting one from the other. For example, Preferential Subspace Identification (PSID) builds a state-space model of a primary time-series (e.g., neural activity) to optimally predict a secondary time-series (e.g., behavior). However, PSID focuses on optimal prediction using past primary data, even though in offline applications, better estimation can be achieved by incorporating concurrent data (filtering) or all available data (smoothing). Here, we extend PSID to enable optimal filtering and smoothing. First, we show that the presence of a secondary signal makes it possible to uniquely identify a model with an optimal Kalman update step (to enable filtering) from a family of otherwise equivalent state-space models. Our filtering solution augments PSID with a reduced-rank regression step that directly learns the optimal gain required for the update step from data. We refer to this extension of PSID as PSID with filtering. Second, inspired by two-filter Kalman smoother formulations, we develop a novel forward-backward PSID smoothing algorithm where we first apply PSID with filtering and then apply it again in the reverse time direction on the residuals of the filtered secondary signal. We validate our methods on simulated data, showing that our approach recovers the ground-truth model parameters for filtering, and achieves optimal filtering and smoothing decoding performance of the secondary signal that matches the ideal performance of the true underlying model. This work provides a principled framework for optimal linear filtering and smoothing in the two-signal setting, significantly expanding the toolkit for analyzing dynamic interactions in multivariate time-series.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emile Anand, Sarah Liaw</p>
<p>Abstract: Thompson Sampling (TS) is widely used to address the exploration/exploitation tradeoff in contextual bandits, yet recent theory shows that it does not explore aggressively enough in high-dimensional problems. Feel-Good Thompson Sampling (FG-TS) addresses this by adding an optimism bonus that biases toward high-reward models, and it achieves the asymptotically minimax-optimal regret in the linear setting when posteriors are exact. However, its performance with \emph{approximate} posteriors -- common in large-scale or neural problems -- has not been benchmarked. We provide the first systematic study of FG-TS and its smoothed variant (SFG-TS) across eleven real-world and synthetic benchmarks. To evaluate their robustness, we compare performance across settings with exact posteriors (linear and logistic bandits) to approximate regimes produced by fast but coarse stochastic-gradient samplers. Ablations over preconditioning, bonus scale, and prior strength reveal a trade-off: larger bonuses help when posterior samples are accurate, but hurt when sampling noise dominates. FG-TS generally outperforms vanilla TS in linear and logistic bandits, but tends to be weaker in neural bandits. Nevertheless, because FG-TS and its variants are competitive and easy-to-use, we recommend them as baselines in modern contextual-bandit benchmarks. Finally, we provide source code for all our experiments in https://github.com/SarahLiaw/ctx-bandits-mcmc-showdown.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Zhang, Kong Chen, Yuen Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately and comprehensively representing crystal structures is critical for advancing machine learning in large-scale crystal materials simulations, however, effectively capturing and leveraging the intricate geometric and topological characteristics of crystal structures remains a core, long-standing challenge for most existing methods in crystal property prediction. Here, we propose MGT, a multi-view graph transformer framework that synergistically fuses SE3 invariant and SO3 equivariant graph representations, which respectively captures rotation-translation invariance and rotation equivariance in crystal geometries. To strategically incorporate these complementary geometric representations, we employ a lightweight mixture of experts router in MGT to adaptively adjust the weight assigned to SE3 and SO3 embeddings based on the specific target task. Compared with previous state-of-the-art models, MGT reduces the mean absolute error by up to 21% on crystal property prediction tasks through multi-task self-supervised pretraining. Ablation experiments and interpretable investigations confirm the effectiveness of each technique implemented in our framework. Additionally, in transfer learning scenarios including crystal catalyst adsorption energy and hybrid perovskite bandgap prediction, MGT achieves performance improvements of up to 58% over existing baselines, demonstrating domain-agnostic scalability across diverse application domains. As evidenced by the above series of studies, we believe that MGT can serve as useful model for crystal material property prediction, providing a valuable tool for the discovery of novel materials.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15336">Beyond Model Base Selection: Weaving Knowledge to Master Fine-grained Neural Network Design</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialiang Wang, Hanmo Liu, Shimin Di, Zhili Wang, Jiachuan Wang, Lei Chen, Xiaofang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Database systems have recently advocated for embedding machine learning (ML) capabilities, offering declarative model queries over large, managed model repositories, thereby circumventing the huge computational overhead of traditional ML-based algorithms in automated neural network model selection. Pioneering database studies aim to organize existing benchmark repositories as model bases (MB), querying them for the model records with the highest performance estimation metrics for given tasks. However, this static model selection practice overlooks the fine-grained, evolving relational dependencies between diverse task queries and model architecture variations, resulting in suboptimal matches and failing to further refine the model effectively. To fill the model refinement gap in database research, we propose M-DESIGN, a curated model knowledge base (MKB) pipeline for mastering neural network refinement by adaptively weaving prior insights about model architecture modification. First, we propose a knowledge weaving engine that reframes model refinement as an adaptive query problem over task metadata. Given a user's task query, M-DESIGN quickly matches and iteratively refines candidate models by leveraging a graph-relational knowledge schema that explicitly encodes data properties, architecture variations, and pairwise performance deltas as joinable relations. This schema supports fine-grained relational analytics over architecture tweaks and drives a predictive query planner that can detect and adapt to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. We instantiate M-DESIGN for graph analytics tasks, where our model knowledge base enriches existing benchmarks with structured metadata covering 3 graph tasks and 22 graph datasets, contributing data records of 67,760 graph models. Empirical results demonstrate that M-DESIGN delivers the optimal model in 26 of 33 data-task pairs within limited budgets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehua Cheng, Rui Sun, Jiahao Sun, Yike Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning the large language models (LLMs) are prevented by the deficiency of centralized control and the massive computing and communication overhead on the decentralized schemes. While the typical standard federated learning (FL) supports data privacy, the central server requirement creates a single point of attack and vulnerability to poisoning attacks. Generalizing the result in this direction to 70B-parameter models in the heterogeneous, trustless environments has turned out to be a huge, yet unbroken bottleneck. This paper introduces FLock, a decentralized framework for secure and efficient collaborative LLM fine-tuning. Integrating a blockchain-based trust layer with economic incentives, FLock replaces the central aggregator with a secure, auditable protocol for cooperation among untrusted parties. We present the first empirical validation of fine-tuning a 70B LLM in a secure, multi-domain, decentralized setting. Our experiments show the FLock framework defends against backdoor poisoning attacks that compromise standard FL optimizers and fosters synergistic knowledge transfer. The resulting models show a >68% reduction in adversarial attack success rates. The global model also demonstrates superior cross-domain generalization, outperforming models trained in isolation on their own specialized data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julia Machnio, Mads Nielsen, Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi</p>
<p>Abstract: Active learning (AL) seeks to reduce annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples for labeling, making it particularly valuable in resource-constrained settings. However, traditional evaluation methods, which focus solely on final accuracy, fail to capture the full dynamics of the learning process. To address this gap, we propose PALM (Performance Analysis of Active Learning Models), a unified and interpretable mathematical model that characterizes AL trajectories through four key parameters: achievable accuracy, coverage efficiency, early-stage performance, and scalability. PALM provides a predictive description of AL behavior from partial observations, enabling the estimation of future performance and facilitating principled comparisons across different strategies. We validate PALM through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-50/100/200, covering a wide range of AL methods and self-supervised embeddings. Our results demonstrate that PALM generalizes effectively across datasets, budgets, and strategies, accurately predicting full learning curves from limited labeled data. Importantly, PALM reveals crucial insights into learning efficiency, data space coverage, and the scalability of AL methods. By enabling the selection of cost-effective strategies and predicting performance under tight budget constraints, PALM lays the basis for more systematic, reproducible, and data-efficient evaluation of AL in both research and real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juntao Wang, Feng Yin, Tian Ding, Tsung-Hui Chang, Zhi-Quan Luo, Qi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Gridization, the process of partitioning space into grids where users share similar channel characteristics, serves as a fundamental prerequisite for efficient large-scale network optimization. However, existing methods like Geographical or Beam Space Gridization (GSG or BSG) are limited by reliance on unavailable location data or the flawed assumption that similar signal strengths imply similar channel properties. We propose Channel Space Gridization (CSG), a pioneering framework that unifies channel estimation and gridization for the first time. Formulated as a joint optimization problem, CSG uses only beam-level reference signal received power (RSRP) to estimate Channel Angle Power Spectra (CAPS) and partition samples into grids with homogeneous channel characteristics. To perform CSG, we develop the CSG Autoencoder (CSG-AE), featuring a trainable RSRP-to-CAPS encoder, a learnable sparse codebook quantizer, and a physics-informed decoder based on the Localized Statistical Channel Model. On recognizing the limitations of naive training scheme, we propose a novel Pretraining-Initialization-Detached-Asynchronous (PIDA) training scheme for CSG-AE, ensuring stable and effective training by systematically addressing the common pitfalls of the naive training paradigm. Evaluations reveal that CSG-AE excels in CAPS estimation accuracy and clustering quality on synthetic data. On real-world datasets, it reduces Active Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 30\% and Overall MAE by 65\% on RSRP prediction accuracy compared to salient baselines using the same data, while improving channel consistency, cluster sizes balance, and active ratio, advancing the development of gridization for large-scale network optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Scott Pesme, Giacomo Meanti, Michael Arbel, Julien Mairal</p>
<p>Abstract: Denoiser models have become powerful tools for inverse problems, enabling the use of pretrained networks to approximate the score of a smoothed prior distribution. These models are often used in heuristic iterative schemes aimed at solving Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) optimisation problems, where the proximal operator of the negative log-prior plays a central role. In practice, this operator is intractable, and practitioners plug in a pretrained denoiser as a surrogate-despite the lack of general theoretical justification for this substitution. In this work, we show that a simple algorithm, closely related to several used in practice, provably converges to the proximal operator under a log-concavity assumption on the prior $p$. We show that this algorithm can be interpreted as a gradient descent on smoothed proximal objectives. Our analysis thus provides a theoretical foundation for a class of empirically successful but previously heuristic methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Gracyk</p>
<p>Abstract: We offer a theoretical mathematical background to Transformers through Lagrangian optimization across the token space. The Transformer, as a flow map, exists in the tangent fiber for each token along the high-dimensional unit sphere. The circumstance of the hypersphere across the latent data is reasonable due to the trained diagonal matrix equal to the identity, which has various empirical justifications. Thus, under the continuum limit of the dynamics, the latent vectors flow among the tangent bundle. Using these facts, we devise a mathematical framework for the Transformer through calculus of variations. We develop a functional and show that the continuous flow map induced by the Transformer satisfies this functional, therefore the Transformer can be viewed as a natural solver of a calculus of variations problem. We invent new scenarios of when our methods are applicable based on loss optimization with respect to path optimality. We derive the Euler-Lagrange equation for the Transformer. The variant of the Euler-Lagrange equation we present has various appearances in literature, but, to our understanding, oftentimes not foundationally proven or under other specialized cases. Our overarching proof is new: our techniques are classical and the use of the flow map object is original. We provide several other relevant results, primarily ones specific to neural scenarios. In particular, much of our analysis will be attempting to quantify Transformer data in variational contexts under neural approximations. Calculus of variations on manifolds is a well-nourished research area, but for the Transformer specifically, it is uncharted: we lay the foundation for this area through an introduction to the Lagrangian for the Transformer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Owen Douglas, Aku Kammonen, Anamika Pandey, Ra\'ul Tempone</p>
<p>Abstract: This work proposes a training algorithm based on adaptive random Fourier features (ARFF) with Metropolis sampling and resampling \cite{kammonen2024adaptiverandomfourierfeatures} for learning drift and diffusion components of stochastic differential equations from snapshot data. Specifically, this study considers It\^{o} diffusion processes and a likelihood-based loss function derived from the Euler-Maruyama integration introduced in \cite{Dietrich2023} and \cite{dridi2021learningstochasticdynamicalsystems}.
  This work evaluates the proposed method against benchmark problems presented in \cite{Dietrich2023}, including polynomial examples, underdamped Langevin dynamics, a stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered model, and a stochastic wave equation. Across all cases, the ARFF-based approach matches or surpasses the performance of conventional Adam-based optimization in both loss minimization and convergence speed. These results highlight the potential of ARFF as a compelling alternative for data-driven modeling of stochastic dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baran Can G\"ul, Suraksha Nadig, Stefanos Tziampazis, Nasser Jazdi, Michael Weyrich</p>
<p>Abstract: In-vehicle emotion recognition underpins adaptive driver-assistance systems and, ultimately, occupant safety. However, practical deployment is hindered by (i) modality fragility - poor lighting and occlusions degrade vision-based methods; (ii) physiological variability - heart-rate and skin-conductance patterns differ across individuals; and (iii) privacy risk - centralized training requires transmission of sensitive data. To address these challenges, we present FedMultiEmo, a privacy-preserving framework that fuses two complementary modalities at the decision level: visual features extracted by a Convolutional Neural Network from facial images, and physiological cues (heart rate, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature) classified by a Random Forest. FedMultiEmo builds on three key elements: (1) a multimodal federated learning pipeline with majority-vote fusion, (2) an end-to-end edge-to-cloud prototype on Raspberry Pi clients and a Flower server, and (3) a personalized Federated Averaging scheme that weights client updates by local data volume. Evaluated on FER2013 and a custom physiological dataset, the federated Convolutional Neural Network attains 77% accuracy, the Random Forest 74%, and their fusion 87%, matching a centralized baseline while keeping all raw data local. The developed system converges in 18 rounds, with an average round time of 120 seconds and a per-client memory footprint below 200 MB. These results indicate that FedMultiEmo offers a practical approach to real-time, privacy-aware emotion recognition in automotive settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes Ackermann, Takashi Ishida, Masashi Sugiyama</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) allows us to train models, such as language models (LMs), to follow complex human preferences. In RLHF for LMs, we first train an LM using supervised fine-tuning, sample pairs of responses, obtain human feedback, and use the resulting data to train a reward model (RM). RL methods are then used to train the LM to maximize the reward given by the RM. As training progresses, the responses generated by the LM no longer resemble the responses seen by the RM during training, leading to the RM becoming inaccurate. The score given by the RM keeps increasing, but the learned behavior no longer matches the human preferences. This issue is known as overoptimization. We investigate overoptimization from the point of view of distribution shift and show that the shift results in an inconsistent estimate of the RM parameters, leading to an inconsistent estimate of the policy gradient. We propose Off-Policy Corrected Reward Modeling (OCRM), which iteratively off-policy corrects the RM using importance weighting, without requiring new labels or samples. This results in a more accurate RM, which empirically leads to an improved final policy. We validate our approach in experiments with summarization and chatbot datasets and show that it performs significantly better than standard RLHF methods and baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weichuang Shao, Iman Yi Liao, Tomas Henrique Bode Maul, Tissa Chandesa</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain shift is a prominent problem in Deep Learning, causing a model pre-trained on a source dataset to suffer significant performance degradation on test datasets. This research aims to address the issue of audio classification under domain shift caused by background noise using Test-Time Adaptation (TTA), a technique that adapts a pre-trained model during testing using only unlabelled test data before making predictions. We adopt two common TTA methods, TTT and TENT, and a state-of-the-art method CoNMix, and investigate their respective performance on two popular audio classification datasets, AudioMNIST (AM) and SpeechCommands V1 (SC), against different types of background noise and noise severity levels. The experimental results reveal that our proposed modified version of CoNMix produced the highest classification accuracy under domain shift (5.31% error rate under 10 dB exercise bike background noise and 12.75% error rate under 3 dB running tap background noise for AM) compared to TTT and TENT. The literature search provided no evidence of similar works, thereby motivating the work reported here as the first study to leverage TTA techniques for audio classification under domain shift.</p>

This enables Data Aware Differentiable Neural Architecture Search to co-optimize model architecture and input data characteristics, effectively balancing resource usage and system performance for TinyML applications.

<p>Abstract: Background: Radiomics shows promise in characterizing glioblastoma, but its added value over clinical and molecular predictors has yet to be proven. This study assessed the added value of conventional radiomics (CR) and deep learning (DL) MRI radiomics for glioblastoma prognosis (<= 6 vs > 6 months survival) on a large multi-center dataset.
  Methods: After patient selection, our curated dataset gathers 1152 glioblastoma (WHO 2016) patients from five Swiss centers and one public source. It included clinical (age, gender), molecular (MGMT, IDH), and baseline MRI data (T1, T1 contrast, FLAIR, T2) with tumor regions. CR and DL models were developed using standard methods and evaluated on internal and external cohorts. Sub-analyses assessed models with different feature sets (imaging-only, clinical/molecular-only, combined-features) and patient subsets (S-1: all patients, S-2: with molecular data, S-3: IDH wildtype).
  Results: The best performance was observed in the full cohort (S-1). In external validation, the combined-feature CR model achieved an AUC of 0.75, slightly, but significantly outperforming clinical-only (0.74) and imaging-only (0.68) models. DL models showed similar trends, though without statistical significance. In S-2 and S-3, combined models did not outperform clinical-only models. Exploratory analysis of CR models for overall survival prediction suggested greater relevance of imaging data: across all subsets, combined-feature models significantly outperformed clinical-only models, though with a modest advantage of 2-4 C-index points.
  Conclusions: While confirming the predictive value of anatomical MRI sequences for glioblastoma prognosis, this multi-center study found standard CR and DL radiomics approaches offer minimal added value over demographic predictors such as age and gender.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating the scientific discovery capabilities of large language model based agents, particularly how they cope with varying environmental complexity and utilize prior knowledge, requires specialized benchmarks currently lacking in the landscape. To address this gap, we introduce PhysGym, a novel benchmark suite and simulation platform for rigorously assessing LLM-based scientific reasoning in interactive physics environments. PhysGym's primary contribution lies in its sophisticated control over the level of prior knowledge provided to the agent. This allows researchers to dissect agent performance along axes including the complexity of the problem and the prior knowledge levels. The benchmark comprises a suite of interactive simulations, where agents must actively probe environments, gather data sequentially under constraints and formulate hypotheses about underlying physical laws. PhysGym provides standardized evaluation protocols and metrics for assessing hypothesis accuracy and model fidelity. We demonstrate the benchmark's utility by presenting results from baseline LLMs, showcasing its ability to differentiate capabilities based on varying priors and task complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pieter Smet, Martina Doneda, Ettore Lanzarone, Giuliana Carello</p>
<p>Abstract: The availability of downstream resources plays a critical role in planning the admission of patients undergoing elective surgery, with inpatient beds being one of the most crucial resources. When planning patient admissions, predictions on their length-of-stay (LOS) made by machine learning (ML) models are used to ensure bed availability. However, the actual LOS for each patient may differ considerably from the predicted value, potentially making the schedule infeasible. To address such infeasibilities, rescheduling strategies that take advantage of operational flexibility can be implemented. For example, adjustments may include postponing admission dates, relocating patients to different wards, or even transferring patients who are already admitted. The common assumption is that more accurate LOS predictions reduce the impact of rescheduling. However, training ML models that can make such accurate predictions can be costly. Building on previous work that proposed simulated \ac{ml} for evaluating data-driven approaches, this paper explores the relationship between LOS prediction accuracy and rescheduling flexibility across various corrective policies. Specifically, we examine the most effective patient rescheduling strategies under LOS prediction errors to prevent bed overflows while optimizing resource utilization.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of satellite constellations in near-Earth orbits presents significant challenges in satellite network management, requiring innovative approaches for efficient, scalable, and resilient operations. This paper explores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in optimizing the operation of satellite mega-constellations, drawing from the ConstellAI project funded by the European Space Agency (ESA). A consortium comprising GMV GmbH, Saarland University, and Thales Alenia Space collaborates to develop AI-driven algorithms and demonstrates their effectiveness over traditional methods for two crucial operational challenges: data routing and resource allocation. In the routing use case, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to improve the end-to-end latency by learning from historical queuing latency, outperforming classical shortest path algorithms. For resource allocation, RL optimizes the scheduling of tasks across constellations, focussing on efficiently using limited resources such as battery and memory. Both use cases were tested for multiple satellite constellation configurations and operational scenarios, resembling the real-life spacecraft operations of communications and Earth observation satellites. This research demonstrates that RL not only competes with classical approaches but also offers enhanced flexibility, scalability, and generalizability in decision-making processes, which is crucial for the autonomous and intelligent management of satellite fleets. The findings of this activity suggest that AI can fundamentally alter the landscape of satellite constellation management by providing more adaptive, robust, and cost-effective solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the continuous proposal of new anomaly detection algorithms and extensive benchmarking efforts, progress seems to stagnate, with only minor performance differences between established baselines and new algorithms. In this position paper, we argue that this stagnation is due to limitations in how we evaluate anomaly detection algorithms. Current benchmarking does not, for example, sufficiently reflect the diversity of anomalies in applications ranging from predictive maintenance to scientific discovery. Consequently, we need to rethink benchmarking in anomaly detection. In our opinion, anomaly detection should be studied using scenarios that capture the relevant characteristics of different applications. We identify three key areas for improvement: First, we need to identify anomaly detection scenarios based on a common taxonomy. Second, anomaly detection pipelines should be analyzed end-to-end and by component. Third, evaluating anomaly detection algorithms should be meaningful regarding the scenario's objectives.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current research on decision-making in safety-critical scenarios often relies on inefficient data-driven scenario generation or specific modeling approaches, which fail to capture corner cases in real-world contexts. To address this issue, we propose a Red-Team Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework, where background vehicles with interference capabilities are treated as red-team agents. Through active interference and exploration, red-team vehicles can uncover corner cases outside the data distribution. The framework uses a Constraint Graph Representation Markov Decision Process, ensuring that red-team vehicles comply with safety rules while continuously disrupting the autonomous vehicles (AVs). A policy threat zone model is constructed to quantify the threat posed by red-team vehicles to AVs, inducing more extreme actions to increase the danger level of the scenario. Experimental results show that the proposed framework significantly impacts AVs decision-making safety and generates various corner cases. This method also offers a novel direction for research in safety-critical scenarios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15601">Optimal Batch-Size Control for Low-Latency Federated Learning with Device Heterogeneity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiling Yang, Zhanwei Wang, Kaibin Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular approach for collaborative machine learning in sixth-generation (6G) networks, primarily due to its privacy-preserving capabilities. The deployment of FL algorithms is expected to empower a wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, e.g., autonomous driving, augmented reality, and healthcare. The mission-critical and time-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of low-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In practice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of computing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the heterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across devices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework for optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency while ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental C$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis. Specifically, increasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and thus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but results in higher per-round latency, and vice versa. The associated problem of latency minimization is intractable; however, we solve it by designing an accurate and tractable surrogate for convergence speed, with parameters fitted to real data. This approach yields two batch-size control strategies tailored to scenarios with slow and fast fading, while also accommodating device heterogeneity. Extensive experiments using real datasets demonstrate that the proposed strategies outperform conventional batch-size adaptation schemes that do not consider the C$^2$ tradeoff or device heterogeneity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edward Holmberg, Pujan Pokhrel, Maximilian Zoch, Elias Ioup, Ken Pathak, Steven Sloan, Kendall Niles, Jay Ratcliff, Maik Flanagin, Christian Guetl, Julian Simeonov, Mahdi Abdelguerfi</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-based solvers like HEC-RAS provide high-fidelity river forecasts but are too computationally intensive for on-the-fly decision-making during flood events. The central challenge is to accelerate these simulations without sacrificing accuracy. This paper introduces a deep learning surrogate that treats HEC-RAS not as a solver but as a data-generation engine. We propose a hybrid, auto-regressive architecture that combines a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to capture short-term temporal dynamics with a Geometry-Aware Fourier Neural Operator (Geo-FNO) to model long-range spatial dependencies along a river reach. The model learns underlying physics implicitly from a minimal eight-channel feature vector encoding dynamic state, static geometry, and boundary forcings extracted directly from native HEC-RAS files. Trained on 67 reaches of the Mississippi River Basin, the surrogate was evaluated on a year-long, unseen hold-out simulation. Results show the model achieves a strong predictive accuracy, with a median absolute stage error of 0.31 feet. Critically, for a full 67-reach ensemble forecast, our surrogate reduces the required wall-clock time from 139 minutes to 40 minutes, a speedup of nearly 3.5 times over the traditional solver. The success of this data-driven approach demonstrates that robust feature engineering can produce a viable, high-speed replacement for conventional hydraulic models, improving the computational feasibility of large-scale ensemble flood forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kailai Yang, Xiao Liu, Lei Ji, Hao Li, Yeyun Gong, Peng Cheng, Mao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual pre-training on small-scale task-specific data is an effective method for improving large language models in new target fields, yet it risks catastrophic forgetting of their original capabilities. A common solution is to re-weight training data mixtures from source and target fields on a domain space to achieve balanced performance. Previous domain reweighting strategies rely on manual designation with certain heuristics based on human intuition or empirical results. In this work, we prove that more general heuristics can be parameterized by proposing Data Mixing Agent, the first model-based, end-to-end framework that learns to re-weight domains. The agent learns generalizable heuristics through reinforcement learning on large quantities of data mixing trajectories with corresponding feedback from an evaluation environment. Experiments in continual pre-training on math reasoning show that Data Mixing Agent outperforms strong baselines in achieving balanced performance across source and target field benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes well across unseen source fields, target models, and domain spaces without retraining. Direct application to the code generation field also indicates its adaptability across target domains. Further analysis showcases the agents' well-aligned heuristics with human intuitions and their efficiency in achieving superior model performance with less source-field data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Shared mobility systems, such as bike-sharing networks, play a crucial role in urban transportation. Identifying anomalies in these systems is essential for optimizing operations, improving service reliability, and enhancing user experience. This paper presents an interpretable anomaly detection framework that integrates multi-source data, including bike-sharing trip records, weather conditions, and public transit availability. The Isolation Forest algorithm is employed for unsupervised anomaly detection, along with the Depth-based Isolation Forest Feature Importance (DIFFI) algorithm providing interpretability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amine Mohamed Aboussalah, Abdessalam Ed-dib</p>
<p>Abstract: The fundamental laws of physics are intrinsically geometric, dictating the evolution of systems through principles of symmetry and conservation. While modern machine learning offers powerful tools for modeling complex dynamics from data, common methods often ignore this underlying geometric fabric. Physics-informed neural networks, for instance, can violate fundamental physical principles, leading to predictions that are unstable over long periods, particularly for high-dimensional and chaotic systems. Here, we introduce \textit{Geometric Hamiltonian Neural Networks (GeoHNN)}, a framework that learns dynamics by explicitly encoding the geometric priors inherent to physical laws. Our approach enforces two fundamental structures: the Riemannian geometry of inertia, by parameterizing inertia matrices in their natural mathematical space of symmetric positive-definite matrices, and the symplectic geometry of phase space, using a constrained autoencoder to ensure the preservation of phase space volume in a reduced latent space. We demonstrate through experiments on systems ranging from coupled oscillators to high-dimensional deformable objects that GeoHNN significantly outperforms existing models. It achieves superior long-term stability, accuracy, and energy conservation, confirming that embedding the geometry of physics is not just a theoretical appeal but a practical necessity for creating robust and generalizable models of the physical world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Cederle, Andrea Mazzucco, Andrea Demartini, Eugenio Mazza, Eugenia Suriani, Federico Vitti, Gian Antonio Susto</p>
<p>Abstract: Electric vehicles (EV) charging stations are one of the critical infrastructures needed to support the transition to renewable-energy-based mobility, but ensuring their reliability and efficiency requires effective anomaly detection to identify irregularities in charging behavior. However, in such a productive scenario, it is also crucial to determine the underlying cause behind the detected anomalies. To achieve this goal, this study investigates unsupervised anomaly detection techniques for EV charging infrastructure, integrating eXplainable Artificial Intelligence techniques to enhance interpretability and uncover root causes of anomalies.
  Using real-world sensors and charging session data, this work applies Isolation Forest to detect anomalies and employs the Depth-based Isolation Forest Feature Importance (DIFFI) method to identify the most important features contributing to such anomalies. The efficacy of the proposed approach is evaluated in a real industrial case.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuchuang Wang, Bo Sun, Hedyeh Beyhaghi, John C. S. Lui, Mohammad Hajiesmaili, Adam Wierman</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-agent ski-rental problem that generalizes the classical ski-rental dilemma to a group setting where agents incur individual and shared costs. In our model, each agent can either rent at a fixed daily cost, or purchase a pass at an individual cost, with an additional third option of a discounted group pass available to all. We consider scenarios in which agents' active days differ, leading to dynamic states as agents drop out of the decision process. To address this problem from different perspectives, we define three distinct competitive ratios: overall, state-dependent, and individual rational. For each objective, we design and analyze optimal deterministic and randomized policies. Our deterministic policies employ state-aware threshold functions that adapt to the dynamic states, while our randomized policies sample and resample thresholds from tailored state-aware distributions. The analysis reveals that symmetric policies, in which all agents use the same threshold, outperform asymmetric ones. Our results provide competitive ratio upper and lower bounds and extend classical ski-rental insights to multi-agent settings, highlighting both theoretical and practical implications for group decision-making under uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad M. Nazar, Abdulkadir Celik, Mohamed Y. Selim, Asmaa Abdallah, Daji Qiao, Ahmed M. Eltawil</p>
<p>Abstract: Vehicular communication systems operating in the millimeter wave (mmWave) band are highly susceptible to signal blockage from dynamic obstacles such as vehicles, pedestrians, and infrastructure. To address this challenge, we propose a proactive blockage prediction framework that utilizes multi-modal sensing, including camera, GPS, LiDAR, and radar inputs in an infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) setting. This approach uses modality-specific deep learning models to process each sensor stream independently and fuses their outputs using a softmax-weighted ensemble strategy based on validation performance. Our evaluations, for up to 1.5s in advance, show that the camera-only model achieves the best standalone trade-off with an F1-score of 97.1% and an inference time of 89.8ms. A camera+radar configuration further improves accuracy to 97.2% F1 at 95.7ms. Our results display the effectiveness and efficiency of multi-modal sensing for mmWave blockage prediction and provide a pathway for proactive wireless communication in dynamic environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting stress in plants is crucial for both open-farm and controlled-environment agriculture. Biomolecules within plants serve as key stress indicators, offering vital markers for continuous health monitoring and early disease detection. Raman spectroscopy provides a powerful, non-invasive means to quantify these biomolecules through their molecular vibrational signatures. However, traditional Raman analysis relies on customized data-processing workflows that require fluorescence background removal and prior identification of Raman peaks of interest-introducing potential biases and inconsistencies. Here, we introduce DIVA (Deep-learning-based Investigation of Vibrational Raman spectra for plant-stress Analysis), a fully automated workflow based on a variational autoencoder. Unlike conventional approaches, DIVA processes native Raman spectra-including fluorescence backgrounds-without manual preprocessing, identifying and quantifying significant spectral features in an unbiased manner. We applied DIVA to detect a range of plant stresses, including abiotic (shading, high light intensity, high temperature) and biotic stressors (bacterial infections). By integrating deep learning with vibrational spectroscopy, DIVA paves the way for AI-driven plant health assessment, fostering more resilient and sustainable agricultural practices.</p>

<p>Abstract: While boundaries between data modalities are vanishing, the usual successful deep models are still challenged by simple ones in the time-series forecasting task. Our hypothesis is that this task needs models that are able to learn the data underlying dynamics. We propose to validate it through both systemic and empirical studies. We develop an original $\texttt{PRO-DYN}$ nomenclature to analyze existing models through the lens of dynamics. Two observations thus emerged: $\textbf{1}$. under-performing architectures learn dynamics at most partially, $\textbf{2}$. the location of the dynamics block at the model end is of prime importance. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm our observations on a set of performance-varying models with diverse backbones. Results support the need to incorporate a learnable dynamics block and its use as the final predictor.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15784">Graph Attention Specialized Expert Fusion Model for Node Classification: Based on Cora and Pubmed Datasets</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihang Ma, Qitian Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph node classification is a fundamental task in graph neural networks (GNNs), aiming to assign predefined class labels to nodes. On the PubMed citation network dataset, we observe significant classification difficulty disparities, with Category 2 achieving only 74.4% accuracy in traditional GCN, 7.5% lower than Category 1. To address this, we propose a Wasserstein-Rubinstein (WR) distance enhanced Expert Fusion Model (WR-EFM), training specialized GNN models for Categories 0/1 (with layer normalization and residual connections) and Multi-hop Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for Category 2. The WR distance metric optimizes representation similarity between models, particularly focusing on improving Category 2 performance. Our adaptive fusion strategy dynamically weights models based on category-specific performance, with Category 2 assigned a GAT weight of 0.8. WR distance further guides the fusion process by measuring distributional differences between model representations, enabling more principled integration of complementary features.
  Experimental results show WR-EFM achieves balanced accuracy across categories: 77.8% (Category 0), 78.0% (Category 1), and 79.9% (Category 2), outperforming both single models and standard fusion approaches. The coefficient of variation (CV) of WR-EFM's category accuracies is 0.013, 77.6% lower than GCN's 0.058, demonstrating superior stability. Notably, WR-EFM improves Category 2 accuracy by 5.5% compared to GCN, verifying the effectiveness of WR-guided fusion in capturing complex structural patterns. This work provides a novel paradigm for handling class-imbalanced graph classification tasks. To promote the research community, we release our project at https://github.com/s010m00n/GASEM4NC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sneheel Sarangi, Hanan Salam</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent capabilities in complex reasoning, largely spurred by rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques applied during the post-training. This has raised the question of whether similar methods can instill more nuanced, human-like social intelligence, such as a Theory of Mind (ToM), in LLMs. This paper investigates whether small-scale LLMs can acquire a robust and generalizable ToM capability through RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We conduct a systematic evaluation by training models on various combinations of prominent ToM datasets (HiToM, ExploreToM, FANToM) and testing for generalization on held-out datasets (e.g., OpenToM). Our findings indicate that small LLMs struggle to develop a generic ToM capability. While performance on in-distribution tasks improves, this capability fails to transfer to unseen ToM tasks with different characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prolonged RL training leads to models ``hacking'' the statistical patterns of the training datasets, resulting in significant performance gains on in-domain data but no change, or degradation of performance on out-of-distribution tasks. This suggests the learned behavior is a form of narrow overfitting rather than the acquisition of a true, abstract ToM capability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujia Mu, Cong Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is one of the popular distributed machine learning (ML) solutions but incurs significant communication and computation costs at edge devices. Federated split learning (FSL) can train sub-models in parallel and reduce the computational burden of edge devices by splitting the model architecture. However, it still requires a high communication overhead due to transmitting the smashed data and gradients between clients and the server in every global round. Furthermore, the server must maintain separate partial models for every client, leading to a significant storage requirement. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel communication and storage efficient federated split learning method, termed CSE-FSL, which utilizes an auxiliary network to locally update the weights of the clients while keeping a single model at the server, hence avoiding frequent transmissions of gradients from the server and greatly reducing the storage requirement of the server. Additionally, a new model update method of transmitting the smashed data in selected epochs can reduce the amount of smashed data sent from the clients. We provide a theoretical analysis of CSE-FSL, rigorously guaranteeing its convergence under non-convex loss functions. The extensive experimental results further indicate that CSE-FSL achieves a significant communication reduction over existing FSL solutions using real-world FL tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: To address the limitations of medium- and long-term four-dimensional (4D) trajectory prediction models, this paper proposes a hybrid CNN-LSTM-attention-adaboost neural network model incorporating a multi-strategy improved snake-herd optimization (SO) algorithm. The model applies the Adaboost algorithm to divide multiple weak learners, and each submodel utilizes CNN to extract spatial features, LSTM to capture temporal features, and attention mechanism to capture global features comprehensively. The strong learner model, combined with multiple sub-models, then optimizes the hyperparameters of the prediction model through the natural selection behavior pattern simulated by SO. In this study, based on the real ADS-B data from Xi'an to Tianjin, the comparison experiments and ablation studies of multiple optimizers are carried out, and a comprehensive test and evaluation analysis is carried out. The results show that SO-CLA-adaboost outperforms traditional optimizers such as particle swarm, whale, and gray wolf in handling large-scale high-dimensional trajectory data. In addition, introducing the full-strategy collaborative improvement SO algorithm improves the model's prediction accuracy by 39.89%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Boglioni, Terrance Liu, Andrew Ilyas, Zhiwei Steven Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work we study black-box privacy auditing, where the goal is to lower bound the privacy parameter of a differentially private learning algorithm using only the algorithm's outputs (i.e., final trained model). For DP-SGD (the most successful method for training differentially private deep learning models), the canonical approach auditing uses membership inference-an auditor comes with a small set of special "canary" examples, inserts a random subset of them into the training set, and then tries to discern which of their canaries were included in the training set (typically via a membership inference attack). The auditor's success rate then provides a lower bound on the privacy parameters of the learning algorithm. Our main contribution is a method for optimizing the auditor's canary set to improve privacy auditing, leveraging recent work on metagradient optimization. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that by using such optimized canaries, we can improve empirical lower bounds for differentially private image classification models by over 2x in certain instances. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is transferable and efficient: canaries optimized for non-private SGD with a small model architecture remain effective when auditing larger models trained with DP-SGD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anh Nguyen, Sam Schafft, Nicholas Hale, John Alfaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as an invaluable solution in scenarios where real-world data collection and usage are limited by cost and scarcity. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in producing high-fidelity, domain-relevant samples across various fields. However, existing approaches that directly use LLMs to generate each record individually impose prohibitive time and cost burdens, particularly when large volumes of synthetic data are required. In this work, we propose a fast, cost-effective method for realistic tabular data synthesis that leverages LLMs to infer and encode each field's distribution into a reusable sampling script. By automatically classifying fields into numerical, categorical, or free-text types, the LLM generates distribution-based scripts that can efficiently produce diverse, realistic datasets at scale without continuous model inference. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional direct methods in both diversity and data realism, substantially reducing the burden of high-volume synthetic data generation. We plan to apply this methodology to accelerate testing in production pipelines, thereby shortening development cycles and improving overall system efficiency. We believe our insights and lessons learned will aid researchers and practitioners seeking scalable, cost-effective solutions for synthetic data generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding maps natural language instructions to precise interface locations for autonomous interaction. Current reinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as hit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature of spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally forms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI Gaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G$^2$), a principled reward framework that models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface plane. GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point rewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions centered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment by measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target regions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance mechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions. This framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to dense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich gradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions. Extensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro benchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of 24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals that continuous modeling provides superior robustness to interface variations and enhanced generalization to unseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI interaction tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mihir Prabhudesai, Menging Wu, Amir Zadeh, Katerina Fragkiadaki, Deepak Pathak</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm.

<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique widely used in brain-computer interfaces and clinical applications, yet existing EEG foundation models face limitations in modeling spatio-temporal brain dynamics and lack channel permutation equivariance, preventing robust generalization across diverse electrode configurations. To address these challenges, we propose DIVER-0, a novel EEG foundation model that demonstrates how full spatio-temporal attention-rather than segregated spatial or temporal processing-achieves superior performance when properly designed with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) for temporal relationships and binary attention biases for channel differentiation. We also introduce Sliding Temporal Conditional Positional Encoding (STCPE), which improves upon existing conditional positional encoding approaches by maintaining both temporal translation equivariance and channel permutation equivariance, enabling robust adaptation to arbitrary electrode configurations unseen during pretraining. Experimental results demonstrate that DIVER-0 achieves competitive performance with only 10% of pretraining data while maintaining consistent results across all channel permutation conditions, validating its effectiveness for cross-dataset generalization and establishing key design principles for handling the inherent heterogeneity of neural recording setups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Monteiro, Sam Nallaperuma-Herzberg, Martina Mason, Steve Niederer</p>
<p>Abstract: Insomnia affects a vast population of the world and can have a wide range of causes. Existing treatments for insomnia have been linked with many side effects like headaches, dizziness, etc. As such, there is a clear need for improved insomnia treatment. Brain modelling has helped with assessing the effects of brain pathology on brain network dynamics and with supporting clinical decisions in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, etc. However, such models have not been developed for insomnia. Therefore, this project attempts to understand the characteristics of the brain of individuals experiencing insomnia using continuous long-duration EEG data. Brain networks are derived based on functional connectivity and spatial distance between EEG channels. The power spectral density of the channels is then computed for the major brain wave frequency bands. A graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) model is then trained to capture the functional characteristics associated with insomnia and configured for the classification task to judge performance. Results indicated a 50-second non-overlapping sliding window was the most suitable choice for EEG segmentation. This approach achieved a classification accuracy of 70% at window level and 68% at subject level. Additionally, the omission of EEG channels C4-P4, F4-C4 and C4-A1 caused higher degradation in model performance than the removal of other channels. These channel electrodes are positioned near brain regions known to exhibit atypical levels of functional connectivity in individuals with insomnia, which can explain such results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giuliana Monachino, Nicol\`o La Porta, Beatrice Zanchi, Luigi Fiorillo, Alvise Dei Rossi, Georgiy Farina, Francesca Dalia Faraci</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are large-scale machine learning models trained on extensive, diverse datasets that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. In the last two years, interest in FMs has also grown for applications in the cardiological field to analyze the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. One of the key properties of FMs is their transferability to a wide range of downstream scenarios. With the spread of wearable and portable devices, keen interest in learning from reduced-channel configurations has arisen. However, the adaptation of ECG FMs to downstream scenarios with fewer available channels still has to be properly investigated. In this work, we propose Self-DANA, a novel, easy-to-integrate solution that makes self-supervised architectures adaptable to a reduced number of input channels, ensuring resource efficiency and high performance. We also introduce Random Lead Selection, a novel augmentation technique to pre-train models in a more robust and channel-agnostic way. Our experimental results on five reduced-channel configurations demonstrate that Self-DANA significantly enhances resource efficiency while reaching state-of-the-art performance. It requires up to 69.3% less peak CPU memory, 34.4% less peak GPU memory, about 17% less average epoch CPU time, and about 24% less average epoch GPU time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frank Efe Erukainure, Feidra Gjata, Matin Ataei Kachouei, Henry Cox, Md. Azahar Ali</p>
<p>Abstract: River water quality monitoring is important for aquatic life, livestock, and humans because clean water is critical to meeting food demand during the global food crisis. Excessive contaminants, including phosphate, deplete dissolved oxygen and trigger eutrophication, leading to serious health and ecological problems. Continuous sensors that track phosphate levels can therefore help prevent eutrophication. In this work we present a lithography-free phosphate sensor (P-sensor) that detects phosphate in river water at parts-per-billion levels. The device uses a solid-state indicator electrode formed by 3D-printed periodic polymer patterns (8 um feature size) coated with a thin phosphate ion-selective membrane. The P-sensor detects as little as 1 ppb phosphate across 0 - 475 ppm with a response time under 30 seconds. We validated the sensor on Rappahannock River water, Virginia (less than 0.8 ppm phosphate) at sites upstream and downstream of a sewage treatment plant and benchmarked the results against a commercial phosphate meter. A feed-forward neural network was trained to predict phosphate levels, achieving a mean-squared error below 1e-3, zero standard deviation, and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.997 for river samples. These results demonstrate a practical tool for continuous water-quality monitoring that can inform stakeholders and policymakers and ultimately improve public health.</p>

<p>Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) poses challenges in diagnosis and monitoring due to its progressive nature and complex symptoms. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing surface electromyography (sEMG) to objectively assess PD severity, focusing on the biceps brachii muscle. Initial analysis of sEMG data from five PD patients and five healthy controls revealed significant neuromuscular differences. A traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) model achieved up to 83% accuracy, while enhancements with a Graph Convolutional Network-Support Vector Machine (GCN-SVM) model increased accuracy to 92%. Despite the preliminary nature of these results, the study outlines a detailed experimental methodology for future research with larger cohorts to validate these findings and integrate the approach into clinical practice. The proposed approach holds promise for advancing PD severity assessment and improving patient care in Parkinson's disease management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Kabali</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research traditionally focuses on algorithms that optimize for specific goals under deterministic rules. Yet, human-like intelligence exhibits adaptive spontaneity - an ability to make unexpected choices or free decisions not strictly dictated by past data or immediate reward. This trait, often dubbed "free will" in a loose sense, might be crucial for creativity, robust adaptation, and avoiding ruts in problem-solving. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, called the Free Will Equation, that draws analogies from quantum field theory to endow AGI agents with a form of adaptive, controlled stochasticity in their decision-making process. The core idea is to treat an AI agent's cognitive state as a superposition of potential actions or thoughts, which collapses probabilistically into a concrete action when a decision is made - much like a quantum wavefunction collapsing upon measurement. By incorporating mechanisms analogous to quantum fields, along with intrinsic motivation terms, we aim to improve an agent's ability to explore novel strategies and adapt to unforeseen changes. Experiments in a non-stationary multi-armed bandit environment demonstrate that agents using this framework achieve higher rewards and policy diversity compared to baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanshan Wang, Dian Xu, Jianmin Shen, Feng Gao, Wei Li, Weibing Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Percolation theory serves as a cornerstone for studying phase transitions and critical phenomena, with broad implications in statistical physics, materials science, and complex networks. However, most machine learning frameworks for percolation analysis have focused on two-dimensional systems, oversimplifying the spatial correlations and morphological complexity of real-world three-dimensional materials. To bridge this gap and improve label efficiency and scalability in 3D systems, we propose a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) that leverages features of the largest cluster as discriminative input. Our method achieves high predictive accuracy for both site and bond percolation thresholds and critical exponents in three dimensions, with sub-1% error margins using significantly fewer labeled samples than traditional approaches. This work establishes a robust and data-efficient framework for modeling high-dimensional critical phenomena, with potential applications in materials discovery and complex network analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaron Green, Zihan Nie, Hanzhen Qin, Oshani Seneviratne, Kristin P. Bennett</p>
<p>Abstract: Survival modeling predicts the time until an event occurs and is widely used in risk analysis; for example, it's used in medicine to predict the survival of a patient based on censored data. There is a need for large-scale, realistic, and freely available datasets for benchmarking artificial intelligence (AI) survival models. In this paper, we derive a suite of 16 survival modeling tasks from publicly available transaction data generated by lending of cryptocurrencies in Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Each task was constructed using an automated pipeline based on choices of index and outcome events. For example, the model predicts the time from when a user borrows cryptocurrency coins (index event) until their first repayment (outcome event). We formulate a survival benchmark consisting of a suite of 16 survival-time prediction tasks (FinSurvival). We also automatically create 16 corresponding classification problems for each task by thresholding the survival time using the restricted mean survival time. With over 7.5 million records, FinSurvival provides a suite of realistic financial modeling tasks that will spur future AI survival modeling research. Our evaluation indicated that these are challenging tasks that are not well addressed by existing methods. FinSurvival enables the evaluation of AI survival models applicable to traditional finance, industry, medicine, and commerce, which is currently hindered by the lack of large public datasets. Our benchmark demonstrates how AI models could assess opportunities and risks in DeFi. In the future, the FinSurvival benchmark pipeline can be used to create new benchmarks by incorporating more DeFi transactions and protocols as the use of cryptocurrency grows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eleonora Vitanza, Pietro DeLellis, Chiara Mocenni, Manuel Ruiz Marin</p>
<p>Abstract: This study integrates causal inference, graph analysis, temporal complexity measures, and machine learning to examine whether individual symptom trajectories can reveal meaningful diagnostic patterns. Testing on a longitudinal dataset of N=45 individuals affected by General Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and/or Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) derived from Fisher et al. 2017, we propose a novel pipeline for the analysis of the temporal dynamics of psychopathological symptoms. First, we employ the PCMCI+ algorithm with nonparametric independence test to determine the causal network of nonlinear dependencies between symptoms in individuals with different mental disorders. We found that the PCMCI+ effectively highlights the individual peculiarities of each symptom network, which could be leveraged towards personalized therapies. At the same time, aggregating the networks by diagnosis sheds light to disorder-specific causal mechanisms, in agreement with previous psychopathological literature. Then, we enrich the dataset by computing complexity-based measures (e.g. entropy, fractal dimension, recurrence) from the symptom time series, and feed it to a suitably selected machine learning algorithm to aid the diagnosis of each individual. The new dataset yields 91% accuracy in the classification of the symptom dynamics, proving to be an effective diagnostic support tool. Overall, these findings highlight how integrating causal modeling and temporal complexity can enhance diagnostic differentiation, offering a principled, data-driven foundation for both personalized assessment in clinical psychology and structural advances in psychological research.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the field of cardiac electrophysiology (EP), effectively reducing noise in intra-cardiac signals is crucial for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies. However, traditional noise reduction techniques fall short in addressing the diverse noise patterns from various sources, often non-linear and non-stationary, present in these signals. This work introduces a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, aimed at improving the quality of intra-ventricular monophasic action potential (MAP) signal recordings. By constructing representations of clean signals from a dataset of 5706 time series from 42 patients diagnosed with ischemic cardiomyopathy, our approach demonstrates superior denoising performance when compared to conventional filtering methods commonly employed in clinical settings. We assess the effectiveness of our VAE model using various metrics, indicating its superior capability to denoise signals across different noise types, including time-varying non-linear noise frequently found in clinical settings. These results reveal that VAEs can eliminate diverse sources of noise in single beats, outperforming state-of-the-art denoising techniques and potentially improving treatment efficacy in cardiac EP.</p>

<p>Abstract: Preclinical sleep research remains constrained by labor intensive, manual vigilance state classification and inter rater variability, limiting throughput and reproducibility. This study presents an automated framework developed by Team Neural Prognosticators to classify electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of small rodents into three critical vigilance states paradoxical sleep (REM), slow wave sleep (SWS), and wakefulness. The system integrates advanced signal processing with machine learning, leveraging engineered features from both time and frequency domains, including spectral power across canonical EEG bands (delta to gamma), temporal dynamics via Maximum-Minimum Distance, and cross-frequency coupling metrics. These features capture distinct neurophysiological signatures such as high frequency desynchronization during wakefulness, delta oscillations in SWS, and REM specific bursts. Validated during the 2024 Big Data Health Science Case Competition (University of South Carolina Big Data Health Science Center, 2024), our XGBoost model achieved 91.5% overall accuracy, 86.8% precision, 81.2% recall, and an F1 score of 83.5%, outperforming all baseline methods. Our approach represents a critical advancement in automated sleep state classification and a valuable tool for accelerating discoveries in sleep science and the development of targeted interventions for chronic sleep disorders. As a publicly available code (BDHSC) resource is set to contribute significantly to advancements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Heublein, Christian Wielenberg, Thorsten Nowak, Tobias Feigl, Christopher Mutschler, Felix Ott</p>
<p>Abstract: Jamming devices disrupt signals from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and pose a significant threat by compromising the reliability of accurate positioning. Consequently, the detection and localization of these interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating their impact, and implementing effective counter-measures. Classical Angle of Arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors. Additionally, AoA-based techniques demand substantial computational resources for array signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting and classifying interference while estimating the distance, azimuth, and elevation of jamming sources. Our benchmark study evaluates 128 vision encoder and time-series models to identify the highest-performing methods for each task. We introduce an attention-based fusion framework that integrates in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed spectrograms while incorporating 22 AoA features to enhance localization accuracy. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset of moving jamming devices recorded in an indoor environment with dynamic multipath conditions and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human computer interaction has become integral to modern life, driven by advancements in machine learning technologies. Affective computing, in particular, has focused on systems that recognize, interpret, and respond to human emotions, often using wearable devices, which provide continuous data streams of physiological signals. Among various physiological signals, the photoplethysmogram (PPG) has gained prominence due to its ease of acquisition from widely available devices. However, the generalization of PPG-based emotion recognition models across individuals remains an unresolved challenge. This paper introduces a novel hybrid architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to address this issue. The proposed model integrates the strengths of these architectures to improve robustness and generalization. Raw PPG signals are fed into the CNN for feature extraction. These features are processed separately by LSTM and TCN. The outputs from these components are concatenated to generate a final feature representation, which serves as the input for classifying valence and arousal, the primary dimensions of emotion. Experiments using the Photoplethysmogram Dataset for Emotional Analysis (PPGE) demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model achieves better model generalization than standalone CNN and LSTM architectures. Our results show that the proposed solution outperforms the state-of-the-art CNN architecture, as well as a CNN-LSTM model, in emotion recognition tasks with PPG signals. Using metrics such as Area Under the Curve (AUC) and F1 Score, we highlight the model's effectiveness in handling subject variability.</p>

Unlike conventional HDC approaches that rely on static, random projections, our method introduces a rhythm-aware and trainable encoding pipeline based on RR intervals, a physiological signal segmentation strategy that aligns with cardiac cycles.

This hybrid framework preserves the symbolic interpretability of HDC while enabling task-adaptive representation learning. Experiments on Apnea-ECG and PTB-XL demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms traditional HDC and classical ML baselines, achieving 73.09\% precision and an F1 score of 0.626 on Apnea-ECG, with comparable robustness on PTB-XL. Our framework offers an efficient and scalable solution for edge-compatible ECG classification, with strong potential for interpretable and personalized health monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojie Li, Zhijie Cai, Nan Qi, Chao Dong, Guangxu Zhu, Haixia Ma, Qihui Wu, Shi Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: The expansion of the low-altitude economy has underscored the significance of Low-Altitude Network Coverage (LANC) prediction for designing aerial corridors. While accurate LANC forecasting hinges on the antenna beam patterns of Base Stations (BSs), these patterns are typically proprietary and not readily accessible. Operational parameters of BSs, which inherently contain beam information, offer an opportunity for data-driven low-altitude coverage prediction. However, collecting extensive low-altitude road test data is cost-prohibitive, often yielding only sparse samples per BS. This scarcity results in two primary challenges: imbalanced feature sampling due to limited variability in high-dimensional operational parameters against the backdrop of substantial changes in low-dimensional sampling locations, and diminished generalizability stemming from insufficient data samples. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a dual strategy comprising expert knowledge-based feature compression and disentangled representation learning. The former reduces feature space complexity by leveraging communications expertise, while the latter enhances model generalizability through the integration of propagation models and distinct subnetworks that capture and aggregate the semantic representations of latent features. Experimental evaluation confirms the efficacy of our framework, yielding a 7% reduction in error compared to the best baseline algorithm. Real-network validations further attest to its reliability, achieving practical prediction accuracy with MAE errors at the 5dB level.</p>

This architecture achieves 81.17% accuracy in spatiotemporal pattern classification with prediction horizons up to 200 time steps and maintains robust performance across diverse regimes. Field testing across chaotic attractors, reaction-diffusion systems, and industrial datasets shows a 79% increase in critical transition detection accuracy and 81.22% improvement in long-term prediction reliability.

<p>Abstract: Radar technology presents untapped potential for continuous, contactless, and passive heart rate monitoring via consumer electronics like mobile phones. However the variety of available radar systems and lack of standardization means that a large new paired dataset collection is required for each radar system. This study demonstrates transfer learning between frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) and impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar systems, both increasingly integrated into consumer devices. FMCW radar utilizes a continuous chirp, while IR-UWB radar employs short pulses. Our mm-wave FMCW radar operated at 60 GHz with a 5.5 GHz bandwidth (2.7 cm resolution, 3 receiving antennas [Rx]), and our IR-UWB radar at 8 GHz with a 500 MHz bandwidth (30 cm resolution, 2 Rx). Using a novel 2D+1D ResNet architecture we achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.85 bpm and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.42% for heart rate monitoring with FMCW radar (N=119 participants, an average of 8 hours per participant). This model maintained performance (under 5 MAE/10% MAPE) across various body positions and heart rate ranges, with a 98.9% recall. We then fine-tuned a variant of this model, trained on single-antenna and single-range bin FMCW data, using a small (N=376, avg 6 minutes per participant) IR-UWB dataset. This transfer learning approach yielded a model with MAE 4.1 bpm and MAPE 6.3% (97.5% recall), a 25% MAE reduction over the IR-UWB baseline. This demonstration of transfer learning between radar systems for heart rate monitoring has the potential to accelerate its introduction into existing consumer devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zahra Teimouri-Jervekani, Fahimeh Nasimi, Mohammadreza Yazdchi, Ghazal MogharehZadeh, Javad Tezerji, Farzan Niknejad Mazandarani, Maryam Mohebbi</p>
<p>Abstract: Background and Objective: Differentiating wide complex tachycardia (WCT) is clinically critical yet challenging due to morphological similarities in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals between life-threatening ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy (SVT-A). Misdiagnosis carries fatal risks. We propose a computationally efficient deep learning solution to improve diagnostic accuracy and provide model interpretability for clinical deployment.
  Methods: A novel lightweight parallel deep architecture is introduced. Each pipeline processes individual ECG leads using two 1D-CNN blocks to extract local features. Feature maps are concatenated across leads, followed by LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies. Final classification employs fully connected layers. Explainability is achieved via Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) for local/global interpretation. The model was evaluated on a 35-subject ECG database using standard performance metrics.
  Results: The model achieved $95.63\%$ accuracy ($95\%$ CI: $93.07-98.19\%$), with sensitivity=$95.10\%$, specificity=$96.06\%$, and F1-score=$95.12\%$. It outperformed state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency, requiring minimal CNN blocks per pipeline. SHAP analysis demonstrated clinically interpretable feature contributions.
  Conclusions: Our end-to-end framework delivers high-precision WCT classification with minimal computational overhead. The integration of SHAP enhances clinical trust by elucidating decision logic, supporting rapid, informed diagnosis. This approach shows significant promise for real-world ECG analysis tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengji Tang, Jianjian Cao, Weihao Lin, Jiale Hong, Bo Zhang, Shuyue Hu, Lei Bai, Tao Chen, Wanli Ouyang, Peng Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper aims to demonstrate the potential and strengths of open-source collectives. It leads to a promising question: Can we harness multiple open-source LLMs to match or even beat the closed-source LLMs? To answer this, we propose SMACS, a scalable multi-agent collaboration system (MACS) framework with high performance. Specifically, for continuous integration of new LLMs and generalization to diverse questions, we first propose a Retrieval-based Prior Selection (RPS), which assigns a proxy performance score to each LLM to select the Top-k LLMs at the instance level for any given question. Then, we propose an Exploration-Exploitation-Driven Posterior Enhancement (EPE), encouraging the generation of diverse responses through prior dropping and selecting the high-quality response via a hybrid posterior score. Experiments on eight mainstream benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our SMACS: by integrating fifteen open-source LLMs, SMACS outperforms leading closed-source LLMs in 2025, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet (+12.73%), GPT-4.1(+5.36%) and GPT-o3-mini(+5.28%) across multiple tasks. Remarkably, it even exceeds the average of best results of different datasets from both open-source LLMs (+2.86%) and closed-source LLMs (+2.04%), pushing the upper bound of intelligence.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijiang Tang, Jiaxin Qi, Yuhua Zheng, Jianqiang Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Electrocardiogram~(ECG), a key bioelectrical time-series signal, is crucial for assessing cardiac health and diagnosing various diseases. Given its time-series format, ECG data is often incorporated into pre-training datasets for large-scale time-series model training. However, existing studies often overlook its unique characteristics and specialized downstream applications, which differ significantly from other time-series data, leading to an incomplete understanding of its properties. In this paper, we present an in-depth investigation of ECG signals and establish a comprehensive benchmark, which includes (1) categorizing its downstream applications into four distinct evaluation tasks, (2) identifying limitations in traditional evaluation metrics for ECG analysis, and introducing a novel metric; (3) benchmarking state-of-the-art time-series models and proposing a new architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed benchmark is comprehensive and robust. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed metric and model architecture, which establish a solid foundation for advancing research in ECG signal analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manish Kumar, Tzu-Hsuan Chou, Byunghyun Lee, Nicol\`o Michelusi, David J. Love, Yaguang Zhang, James V. Krogmeier</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-latency localization is critical in cellular networks to support real-time applications requiring precise positioning. In this paper, we propose a distributed machine learning (ML) framework for fingerprint-based localization tailored to cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, an emerging architecture for 6G networks. The proposed framework enables each access point (AP) to independently train a Gaussian process regression model using local angle-of-arrival and received signal strength fingerprints. These models provide probabilistic position estimates for the user equipment (UE), which are then fused by the UE with minimal computational overhead to derive a final location estimate. This decentralized approach eliminates the need for fronthaul communication between the APs and the central processing unit (CPU), thereby reducing latency. Additionally, distributing computational tasks across the APs alleviates the processing burden on the CPU compared to traditional centralized localization schemes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed distributed framework achieves localization accuracy comparable to centralized methods, despite lacking the benefits of centralized data aggregation. Moreover, it effectively reduces uncertainty of the location estimates, as evidenced by the 95\% covariance ellipse. The results highlight the potential of distributed ML for enabling low-latency, high-accuracy localization in future 6G networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Craig S Wright</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence functions not as an epistemic leveller, but as an accelerant of cognitive stratification, entrenching and formalising informational castes within liberal-democratic societies. Synthesising formal epistemology, political theory, algorithmic architecture, and economic incentive structures, the argument traces how contemporary AI systems selectively amplify the reasoning capacity of individuals equipped with recursive abstraction, symbolic logic, and adversarial interrogation, whilst simultaneously pacifying the cognitively untrained through engagement-optimised interfaces. Fluency replaces rigour, immediacy displaces reflection, and procedural reasoning is eclipsed by reactive suggestion. The result is a technocratic realignment of power: no longer grounded in material capital alone, but in the capacity to navigate, deconstruct, and manipulate systems of epistemic production. Information ceases to be a commons; it becomes the substrate through which consent is manufactured and autonomy subdued. Deliberative democracy collapses not through censorship, but through the erosion of interpretive agency. The proposed response is not technocratic regulation, nor universal access, but the reconstruction of rational autonomy as a civic mandate, codified in education, protected by epistemic rights, and structurally embedded within open cognitive infrastructure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haitian Hu, Wei Zhang, Feng Feng, Zhiguo Zhang, Qi-Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This article introduces an advanced space mapping (SM) technique that applies a shared electromagnetic (EM)-based coarse model for multistate tuning-driven multiphysics optimization of tunable filters. The SM method combines the computational efficiency of EM single-physics simulations with the precision of multiphysics simulations. The shared coarse model is based on EM single-physics responses corresponding to various nontunable design parameters values. Conversely, the fine model is implemented to delineate the behavior of multiphysics responses concerning both nontunable and tunable design parameter values. The proposed overall surrogate model comprises multiple subsurrogate models, each consisting of one shared coarse model and two distinct mapping neural networks. The responses from the shared coarse model in the EM single-physics filed offer a suitable approximation for the fine responses in the multiphysics filed, whereas the mapping neural networks facilitate transition from the EM single-physics field to the multiphysics field. Each subsurrogate model maintains consistent nontunable design parameter values but possesses unique tunable design parameter values. By developing multiple subsurrogate models, optimization can be simultaneously performed for each tuning state. Nontunable design parameter values are constrained by all tuning states, whereas tunable design parameter values are confined to their respective tuning states. This optimization technique simultaneously accounts for all the tuning states to fulfill the necessary multiple tuning state requirements. Multiple EM and multiphysics training samples are generated concurrently to develop the surrogate model. Compared with existing direct multiphysics parameterized modeling techniques, our proposed method achieves superior multiphysics modeling accuracy with fewer training samples and reduced computational costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eoghan Cunningham, James Cross, Derek Greene</p>
<p>Abstract: The automated summarisation of parliamentary debates using large language models (LLMs) offers a promising way to make complex legislative discourse more accessible to the public. However, such summaries must not only be accurate and concise but also equitably represent the views and contributions of all speakers. This paper explores the use of LLMs to summarise plenary debates from the European Parliament and investigates the algorithmic and representational biases that emerge in this context. We propose a structured, multi-stage summarisation framework that improves textual coherence and content fidelity, while enabling the systematic analysis of how speaker attributes -- such as speaking order or political affiliation -- influence the visibility and accuracy of their contributions in the final summaries. Through our experiments using both proprietary and open-weight LLMs, we find evidence of consistent positional and partisan biases, with certain speakers systematically under-represented or misattributed. Our analysis shows that these biases vary by model and summarisation strategy, with hierarchical approaches offering the greatest potential to reduce disparity. These findings underscore the need for domain-sensitive evaluation metrics and ethical oversight in the deployment of LLMs for democratic applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beno\^it Brebion, Alban Gallard, Katrin Sippel, Amer Zaylaa, Hubert Preissl, Sahar Moghimi, Fabrice Wallois, Ya\"el Fr\'egier</p>
<p>Abstract: Background and objective: Brain activity in premature newborns has traditionally been studied using electroencephalography (EEG), leading to substantial advances in our understanding of early neural development. However, since brain development takes root at the fetal stage, a critical window of this process remains largely unknown. The only technique capable of recording neural activity in the intrauterine environment is fetal magnetoencephalography (fMEG), but this approach presents challenges in terms of data quality and scarcity. Using artificial intelligence, the present research aims to transfer the well-established knowledge from EEG studies to fMEG to improve understanding of prenatal brain development, laying the foundations for better detection and treatment of potential pathologies. Methods: We developed an unpaired diffusion translation method based on dual diffusion bridges, which notably includes numerical integration improvements to obtain more qualitative results at a lower computational cost. Models were trained on our unpaired dataset of bursts of spontaneous activity from 30 high-resolution premature newborns EEG recordings and 44 fMEG recordings. Results: We demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvement upon previous results obtained with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by almost 5% on the mean squared error in the time domain, and completely eliminating the mode collapse problem in the frequency domain, thus achieving near-perfect signal fidelity. Conclusion: We set a new state of the art in the EEG-fMEG unpaired translation problem, as our developed tool completely paves the way for early brain activity analysis. Overall, we also believe that our method could be reused for other unpaired signal translation applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khalid Hasan, Jamil Saquer</p>
<p>Abstract: Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental illness frequently underdiagnosed due to subtle early symptoms and social stigma. This paper explores the advanced natural language processing (NLP) models for recognizing signs of bipolar disorder based on user-generated social media text. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, ELECTRA, DistilBERT) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models based on contextualized (BERT) and static (GloVe, Word2Vec) word embeddings. Experiments were performed on a large, annotated dataset of Reddit posts after confirming their validity through sentiment variance and judgmental analysis. Our results demonstrate that RoBERTa achieves the highest performance among transformer models with an F1 score of ~98% while LSTM models using BERT embeddings yield nearly identical results. In contrast, LSTMs trained on static embeddings fail to capture meaningful patterns, scoring near-zero F1. These findings underscore the critical role of contextual language modeling in detecting bipolar disorder. In addition, we report model training times and highlight that DistilBERT offers an optimal balance between efficiency and accuracy. In general, our study offers actionable insights for model selection in mental health NLP applications and validates the potential of contextualized language models to support early bipolar disorder screening.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Al Jubair, Mohammad Shamsul Arefin, Ahmed Wasif Reza</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the relationship between voter trust and their experiences during elections by applying a rule-based data mining technique to the 2022 Survey of the Performance of American Elections (SPAE). Using the Apriori algorithm and setting parameters to capture meaningful associations (support >= 3%, confidence >= 60%, and lift > 1.5), the analysis revealed a strong connection between demographic attributes and voting-related challenges, such as registration hurdles, accessibility issues, and queue times. For instance, respondents who indicated that accessing polling stations was "very easy" and who reported moderate confidence were found to be over six times more likely (lift = 6.12) to trust their county's election outcome and experience no registration issues. A further analysis, which adjusted the support threshold to 2%, specifically examined patterns among minority voters. It revealed that 98.16 percent of Black voters who reported easy access to polling locations also had smooth registration experiences. Additionally, those who had high confidence in the vote-counting process were almost two times as likely to identify as Democratic Party supporters. These findings point to the important role that enhancing voting access and offering targeted support can play in building trust in the electoral system, particularly among marginalized communities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eldor Abdukhamidov, Mohammed Abuhamad, Simon S. Woo, Hyoungshick Kim, Tamer Abuhmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision transformer (ViT) models, when coupled with interpretation models, are regarded as secure and challenging to deceive, making them well-suited for security-critical domains such as medical applications, autonomous vehicles, drones, and robotics. However, successful attacks on these systems can lead to severe consequences. Recent research on threats targeting ViT models primarily focuses on generating the smallest adversarial perturbations that can deceive the models with high confidence, without considering their impact on model interpretations. Nevertheless, the use of interpretation models can effectively assist in detecting adversarial examples. This study investigates the vulnerability of transformer models to adversarial attacks, even when combined with interpretation models. We propose an attack called "AdViT" that generates adversarial examples capable of misleading both a given transformer model and its coupled interpretation model. Through extensive experiments on various transformer models and two transformer-based interpreters, we demonstrate that AdViT achieves a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box scenarios. In white-box scenarios, it reaches up to 98% misclassification confidence, while in black-box scenarios, it reaches up to 76% misclassification confidence. Remarkably, AdViT consistently generates accurate interpretations in both scenarios, making the adversarial examples more difficult to detect.</p>

The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and making the architecture both computationally efficient and elegant. The proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\alpha_i + \tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$, where all parameters $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$ are trainable. We validate our APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to 96.69\% test accuracy in just 20 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters. The results highlight the superior expressiveness and computational efficiency of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) capabilities are envisioned to play a pivotal role in future wireless networks due to their enhanced flexibility and efficiency. However, jointly optimizing UAV trajectory planning, multi-user communication, and target sensing under stringent resource constraints and time-critical conditions remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose an Age of Information (AoI)-centric UAV-ISAC system that simultaneously performs target sensing and serves multiple ground users, emphasizing information freshness as the core performance metric. We formulate a long-term average AoI minimization problem that jointly optimizes the UAV's flight trajectory and beamforming. To tackle the high-dimensional, non-convexity of this problem, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm capable of providing real-time decisions on UAV movement and beamforming for both radar sensing and multi-user communication. Specifically, a Kalman filter is employed for accurate target state prediction, regularized zero-forcing is utilized to mitigate inter-user interference, and the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm is applied for training the DRL agent on continuous actions. The proposed framework adaptively balances the trade-offs between sensing accuracy and communication quality. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently achieves lower average AoI compared to baseline approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongjin Kim, Xiaoyu Wang, Peichen Zhong, Daniel S. King, Theo Jaffrelot Inizan, Bingqing Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Most current machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) rely on short-range approximations, without explicit treatment of long-range electrostatics. To address this, we recently developed the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) method, which infers electrostatic interactions, polarization, and Born effective charges (BECs), just by learning from energy and force training data. Here, we present LES as a standalone library, compatible with any short-range MLIP, and demonstrate its integration with methods such as MACE, NequIP, CACE, and CHGNet. We benchmark LES-enhanced models on distinct systems, including bulk water, polar dipeptides, and gold dimer adsorption on defective substrates, and show that LES not only captures correct electrostatics but also improves accuracy. Additionally, we scale LES to large and chemically diverse data by training MACELES-OFF on the SPICE set containing molecules and clusters, making a universal MLIP with electrostatics for organic systems including biomolecules. MACELES-OFF is more accurate than its short-range counterpart (MACE-OFF) trained on the same dataset, predicts dipoles and BECs reliably, and has better descriptions of bulk liquids. By enabling efficient long-range electrostatics without directly training on electrical properties, LES paves the way for electrostatic foundation MLIPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rakesh Paul, Anusha Kamath, Kanishk Singla, Raviraj Joshi, Utkarsh Vaidya, Sanjay Singh Chauhan, Niranjan Wartikar</p>
<p>Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate a performance gap between English and non-English languages, particularly in low-resource settings. Aligning these models to low-resource languages is essential yet challenging due to limited high-quality data. While English alignment datasets are readily available, curating equivalent data in other languages is expensive and time-consuming. A common workaround is to translate existing English alignment data; however, standard translation techniques often fail to preserve critical elements such as code, mathematical expressions, and structured formats like JSON. In this work, we investigate LLM-based selective translation, a technique that selectively translates only the translatable parts of a text while preserving non-translatable content and sentence structure. We conduct a systematic study to explore key questions around this approach, including its effectiveness compared to vanilla translation, the importance of filtering noisy outputs, and the benefits of mixing translated samples with original English data during alignment. Our experiments focus on the low-resource Indic language Hindi and compare translations generated by Google Cloud Translation (GCP) and Llama-3.1-405B. The results highlight the promise of selective translation as a practical and effective method for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Brain foundation models represent a new frontier in AI: instead of processing text or images, these models interpret real-time neural signals from EEG, fMRI, and other neurotechnologies. When integrated with brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), they may enable transformative applications-from thought controlled devices to neuroprosthetics-by interpreting and acting on brain activity in milliseconds. However, these same systems pose unprecedented risks, including the exploitation of subconscious neural signals and the erosion of cognitive liberty. Users cannot easily observe or control how their brain signals are interpreted, creating power asymmetries that are vulnerable to manipulation. This paper proposes embedding fiduciary duties-loyalty, care, and confidentiality-directly into BCI-integrated brain foundation models through technical design. Drawing on legal traditions and recent advancements in AI alignment techniques, we outline implementable architectural and governance mechanisms to ensure these systems act in users' best interests. Placing brain foundation models on a fiduciary footing is essential to realizing their potential without compromising self-determination.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Athanasios Andrikopoulos, Nikolaos Sampanis</p>
<p>Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has emerged as a powerful framework for extracting robust and interpretable features from noisy high-dimensional data. In the context of Social Choice Theory, where preference profiles and collective decisions are geometrically rich yet sensitive to perturbations, TDA remains largely unexplored. This work introduces a novel conceptual bridge between these domains by proposing a new metric framework for persistence diagrams tailored to noisy preference data.We define a polar coordinate-based distance that captures both the magnitude and orientation of topological features in a smooth and differentiable manner. Our metric addresses key limitations of classical distances, such as bottleneck and Wasserstein, including instability under perturbation, lack of continuity, and incompatibility with gradient-based learning. The resulting formulation offers improved behavior in both theoretical and applied settings.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically apply persistent homology to social choice systems, providing a mathematically grounded method for comparing topological summaries of voting structures and preference dynamics. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach through extensive experiments, including robustness tests and supervised learning tasks, and we propose a modular pipeline for building predictive models from online preference data. This work contributes a conceptually novel and computationally effective tool to the emerging interface of topology and decision theory, opening new directions in interpretable machine learning for political and economic systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce MENO (''Matrix Exponential-based Neural Operator''), a hybrid surrogate modeling framework for efficiently solving stiff systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that exhibit a sparse nonlinear structure. In such systems, only a few variables contribute nonlinearly to the dynamics, while the majority influence the equations linearly. MENO exploits this property by decomposing the system into two components: the low-dimensional nonlinear part is modeled using conventional neural operators, while the linear time-varying subsystem is integrated using a novel neural matrix exponential formulation. This approach combines the exact solution of linear time-invariant systems with learnable, time-dependent graph-based corrections applied to the linear operators. Unlike black-box or soft-constrained physics-informed (PI) models, MENO embeds the governing equations directly into its architecture, ensuring physical consistency (e.g., steady states), improved robustness, and more efficient training. We validate MENO on three complex thermochemical systems: the POLLU atmospheric chemistry model, an oxygen mixture in thermochemical nonequilibrium, and a collisional-radiative argon plasma in one- and two-dimensional shock-tube simulations. MENO achieves relative errors below 2% in trained zero-dimensional settings and maintains good accuracy in extrapolatory multidimensional regimes. It also delivers substantial computational speedups, achieving up to 4 800$\times$ on GPU and 185$\times$ on CPU compared to standard implicit ODE solvers. Although intrusive by design, MENO's physics-based architecture enables superior generalization and reliability, offering a scalable path for real-time simulation of stiff reactive systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Osman Erman Gungor, Derak Paulsen, William Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Schema matching is essential for integrating heterogeneous data sources and enhancing dataset discovery, yet it remains a complex and resource-intensive problem. We introduce SCHEMORA, a schema matching framework that combines large language models with hybrid retrieval techniques in a prompt-based approach, enabling efficient identification of candidate matches without relying on labeled training data or exhaustive pairwise comparisons. By enriching schema metadata and leveraging both vector-based and lexical retrieval, SCHEMORA improves matching accuracy and scalability. Evaluated on the MIMIC-OMOP benchmark, it establishes new state-of-the-art performance, with gains of 7.49% in HitRate@5 and 3.75% in HitRate@3 over previous best results. To our knowledge, this is the first LLM-based schema matching method with an open-source implementation, accompanied by analysis that underscores the critical role of retrieval and provides practical guidance on model selection.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14406">Fail Fast, or Ask: Mitigating the Deficiencies of Reasoning LLMs with Human-in-the-Loop Systems Engineering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael J. Zellinger, Matt Thomson</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are powerful problem solvers, but they still occasionally make mistakes. However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive domains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose collaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries the model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty of a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an effective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3 235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring 7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them challenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this challenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning model. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system "Fail Fast, or Ask", since the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert directly ("failing fast"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher latency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and about 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the accuracy-rejection curve. However, we observe that latency savings are lower than expected because of "latency drag", the phenomenon that processing easier queries with a non-reasoning model pushes the reasoning model's latency distribution towards longer latencies. Broadly, our results suggest that the deficiencies of state-of-the-art reasoning models -- nontrivial error rates and high latency -- can be substantially mitigated through black-box systems engineering, without requiring access to LLM internals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuejie Chi, Yuxin Chen, Yuting Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: As a paradigm for sequential decision making in unknown environments, reinforcement learning (RL) has received a flurry of attention in recent years. However, the explosion of model complexity in emerging applications and the presence of nonconvexity exacerbate the challenge of achieving efficient RL in sample-starved situations, where data collection is expensive, time-consuming, or even high-stakes (e.g., in clinical trials, autonomous systems, and online advertising). How to understand and enhance the sample and computational efficacies of RL algorithms is thus of great interest. In this tutorial, we aim to introduce several important algorithmic and theoretical developments in RL, highlighting the connections between new ideas and classical topics. Employing Markov Decision Processes as the central mathematical model, we cover several distinctive RL scenarios (i.e., RL with a simulator, online RL, offline RL, robust RL, and RL with human feedback), and present several mainstream RL approaches (i.e., model-based approach, value-based approach, and policy optimization). Our discussions gravitate around the issues of sample complexity, computational efficiency, as well as algorithm-dependent and information-theoretic lower bounds from a non-asymptotic viewpoint.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Chen, Lijin Wang, Yanzhao Cao, Xupeng Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel neural network model for learning stochastic Hamiltonian systems (SHSs) from observational data, termed the stochastic generating function neural network (SGFNN). SGFNN preserves symplectic structure of the underlying stochastic Hamiltonian system and produces symplectic predictions. Our model utilizes the autoencoder framework to identify the randomness of the latent system by the encoder network, and detects the stochastic generating function of the system through the decoder network based on the random variables extracted from the encoder. Symplectic predictions can then be generated by the stochastic generating function. Numerical experiments are performed on several stochastic Hamiltonian systems, varying from additive to multiplicative, and from separable to non-separable SHSs with single or multiple noises. Compared with the benchmark stochastic flow map learning (sFML) neural network, our SGFNN model exhibits higher accuracy across various prediction metrics, especially in long-term predictions, with the property of maintaining the symplectic structure of the underlying SHSs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bing-Ze Lu, Richard Tsai</p>
<p>Abstract: In many applications, one needs to learn a dynamical system from its solutions sampled at a finite number of time points. The learning problem is often formulated
  as an optimization problem over a chosen function class. However, in the optimization procedure, it is necessary to employ a numerical scheme to integrate candidate dynamical systems and assess how their solutions fit the data.
  This paper reveals potentially serious effects of a chosen numerical scheme on the learning outcome. In particular, our analysis demonstrates that a damped oscillatory system may be incorrectly identified as having "anti-damping" and exhibiting a reversed oscillation direction, despite adequately fitting the given data points.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14499">Neural Brownian Motion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural-Brownian Motion (NBM), a new class of stochastic processes for modeling dynamics under learned uncertainty. The NBM is defined axiomatically by replacing the classical martingale property with respect to linear expectation with one relative to a non-linear Neural Expectation Operator, $\varepsilon^\theta$, generated by a Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (BSDE) whose driver $f_\theta$ is parameterized by a neural network. Our main result is a representation theorem for a canonical NBM, which we define as a continuous $\varepsilon^\theta$-martingale with zero drift under the physical measure. We prove that, under a key structural assumption on the driver, such a canonical NBM exists and is the unique strong solution to a stochastic differential equation of the form ${\rm d} M_t = \nu_\theta(t, M_t) {\rm d} W_t$. Crucially, the volatility function $\nu_\theta$ is not postulated a priori but is implicitly defined by the algebraic constraint $g_\theta(t, M_t, \nu_\theta(t, M_t)) = 0$, where $g_\theta$ is a specialization of the BSDE driver. We develop the stochastic calculus for this process and prove a Girsanov-type theorem for the quadratic case, showing that an NBM acquires a drift under a new, learned measure. The character of this measure, whether pessimistic or optimistic, is endogenously determined by the learned parameters $\theta$, providing a rigorous foundation for models where the attitude towards uncertainty is a discoverable feature.</p>

In this survey, we firstly introduce the standard diffusion models and their prevalent variants, explaining their adaptation to TSF tasks.

In analyzing existing approaches using diffusion models for TSF, we provide a systematic categorization and a comprehensive summary of them in this survey. Furthermore, we examine several foundational diffusion models applied to TSF, alongside commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss current limitations in these approaches and potential future research directions. Overall, this survey details recent progress and future prospects for diffusion models in TSF, serving as a reference for researchers in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sharanya Mukherjee, Md Hishaam Akhtar, Kannadasan R</p>
<p>Abstract: It has always been a rather tough task to communicate with someone possessing a hearing impairment. One of the most tested ways to establish such a communication is through the use of sign based languages. However, not many people are aware of the smaller intricacies involved with sign language. Sign language recognition using computer vision aims at eliminating the communication barrier between deaf-mute and ordinary people so that they can properly communicate with others. Recently the pandemic has left the whole world shaken up and has transformed the way we communicate. Video meetings have become essential for everyone, even people with a hearing disability. In recent studies, it has been found that people with hearing disabilities prefer to sign over typing during these video calls. In this paper, we are proposing a browser extension that will automatically translate sign language to subtitles for everyone else in the video call. The Large-scale dataset which contains more than 2000 Word-Level ASL videos, which were performed by over 100 signers will be used.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omar Al-Desi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the Coordinate Heart System (CHS), a geometric framework for emotion representation in artificial intelligence applications. We position eight core emotions as coordinates on a unit circle, enabling mathematical computation of complex emotional states through coordinate mixing and vector operations. Our initial five-emotion model revealed significant coverage gaps in the emotion space, leading to the development of an eight-emotion system that provides complete geometric coverage with mathematical guarantees. The framework converts natural language input to emotion coordinates and supports real-time emotion interpolation through computational algorithms. The system introduces a re-calibrated stability parameter S in [0,1], which dynamically integrates emotional load, conflict resolution, and contextual drain factors. This stability model leverages advanced Large Language Model interpretation of textual cues and incorporates hybrid temporal tracking mechanisms to provide nuanced assessment of psychological well-being states. Our key contributions include: (i) mathematical proof demonstrating why five emotions are insufficient for complete geometric coverage, (ii) an eight-coordinate system that eliminates representational blind spots, (iii) novel algorithms for emotion mixing, conflict resolution, and distance calculation in emotion space, and (iv) a comprehensive computational framework for AI emotion recognition with enhanced multi-dimensional stability modeling. Experimental validation through case studies demonstrates the system's capability to handle emotionally conflicted states, contextual distress factors, and complex psychological scenarios that traditional categorical emotion models cannot adequately represent. This work establishes a new mathematical foundation for emotion modeling in artificial intelligence systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eugene Armah, Linda Amoako Bannning</p>
<p>Abstract: Processing data at high speeds is becoming increasingly critical as digital economies generate enormous data. The current paradigms for timely data processing are edge computing and data stream processing (DSP). Edge computing places resources closer to where data is generated, while stream processing analyzes the unbounded high-speed data in motion. However, edge stream processing faces rapid workload fluctuations, complicating resource provisioning. Inadequate resource allocation leads to bottlenecks, whereas excess allocation results in wastage. Existing reactive methods, such as threshold-based policies and queuing theory scale only after performance degrades, potentially violating SLAs. Although reinforcement learning (RL) offers a proactive approach through agents that learn optimal runtime adaptation policies, it requires extensive simulation. Furthermore, predictive machine learning models face online distribution and concept drift that minimize their accuracy. We propose a three-step solution to the proactive edge stream processing autoscaling problem. Firstly, a GRU neural network forecasts the upstream load using real-world and synthetic DSP datasets. Secondly, a transfer learning framework integrates the predictive model into an online stream processing system using the DTW algorithm and joint distribution adaptation to handle the disparities between offline and online domains. Finally, a horizontal autoscaling module dynamically adjusts the degree of operator parallelism, based on predicted load while considering edge resource constraints. The lightweight GRU model for load predictions recorded up to 1.3\% SMAPE value on a real-world data set. It outperformed CNN, ARIMA, and Prophet on the SMAPE and RMSE evaluation metrics, with lower training time than the computationally intensive RL models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural IR architectures, particularly cross-encoders, are highly effective models whose internal mechanisms are mostly unknown. Most works trying to explain their behavior focused on high-level processes (e.g., what in the input influences the prediction, does the model adhere to known IR axioms) but fall short of describing the matching process. Instead of Mechanistic Interpretability approaches which specifically aim at explaining the hidden mechanisms of neural models, we demonstrate that more straightforward methods can already provide valuable insights. In this paper, we first focus on the attention process and extract causal insights highlighting the crucial roles of some attention heads in this process. Second, we provide an interpretation of the mechanism underlying matching detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nandani Sharma, Dinesh Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial expression recognition is crucial for human-computer interaction applications such as face animation, video surveillance, affective computing, medical analysis, etc. Since the structure of facial attributes varies with facial expressions, incorporating structural information into facial attributes is essential for facial expression recognition. In this paper, we propose Exp-Graph, a novel framework designed to represent the structural relationships among facial attributes using graph-based modeling for facial expression recognition. For facial attributes graph representation, facial landmarks are used as the graph's vertices. At the same time, the edges are determined based on the proximity of the facial landmark and the similarity of the local appearance of the facial attributes encoded using the vision transformer. Additionally, graph convolutional networks are utilized to capture and integrate these structural dependencies into the encoding of facial attributes, thereby enhancing the accuracy of expression recognition. Thus, Exp-Graph learns from the facial attribute graphs highly expressive semantic representations. On the other hand, the vision transformer and graph convolutional blocks help the framework exploit the local and global dependencies among the facial attributes that are essential for the recognition of facial expressions. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of the proposed Exp-Graph model on three benchmark datasets: Oulu-CASIA, eNTERFACE05, and AFEW. The model achieved recognition accuracies of 98.09\%, 79.01\%, and 56.39\%, respectively. These results indicate that Exp-Graph maintains strong generalization capabilities across both controlled laboratory settings and real-world, unconstrained environments, underscoring its effectiveness for practical facial expression recognition applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of satellite-augmented low-altitude economy and terrestrial networks (SLAETNs) demands intelligent and autonomous systems that can operate reliably across heterogeneous, dynamic, and mission-critical environments. To address these challenges, this survey focuses on enabling agentic artificial intelligence (AI), that is, artificial agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting, through generative AI (GAI) and large language models (LLMs). We begin by introducing the architecture and characteristics of SLAETNs, and analyzing the challenges that arise in integrating satellite, aerial, and terrestrial components. Then, we present a model-driven foundation by systematically reviewing five major categories of generative models: variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), generative diffusion models (GDMs), transformer-based models (TBMs), and LLMs. Moreover, we provide a comparative analysis to highlight their generative mechanisms, capabilities, and deployment trade-offs within SLAETNs. Building on this foundation, we examine how these models empower agentic functions across three domains: communication enhancement, security and privacy protection, and intelligent satellite tasks. Finally, we outline key future directions for building scalable, adaptive, and trustworthy generative agents in SLAETNs. This survey aims to provide a unified understanding and actionable reference for advancing agentic AI in next-generation integrated networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saleh Alwer, Ronan Fleming</p>
<p>Abstract: Kinetic parameters such as the turnover number ($k_{cat}$) and Michaelis constant ($K_{\mathrm{M}}$) are essential for modelling enzymatic activity but experimental data remains limited in scale and diversity. Previous methods for predicting enzyme kinetics typically use mean-pooled residue embeddings from a single protein language model to represent the protein. We present KinForm, a machine learning framework designed to improve predictive accuracy and generalisation for kinetic parameters by optimising protein feature representations. KinForm combines several residue-level embeddings (Evolutionary Scale Modeling Cambrian, Evolutionary Scale Modeling 2, and ProtT5-XL-UniRef50), taken from empirically selected intermediate transformer layers and applies weighted pooling based on per-residue binding-site probability. To counter the resulting high dimensionality, we apply dimensionality reduction using principal--component analysis (PCA) on concatenated protein features, and rebalance the training data via a similarity-based oversampling strategy. KinForm outperforms baseline methods on two benchmark datasets. Improvements are most pronounced in low sequence similarity bins. We observe improvements from binding-site probability pooling, intermediate-layer selection, PCA, and oversampling of low-identity proteins. We also find that removing sequence overlap between folds provides a more realistic evaluation of generalisation and should be the standard over random splitting when benchmarking kinetic prediction models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ponkrshnan Thiagarajan, Tamer A. Zaki, Michael D. Shields</p>
<p>Abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a powerful and accurate method to sample from the posterior distribution in Bayesian inference. However, HMC techniques are computationally demanding for Bayesian neural networks due to the high dimensionality of the network's parameter space and the non-convexity of their posterior distributions. Therefore, various approximation techniques, such as variational inference (VI) or stochastic gradient MCMC, are often employed to infer the posterior distribution of the network parameters. Such approximations introduce inaccuracies in the inferred distributions, resulting in unreliable uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that combines inexpensive VI and accurate HMC methods to efficiently and accurately quantify uncertainties in neural networks and neural operators. The proposed approach leverages an initial VI training on the full network. We examine the influence of individual parameters on the prediction uncertainty, which shows that a large proportion of the parameters do not contribute substantially to uncertainty in the network predictions. This information is then used to significantly reduce the dimension of the parameter space, and HMC is performed only for the subset of network parameters that strongly influence prediction uncertainties. This yields a framework for accelerating the full batch HMC for posterior inference in neural networks. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed framework on deep neural networks and operator networks, showing that inference can be performed for large networks with tens to hundreds of thousands of parameters. We show that this method can effectively learn surrogates for complex physical systems by modeling the operator that maps from upstream conditions to wall-pressure data on a cone in hypersonic flow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wooseok Ha, Yuansi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) aims to achieve high predictive performance in the target domain with limited labeled target data by exploiting abundant source and unlabeled target data. Despite its significance in numerous applications, theory on the effectiveness of SSDA remains largely unexplored, particularly in scenarios involving various types of source-target distributional shifts. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework based on structural causal models (SCMs) which allows us to analyze and quantify the performance of SSDA methods when labeled target data is limited. Within this framework, we introduce three SSDA methods, each having a fine-tuning strategy tailored to a distinct assumption about the source and target relationship. Under each assumption, we demonstrate how extending an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method to SSDA can achieve minimax-optimal target performance with limited target labels. When the relationship between source and target data is only vaguely known -- a common practical concern -- we propose the Multi Adaptive-Start Fine-Tuning (MASFT) algorithm, which fine-tunes UDA models from multiple starting points and selects the best-performing one based on a small hold-out target validation dataset. Combined with model selection guarantees, MASFT achieves near-optimal target predictive performance across a broad range of types of distributional shifts while significantly reducing the need for labeled target data. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods through simulations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Post-training has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with human instructions, significantly enhancing their performance across a wide range of tasks. Central to this process is the quality and diversity of post-training datasets. This paper presents a review of publicly available Arabic post-training datasets on the Hugging Face Hub, organized along four key dimensions: (1) LLM Capabilities (e.g., Question Answering, Translation, Reasoning, Summarization, Dialogue, Code Generation, and Function Calling); (2) Steerability (e.g., persona and system prompts); (3) Alignment (e.g., cultural, safety, ethics, and fairness), and (4) Robustness. Each dataset is rigorously evaluated based on popularity, practical adoption, recency and maintenance, documentation and annotation quality, licensing transparency, and scientific contribution. Our review revealed critical gaps in the development of Arabic post-training datasets, including limited task diversity, inconsistent or missing documentation and annotation, and low adoption across the community. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of these gaps on the progress of Arabic LLMs and applications while providing concrete recommendations for future efforts in post-training dataset development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amina Dzafic, Merve Kavut, Ulya Bayram</p>
<p>Abstract: Suicidal ideation detection is critical for real-time suicide prevention, yet its progress faces two under-explored challenges: limited language coverage and unreliable annotation practices. Most available datasets are in English, but even among these, high-quality, human-annotated data remains scarce. As a result, many studies rely on available pre-labeled datasets without examining their annotation process or label reliability. The lack of datasets in other languages further limits the global realization of suicide prevention via artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, we address one of these gaps by constructing a novel Turkish suicidal ideation corpus derived from social media posts and introducing a resource-efficient annotation framework involving three human annotators and two large language models (LLMs). We then address the remaining gaps by performing a bidirectional evaluation of label reliability and model consistency across this dataset and three popular English suicidal ideation detection datasets, using transfer learning through eight pre-trained sentiment and emotion classifiers. These transformers help assess annotation consistency and benchmark model performance against manually labeled data. Our findings underscore the need for more rigorous, language-inclusive approaches to annotation and evaluation in mental health natural language processing (NLP) while demonstrating the questionable performance of popular models with zero-shot transfer learning. We advocate for transparency in model training and dataset construction in mental health NLP, prioritizing data and model reliability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samantha Dies, David Liu, Tina Eliassi-Rad</p>
<p>Abstract: Faculty hiring shapes the flow of ideas, resources, and opportunities in academia, influencing not only individual career trajectories but also broader patterns of institutional prestige and scientific progress. While traditional studies have found strong correlations between faculty hiring and attributes such as doctoral department prestige and publication record, they rarely assess whether these associations generalize to individual hiring outcomes, particularly for future candidates outside the original sample. Here, we consider faculty placement as an individual-level prediction task. Our data consist of temporal co-authorship networks with conventional attributes such as doctoral department prestige and bibliometric features. We observe that using the co-authorship network significantly improves predictive accuracy by up to 10% over traditional indicators alone, with the largest gains observed for placements at the most elite (top-10) departments. Our results underscore the role that social networks, professional endorsements, and implicit advocacy play in faculty hiring beyond traditional measures of scholarly productivity and institutional prestige. By introducing a predictive framing of faculty placement and establishing the benefit of considering co-authorship networks, this work provides a new lens for understanding structural biases in academia that could inform targeted interventions aimed at increasing transparency, fairness, and equity in academic hiring practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cassandra Tong Ye, Shamus Li, Tyler King, Kristina Monakhova</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models often hallucinate, producing realistic artifacts that are not truly present in the sample. This can have dire consequences for scientific and medical inverse problems, such as MRI and microscopy denoising, where accuracy is more important than perceptual quality. Uncertainty quantification techniques, such as conformal prediction, can pinpoint outliers and provide guarantees for image regression tasks, improving reliability. However, existing methods utilize a linear constant scaling factor to calibrate uncertainty bounds, resulting in larger, less informative bounds. We propose QUTCC, a quantile uncertainty training and calibration technique that enables nonlinear, non-uniform scaling of quantile predictions to enable tighter uncertainty estimates. Using a U-Net architecture with a quantile embedding, QUTCC enables the prediction of the full conditional distribution of quantiles for the imaging task. During calibration, QUTCC generates uncertainty bounds by iteratively querying the network for upper and lower quantiles, progressively refining the bounds to obtain a tighter interval that captures the desired coverage. We evaluate our method on several denoising tasks as well as compressive MRI reconstruction. Our method successfully pinpoints hallucinations in image estimates and consistently achieves tighter uncertainty intervals than prior methods while maintaining the same statistical coverage.</p>

<p>Abstract: Causality helps people reason about and understand complex systems, particularly through what-if analyses that explore how interventions might alter outcomes. Although existing methods embrace causal reasoning using interventions and counterfactual analysis, they primarily focus on effects at the population level. These approaches often fall short in systems characterized by significant heterogeneity, where the impact of an intervention can vary widely across subgroups. To address this challenge, we present XplainAct, a visual analytics framework that supports simulating, explaining, and reasoning interventions at the individual level within subpopulations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of XplainAct through two case studies: investigating opioid-related deaths in epidemiology and analyzing voting inclinations in the presidential election.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhou Li, Xiang Zhang, Jiawen Lv, Jihao Fan, Haiqiang Chen, Giuseppe Caire</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by federated learning (FL), secure aggregation (SA) aims to securely compute, as efficiently as possible, the sum of a set of inputs distributed across many users. To understand the impact of network topology, hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) investigated the communication and secret key generation efficiency in a 3-layer relay network, where clusters of users are connected to the aggregation server through an intermediate layer of relays. Due to the pre-aggregation of the messages at the relays, HSA reduces the communication burden on the relay-to-server links and is able to support a large number of users. However, as the number of users increases, a practical challenge arises from heterogeneous security requirements--for example, users in different clusters may require varying levels of input protection. Motivated by this, we study weakly-secure HSA (WS-HSA) with collusion resilience, where instead of protecting all the inputs from any set of colluding users, only the inputs belonging to a predefined collection of user groups (referred to as security input sets) need to be protected against another predefined collection of user groups (referred to as collusion sets). Since the security input sets and collusion sets can be arbitrarily defined, our formulation offers a flexible framework for addressing heterogeneous security requirements in HSA. We characterize the optimal total key rate, i.e., the total number of independent key symbols required to ensure both server and relay security, for a broad range of parameter configurations. For the remaining cases, we establish lower and upper bounds on the optimal key rate, providing constant-factor gap optimality guarantees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoping Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) surrogate models are increasingly used in engineering analysis and design to replace computationally expensive simulation models, significantly reducing computational cost and accelerating decision-making processes. However, ML predictions contain inherent errors, often estimated as model uncertainty, which is coupled with variability in model inputs. Accurately quantifying and propagating these combined uncertainties is essential for generating reliable engineering predictions. This paper presents a robust framework based on Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) to handle joint input and model uncertainty propagation. While the approach applies broadly to general ML surrogates, we focus on Gaussian Process regression models, which provide explicit predictive distributions for model uncertainty. By transforming all random inputs into a unified standard space, a PCE surrogate model is constructed, allowing efficient and accurate calculation of the mean and standard deviation of the output. The proposed methodology also offers a mechanism for global sensitivity analysis, enabling the accurate quantification of the individual contributions of input variables and ML model uncertainty to the overall output variability. This approach provides a computationally efficient and interpretable framework for comprehensive uncertainty quantification, supporting trustworthy ML predictions in downstream engineering applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junliang Luo, Katrin Tinn, Samuel Ferreira Duran, Di Wu, Xue Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Tokenized U.S. Treasuries have emerged as a prominent subclass of real-world assets (RWAs), offering cryptographically enforced, yield-bearing instruments collateralized by sovereign debt and deployed across multiple blockchain networks. While the market has expanded rapidly, empirical analyses of transaction-level behaviour remain limited. This paper conducts a quantitative, function-level dissection of U.S. Treasury-backed RWA tokens including BUIDL, BENJI, and USDY, across multi-chain: mostly Ethereum and Layer-2s. We analyze decoded contract calls to isolate core functional primitives such as issuance, redemption, transfer, and bridge activity, revealing segmentation in behaviour between institutional actors and retail users. To model address-level economic roles, we introduce a curvature-aware representation learning framework using Poincar\'e embeddings and liquidity-based graph features. Our method outperforms baseline models on our RWA Treasury dataset in role inference and generalizes to downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and wallet classification in broader blockchain transaction networks. These findings provide a structured understanding of functional heterogeneity and participant roles in tokenized Treasury in a transaction-level perspective, contributing new empirical evidence to the study of on-chain financialization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pan Peng, Hangyu Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of releasing a differentially private (DP) synthetic graph $G'$ that well approximates the triangle-motif sizes of all cuts of any given graph $G$, where a motif in general refers to a frequently occurring subgraph within complex networks. Non-private versions of such graphs have found applications in diverse fields such as graph clustering, graph sparsification, and social network analysis. Specifically, we present the first $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP mechanism that, given an input graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges and local sensitivity of triangles $\ell_{3}(G)$, generates a synthetic graph $G'$ in polynomial time, approximating the triangle-motif sizes of all cuts $(S,V\setminus S)$ of the input graph $G$ up to an additive error of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{m\ell_{3}(G)}n/\varepsilon^{3/2})$. Additionally, we provide a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{mn}\ell_{3}(G)/\varepsilon)$ on the additive error for any DP algorithm that answers the triangle-motif size queries of all $(S,T)$-cut of $G$. Finally, our algorithm generalizes to weighted graphs, and our lower bound extends to any $K_h$-motif cut for any constant $h\geq 2$.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose an all-in-one video restoration framework that grounds degradation-aware semantic context of video frames in natural language via foundation models, offering interpretable and flexible guidance. Unlike prior art, our method assumes no degradation knowledge in train or test time and learns an approximation to the grounded knowledge such that the foundation model can be safely disentangled during inference adding no extra cost. Further, we call for standardization of benchmarks in all-in-one video restoration, and propose two benchmarks in multi-degradation setting, three-task (3D) and four-task (4D), and two time-varying composite degradation benchmarks; one of the latter being our proposed dataset with varying snow intensity, simulating how weather degradations affect videos naturally. We compare our method with prior works and report state-of-the-art performance on all benchmarks.</p>

Despite its potential, FL faces significant challenges, particularly in terms of communication overhead and data privacy. Privacy-preserving Techniques (PPTs) such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) have been used to mitigate these concerns.

In this work, we explore how Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE), a cryptographic protocol that combines symmetric encryption with HE, can be effectively integrated with FL to address both communication and privacy challenges, paving the way for scalable and secure decentralized learning system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Armin Keki\'c, Jan Schneider, Dieter B\"uchler, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf, Michel Besserve</p>
<p>Abstract: Why do reinforcement learning (RL) policies fail or succeed? This is a challenging question due to the complex, high-dimensional nature of agent-environment interactions. In this work, we take a causal perspective on explaining the behavior of RL policies by viewing the states, actions, and rewards as variables in a low-level causal model. We introduce random perturbations to policy actions during execution and observe their effects on the cumulative reward, learning a simplified high-level causal model that explains these relationships. To this end, we develop a nonlinear Causal Model Reduction framework that ensures approximate interventional consistency, meaning the simplified high-level model responds to interventions in a similar way as the original complex system. We prove that for a class of nonlinear causal models, there exists a unique solution that achieves exact interventional consistency, ensuring learned explanations reflect meaningful causal patterns. Experiments on both synthetic causal models and practical RL tasks-including pendulum control and robot table tennis-demonstrate that our approach can uncover important behavioral patterns, biases, and failure modes in trained RL policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Ayomide Olanrewaju</p>
<p>Abstract: This research introduces the Theory of Partial Symmetry Enforced Attention Decomposition (PSEAD), a new and rigorous group-theoretic framework designed to seamlessly integrate local symmetry awareness into the core architecture of self-attention mechanisms within Transformer models. We formalize the concept of local permutation subgroup actions on windows of biological data, proving that under such actions, the attention mechanism naturally decomposes into a direct sum of orthogonal irreducible components. Critically, these components are intrinsically aligned with the irreducible representations of the acting permutation subgroup, thereby providing a powerful mathematical basis for disentangling symmetric and asymmetric features. We show that PSEAD offers substantial advantages. These include enhanced generalization capabilities to novel biological motifs exhibiting similar partial symmetries, unprecedented interpretability by allowing direct visualization and analysis of attention contributions from different symmetry channels, and significant computational efficiency gains by focusing representational capacity on relevant symmetric subspaces. Beyond static data analysis, we extend PSEAD's applicability to dynamic biological processes within reinforcement learning paradigms, showcasing its potential to accelerate the discovery and optimization of biologically meaningful policies in complex environments like protein folding and drug discovery. This work lays the groundwork for a new generation of biologically informed, symmetry-aware artificial intelligence models.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14946">FullRecall: A Semantic Search-Based Ranking Approach for Maximizing Recall in Patent Retrieval</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Amna Ali, Liyanage C. De Silva, Pg Emeroylariffion Abas</p>
<p>Abstract: Patent examiners and inventors face significant pressure to verify the originality and non-obviousness of inventions, and the intricate nature of patent data intensifies the challenges of patent retrieval. Therefore, there is a pressing need to devise cutting-edge retrieval strategies that can reliably achieve the desired recall. This study introduces FullRecall, a novel patent retrieval approach that effectively manages the complexity of patent data while maintaining the reliability of relevance matching and maximising recall. It leverages IPC-guided knowledge to generate informative phrases, which are processed to extract key information in the form of noun phrases characterising the query patent under observation. From these, the top k keyphrases are selected to construct a query for retrieving a focused subset of the dataset. This initial retrieval step achieves complete recall, successfully capturing all relevant documents. To further refine the results, a ranking scheme is applied to the retrieved subset, reducing its size while maintaining 100% recall. This multi-phase process demonstrates an effective strategy for balancing precision and recall in patent retrieval tasks. Comprehensive experiments were conducted, and the results were compared with baseline studies, namely HRR2 [1] and ReQ-ReC [2]. The proposed approach yielded superior results, achieving 100% recall in all five test cases. However, HRR2[1] recall values across the five test cases were 10%, 25%, 33.3%, 0%, and 14.29%, while ReQ-ReC [2] showed 50% for the first test case, 25% for the second test case, and 0% for the third, fourth, and fifth test cases. The 100% recall ensures that no relevant prior art is overlooked, thereby strengthening the patent pre-filing and examination processes, hence reducing potential legal risks.</p>

This study conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of robust statistical methods and advanced machine learning techniques for real-time anomaly identification in cryptocurrency LOBs. Within a unified testing environment, named AITA Order Book Signal (AITA-OBS), we evaluate the efficacy of thirteen diverse models to identify which approaches are most suitable for detecting potentially manipulative trading behaviours. An empirical evaluation, conducted via backtesting on a dataset of 26,204 records from a major exchange, demonstrates that the top-performing model, Empirical Covariance (EC), achieves a 6.70% gain, significantly outperforming a standard Buy-and-Hold benchmark. These findings underscore the effectiveness of outlier-driven strategies and provide insights into the trade-offs between model complexity, trade frequency, and performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Zhang, An Zhang, XiuYu Zhang, Leheng Sheng, Yuxin Chen, Zhenkai Liang, Xiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite possessing latent safety understanding from their vast pretraining data, remain vulnerable to generating harmful content and exhibit issues such as over-refusal and utility degradation after safety alignment. Current safety alignment methods often result in superficial refusal shortcuts or rely on intensive supervision for reasoning-based approaches, failing to fully leverage the model's intrinsic safety self-awareness. We propose \textbf{AlphaAlign}, a simple yet effective pure reinforcement learning (RL) framework with verifiable safety reward designed to incentivize this latent safety awareness through proactive safety reasoning.} AlphaAlign employs a dual-reward system: a verifiable safety reward encourages correctly formatted and explicitly justified refusals for harmful queries while penalizing over-refusals, and a normalized helpfulness reward guides high-quality responses to benign inputs. This allows the model to develop proactive safety reasoning capabilities without depending on supervised safety-specific reasoning data. AlphaAlign demonstrates three key advantages: (1) Simplicity and efficiency, requiring only binary prompt safety labels and minimal RL steps for substantial improvements. (2) Breaking the safety-utility trade-off, by enhancing refusal of harmful content and reducing over-refusals, while simultaneously maintaining or even improving general task performance and robustness to unseen jailbreaks. (3) Deep alignment, fostering proactive safety reasoning that generates explicit safety rationales rather than relying on shallow refusal patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roy H. Jennings, Genady Paikin, Roy Shaul, Evgeny Soloveichik</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for image-based regression tasks, but current approaches face key limitations. Recent methods fine-tune MLLMs using preset output vocabularies and generic task-level prompts (e.g., "How would you rate this image?"), assuming this mimics human rating behavior. Our analysis reveals these approaches provide no benefit over image-only training. Models using preset vocabularies and generic prompts perform equivalently to image-only models, failing to leverage semantic understanding from textual input. We propose Regression via Transformer-Based Classification (RvTC), which replaces vocabulary-constrained classification with a flexible bin-based approach. Unlike approaches that address discretization errors through complex distributional modeling, RvTC eliminates manual vocabulary crafting through straightforward bin increase, achieving state-of-the-art performance on four image assessment datasets using only images. More importantly, we demonstrate that data-specific prompts dramatically improve performance. Unlike generic task descriptions, prompts containing semantic information about specific images enable MLLMs to leverage cross-modal understanding. On the AVA dataset, adding challenge titles to prompts improves correlations from 0.83 to 0.90, a new state-of-the-art. We demonstrate through empirical evidence from the AVA and AGIQA-3k datasets that MLLMs benefit from semantic prompt information surpassing mere statistical biases. This underscores the importance of incorporating meaningful textual context in multimodal regression tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Li, Haoxiang Zhang, Ahmed E. Hassan</p>
<p>Abstract: The future of software engineering--SE 3.0--is unfolding with the rise of AI teammates: autonomous, goal-driven systems collaborating with human developers. Among these, autonomous coding agents are especially transformative, now actively initiating, reviewing, and evolving code at scale. This paper introduces AIDev, the first large-scale dataset capturing how such agents operate in the wild. Spanning over 456,000 pull requests by five leading agents--OpenAI Codex, Devin, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code--across 61,000 repositories and 47,000 developers, AIDev provides an unprecedented empirical foundation for studying autonomous teammates in software development.
  Unlike prior work that has largely theorized the rise of AI-native software engineering, AIDev offers structured, open data to support research in benchmarking, agent readiness, optimization, collaboration modeling, and AI governance. The dataset includes rich metadata on PRs, authorship, review timelines, code changes, and integration outcomes--enabling exploration beyond synthetic benchmarks like SWE-bench. For instance, although agents often outperform humans in speed, their PRs are accepted less frequently, revealing a trust and utility gap. Furthermore, while agents accelerate code submission--one developer submitted as many PRs in three days as they had in three years--these are structurally simpler (via code complexity metrics).
  We envision AIDev as a living resource: extensible, analyzable, and ready for the SE and AI communities. Grounding SE 3.0 in real-world evidence, AIDev enables a new generation of research into AI-native workflows and supports building the next wave of symbiotic human-AI collaboration.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soheil Radfar, Faezeh Maghsoodifar, Hamed Moftakhari, Hamid Moradkhani</p>
<p>Abstract: Coastal communities increasingly face compound floods, where multiple drivers like storm surge, high tide, heavy rainfall, and river discharge occur together or in sequence to produce impacts far greater than any single driver alone. Traditional hydrodynamic models can provide accurate physics-based simulations but require substantial computational resources for real-time applications or risk assessments, while machine learning alternatives often sacrifice physical consistency for speed, producing unrealistic predictions during extreme events. This study addresses these challenges by developing ALPINE (All-in-one Physics Informed Neural Emulator), a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework to enforce complete shallow water dynamics in compound flood modeling. Unlike previous approaches that implement partial constraints, our framework simultaneously enforces mass conservation and both momentum equations, ensuring full adherence to Newton's laws throughout the prediction process. The model integrates a convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with ConvLSTM temporal processing, trained using a composite loss function that balances data fidelity with physics-based residuals. Using six historical storm events (four for training, one for validation, and one held-out for unseen testing), we observe substantial improvements over baseline neural networks. ALPINE reduces domain-averaged prediction errors and improves model skill metrics for water surface elevation and velocity components. Physics-informed constraints prove most valuable during peak storm intensity, when multiple flood drivers interact and reliable predictions matter most. This approach yields a physically consistent emulator capable of supporting compound-flood forecasting and large-scale risk analyses while preserving physical realism essential for coastal emergency management.</p>

<p>Abstract: The discovery of fast and variable coherent signals in a handful of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) testifies to the presence of super-Eddington accreting neutron stars, and drastically changed the understanding of the ULX class. Our capability of discovering pulsations in ULXs is limited, among others, by poor statistics. However, catalogues and archives of high-energy missions contain information which can be used to identify new candidate pulsating ULXs (PULXs). The goal of this research is to single out candidate PULXs among those ULXs which have not shown pulsations due to an unfavourable combination of factors. We applied an AI approach to an updated database of ULXs detected by XMM-Newton. We first used an unsupervised clustering algorithm to sort out sources with similar characteristics into two clusters. Then, the sample of known PULX observations has been used to set the separation threshold between the two clusters and to identify the one containing the new candidate PULXs. We found that only a few criteria are needed to assign the membership of an observation to one of the two clusters. The cluster of new candidate PULXs counts 85 unique sources for 355 observations, with $\sim$85% of these new candidates having multiple observations. A preliminary timing analysis found no new pulsations for these candidates. This work presents a sample of new candidate PULXs observed by XMM-Newton, the properties of which are similar (in a multi-dimensional phase space) to those of the known PULXs, despite the absence of pulsations in their light curves. While this result is a clear example of the predictive power of AI-based methods, it also highlights the need for high-statistics observational data to reveal coherent signals from the sources in this sample and thus validate the robustness of the approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijun Zeng, Youjia Zheng, Hao Hu, Zeyuan Dong, Yihang Zheng, Xinliang Liu, Jinzhuo Wang, Zuoqiang Shi, Linfeng Zhang, Yubing Li, He Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of wave equations is crucial in computational wave imaging applications, such as ultrasound computed tomography (USCT), which reconstructs tissue material properties from observed scattered waves. Traditional numerical solvers for wave equations are computationally intensive and often unstable, limiting their practical applications for quasi-real-time image reconstruction. Neural operators offer an innovative approach by accelerating PDE solving using neural networks; however, their effectiveness in realistic imaging is limited because existing datasets oversimplify real-world complexity. In this paper, we present OpenBreastUS, a large-scale wave equation dataset designed to bridge the gap between theoretical equations and practical imaging applications. OpenBreastUS includes 8,000 anatomically realistic human breast phantoms and over 16 million frequency-domain wave simulations using real USCT configurations. It enables a comprehensive benchmarking of popular neural operators for both forward simulation and inverse imaging tasks, allowing analysis of their performance, scalability, and generalization capabilities. By offering a realistic and extensive dataset, OpenBreastUS not only serves as a platform for developing innovative neural PDE solvers but also facilitates their deployment in real-world medical imaging problems. For the first time, we demonstrate efficient in vivo imaging of the human breast using neural operator solvers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ian Hardgrove, John D. Hastings</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental problem in cybersecurity and computer science is determining whether a program is free of bugs and vulnerabilities. Fuzzing, a popular approach to discovering vulnerabilities in programs, has several advantages over alternative strategies, although it has investment costs in the form of initial setup and continuous maintenance. The choice of fuzzing is further complicated when only a binary library is available, such as the case of closed-source and proprietary software. In response, we introduce LibLMFuzz, a framework that reduces costs associated with fuzzing closed-source libraries by pairing an agentic Large Language Model (LLM) with a lightweight tool-chain (disassembler/compiler/fuzzer) to autonomously analyze stripped binaries, plan fuzz strategies, generate drivers, and iteratively self-repair build or runtime errors. Tested on four widely-used Linux libraries, LibLMFuzz produced syntactically correct drivers for all 558 fuzz-able API functions, achieving 100% API coverage with no human intervention. Across the 1601 synthesized drivers, 75.52% were nominally correct on first execution. The results show that LLM-augmented middleware holds promise in reducing the costs of fuzzing black box components and provides a foundation for future research efforts. Future opportunities exist for research in branch coverage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyue Zhu, Binghao Huang, Yunzhu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Handheld grippers are increasingly used to collect human demonstrations due to their ease of deployment and versatility. However, most existing designs lack tactile sensing, despite the critical role of tactile feedback in precise manipulation. We present a portable, lightweight gripper with integrated tactile sensors that enables synchronized collection of visual and tactile data in diverse, real-world, and in-the-wild settings. Building on this hardware, we propose a cross-modal representation learning framework that integrates visual and tactile signals while preserving their distinct characteristics. The learning procedure allows the emergence of interpretable representations that consistently focus on contacting regions relevant for physical interactions. When used for downstream manipulation tasks, these representations enable more efficient and effective policy learning, supporting precise robotic manipulation based on multimodal feedback. We validate our approach on fine-grained tasks such as test tube insertion and pipette-based fluid transfer, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness under external disturbances.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chloe Pomeroy, Aleksandar Pramov, Karishma Thakrar, Lakshmi Yendapalli</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the applications of quantum annealing (QA) and classical simulated annealing (SA) to a suite of combinatorial optimization problems in machine learning, namely feature selection, instance selection, and clustering. We formulate each task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and implement both quantum and classical solvers to compare their effectiveness. For feature selection, we propose several QUBO configurations that balance feature importance and redundancy, showing that quantum annealing (QA) produces solutions that are computationally more efficient. In instance selection, we propose a few novel heuristics for instance-level importance measures that extend existing methods. For clustering, we embed a classical-to-quantum pipeline, using classical clustering followed by QUBO-based medoid refinement, and demonstrate consistent improvements in cluster compactness and retrieval metrics. Our results suggest that QA can be a competitive and efficient tool for discrete machine learning optimization, even within the constraints of current quantum hardware.</p>

The new SPINUP method extracts the unfolded distribution based on a neural network encoding the forward mapping, making it independent of the prior from the simulated training data. It is made efficient through neural importance sampling, and ensembling can be used to estimate the effect of information loss in the forward process. We showcase SPINUP for unfolding detector effects on jet substructure observables and for unfolding to parton level of associated Higgs and single-top production.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subhroshekhar Ghosh, Soumendu Sundar Mukherjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Group or cluster structure on explanatory variables in machine learning problems is a very general phenomenon, which has attracted broad interest from practitioners and theoreticians alike. In this work we contribute an approach to sparse learning under such group structure, that does not require prior information on the group identities. Our paradigm is motivated by the Laplacian geometry of an underlying network with a related community structure, and proceeds by directly incorporating this into a penalty that is effectively computed via a heat-flow-based local network dynamics. The proposed penalty interpolates between the lasso and the group lasso penalties, the runtime of the heat-flow dynamics being the interpolating parameter. As such it can automatically default to lasso when the group structure reflected in the Laplacian is weak. In fact, we demonstrate a data-driven procedure to construct such a network based on the available data. Notably, we dispense with computationally intensive pre-processing involving clustering of variables, spectral or otherwise. Our technique is underpinned by rigorous theorems that guarantee its effective performance and provide bounds on its sample complexity. In particular, in a wide range of settings, it provably suffices to run the diffusion for time that is only logarithmic in the problem dimensions. We explore in detail the interfaces of our approach with key statistical physics models in network science, such as the Gaussian Free Field and the Stochastic Block Model. Our work raises the possibility of applying similar diffusion-based techniques to classical learning tasks, exploiting the interplay between geometric, dynamical and stochastic structures underlying the data.</p>

<p>Abstract: One of the main challenges in the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) loop closure problem is the recognition of previously visited places. In this work, we tackle the two main problems of real-time SLAM systems: 1) loop closure detection accuracy and 2) real-time computation constraints on the embedded hardware. Our LoopNet method is based on a multitasking variant of the classical ResNet architecture, adapted for online retraining on a dynamic visual dataset and optimized for embedded devices. The online retraining is designed using a few-shot learning approach. The architecture provides both an index into the queried visual dataset, and a measurement of the prediction quality. Moreover, by leveraging DISK (DIStinctive Keypoints) descriptors, LoopNet surpasses the limitations of handcrafted features and traditional deep learning methods, offering better performance under varying conditions. Code is available at https://github.com/RovisLab/LoopNet. Additinally, we introduce a new loop closure benchmarking dataset, coined LoopDB, which is available at https://github.com/RovisLab/LoopDB.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Szymon Mazurek, Stephen Moore, Alessandro Crimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Goal: Epilepsy remains under-diagnosed in low-income countries due to scarce neurologists and costly diagnostic tools. We propose a graph-based deep learning framework to detect epilepsy from low-cost Electroencephalography (EEG) hardware, tested on recordings from Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau. Our focus is on fair, accessible automatic assessment and explainability to shed light on epilepsy biomarkers. Methods: We model EEG signals as spatio-temporal graphs, classify them, and identify interchannel relationships and temporal dynamics using graph attention networks (GAT). To emphasize connectivity biomarkers, we adapt the inherently node-focused GAT to analyze edges. We also designed signal preprocessing for low-fidelity recordings and a lightweight GAT architecture trained on Google Colab and deployed on RaspberryPi devices. Results: The approach achieves promising classification performance, outperforming a standard classifier based on random forest and graph convolutional networks in terms of accuracy and robustness over multiple sessions, but also highlighting specific connections in the fronto-temporal region. Conclusions: The results highlight the potential of GATs to provide insightful and scalable diagnostic support for epilepsy in underserved regions, paving the way for affordable and accessible neurodiagnostic tools.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a communication-efficient, event-triggered inference framework for cooperative edge AI systems comprising multiple user devices and edge servers. Building upon dual-threshold early-exit strategies for rare-event detection, the proposed approach extends classical single-device inference to a distributed, multi-device setting while incorporating proportional fairness constraints across users. A joint optimization framework is formulated to maximize classification utility under communication, energy, and fairness constraints. To solve the resulting problem efficiently, we exploit the monotonicity of the utility function with respect to the confidence thresholds and apply alternating optimization with Benders decomposition. Experimental results show that the proposed framework significantly enhances system-wide performance and fairness in resource allocation compared to single-device baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian A. Cruz Romero, Misael J. Mercado Hernandez, Samir Y. Ali Rivera, Jorge A. Santiago Fernandez, Wilfredo E. Lugo Beauchamp</p>
<p>Abstract: The design of medical systems for remote, resource-limited environments faces persistent challenges due to poor interoperability, lack of offline support, and dependency on costly infrastructure. Many existing digital health solutions neglect these constraints, limiting their effectiveness for frontline health workers in underserved regions. This paper presents a portable, edge-enabled Electronic Health Record platform optimized for offline-first operation, secure patient data management, and modular diagnostic integration. Running on small-form factor embedded devices, it provides AES-256 encrypted local storage with optional cloud synchronization for interoperability. As a use case, we integrated a non-invasive anemia screening module leveraging fingernail pallor analysis. Trained on 250 patient cases (27\% anemia prevalence) with KDE-balanced data, the Random Forest model achieved a test RMSE of 1.969 g/dL and MAE of 1.490 g/dL. A severity-based model reached 79.2\% sensitivity. To optimize performance, a YOLOv8n-based nail bed detector was quantized to INT8, reducing inference latency from 46.96 ms to 21.50 ms while maintaining mAP@0.5 at 0.995. The system emphasizes low-cost deployment, modularity, and data privacy compliance (HIPAA/GDPR), addressing critical barriers to digital health adoption in disconnected settings. Our work demonstrates a scalable approach to enhance portable health information systems and support frontline healthcare in underserved regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingbo Li, Anuradha Mathrani, Teo Susnjak</p>
<p>Abstract: Automating data extraction from full-text randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for meta-analysis remains a significant challenge. This study evaluates the practical performance of three LLMs (Gemini-2.0-flash, Grok-3, GPT-4o-mini) across tasks involving statistical results, risk-of-bias assessments, and study-level characteristics in three medical domains: hypertension, diabetes, and orthopaedics. We tested four distinct prompting strategies (basic prompting, self-reflective prompting, model ensemble, and customised prompts) to determine how to improve extraction quality. All models demonstrate high precision but consistently suffer from poor recall by omitting key information. We found that customised prompts were the most effective, boosting recall by up to 15\%. Based on this analysis, we propose a three-tiered set of guidelines for using LLMs in data extraction, matching data types to appropriate levels of automation based on task complexity and risk. Our study offers practical advice for automating data extraction in real-world meta-analyses, balancing LLM efficiency with expert oversight through targeted, task-specific automation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroshi Tamano, Hideitsu Hino, Daichi Mochihashi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multidimensional item response theory is a statistical test theory used to estimate the latent skills of learners and the difficulty levels of problems based on test results. Both compensatory and non-compensatory models have been proposed in the literature. Previous studies have revealed the substantial underestimation of higher skills when the non-compensatory model is misspecified as the compensatory model. However, the underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon has not been fully elucidated. It remains unclear whether overestimation also occurs and whether issues arise regarding the variance of the estimated parameters. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of both underestimation and overestimation through a theoretical approach. In addition to the previously identified underestimation of the skills, we newly discover that the overestimation of skills occurs around the origin. Furthermore, we investigate the extent to which the asymptotic variance of the estimated parameters differs when considering model misspecification compared to when it is not taken into account.</p>

<p>Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in intelligence, performing comparably to human experts on complex reasoning tasks such as coding and mathematical reasoning. However, generating formal proofs in specialized languages like Lean 4 remains a significant challenge for these models, limiting their application in complex theorem proving and automated verification. Current approaches typically require specializing models through fine-tuning on dedicated formal corpora, incurring high costs for data collection and training. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Delta Prover}, an agent-based framework that orchestrates the interaction between a general-purpose LLM and the Lean 4 proof environment. Delta Prover leverages the reflection and reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs to interactively construct formal proofs in Lean 4, circumventing the need for model specialization. At its core, the agent integrates two novel, interdependent components: an algorithmic framework for reflective decomposition and iterative proof repair, and a custom Domain-Specific Language (DSL) built upon Lean 4 for streamlined subproblem management. \textbf{Delta Prover achieves a state-of-the-art 95.9\% success rate on the miniF2F-test benchmark, surpassing all existing approaches, including those requiring model specialization.} Furthermore, Delta Prover exhibits a significantly stronger test-time scaling law compared to standard Best-of-N proof strategies. Crucially, our findings demonstrate that general-purpose LLMs, when guided by an effective agentic structure, possess substantial untapped theorem-proving capabilities. This presents a computationally efficient alternative to specialized models for robust automated reasoning in formal environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minwoo Kim, Sungkyu Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances have sparked significant interest in the development of privacy-preserving Principal Component Analysis (PCA). However, many existing approaches rely on restrictive assumptions, such as assuming sub-Gaussian data or being vulnerable to data contamination. Additionally, some methods are computationally expensive or depend on unknown model parameters that must be estimated, limiting their accessibility for data analysts seeking privacy-preserving PCA. In this paper, we propose a differentially private PCA method applicable to heavy-tailed and potentially contaminated data. Our approach leverages the property that the covariance matrix of properly rescaled data preserves eigenvectors and their order under elliptical distributions, which include Gaussian and heavy-tailed distributions. By applying a bounded transformation, we enable straightforward computation of principal components in a differentially private manner. Additionally, boundedness guarantees robustness against data contamination. We conduct both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations of the proposed method, focusing on its ability to recover the subspace spanned by the leading principal components. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of statistical utility, particularly in non-Gaussian or contaminated data settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Design of Experiments (DOEs) is a fundamental scientific methodology that provides researchers with systematic principles and techniques to enhance the validity, reliability, and efficiency of experimental outcomes. In this study, we explore optimal experimental design within a Bayesian framework, utilizing Bayes' theorem to reformulate the utility expectation--originally expressed as a nested double integral--into an independent double integral form, significantly improving numerical efficiency. To further accelerate the computation of the proposed utility expectation, conditional density estimation is employed to approximate the ratio of two Gaussian random fields, while covariance serves as a selection criterion to identify informative datasets during model fitting and integral evaluation. In scenarios characterized by low simulation efficiency and high costs of raw data acquisition, key challenges such as surrogate modeling, failure probability estimation, and parameter inference are systematically restructured within the Bayesian experimental design framework. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is validated through both theoretical analysis and practical applications, demonstrating its potential for enhancing experimental efficiency and decision-making under uncertainty.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work investigates the impact of multi-task, multi-lingual, and multi-source learning approaches on the robustness and performance of pretrained language models. To enhance this analysis, we introduce Subsets of Interest (SOI), a novel categorization framework that identifies six distinct learning behavior patterns during training, including forgettable examples, unlearned examples, and always correct examples. Through SOI transition heatmaps and dataset cartography visualization, we analyze how examples shift between these categories when transitioning from single-setting to multi-setting configurations. We perform comprehensive experiments across three parallel comparisons: multi-task vs. single-task learning using English tasks (entailment, paraphrase, sentiment), multi-source vs. single-source learning using sentiment analysis datasets, and multi-lingual vs. single-lingual learning using intent classification in French, English, and Persian. Our results demonstrate that multi-source learning consistently improves out-of-distribution performance by up to 7%, while multi-task learning shows mixed results with notable gains in similar task combinations. We further introduce a two-stage fine-tuning approach where the second stage leverages SOI-based subset selection to achieve additional performance improvements. These findings provide new insights into training dynamics and offer practical approaches for optimizing multi-setting language model performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the progress in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL), a model pre-trained with DINO combined with a prototypical classifier outperforms the latest SOTA methods. A crucial limitation that needs to be overcome is that updating too many parameters of the transformers leads to overfitting due to the scarcity of labeled samples. To address this challenge, we propose a new concept, Coalescent Projection (CP), as an effective successor to soft prompts. Additionally, we propose a novel pseudo-class generation method combined with Self-Supervised Transformations (SSTs) that relies solely on the base domain to prepare the network for encountering unseen samples from different domains. The proposed method exhibits its effectiveness in comprehensive experiments on the extreme domain shift scenario of the BSCD-FSL benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaochen Guo, Zhixiang Shen, Xuanting Xie, Liangjian Wen, Zhao Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal graphs, which integrate unstructured heterogeneous data with structured interconnections, offer substantial real-world utility but remain insufficiently explored in unsupervised learning. In this work, we initiate the study of multimodal graph clustering, aiming to bridge this critical gap. Through empirical analysis, we observe that real-world multimodal graphs often exhibit hybrid neighborhood patterns, combining both homophilic and heterophilic relationships. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework -- \textsc{Disentangled Multimodal Graph Clustering (DMGC)} -- which decomposes the original hybrid graph into two complementary views: (1) a homophily-enhanced graph that captures cross-modal class consistency, and (2) heterophily-aware graphs that preserve modality-specific inter-class distinctions. We introduce a \emph{Multimodal Dual-frequency Fusion} mechanism that jointly filters these disentangled graphs through a dual-pass strategy, enabling effective multimodal integration while mitigating category confusion. Our self-supervised alignment objectives further guide the learning process without requiring labels. Extensive experiments on both multimodal and multi-relational graph datasets demonstrate that DMGC achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability across diverse settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deyun Zhang, Xiang Lan, Shijia Geng, Qinghao Zhao, Sumei Fan, Mengling Feng, Shenda Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a foundational role in modern cardiovascular care, enabling non-invasive diagnosis of arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and conduction disorders. While machine learning has achieved expert-level performance in ECG interpretation, the development of clinically deployable multimodal AI systems remains constrained, primarily due to the lack of publicly available datasets that simultaneously incorporate raw signals, diagnostic images, and interpretation text. Most existing ECG datasets provide only single-modality data or, at most, dual modalities, making it difficult to build models that can understand and integrate diverse ECG information in real-world settings. To address this gap, we introduce MEETI (MIMIC-IV-Ext ECG-Text-Image), the first large-scale ECG dataset that synchronizes raw waveform data, high-resolution plotted images, and detailed textual interpretations generated by large language models. In addition, MEETI includes beat-level quantitative ECG parameters extracted from each lead, offering structured parameters that support fine-grained analysis and model interpretability. Each MEETI record is aligned across four components: (1) the raw ECG waveform, (2) the corresponding plotted image, (3) extracted feature parameters, and (4) detailed interpretation text. This alignment is achieved using consistent, unique identifiers. This unified structure supports transformer-based multimodal learning and supports fine-grained, interpretable reasoning about cardiac health.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyung-Bin Kwon, Sayak Mukherjee, Ramij R. Hossain, Marcelo Elizondo</p>
<p>Abstract: This letter develops a novel physics-informed neural ordinary differential equations-based framework to emulate the proprietary dynamics of the inverters -- essential for improved accuracy in grid dynamic simulations. In current industry practice, the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) often do not disclose the exact internal controls and parameters of the inverters, posing significant challenges in performing accurate dynamic simulations and other relevant studies, such as gain tunings for stability analysis and controls. To address this, we propose a Physics-Informed Latent Neural ODE Model (PI-LNM) that integrates system physics with neural learning layers to capture the unmodeled behaviors of proprietary units. The proposed method is validated using a grid-forming inverter (GFM) case study, demonstrating improved dynamic simulation accuracy over approaches that rely solely on data-driven learning without physics-based guidance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuangyu Ding, Kim-Chuan Toh</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problem defined over nonconvex constraints, where the feasible set is given by the intersection of the closure of an open set and a smooth manifold. By endowing the open set with a Riemannian metric induced by a barrier function, we obtain a Riemannian subgradient flow formulated as a differential inclusion, which remains strictly within the interior of the feasible set. This continuous dynamical system unifies two classes of iterative optimization methods, namely the Hessian barrier method and mirror descent scheme, by revealing that these methods can be interpreted as discrete approximations of the continuous flow. We explore the long-term behavior of the trajectories generated by this dynamical system and show that the existing deficient convergence properties of the Hessian barrier and mirror descent scheme can be unifily and more insightfully interpreted through these of the continuous trajectory. For instance, the notorious spurious stationary points \cite{chen2024spurious} observed in Hessian barrier method and mirror descent scheme are interpreted as stable equilibria of the dynamical system that do not correspond to real stationary points of the original optimization problem. We provide two sufficient condition such that these spurious stationary points can be avoided if the strict complementarity conditions holds. In the absence of these regularity condition, we propose a random perturbation strategy that ensures the trajectory converges (subsequentially) to an approximate stationary point. Building on these insights, we introduce two iterative Riemannian subgradient methods, form of interior point methods, that generalizes the existing Hessian barrier method and mirror descent scheme for solving nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problems.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15319">Language Generation in the Limit: Noise, Loss, and Feedback</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yannan Bai, Debmalya Panigrahi, Ian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Kleinberg and Mullainathan (2024) recently proposed a formal framework called language generation in the limit and showed that given a sequence of example strings from an unknown target language drawn from any countable collection, an algorithm can correctly generate unseen strings from the target language within finite time. This notion was further refined by Li, Raman, and Tewari (2024), who defined stricter categories of non-uniform and uniform generation. They showed that a finite union of uniformly generatable collections is generatable in the limit, and asked if the same is true for non-uniform generation.
  We begin by resolving the question in the negative: we give a uniformly generatable collection and a non-uniformly generatable collection whose union is not generatable in the limit. We then use facets of this construction to further our understanding of several variants of language generation. The first two, generation with noise and without samples, were introduced by Raman and Raman (2025) and Li, Raman, and Tewari (2024) respectively. We show the equivalence of these models for uniform and non-uniform generation, and provide a characterization of non-uniform noisy generation. The former paper asked if there is any separation between noisy and non-noisy generation in the limit -- we show that such a separation exists even with a single noisy string. Finally, we study the framework of generation with feedback, introduced by Charikar and Pabbaraju (2025), where the algorithm is strengthened by allowing it to ask membership queries. We show finite queries add no power, but infinite queries yield a strictly more powerful model.
  In summary, the results in this paper resolve the union-closedness of language generation in the limit, and leverage those techniques (and others) to give precise characterizations for natural variants that incorporate noise, loss, and feedback.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern moderation systems increasingly support multiple languages, but often fail to address localisation and low-resource variants - creating safety gaps in real-world deployments. Small models offer a potential alternative to large LLMs, yet still demand considerable data and compute. We present LionGuard 2, a lightweight, multilingual moderation classifier tailored to the Singapore context, supporting English, Chinese, Malay, and partial Tamil. Built on pre-trained OpenAI embeddings and a multi-head ordinal classifier, LionGuard 2 outperforms several commercial and open-source systems across 17 benchmarks, including both Singapore-specific and public English datasets. The system is actively deployed within the Singapore Government, demonstrating practical efficacy at scale. Our findings show that high-quality local data and robust multilingual embeddings can achieve strong moderation performance, without fine-tuning large models. We release our model weights and part of our training data to support future work on LLM safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Li, Yi-Chi Liao, Christian Holz</p>
<p>Abstract: Adjusting visual parameters such as brightness and contrast is common in our everyday experiences. Finding the optimal parameter setting is challenging due to the large search space and the lack of an explicit objective function, leaving users to rely solely on their implicit preferences. Prior work has explored Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO) to address this challenge, involving users to iteratively select preferred designs from candidate sets. However, PBO often requires many rounds of preference comparisons, making it more suitable for designers than everyday end-users. We propose Meta-PO, a novel method that integrates PBO with meta-learning to improve sample efficiency. Specifically, Meta-PO infers prior users' preferences and stores them as models, which are leveraged to intelligently suggest design candidates for the new users, enabling faster convergence and more personalized results. An experimental evaluation of our method for appearance design tasks on 2D and 3D content showed that participants achieved satisfactory appearance in 5.86 iterations using Meta-PO when participants shared similar goals with a population (e.g., tuning for a ``warm'' look) and in 8 iterations even generalizes across divergent goals (e.g., from ``vintage'', ``warm'', to ``holiday''). Meta-PO makes personalized visual optimization more applicable to end-users through a generalizable, more efficient optimization conditioned on preferences, with the potential to scale interface personalization more broadly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruifeng Zheng, Cong Chen, Shuang Wang, Yiming Liu, Lin You, Jindong Lu, Ruizhe Zhu, Guodao Zhang, Kejie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic, noncommunicable brain disorder, and sudden seizure onsets can significantly impact patients' quality of life and health. However, wearable seizure-predicting devices are still limited, partly due to the bulky size of EEG-collecting devices. To relieve the problem, we proposed a novel two-stage channel-aware Set Transformer Network that could perform seizure prediction with fewer EEG channel sensors. We also tested a seizure-independent division method which could prevent the adjacency of training and test data. Experiments were performed on the CHB-MIT dataset which includes 22 patients with 88 merged seizures. The mean sensitivity before channel selection was 76.4% with a false predicting rate (FPR) of 0.09/hour. After channel selection, dominant channels emerged in 20 out of 22 patients; the average number of channels was reduced to 2.8 from 18; and the mean sensitivity rose to 80.1% with an FPR of 0.11/hour. Furthermore, experimental results on the seizure-independent division supported our assertion that a more rigorous seizure-independent division should be used for patients with abundant EEG recordings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehdi Khalaj, Shahrzad Golestani Najafabadi, Julita Vassileva</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized News Recommendation systems (PNR) have emerged as a solution to information overload by predicting and suggesting news items tailored to individual user interests. However, traditional PNR systems face several challenges, including an overreliance on textual content, common neglect of short-term user interests, and significant privacy concerns due to centralized data storage. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a novel multimodal federated learning-based approach for news recommendation. First, it integrates both textual and visual features of news items using a multimodal model, enabling a more comprehensive representation of content. Second, it employs a time-aware model that balances users' long-term and short-term interests through multi-head self-attention networks, improving recommendation accuracy. Finally, to enhance privacy, a federated learning framework is implemented, enabling collaborative model training without sharing user data. The framework divides the recommendation model into a large server-maintained news model and a lightweight user model shared between the server and clients. The client requests news representations (vectors) and a user model from the central server, then computes gradients with user local data, and finally sends their locally computed gradients to the server for aggregation. The central server aggregates gradients to update the global user model and news model. The updated news model is further used to infer news representation by the server. To further safeguard user privacy, a secure aggregation algorithm based on Shamir's secret sharing is employed. Experiments on a real-world news dataset demonstrate strong performance compared to existing systems, representing a significant advancement in privacy-preserving personalized news recommendation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring reliable and rule-compliant behavior of autonomous agents in uncertain environments remains a fundamental challenge in modern robotics. Our work shows how neuro-symbolic systems, which integrate probabilistic, symbolic white-box reasoning models with deep learning methods, offer a powerful solution to this challenge. This enables the simultaneous consideration of explicit rules and neural models trained on noisy data, combining the strength of structured reasoning with flexible representations. To this end, we introduce the Constitutional Controller (CoCo), a novel framework designed to enhance the safety and reliability of agents by reasoning over deep probabilistic logic programs representing constraints such as those found in shared traffic spaces. Furthermore, we propose the concept of self-doubt, implemented as a probability density conditioned on doubt features such as travel velocity, employed sensors, or health factors. In a real-world aerial mobility study, we demonstrate CoCo's advantages for intelligent autonomous systems to learn appropriate doubts and navigate complex and uncertain environments safely and compliantly.</p>

Our approach is guaranteed to converge and shows superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods based on empirical tests on the challenging unconstrained and bound-constrained optimization problems from the CUTEst test set.</p>

<p>Abstract: Odometry is a critical task for autonomous systems for self-localization and navigation. We propose a novel LiDAR-Visual odometry framework that integrates LiDAR point clouds and images for accurate and robust pose estimation. Our method utilizes a dense-depth map estimated from point clouds and images through depth completion, and incorporates a multi-scale feature extraction network with attention mechanisms, enabling adaptive depth-aware representations. Furthermore, we leverage dense depth information to refine flow estimation and mitigate errors in occlusion-prone regions. Our hierarchical pose refinement module optimizes motion estimation progressively, ensuring robust predictions against dynamic environments and scale ambiguities. Comprehensive experiments on the KITTI odometry benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves similar or superior accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art visual and LiDAR odometry methods.</p>

Our engine allows developers to guide LLM generation of high-quality tasks consisting of complex user queries, simulation state and corresponding validation programs, tackling data availability and evaluation robustness challenges.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Carlesso, Maria Eliza Patulea, Moncef Garouani, Radu Tudor Ionescu, Josiane Mothe</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixup has become a popular augmentation strategy for image classification, yet its naive pixel-wise interpolation often produces unrealistic images that can hinder learning, particularly in high-stakes medical applications. We propose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a learned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a StyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation, we sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different classes and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition the generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that lie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale COVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101, EfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1 over traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for COVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup, delivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without disrupting existing training pipelines. We publicly release our code at https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix to foster reproducibility and further research.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Being-H0, a dexterous Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) trained on large-scale human videos. Existing VLAs struggle with complex manipulation tasks requiring high dexterity and generalize poorly to novel scenarios and tasks, primarily due to their reliance on synthetic data with significant sim-to-real gaps or teleoperated demonstrations lacking scale and diversity. To address this data bottleneck, we propose leveraging human hands as a foundation manipulator, capitalizing on the rich dexterity and scalability present in web data. Our approach centers on physical instruction tuning, a novel training paradigm that combines large-scale VLA pretraining from human videos, physical space alignment for 3D reasoning, and post-training adaptation for robotic tasks. Additionally, we introduce a part-level motion tokenization method which achieves millimeter-level reconstruction accuracy to model precise hand trajectories for action learning. To support our proposed paradigm, we further develop a comprehensive data curation pipeline that integrates heterogeneous sources -- including motion capture, VR, and RGB-only videos -- into a large-scale dataset with millions of motion-based instructional instances. We empirically show the excellence of Being-H0 in hand motion generation and instruction following, and it also scales well with model and data sizes. Importantly, we observe the expected gains of Being-H0 in real-world robotic manipulation as physical instruction tuning is applied.

<p>Abstract: Large language models for code (Code LLM) are increasingly utilized in programming environments. Despite their utility, the training datasets for top LLM remain undisclosed, raising concerns about potential copyright violations. Some models, such as Pleias and Comma put emphasis on data curation and licenses, however, with limited training data these models are not competitive and only serve as proof of concepts. To improve the utility of these models, we propose an application of the "Chinese Wall" technique, inspired by the reverse engineering technique of the same name -- a high quality model is used to generate detailed instructions for a weaker model. By doing so, a weaker but ethically aligned model may be used to perform complicated tasks that, otherwise, can only be completed by more powerful models. In our evaluation, we've found that this technique improves Comma v0.1 1T's performance in CanItEdit benchmark by over 66%, and Starcoder2 Instruct by roughly 20% compared to when running the same model on the benchmark alone. The practical application of this technique today, however, may be limited due to the lack of models trained on public domain content without copyright restrictions.</p>

We propose a novel, fast, and easy-to-use imputation method called missing value imputation with adversarial random forests (MissARF), based on generative machine learning, that provides both single and multiple imputation. MissARF employs adversarial random forest (ARF) for density estimation and data synthesis. To impute a missing value of an observation, we condition on the non-missing values and sample from the estimated conditional distribution generated by ARF. Our experiments demonstrate that MissARF performs comparably to state-of-the-art single and multiple imputation methods in terms of imputation quality and fast runtime with no additional costs for multiple imputation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Congmin Zheng, Jiachen Zhu, Jianghao Lin, Xinyi Dai, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang, Mengyue Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) play a central role in evaluating and guiding multi-step reasoning in large language models (LLMs), especially for mathematical problem solving. However, we identify a pervasive length bias in existing PRMs: they tend to assign higher scores to longer reasoning steps, even when the semantic content and logical validity are unchanged. This bias undermines the reliability of reward predictions and leads to overly verbose outputs during inference. To address this issue, we propose CoLD(Counterfactually-Guided Length Debiasing), a unified framework that mitigates length bias through three components: an explicit length-penalty adjustment, a learned bias estimator trained to capture spurious length-related signals, and a joint training strategy that enforces length-invariance in reward predictions. Our approach is grounded in counterfactual reasoning and informed by causal graph analysis. Extensive experiments on MATH500 and GSM-Plus show that CoLD consistently reduces reward-length correlation, improves accuracy in step selection, and encourages more concise, logically valid reasoning. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of CoLD in improving the fidelity and robustness of PRMs.</p>

In heteroscedastic settings, we forgo these non-asymptotic guarantees to gain statistical efficiency, proposing a local $k$--nearest--neighbor method without conformal calibration that is adaptive to the geometry of each particular nonlinear space. Both procedures work with any regression algorithm and are scalable to large data sets, allowing practitioners to plug in their preferred models and incorporate domain expertise. We prove consistency for the proposed estimators under minimal conditions.

<p>Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the promise of conversational AI systems for diagnostic dialogue. However, real-world assurance of patient safety means that providing individual diagnoses and treatment plans is considered a regulated activity by licensed professionals. Furthermore, physicians commonly oversee other team members in such activities, including nurse practitioners (NPs) or physician assistants/associates (PAs). Inspired by this, we propose a framework for effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) AI system. We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent system that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from individualized medical advice. Afterwards, g-AMIE conveys assessments to an overseeing primary care physician (PCP) in a clinician cockpit interface. The PCP provides oversight and retains accountability of the clinical decision. This effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen asynchronously. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we compared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across 60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality intake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the overseeing PCP to review. This resulted in higher quality composite decisions. PCP oversight of g-AMIE was also more time-efficient than standalone PCP consultations in prior work. While our study does not replicate existing clinical practices and likely underestimates clinicians' capabilities, our results demonstrate the promise of asynchronous oversight as a feasible paradigm for diagnostic AI systems to operate under expert human oversight for enhancing real-world care.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrei-Valentin Tanase, Elena Pelican</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Supernova, a 650M-parameter decoder-only transformer that demonstrates how careful architectural design and tokenization innovation can achieve the performance of larger models while maintaining computational efficiency. Our architecture combines Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), Grouped Query Attention (GQA) with a 3:1 compression ratio, RMSNorm for computational efficiency, and SwiGLU activation functions. A critical innovation is our custom 128,000-vocabulary byte-level BPE tokenizer, which achieves state-of-the-art compression performance. Through detailed analysis, we show that Supernova achieves 90% of the performance of 1B-parameter models while using 35% fewer parameters and requiring only 100B training tokens--an order of magnitude less than competing models. Our findings challenge the prevailing scaling paradigm, demonstrating that architectural efficiency and tokenization quality can compensate for reduced parameter counts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noor Sajid, Johan Medrano</p>
<p>Abstract: Parr et al., 2025 examines how auto-regressive and deep temporal models differ in their treatment of non-Markovian sequence modelling. Building on this, we highlight the need for dissociating model architectures, i.e., how the predictive distribution factorises, from the computations invoked at inference. We demonstrate that deep temporal computations are mimicked by autoregressive models by structuring context access during iterative inference. Using a transformer trained on next-token prediction, we show that inducing hierarchical temporal factorisation during iterative inference maintains predictive capacity while instantiating fewer computations. This emphasises that processes for constructing and refining predictions are not necessarily bound to their underlying model architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R\'emi Vaucher, Paul Minchella</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent decades, hypergraphs and their analysis through Topological Data Analysis (TDA) have emerged as powerful tools for understanding complex data structures. Various methods have been developed to construct hypergraphs -- referred to as simplicial complexes in the TDA framework -- over datasets, enabling the formation of edges between more than two vertices. This paper addresses the challenge of constructing hypergraphs from collections of multivariate time series. While prior work has focused on the case of a single multivariate time series, we extend this framework to handle collections of such time series. Our approach generalizes the method proposed in Chretien and al. by leveraging the properties of signature transforms to introduce controlled randomness, thereby enhancing the robustness of the construction process. We validate our method on synthetic datasets and present promising results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danhui Chen, Ziquan Liu, Chuxi Yang, Dan Wang, Yan Yan, Yi Xu, Xiangyang Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Pixel-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, require extensive and high-quality annotated data, which is costly to obtain. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the labeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through self-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation models pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize across domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational segmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as an annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of using SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual input, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the shortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose ConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation model using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable pixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as supervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models to target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the strong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which benefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training strategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training stage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS, ConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and helps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roberto Miele, Niklas Linde</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance. Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data, individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seth Karten, Wenzhe Li, Zihan Ding, Samuel Kleiner, Yu Bai, Chi Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the LLM Economist, a novel framework that uses agent-based modeling to design and assess economic policies in strategic environments with hierarchical decision-making. At the lower level, bounded rational worker agents -- instantiated as persona-conditioned prompts sampled from U.S. Census-calibrated income and demographic statistics -- choose labor supply to maximize text-based utility functions learned in-context. At the upper level, a planner agent employs in-context reinforcement learning to propose piecewise-linear marginal tax schedules anchored to the current U.S. federal brackets. This construction endows economic simulacra with three capabilities requisite for credible fiscal experimentation: (i) optimization of heterogeneous utilities, (ii) principled generation of large, demographically realistic agent populations, and (iii) mechanism design -- the ultimate nudging problem -- expressed entirely in natural language. Experiments with populations of up to one hundred interacting agents show that the planner converges near Stackelberg equilibria that improve aggregate social welfare relative to Saez solutions, while a periodic, persona-level voting procedure furthers these gains under decentralized governance. These results demonstrate that large language model-based agents can jointly model, simulate, and govern complex economic systems, providing a tractable test bed for policy evaluation at the societal scale to help build better civilizations.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents adaptive conformal selection (ACS), an interactive framework for model-free selection with guaranteed error control. Building on conformal selection (Jin and Cand\`es, 2023b), ACS generalizes the approach to support human-in-the-loop adaptive data analysis. Under the ACS framework, we can partially reuse the data to boost the selection power, make decisions on the fly while exploring the data, and incorporate new information or preferences as they arise. The key to ACS is a carefully designed principle that controls the information available for decision making, allowing the data analyst to explore the data adaptively while maintaining rigorous control of the false discovery rate (FDR). Based on the ACS framework, we provide concrete selection algorithms for various goals, including model update/selection, diversified selection, and incorporating newly available labeled data. The effectiveness of ACS is demonstrated through extensive numerical simulations and real-data applications in large language model (LLM) deployment and drug discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro B. Melchiorre, Elena V. Epure, Shahed Masoudian, Gustavo Escobedo, Anna Hausberger, Manuel Moussallam, Markus Schedl</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language interfaces offer a compelling approach for music recommendation, enabling users to express complex preferences conversationally. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in this direction, their scalability in recommender systems is limited by high costs and latency. Retrieval-based approaches using smaller language models mitigate these issues but often rely on single-modal item representations, overlook long-term user preferences, and require full model retraining, posing challenges for real-world deployment. In this paper, we present JAM (Just Ask for Music), a lightweight and intuitive framework for natural language music recommendation. JAM models user-query-item interactions as vector translations in a shared latent space, inspired by knowledge graph embedding methods like TransE. To capture the complexity of music and user intent, JAM aggregates multimodal item features via cross-attention and sparse mixture-of-experts. We also introduce JAMSessions, a new dataset of over 100k user-query-item triples with anonymized user/item embeddings, uniquely combining conversational queries and user long-term preferences. Our results show that JAM provides accurate recommendations, produces intuitive representations suitable for practical use cases, and can be easily integrated with existing music recommendation stacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihao Li, Jiayi Xin, Miranda Muqing Miao, Qi Long, Lyle Ungar</p>
<p>Abstract: Proficient multilingual speakers often intentionally switch languages in the middle of a conversation. Similarly, recent reasoning-focused bilingual large language models (LLMs) with strong capabilities in both languages exhibit language mixing--alternating languages within their chain of thought. Discouraging this behavior in DeepSeek-R1 was found to degrade accuracy, suggesting that language mixing may benefit reasoning. In this work, we study language switching in Chinese-English bilingual reasoning models. We identify reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as the critical training stage that leads to language mixing. We demonstrate that language mixing can enhance reasoning: enforcing monolingual decoding reduces accuracy by 5.6 percentage points on math reasoning tasks. Additionally, a lightweight probe can be trained to predict whether a potential language switch would benefit or harm reasoning, and when used to guide decoding, increases accuracy by up to 6.25 percentage points. Our findings suggest that language mixing is not merely a byproduct of multilingual training, but is a strategic reasoning behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuta Shikuri</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian process regression can flexibly represent the posterior distribution of an interest parameter given sufficient information on the likelihood. However, in some cases, we have little knowledge regarding the probability model. For example, when investing in a financial instrument, the probability model of cash flow is generally unknown. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called the likelihood-free Gaussian process (LFGP), which allows representation of the posterior distributions of interest parameters for scalable problems without directly setting their likelihood functions. The LFGP establishes clusters in which the value of the interest parameter can be considered approximately identical, and it approximates the likelihood of the interest parameter in each cluster to a Gaussian using the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. We expect that the proposed framework will contribute significantly to likelihood-free modeling, particularly by reducing the assumptions for the probability model and the computational costs for scalable problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: In today's day and age, a mobile phone has become a basic requirement needed for anyone to thrive. With the cellular traffic demand increasing so dramatically, it is now necessary to accurately predict the user traffic in cellular networks, so as to improve the performance in terms of resource allocation and utilisation. Since traffic learning and prediction is a classical and appealing field, which still yields many meaningful results, there has been an increasing interest in leveraging Machine Learning tools to analyse the total traffic served in a given region, to optimise the operation of the network. With the help of this project, we seek to exploit the traffic history by using it to predict the nature and occurrence of future traffic. Furthermore, we classify the traffic into particular application types, to increase our understanding of the nature of the traffic. By leveraging the power of machine learning and identifying its usefulness in the field of cellular networks we try to achieve three main objectives - classification of the application generating the traffic, prediction of packet arrival intensity and burst occurrence. The design of the prediction and classification system is done using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. The LSTM predictor developed in this experiment would return the number of uplink packets and also estimate the probability of burst occurrence in the specified future time interval. For the purpose of classification, the regression layer in our LSTM prediction model is replaced by a softmax classifier which is used to classify the application generating the cellular traffic into one of the four applications including surfing, video calling, voice calling, and video streaming.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Garud Iyengar, Henry Lam, Tianyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In data-driven optimization, the sample performance of the obtained decision typically incurs an optimistic bias against the true performance, a phenomenon commonly known as the Optimizer's Curse and intimately related to overfitting in machine learning. Common techniques to correct this bias, such as cross-validation, require repeatedly solving additional optimization problems and are therefore computationally expensive. We develop a general bias correction approach, building on what we call Optimizer's Information Criterion (OIC), that directly approximates the first-order bias and does not require solving any additional optimization problems. Our OIC generalizes the celebrated Akaike Information Criterion to evaluate the objective performance in data-driven optimization, which crucially involves not only model fitting but also its interplay with the downstream optimization. As such it can be used for decision selection instead of only model selection. We apply our approach to a range of data-driven optimization formulations comprising empirical and parametric models, their regularized counterparts, and furthermore contextual optimization. Finally, we provide numerical validation on the superior performance of our approach under synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that presents supervisory signals to real-world problems, bypassing the extensive cost of manual labeling. Consequently, self-supervised anomaly detection (SSAD) has seen a recent surge of interest, since SSL is especially attractive for unsupervised tasks. However, recent works have reported that the choice of a data augmentation function has significant impact on the accuracy of SSAD, posing augmentation search as an essential but nontrivial problem due to lack of labeled validation data. In this paper, we introduce ST-SSAD, the first unsupervised approach to end-to-end augmentation tuning for SSAD. To this end, our work presents two key contributions. The first is a new unsupervised validation loss that quantifies the alignment between augmented training data and unlabeled validation data. The second is new differentiable augmentation functions, allowing data augmentation hyperparameter(s) to be tuned in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on two testbeds with semantic class anomalies and subtle industrial defects show that ST-SSAD gives significant performance gains over existing works.

<p>Abstract: Reservoir computation is a recurrent framework for learning and predicting time series data, that benefits from extremely simple training and interpretability, often as the the dynamics of a physical system. In this paper, we will study the impact of noise on the learning capabilities of analog reservoir computers. Recent work on reservoir computation has shown that the information processing capacity (IPC) is a useful metric for quantifying the degradation of the performance due to noise. We further this analysis and demonstrate that this degradation of the IPC limits the possible features that can be meaningfully constructed in an analog reservoir computing setting. We borrow a result from quantum complexity theory that relates the circuit model of computation to a continuous time model, and demonstrate an exponential reduction in the accessible volume of reservoir configurations. We conclude by relating this degradation in the IPC to the fat-shattering dimension of a family of functions describing the reservoir dynamics, which allows us to express our result in terms of a classification task. We conclude that any physical, analog reservoir computer that is exposed to noise can only be used to perform a polynomial amount of learning, despite the exponentially large latent space, even with an exponential amount of post-processing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrosynthesis poses a key challenge in biopharmaceuticals, aiding chemists in finding appropriate reactant molecules for given product molecules. With reactants and products represented as 2D graphs, retrosynthesis constitutes a conditional graph-to-graph (G2G) generative task. Inspired by advancements in discrete diffusion models for graph generation, we aim to design a diffusion-based method to address this problem. However, integrating a diffusion-based G2G framework while retaining essential chemical reaction template information presents a notable challenge. Our key innovation involves a multi-stage diffusion process. We decompose the retrosynthesis procedure to first sample external groups from the dummy distribution given products, then generate external bonds to connect products and generated groups. Interestingly, this generation process mirrors the reverse of the widely adapted semi-template retrosynthesis workflow, \emph{i.e.} from reaction center identification to synthon completion. Based on these designs, we introduce Retrosynthesis Diffusion (RetroDiff), a novel diffusion-based method for the retrosynthesis task. Experimental results demonstrate that RetroDiff surpasses all semi-template methods in accuracy, and outperforms template-based and template-free methods in large-scale scenarios and molecular validity, respectively.

<p>Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from large models to small models and has recently achieved remarkable success. However, the reliability of existing KD methods in real-world applications, especially under distribution shift, remains underexplored. Distribution shift refers to the data distribution drifts between the training and testing phases, and this can adversely affect the efficacy of KD. In this paper, we propose a unified and systematic framework \textsc{ShiftKD} to benchmark KD against two general distributional shifts: diversity and correlation shift. The evaluation benchmark covers more than 30 methods from algorithmic, data-driven, and optimization perspectives for five benchmark datasets. Our development of \textsc{ShiftKD} conducts extensive experiments and reveals strengths and limitations of current SOTA KD methods. More importantly, we thoroughly analyze key factors in student model training process, including data augmentation, pruning methods, optimizers, and evaluation metrics. We believe \textsc{ShiftKD} could serve as an effective benchmark for assessing KD in real-world scenarios, thus driving the development of more robust KD methods in response to evolving demands. The code will be made available upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Burak Var{\i}c{\i}, Emre Acart\"urk, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Abhishek Kumar, Ali Tajer</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses intervention-based causal representation learning (CRL) under a general nonparametric latent causal model and an unknown transformation that maps the latent variables to the observed variables. Linear and general transformations are investigated. The paper addresses both the identifiability and achievability aspects. Identifiability refers to determining algorithm-agnostic conditions that ensure the recovery of the true latent causal variables and the underlying latent causal graph. Achievability refers to the algorithmic aspects and addresses designing algorithms that achieve identifiability guarantees. By drawing novel connections between score functions (i.e., the gradients of the logarithm of density functions) and CRL, this paper designs a score-based class of algorithms that ensures both identifiability and achievability. First, the paper focuses on linear transformations and shows that one stochastic hard intervention per node suffices to guarantee identifiability. It also provides partial identifiability guarantees for soft interventions, including identifiability up to mixing with parents for general causal models and perfect recovery of the latent graph for sufficiently nonlinear causal models. Secondly, it focuses on general transformations and demonstrates that two stochastic hard interventions per node are sufficient for identifiability. This is achieved by defining a differentiable loss function whose global optima ensure identifiability for general CRL. Notably, one does not need to know which pair of interventional environments has the same node intervened. Finally, the theoretical results are empirically validated via experiments on structured synthetic data and image data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashok Vardhan Makkuva, Marco Bondaschi, Adway Girish, Alliot Nagle, Martin Jaggi, Hyeji Kim, Michael Gastpar</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention-based transformers have achieved tremendous success across a variety of disciplines including natural languages. To deepen our understanding of their sequential modeling capabilities, there is a growing interest in using Markov input processes to study them. A key finding is that when trained on first-order Markov chains, transformers with two or more layers consistently develop an induction head mechanism to estimate the in-context bigram conditional distribution. In contrast, single-layer transformers, unable to form an induction head, directly learn the Markov kernel but often face a surprising challenge: they become trapped in local minima representing the unigram distribution, whereas deeper models reliably converge to the ground-truth bigram. While single-layer transformers can theoretically model first-order Markov chains, their empirical failure to learn this simple kernel in practice remains a curious phenomenon. To explain this contrasting behavior of single-layer models, in this paper we introduce a new framework for a principled analysis of transformers via Markov chains. Leveraging our framework, we theoretically characterize the loss landscape of single-layer transformers and show the existence of global minima (bigram) and bad local minima (unigram) contingent on data properties and model architecture.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Apoorva Narula, Aastha Jain, Jatin Batra, MN Rajeevan, Sandeep Juneja</p>
<p>Abstract: The Indian summer monsoon is a highly complex and critical weather system that directly affects the livelihoods of over a billion people across the Indian subcontinent. Accurate short-term forecasting remains a major scientific challenge due to the monsoon's intrinsic nonlinearity and its sensitivity to multi-scale drivers, including local land-atmosphere interactions and large-scale ocean-atmosphere phenomena. In this study, we address the problem of forecasting daily rainfall across India during the summer months, focusing on both one-day and three-day lead times. We use Autoformers - deep learning transformer-based architectures designed for time series forecasting. These are trained on historical gridded precipitation data from the Indian Meteorological Department (1901--2023) at spatial resolutions of $0.25^\circ \times 0.25^\circ$, as well as $1^\circ \times 1^\circ$. The models also incorporate auxiliary meteorological variables from ECMWFs reanalysis datasets, namely, cloud cover, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, vorticity, and wind speed. Forecasts at $0.25^\circ \times 0.25^\circ$ are benchmarked against ECMWFs High-Resolution Ensemble System (HRES), widely regarded as the most accurate numerical weather predictor, and at $1^\circ \times 1^\circ $ with those from National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). We conduct both nationwide evaluations and localized analyses for major Indian cities. Our results indicate that transformer-based deep learning models consistently outperform both HRES and NCEP, as well as other climatological baselines. Specifically, compared to our model, forecasts from HRES and NCEP model have about 22\% and 43\% higher error, respectively, for a single day prediction, and over 27\% and 66\% higher error respectively, for a three day prediction.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12887">Understanding the training of infinitely deep and wide ResNets with Conditional Optimal Transport</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rapha\"el Barboni (ENS-PSL), Gabriel Peyr\'e (CNRS,ENS-PSL), Fran\c{c}ois-Xavier Vialard (LIGM)</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the convergence of gradient flow for the training of deep neural networks. If Residual Neural Networks are a popular example of very deep architectures, their training constitutes a challenging optimization problem due notably to the non-convexity and the non-coercivity of the objective. Yet, in applications, those tasks are successfully solved by simple optimization algorithms such as gradient descent. To better understand this phenomenon, we focus here on a ``mean-field'' model of infinitely deep and arbitrarily wide ResNet, parameterized by probability measures over the product set of layers and parameters and with constant marginal on the set of layers. Indeed, in the case of shallow neural networks, mean field models have proven to benefit from simplified loss-landscapes and good theoretical guarantees when trained with gradient flow for the Wasserstein metric on the set of probability measures. Motivated by this approach, we propose to train our model with gradient flow w.r.t. the conditional Optimal Transport distance: a restriction of the classical Wasserstein distance which enforces our marginal condition. Relying on the theory of gradient flows in metric spaces we first show the well-posedness of the gradient flow equation and its consistency with the training of ResNets at finite width. Performing a local Polyak-\L{}ojasiewicz analysis, we then show convergence of the gradient flow for well-chosen initializations: if the number of features is finite but sufficiently large and the risk is sufficiently small at initialization, the gradient flow converges towards a global minimizer. This is the first result of this type for infinitely deep and arbitrarily wide ResNets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqiang Cai, Tong Ding, Min Liu, Xinyu Liu, Jianlin Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a structure-guided Gauss-Newton (SgGN) method for solving least squares problems using a shallow ReLU neural network. The method effectively takes advantage of both the least squares structure and the neural network structure of the objective function. By categorizing the weights and biases of the hidden and output layers of the network as nonlinear and linear parameters, respectively, the method iterates back and forth between the nonlinear and linear parameters. The nonlinear parameters are updated by a damped Gauss-Newton method and the linear ones are updated by a linear solver. Moreover, at the Gauss-Newton step, a special form of the Gauss-Newton matrix is derived for the shallow ReLU neural network and is used for efficient iterations. It is shown that the corresponding mass and Gauss-Newton matrices in the respective linear and nonlinear steps are symmetric and positive definite under reasonable assumptions. Thus, the SgGN method naturally produces an effective search direction without the need of additional techniques like shifting in the Levenberg-Marquardt method to achieve invertibility of the Gauss-Newton matrix. The convergence and accuracy of the method are demonstrated numerically for several challenging function approximation problems, especially those with discontinuities or sharp transition layers that pose significant challenges for commonly used training algorithms in machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Sawarni, Nirjhar Das, Siddharth Barman, Gaurav Sinha</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the generalized linear contextual bandit problem within the constraints of limited adaptivity. In this paper, we present two algorithms, $\texttt{B-GLinCB}$ and $\texttt{RS-GLinCB}$, that address, respectively, two prevalent limited adaptivity settings. Given a budget $M$ on the number of policy updates, in the first setting, the algorithm needs to decide upfront $M$ rounds at which it will update its policy, while in the second setting it can adaptively perform $M$ policy updates during its course. For the first setting, we design an algorithm $\texttt{B-GLinCB}$, that incurs $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret when $M = \Omega( \log{\log T} )$ and the arm feature vectors are generated stochastically. For the second setting, we design an algorithm $\texttt{RS-GLinCB}$ that updates its policy $\tilde{O}(\log^2 T)$ times and achieves a regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ even when the arm feature vectors are adversarially generated. Notably, in these bounds, we manage to eliminate the dependence on a key instance dependent parameter $\kappa$, that captures non-linearity of the underlying reward model. Our novel approach for removing this dependence for generalized linear contextual bandits might be of independent interest.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01663">Oversmoothing Alleviation in Graph Neural Networks: A Survey and Unified View</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufei Jin, Xingquan Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Oversmoothing is a common challenge in learning graph neural networks (GNN), where, as layers increase, embedding features learned from GNNs quickly become similar or indistinguishable, making them incapable of differentiating network proximity. A GNN with shallow layer architectures can only learn short-term relation or localized structure information, limiting its power of learning long-term connection, evidenced by their inferior learning performance on heterophilous graphs. Tackling oversmoothing is crucial for harnessing deep-layer architectures for GNNs. To date, many methods have been proposed to alleviate oversmoothing. The vast difference behind their design principles, combined with graph complications, make it difficult to understand and even compare the difference between different approaches in tackling the oversmoothing. In this paper, we propose ATNPA, a unified view with five key steps: Augmentation, Transformation, Normalization, Propagation, and Aggregation, to summarize GNN oversmoothing alleviation approaches. We first propose a taxonomy for GNN oversmoothing alleviation which includes three themes to tackle oversmoothing. After that, we separate all methods into six categories, followed by detailed reviews of representative methods, including their relation to ATNPA, and discussion of their niche, strength, and weakness. The review not only draws an in-depth understanding of existing methods in the field but also shows a clear road map for future study.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takuya Hiraoka, Guanquan Wang, Takashi Onishi, Yoshimasa Tsuruoka</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) with experience replay, experiences stored in a replay buffer influence the RL agent's performance. Information about how these experiences influence the agent's performance is valuable for various purposes, such as identifying experiences that negatively influence underperforming agents. One method for estimating the influence of experiences is the leave-one-out (LOO) method. However, this method is usually computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we present Policy Iteration with Turn-over Dropout (PIToD), which efficiently estimates the influence of experiences. We evaluate how correctly PIToD estimates the influence of experiences and its efficiency compared to LOO. We then apply PIToD to amend underperforming RL agents, i.e., we use PIToD to estimate negatively influential experiences for the RL agents and to delete the influence of these experiences. We show that RL agents' performance is significantly improved via amendments with PIToD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanlin Qu, Jose Blanchet, Peter Glynn</p>
<p>Abstract: Convergence rate analysis for general state-space Markov chains is fundamentally important in areas such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and algorithmic analysis (for computing explicit convergence bounds). This problem, however, is notoriously difficult because traditional analytical methods often do not generate practically useful convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains. We propose the Deep Contractive Drift Calculator (DCDC), the first general-purpose sample-based algorithm for bounding the convergence of Markov chains to stationarity in Wasserstein distance. The DCDC has two components. First, inspired by the new convergence analysis framework in Qu, Blanchet and Glynn (2023), we introduce the Contractive Drift Equation (CDE), the solution of which leads to an explicit convergence bound. Second, we develop an efficient neural-network-based CDE solver. Equipped with these two components, DCDC solves the CDE and converts the solution into a convergence bound. We analyze the sample complexity of the algorithm and further demonstrate the effectiveness of the DCDC by generating convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains arising from stochastic processing networks as well as constant step-size stochastic optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Nguyen, Batuhan K. Karaman, Heejong Kim, Alan Q. Wang, Fengbei Liu, Mert R. Sabuncu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models benefit from rich (e.g., multi-modal) input features. However, multimodal models might be challenging to deploy, because some inputs may be missing at inference. Current popular solutions include marginalization, imputation, and training multiple models. Marginalization achieves calibrated predictions, but it is computationally expensive and only feasible for low dimensional inputs. Imputation may result in inaccurate predictions, particularly when high-dimensional data, such as images, are missing. Training multiple models, where each model is designed to handle different subsets of inputs, can work well but requires prior knowledge of missing input patterns. Furthermore, training and retaining multiple models can be costly. We propose an efficient method to learn both the conditional distribution using full inputs and the marginal distributions. Our method, Knockout, randomly replaces input features with appropriate placeholder values during training. We provide a theoretical justification for Knockout and show that it can be interpreted as an implicit marginalization strategy. We evaluate Knockout across a wide range of simulations and real-world datasets and show that it offers strong empirical performance.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07668">How to Leverage Predictive Uncertainty Estimates for Reducing Catastrophic Forgetting in Online Continual Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Giuseppe Serra, Ben Werner, Florian Buettner</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world applications require machine-learning models to be able to deal with non-stationary data distributions and thus learn autonomously over an extended period of time, often in an online setting. One of the main challenges in this scenario is the so-called catastrophic forgetting (CF) for which the learning model tends to focus on the most recent tasks while experiencing predictive degradation on older ones. In the online setting, the most effective solutions employ a fixed-size memory buffer to store old samples used for replay when training on new tasks. Many approaches have been presented to tackle this problem. However, it is not clear how predictive uncertainty information for memory management can be leveraged in the most effective manner and conflicting strategies are proposed to populate the memory. Are the easiest-to-forget or the easiest-to-remember samples more effective in combating CF? Starting from the intuition that predictive uncertainty provides an idea of the samples' location in the decision space, this work presents an in-depth analysis of different uncertainty estimates and strategies for populating the memory. The investigation provides a better understanding of the characteristics data points should have for alleviating CF. Then, we propose an alternative method for estimating predictive uncertainty via the generalised variance induced by the negative log-likelihood. Finally, we demonstrate that the use of predictive uncertainty measures helps in reducing CF in different settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: The field of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) systems is growing rapidly. Proposed approaches show great promise in achieving symbiotic unions of neural and symbolic methods. However, a unifying framework is needed to organize common NeSy modeling patterns and develop general learning approaches. In this paper, we introduce Neural-Symbolic Energy-Based Models (NeSy-EBMs), a unifying mathematical framework for discriminative and generative NeSy modeling. Importantly, NeSy-EBMs allow the derivation of general expressions for gradients of prominent learning losses, and we introduce a suite of four learning approaches that leverage methods from multiple domains, including bilevel and stochastic policy optimization. Finally, we ground the NeSy-EBM framework with Neural Probabilistic Soft Logic (NeuPSL), an open-source NeSy-EBM library designed for scalability and expressivity, facilitating the real-world application of NeSy systems. Through extensive empirical analysis across multiple datasets, we demonstrate the practical advantages of NeSy-EBMs in various tasks, including image classification, graph node labeling, autonomous vehicle situation awareness, and question answering.</p>

To address this challenge, a novel generative model, termed the State-Observation Augmented Diffusion (SOAD) model is proposed for data-driven assimilation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialiang Wang, Hanmo Liu, Shimin Di, Zhili Wang, Jiachuan Wang, Lei Chen, Xiaofang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: High-level automation is increasingly critical in AI, driven by rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) and AI agents. However, LLMs, despite their general reasoning power, struggle significantly in specialized, data-sensitive tasks such as designing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This difficulty arises from (1) the inherent knowledge gaps in modeling the intricate, varying relationships between graph properties and suitable architectures and (2) the external noise from misleading descriptive inputs, often resulting in generic or even misleading model suggestions. Achieving proficiency in designing data-aware models -- defined as the meta-level capability to systematically accumulate, interpret, and apply data-specific design knowledge -- remains challenging for existing automated approaches, due to their inefficient construction and application of meta-knowledge. To achieve the meta-level proficiency, we propose DesiGNN, a knowledge-centered framework that systematically converts past model design experiences into structured, fine-grained knowledge priors well fitted to meta-learning with LLMs. To account for the inherent variability and external noise, DesiGNN aligns empirical property filtering from extensive benchmarks with adaptive elicitation of literature insights via LLMs. By constructing a solid meta-knowledge between unseen graph understanding and known effective architecture patterns, DesiGNN can deliver top-5.77% initial model proposals for unseen datasets within seconds, and achieve consistently superior performance with minimal search costs against baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Osama Ahmad, Lukas Wesemann, Fabian Waschkowski, Zubair Khalid</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on spatiotemporal (ST) traffic prediction using graph neural networks (GNNs). Given that ST data comprises non-stationary and complex temporal patterns, interpreting and predicting such trends is inherently challenging. Representing ST data in decomposed modes helps infer underlying behavior and assess the impact of noise on predictive performance. We propose a framework that decomposes ST data into interpretable modes using variational mode decomposition (VMD) and processes them through a neural network for future state forecasting. Unlike existing graph-based traffic forecasters that operate directly on raw or aggregated time series, the proposed hybrid approach, termed the Variational Mode Graph Convolutional Network (VMGCN), first decomposes non-stationary signals into interpretable variational modes by determining the optimal mode count via reconstruction-loss minimization and then learns both intramode and cross-mode spatiotemporal dependencies through a novel attention-augmented GCN. Additionally, we analyze the significance of each mode and the effect of bandwidth constraints on multi-horizon traffic flow predictions. The proposed two-stage design yields significant accuracy gains while providing frequency-level interpretability with demonstrated superior performance on the LargeST dataset for both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dexin Duan, Peilin liu, Bingwei Hui, Fei Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: On-device computing, or edge computing, is becoming increasingly important for remote sensing, particularly in applications like deep network-based perception on on-orbit satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In these scenarios, two brain-like capabilities are crucial for remote sensing models: (1) high energy efficiency, allowing the model to operate on edge devices with limited computing resources, and (2) online adaptation, enabling the model to quickly adapt to environmental variations, weather changes, and sensor drift. This work addresses these needs by proposing an online adaptation framework based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for remote sensing. Starting with a pretrained SNN model, we design an efficient, unsupervised online adaptation algorithm, which adopts an approximation of the BPTT algorithm and only involves forward-in-time computation that significantly reduces the computational complexity of SNN adaptation learning. Besides, we propose an adaptive activation scaling scheme to boost online SNN adaptation performance, particularly in low time-steps. Furthermore, for the more challenging remote sensing detection task, we propose a confidence-based instance weighting scheme, which substantially improves adaptation performance in the detection task. To our knowledge, this work is the first to address the online adaptation of SNNs. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets across classification, segmentation, and detection tasks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation and domain generalization approaches under varying weather conditions. The proposed method enables energy-efficient and fast online adaptation on edge devices, and has much potential in applications such as remote perception on on-orbit satellites and UAV.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaeseong Lee, seung-won hwang, Aurick Qiao, Daniel F Campos, Zhewei Yao, Yuxiong He</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoEs) have been adopted for reducing inference costs by sparsely activating experts in Large language models (LLMs). Despite this reduction, the massive number of experts in MoEs still makes them expensive to serve. In this paper, we study how to address this, by pruning MoEs. Among pruning methodologies, unstructured pruning has been known to achieve the highest performance for a given pruning ratio, compared to structured pruning, since the latter imposes constraints on the sparsification structure. This is intuitive, as the solution space of unstructured pruning subsumes that of structured pruning. However, our counterintuitive finding reveals that expert pruning, a form of structured pruning, can actually precede unstructured pruning to outperform unstructured-only pruning. As existing expert pruning, requiring $O(\frac{k^n}{\sqrt{n}})$ forward passes for $n$ experts, cannot scale for recent MoEs, we propose a scalable alternative with $O(1)$ complexity, yet outperforming the more expensive methods. The key idea is leveraging a latent structure between experts, based on behavior similarity, such that the greedy decision of whether to prune closely captures the joint pruning effect. Ours is highly effective -- for Snowflake Arctic, a 480B-sized MoE with 128 experts, our method needs only one H100 and two hours to achieve nearly no loss in performance with 40% sparsity, even in generative tasks such as GSM8K, where state-of-the-art unstructured pruning fails to. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Constantin Philippenko, Kevin Scaman, Laurent Massouli\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: We analyze a distributed algorithm to compute a low-rank matrix factorization on $N$ clients, each holding a local dataset $\mathbf{S}^i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i \times d}$, mathematically, we seek to solve $min_{\mathbf{U}^i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i\times r}, \mathbf{V}\in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r} } \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \|\mathbf{S}^i - \mathbf{U}^i \mathbf{V}^\top\|^2_{\text{F}}$. Considering a power initialization of $\mathbf{V}$, we rewrite the previous smooth non-convex problem into a smooth strongly-convex problem that we solve using a parallel Nesterov gradient descent potentially requiring a single step of communication at the initialization step. For any client $i$ in $\{1, \dots, N\}$, we obtain a global $\mathbf{V}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ common to all clients and a local variable $\mathbf{U}^i$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n_i \times r}$. We provide a linear rate of convergence of the excess loss which depends on $\sigma_{\max} / \sigma_{r}$, where $\sigma_{r}$ is the $r^{\mathrm{th}}$ singular value of the concatenation $\mathbf{S}$ of the matrices $(\mathbf{S}^i)_{i=1}^N$. This result improves the rates of convergence given in the literature, which depend on $\sigma_{\max}^2 / \sigma_{\min}^2$. We provide an upper bound on the Frobenius-norm error of reconstruction under the power initialization strategy. We complete our analysis with experiments on both synthetic and real data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Zhang, Zhen Chen, Chih-Hong Cheng, Wenjie Ruan, Xiaowei Huang, Dezong Zhao, David Flynn, Siddartha Khastgir, Xingyu Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) Diffusion Models (DMs) have garnered widespread attention for their impressive advancements in image generation. However, their growing popularity has raised ethical and social concerns related to key non-functional properties of trustworthiness, such as robustness, fairness, security, privacy, factuality, and explainability, similar to those in traditional deep learning (DL) tasks. Conventional approaches for studying trustworthiness in DL tasks often fall short due to the unique characteristics of T2I DMs, e.g., the multi-modal nature. Given the challenge, recent efforts have been made to develop new methods for investigating trustworthiness in T2I DMs via various means, including falsification, enhancement, verification \& validation and assessment. However, there is a notable lack of in-depth analysis concerning those non-functional properties and means. In this survey, we provide a timely and focused review of the literature on trustworthy T2I DMs, covering a concise-structured taxonomy from the perspectives of property, means, benchmarks and applications. Our review begins with an introduction to essential preliminaries of T2I DMs, and then we summarise key definitions/metrics specific to T2I tasks and analyses the means proposed in recent literature based on these definitions/metrics. Additionally, we review benchmarks and domain applications of T2I DMs. Finally, we highlight the gaps in current research, discuss the limitations of existing methods, and propose future research directions to advance the development of trustworthy T2I DMs. Furthermore, we keep up-to-date updates in this field to track the latest developments and maintain our GitHub repository at: https://github.com/wellzline/Trustworthy_T2I_DMs</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ties Robroek (IT University of Copenhagen), Neil Kim Nielsen (IT University of Copenhagen), P{\i}nar T\"oz\"un (IT University of Copenhagen)</p>
<p>Abstract: Training deep learning models is a repetitive and resource-intensive process. Data scientists often train several models before landing on a set of parameters (e.g., hyper-parameter tuning) and model architecture (e.g., neural architecture search), among other things that yield the highest accuracy. The computational efficiency of these training tasks depends highly on how well the training data is supplied to the training process. The repetitive nature of these tasks results in the same data processing pipelines running over and over, exacerbating the need for and costs of computational resources. In this paper, we present TensorSocket to reduce the computational needs of deep learning training by enabling simultaneous training processes to share the same data loader. TensorSocket mitigates CPU-side bottlenecks in cases where the collocated training workloads have high throughput on GPU, but are held back by lower data-loading throughput on CPU. TensorSocket achieves this by reducing redundant computations and data duplication across collocated training processes and leveraging modern GPU-GPU interconnects. While doing so, TensorSocket is able to train and balance differently-sized models and serve multiple batch sizes simultaneously and is hardware- and pipeline-agnostic in nature. Our evaluation shows that TensorSocket enables scenarios that are infeasible without data sharing, increases training throughput by up to 100%, and when utilizing cloud instances, achieves cost savings of 50% by reducing the hardware resource needs on the CPU side. Furthermore, TensorSocket outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions for shared data loading such as CoorDL and Joader; it is easier to deploy and maintain and either achieves higher or matches their throughput while requiring fewer CPU resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junkang Wu, Xue Wang, Zhengyi Yang, Jiancan Wu, Jinyang Gao, Bolin Ding, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and intentions is crucial for their utility, honesty, and safety. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a popular approach to achieve this alignment, but it faces challenges in computational efficiency and training stability. Recent methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) have proposed offline alternatives to RLHF, simplifying the process by reparameterizing the reward function. However, DPO depends on a potentially suboptimal reference model, and SimPO's assumption of a fixed target reward margin may lead to suboptimal decisions in diverse data settings. In this work, we propose $\alpha$-DPO, an adaptive preference optimization algorithm designed to address these limitations by introducing a dynamic reward margin. Specifically, $\alpha$-DPO employs an adaptive preference distribution, balancing the policy model and the reference model to achieve personalized reward margins. We provide theoretical guarantees for $\alpha$-DPO, demonstrating its effectiveness as a surrogate optimization objective and its ability to balance alignment and diversity through KL divergence control. Empirical evaluations on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard show that $\alpha$-DPO consistently outperforms DPO and SimPO across various model settings, establishing it as a robust approach for fine-tuning LLMs. Our method achieves significant improvements in win rates, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for LLM alignment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Jiao, Qiuxia Lai, Yu Li, Qiang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning requires to overcome catastrophic forgetting when training a single model on a sequence of tasks. Recent top-performing approaches are prompt-based methods that utilize a set of learnable parameters (i.e., prompts) to encode task knowledge, from which appropriate ones are selected to guide the fixed pre-trained model in generating features tailored to a certain task. However, existing methods rely on predicting prompt identities for prompt selection, where the identity prediction process cannot be optimized with task loss. This limitation leads to sub-optimal prompt selection and inadequate adaptation of pre-trained features for a specific task. Previous efforts have tried to address this by directly generating prompts from input queries instead of selecting from a set of candidates. However, these prompts are continuous, which lack sufficient abstraction for task knowledge representation, making them less effective for continual learning. To address these challenges, we propose VQ-Prompt, a prompt-based continual learning method that incorporates Vector Quantization (VQ) into end-to-end training of a set of discrete prompts. In this way, VQ-Prompt can optimize the prompt selection process with task loss and meanwhile achieve effective abstraction of task knowledge for continual learning. Extensive experiments show that VQ-Prompt outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods across a variety of benchmarks under the challenging class-incremental setting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuchang Yan, Haoran Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: In our prior work, we investigated the minimum fuel consumption of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) under a state-of-charge (SOC) balance constraint, assuming perfect SOC measurements and accurate reference speed profiles. The constrained optimal fuel consumption (COFC) problem was addressed using a constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) framework. However, in real-world scenarios, SOC readings are often corrupted by sensor noise, and reference speeds may deviate from actual driving conditions. To account for these imperfections, this study reformulates the COFC problem by explicitly incorporating observational noise in both SOC and reference speed. We adopt a robust CRL approach, where the noise is modeled as a uniform distribution, and employ a structured training procedure to ensure stability. The proposed method is evaluated through simulations on the Toyota Prius hybrid system (THS), using both the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC). Results show that fuel consumption and SOC constraint satisfaction remain robust across varying noise levels. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that observational noise in SOC and speed can impact fuel consumption to different extents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly examine how observational noise -- commonly encountered in dynamometer testing and predictive energy control (PEC) applications -- affects constrained optimal fuel consumption in HEVs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiwot Belay Tadesse, Alihan H\"uy\"uk, Yaniv Yacoby, Weiwei Pan, Finale Doshi-Velez</p>
<p>Abstract: When explaining black-box machine learning models, it's often important for explanations to have certain desirable properties. Most existing methods `encourage' desirable properties in their construction of explanations. In this work, we demonstrate that these forms of encouragement do not consistently create explanations with the properties that are supposedly being targeted. Moreover, they do not allow for any control over which properties are prioritized when different properties are at odds with each other. We propose to directly optimize explanations for desired properties. Our direct approach not only produces explanations with optimal properties more consistently but also empowers users to control trade-offs between different properties, allowing them to create explanations with exactly what is needed for a particular task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael Ayll\'on-Gavil\'an, Francisco Jos\'e Mart\'inez-Estudillo, David Guijo-Rubio, C\'esar Herv\'as-Mart\'inez, Pedro Antonio Guti\'errez</p>
<p>Abstract: Ordinal Classification (OC) addresses those classification tasks where the labels exhibit a natural order. Unlike nominal classification, which treats all classes as mutually exclusive and unordered, OC takes the ordinal relationship into account, producing more accurate and relevant results. This is particularly critical in applications where the magnitude of classification errors has significant consequences. Despite this, OC problems are often tackled using nominal methods, leading to suboptimal solutions. Although decision trees are among the most popular classification approaches, ordinal tree-based approaches have received less attention when compared to other classifiers. This work provides a comprehensive survey of ordinal splitting criteria, standardising the notations used in the literature to enhance clarity and consistency. Three ordinal splitting criteria, Ordinal Gini (OGini), Weighted Information Gain (WIG), and Ranking Impurity (RI), are compared to the nominal counterparts of the first two (Gini and information gain), by incorporating them into a decision tree classifier. An extensive repository considering $45$ publicly available OC datasets is presented, supporting the first experimental comparison of ordinal and nominal splitting criteria using well-known OC evaluation metrics. The results have been statistically analysed, highlighting that OGini stands out as the best ordinal splitting criterion to date, reducing the mean absolute error achieved by Gini by more than 3.02%. To promote reproducibility, all source code developed, a detailed guide for reproducing the results, the 45 OC datasets, and the individual results for all the evaluated methodologies are provided.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duygu Sezen Islakoglu, Jan-Christoph Kalo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various NLP tasks, yet they still face significant challenges in reasoning and arithmetic. Temporal reasoning, a critical component of natural language understanding, has raised increasing research attention. However, comprehensive testing of Allen's interval relations (e.g., before, after, during) -- a fundamental framework for temporal relationships -- remains underexplored. To fill this gap, we present ChronoSense, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' temporal understanding. It includes 16 tasks, focusing on identifying the Allen relation between two temporal events and temporal arithmetic, using both abstract events and real-world data from Wikidata. We assess the performance of seven recent LLMs using this benchmark and the results indicate that models handle Allen relations, even symmetrical ones, quite differently. Moreover, the findings suggest that the models may rely on memorization to answer time-related questions. Overall, the models' low performance highlights the need for improved temporal understanding in LLMs and ChronoSense offers a robust framework for future research in this area.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youran Zhou, Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek, Jonathan Wells, Sunil Aryal</p>
<p>Abstract: Handling incomplete and heterogeneous data remains a central challenge in real-world machine learning, where missing values may follow complex mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) and features can be of mixed types (numerical and categorical). Existing methods often rely on imputation, which may introduce bias or privacy risks, or fail to jointly address data heterogeneity and structured missingness. We propose the \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{P}robability \textbf{M}ass \textbf{K}ernel (\textbf{HI-PMK}), a novel data-dependent representation learning approach that eliminates the need for imputation. HI-PMK introduces two key innovations: (1) a probability mass-based dissimilarity measure that adapts to local data distributions across heterogeneous features (numerical, ordinal, nominal), and (2) a missingness-aware uncertainty strategy (MaxU) that conservatively handles all three missingness mechanisms by assigning maximal plausible dissimilarity to unobserved entries. Our approach is privacy-preserving, scalable, and readily applicable to downstream tasks such as classification and clustering. Extensive experiments on over 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HI-PMK consistently outperforms traditional imputation-based pipelines and kernel methods across a wide range of missing data settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyuan Feng, Zhiqiang Pu, Tianyi Hu, Dongmin Li, Xiaolin Ai, Huimu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Building mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture for Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is emerging as a potential direction in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for its modular design and remarkable performance. However, simply stacking the number of experts cannot guarantee significant improvement. In this work, we first conduct qualitative analysis to indicate that experts collapse to similar representations in vanilla MoE, limiting the capacity of modular design and computational efficiency. Ulteriorly, Our analysis reveals that the performance of previous MoE variants maybe limited by a lack of diversity among experts. Motivated by these findings, we propose Orthogonal Mixture-of-Experts (OMoE), a resource-efficient MoE variant that trains experts in an orthogonal manner to promote diversity. In OMoE, a Gram-Schmidt process is leveraged to enforce that the experts' representations lie within the Stiefel manifold. By applying orthogonal constraints directly to the architecture, OMoE keeps the learning objective unchanged, without compromising optimality. Our method is simple and alleviates memory bottlenecks, as it incurs minimal experts compared to vanilla MoE models. Experiments on diverse commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that OMoE can consistently achieve stable and efficient performance improvement when compared with the state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing the number of required experts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autoregressive and recurrent networks have achieved remarkable progress across various fields, from weather forecasting to molecular generation and Large Language Models. Despite their strong predictive capabilities, these models lack a rigorous framework for addressing uncertainty, which is key in scientific applications such as PDE solving, molecular generation and Machine Learning Force Fields. To address this shortcoming we present BARNN: a variational Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network. BARNNs aim to provide a principled way to turn any autoregressive or recurrent model into its Bayesian version. BARNN is based on the variational dropout method, allowing to apply it to large recurrent neural networks as well. We also introduce a temporal version of the "Variational Mixtures of Posteriors" prior (tVAMP-prior) to make Bayesian inference efficient and well-calibrated. Extensive experiments on PDE modelling and molecular generation demonstrate that BARNN not only achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to existing methods, but also excels in uncertainty quantification and modelling long-range dependencies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haokun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Character diversity in competitive games, while enriching gameplay, often introduces balance challenges that can negatively impact player experience and strategic depth. Traditional balance assessments rely on aggregate metrics like win rates and pick rates, which offer limited insight into the intricate dynamics of team-based games and nuanced character roles. This paper proposes a novel clustering-based methodology to analyze character balance, leveraging in-game data from Valorant to account for team composition influences and reveal latent character roles. By applying hierarchical agglomerative clustering with Jensen-Shannon Divergence to professional match data from the Valorant Champions Tour 2022, our approach identifies distinct clusters of agents exhibiting similar co-occurrence patterns within team compositions. This method not only complements existing quantitative metrics but also provides a more holistic and interpretable perspective on character synergies and potential imbalances, offering game developers a valuable tool for informed and context-aware balance adjustments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elisabetta Cornacchia, Dan Mikulincer, Elchanan Mossel</p>
<p>Abstract: The problem of learning single index and multi index models has gained significant interest as a fundamental task in high-dimensional statistics. Many recent works have analysed gradient-based methods, particularly in the setting of isotropic data distributions, often in the context of neural network training. Such studies have uncovered precise characterisations of algorithmic sample complexity in terms of certain analytic properties of the target function, such as the leap, information, and generative exponents. These properties establish a quantitative separation between low and high complexity learning tasks. In this work, we show that high complexity cases are rare. Specifically, we prove that introducing a small random perturbation to the data distribution--via a random shift in the first moment--renders any Gaussian single index model as easy to learn as a linear function. We further extend this result to a class of multi index models, namely sparse Boolean functions, also known as Juntas.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sampling from unnormalized densities presents a fundamental challenge with wide-ranging applications, from posterior inference to molecular dynamics simulations. Continuous flow-based neural samplers offer a promising approach, learning a velocity field that satisfies key principles of marginal density evolution (e.g., the continuity equation) to generate samples. However, this learning procedure requires accurate estimation of intractable terms linked to the computationally challenging partition function, for which existing estimators often suffer from high variance or low accuracy. To overcome this, we introduce an improved estimator for these challenging quantities, employing a velocity-driven Sequential Monte Carlo method enhanced with control variates. Furthermore, we introduce a shortcut consistency model to boost the runtime efficiency of the flow-based neural sampler by minimizing its required sampling steps. Our proposed Neural Flow Shortcut Sampler empirically outperforms existing flow-based neural samplers on both synthetic datasets and complex n-body system targets.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the past decade, motivated by the putative failure of naive self-play deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in adversarial imperfect-information games, researchers have developed numerous DRL algorithms based on fictitious play (FP), double oracle (DO), and counterfactual regret minimization (CFR). In light of recent results of the magnetic mirror descent algorithm, we hypothesize that simpler generic policy gradient methods like PPO are competitive with or superior to these FP-, DO-, and CFR-based DRL approaches. To facilitate the resolution of this hypothesis, we implement and release the first broadly accessible exact exploitability computations for four large games. Using these games, we conduct the largest-ever exploitability comparison of DRL algorithms for imperfect-information games. Over 5600 training runs, we find that FP-, DO-, and CFR-based approaches fail to outperform generic policy gradient methods.

<p>Abstract: System identification is normally involved in augmenting time series data by time shifting and nonlinearisation (e.g., polynomial basis), both of which introduce redundancy in features and samples. Many research works focus on reducing redundancy feature-wise, while less attention is paid to sample-wise redundancy. This paper proposes a novel data pruning method, called mini-batch FastCan, to reduce sample-wise redundancy based on dictionary learning. Time series data is represented by some representative samples, called atoms, via dictionary learning. The useful samples are selected based on their correlation with the atoms. The method is tested on one simulated dataset and two benchmark datasets. The R-squared between the coefficients of models trained on the full datasets and the coefficients of models trained on pruned datasets is adopted to evaluate the performance of data pruning methods. It is found that the proposed method significantly outperforms the random pruning method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Di Gennaro, Thibault Laugel, Vincent Grari, Marcin Detyniecki</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional approaches to learning fair machine learning models often require rebuilding models from scratch, typically without considering potentially existing models. In a context where models need to be retrained frequently, this can lead to inconsistent model updates, as well as redundant and costly validation testing. To address this limitation, we introduce the notion of controlled model debiasing, a novel supervised learning task relying on two desiderata: that the differences between the new fair model and the existing one should be (i) minimal and (ii) interpretable. After providing theoretical guarantees to this new problem, we introduce a novel algorithm for algorithmic fairness, COMMOD, that is both model-agnostic and does not require the sensitive attribute at test time. In addition, our algorithm is explicitly designed to enforce minimal and interpretable changes between biased and debiased predictions in a binary classification task, a property that, while highly desirable in high-stakes applications, is rarely prioritized as an explicit objective in fairness literature.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinliang Zhou, Chenyu Liu, Zhisheng Chen, Kun Wang, Yi Ding, Ziyu Jia, Qingsong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain foundation models (BFMs) have emerged as a transformative paradigm in computational neuroscience, offering a revolutionary framework for processing diverse neural signals across different brain-related tasks. These models leverage large-scale pre-training techniques, allowing them to generalize effectively across multiple scenarios, tasks, and modalities, thus overcoming the traditional limitations faced by conventional artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in understanding complex brain data. By tapping into the power of pretrained models, BFMs provide a means to process neural data in a more unified manner, enabling advanced analysis and discovery in the field of neuroscience. In this survey, we define BFMs for the first time, providing a clear and concise framework for constructing and utilizing these models in various applications. We also examine the key principles and methodologies for developing these models, shedding light on how they transform the landscape of neural signal processing. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in BFMs, covering the most recent methodological innovations, novel views of application areas, and challenges in the field. Notably, we highlight the future directions and key challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of BFMs. These challenges include improving the quality of brain data, optimizing model architecture for better generalization, increasing training efficiency, and enhancing the interpretability and robustness of BFMs in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michal Spiegel, Michal \v{S}tef\'anik, Marek Kadl\v{c}\'ik, Josef Kucha\v{r}</p>
<p>Abstract: Can transformers learn to perform algorithmic tasks reliably across previously unseen input/output domains? While pre-trained language models show solid accuracy on benchmarks incorporating algorithmic reasoning, assessing the reliability of these results necessitates an ability to distinguish genuine algorithmic understanding from memorization. In this paper, we propose AttentionSpan, an algorithmic benchmark comprising five tasks of infinite input domains where we can disentangle and trace the correct, robust algorithm necessary for the task. This allows us to assess (i) models' ability to extrapolate to unseen types of inputs, including new lengths, value ranges or input domains, but also (ii)to assess the robustness of their learned mechanisms. By analyzing attention maps and performing targeted interventions, we show that attention mechanism directly causes failures in extrapolation. We make the implementation of all our tasks and interpretability methods publicly available at https://github.com/michalspiegel/AttentionSpan .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kwanyoung Kim, Byeongsu Sim</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown impressive results in generating high-quality conditional samples using guidance techniques such as Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, existing methods often require additional training or neural function evaluations (NFEs), making them incompatible with guidance-distilled models. Also, they rely on heuristic approaches that need identifying target layers. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient method, termed PLADIS, which boosts pre-trained models (U-Net/Transformer) by leveraging sparse attention. Specifically, we extrapolate query-key correlations using softmax and its sparse counterpart in the cross-attention layer during inference, without requiring extra training or NFEs. By leveraging the noise robustness of sparse attention, our PLADIS unleashes the latent potential of text-to-image diffusion models, enabling them to excel in areas where they once struggled with newfound effectiveness. It integrates seamlessly with guidance techniques, including guidance-distilled models. Extensive experiments show notable improvements in text alignment and human preference, offering a highly efficient and universally applicable solution.

<p><b>Authors:</b> I. Bentley, J. Tedder, M. Gebran, A. Paul</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper describes the development of the Four Model Tree Ensemble (FMTE). The FMTE is a composite of machine learning models trained on experimental binding energies from the Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME) 2012. The FMTE predicts binding energy values for all nuclei with N > 7 and Z > 7 from AME 2020 with a standard deviation of 76 keV and a mean average deviation of 34 keV. The FMTE model was developed by combining three new models with one prior model. The new models presented here have been trained on binding energy residuals from mass models using four machine learning approaches. The models presented in this work leverage shape parameters along with other physical features. We have determined the preferred machine learning approach for binding energy residuals is the least-squares boosted ensemble of trees. This approach appears to have a superior ability to both interpolate and extrapolate binding energy residuals. A comparison with the masses of isotopes that were not measured previously and a discussion of extrapolations approaching the neutron drip line have been included.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyang Zhao, Haoxian Chen, Yucheng Guo, Genta Indra Winata, Tingting Ou, Ziyu Huang, David D. Yao, Wenpin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Rich Preference Optimization (RPO), a novel pipeline that leverages rich feedback signals to improve the curation of preference pairs for fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models. Traditional methods, like Diffusion-DPO, often rely solely on reward model labeling, which can be opaque, offer limited insights into the rationale behind preferences, and are prone to issues such as reward hacking or overfitting. In contrast, our approach begins with generating detailed critiques of synthesized images, from which we extract reliable and actionable image editing instructions. By implementing these instructions, we create refined images, resulting in synthetic, informative preference pairs that serve as enhanced tuning datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and the resulting datasets in fine-tuning state-of-the-art diffusion models. Our code is available at https://github.com/Diffusion-RLHF/RPO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyang Guo, Fanhu Zeng, Fei Zhu, Wenzhuo Liu, Da-Han Wang, Jian Xu, Xu-Yao Zhang, Cheng-Lin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: A vast amount of instruction tuning data is crucial for the impressive performance of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), but the associated computational costs and data collection demands during supervised fine-tuning make it impractical for most researchers. Federated learning (FL) has the potential to leverage all distributed data and training resources to reduce the overhead of joint training. However, most existing methods assume a fixed number of tasks, while in real-world scenarios, clients continuously encounter new knowledge and often struggle to retain old tasks due to memory constraints. In this work, we introduce the Federated Continual Instruction Tuning (FCIT) benchmark to model this real-world challenge. Our benchmark includes two realistic scenarios, encompassing four different settings and twelve carefully curated instruction tuning datasets. To address the challenges posed by FCIT, we propose dynamic knowledge organization to effectively integrate updates from different tasks during training and subspace selective activation to allocate task-specific output during inference. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances model performance across varying levels of data heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14549">Sampling Decisions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Chertkov, Sungsoo Ahn, Hamidreza Behjoo</p>
<p>Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce a novel Decision Flow (DF) framework for sampling decisions from a target distribution while incorporating additional guidance from a prior sampler. DF can be viewed as an AI-driven algorithmic reincarnation of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) approach in stochastic optimal control. It extends the continuous-space, continuous-time Path Integral Diffusion sampling technique of [Behjoo, Chertkov 2025] to discrete time and space, while also generalizing the Generative Flow Network (GFN) framework of [Bengio, et al 2021]. In its most basic form an explicit formulation that does not require Neural Networks (NNs), DF leverages the linear solvability of the underlying MDP [Todorov, 2007] to adjust the transition probabilities of the prior sampler. The resulting Markov process is expressed as a convolution of the reverse-time Green's function of the prior sampling with the target distribution. We illustrate the DF framework through an example of sampling from the Ising model -- compare DF to Metropolis-Hastings to quantify its efficiency, discuss potential NN-based extensions, and outline how DF can enhance guided sampling across various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan G. Dempsey, Jonathan Ethier, Halim Yanikomeroglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Path loss modeling is a widely used technique for estimating point-to-point losses along a communications link from transmitter (Tx) to receiver (Rx). Accurate path loss predictions can optimize use of the radio frequency spectrum and minimize unwanted interference. Modern path loss modeling often leverages data-driven approaches, using machine learning to train models on drive test measurement datasets. Drive tests primarily represent downlink scenarios, where the Tx is located on a building and the Rx is located on a moving vehicle. Consequently, trained models are frequently reserved for downlink coverage estimation, lacking representation of uplink scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate that data augmentation can be used to train a path loss model that is generalized to uplink, downlink, and backhaul scenarios, training using only downlink drive test measurements. By adding a small number of synthetic samples representing uplink scenarios to the training set, root mean squared error is reduced by > 8 dB on uplink examples in the test set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikael Makonnen, Moritz Vandenhirtz, Sonia Laguna, Julia E Vogt</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to enhance interpretability by structuring predictions around human-understandable concepts. However, unintended information leakage, where predictive signals bypass the concept bottleneck, compromises their transparency. This paper introduces an information-theoretic measure to quantify leakage in CBMs, capturing the extent to which concept embeddings encode additional, unintended information beyond the specified concepts. We validate the measure through controlled synthetic experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting leakage trends across various configurations. Our findings highlight that feature and concept dimensionality significantly influence leakage, and that classifier choice impacts measurement stability, with XGBoost emerging as the most reliable estimator. Additionally, preliminary investigations indicate that the measure exhibits the anticipated behavior when applied to soft joint CBMs, suggesting its reliability in leakage quantification beyond fully synthetic settings. While this study rigorously evaluates the measure in controlled synthetic experiments, future work can extend its application to real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) deliver outstanding performance, but their complexity often prohibits deployment in resource-constrained settings. Comprehensive structured pruning frameworks based on parameter dependency analysis reduce model size with specific regard to computational performance. When applying them to Multi-Component Neural Architectures (MCNAs), they risk network integrity by removing large parameter groups. We introduce a component-aware pruning strategy, extending dependency graphs to isolate individual components and inter-component flows. This creates smaller, targeted pruning groups that conserve functional integrity. Demonstrated effectively on a control task, our approach achieves greater sparsity and reduced performance degradation, opening a path for optimizing complex, multi-component DNNs efficiently.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rapha\"el Barboni (\'ENS-PSL), Gabriel Peyr\'e (CNRS,\'ENS-PSL), Fran\c{c}ois-Xavier Vialard (LIGM)</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the convergence of gradient methods for the training of mean-field single-hidden-layer neural networks with square loss. For this high-dimensional and non-convex optimization problem, most known convergence results are either qualitative or rely on a neural tangent kernel analysis where nonlinear representations of the data are fixed. Using that this problem belongs to the class of separable nonlinear least squares problems, we consider here a Variable Projection (VarPro) or two-timescale learning algorithm, thereby eliminating the linear variables and reducing the learning problem to the training of nonlinear features. In a teacher-student scenario, we show such a strategy enables provable convergence rates for the sampling of a teacher feature distribution. Precisely, in the limit where the regularization strength vanishes, we show that the dynamic of the feature distribution corresponds to a weighted ultra-fast diffusion equation. Recent results on the asymptotic behavior of such PDEs then give quantitative guarantees for the convergence of the learned feature distribution.</p>

<p>Abstract: When optimising for conditional value at risk (CVaR) using policy gradients (PG), current methods rely on discarding a large proportion of trajectories, resulting in poor sample efficiency. We propose a reformulation of the CVaR optimisation problem by capping the total return of trajectories used in training, rather than simply discarding them, and show that this is equivalent to the original problem if the cap is set appropriately. We show, with empirical results in an number of environments, that this reformulation of the problem results in consistently improved performance compared to baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Winston Chen, Trenton Chang, Jenna Wiens</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimates of heterogeneous treatment assignment effects can inform treatment decisions. Under the presence of non-adherence (e.g., patients do not adhere to their assigned treatment), both the standard backdoor adjustment (SBD) and the conditional front-door adjustment (CFD) can recover unbiased estimates of the treatment assignment effects. However, the estimation variance of these approaches may vary widely across settings, which remains underexplored in the literature. In this work, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that CFD yields lower-variance estimates than SBD when the true effect of treatment assignment is small (i.e., assigning an intervention leads to small changes in patients' future outcome). Additionally, since CFD requires estimating multiple nuisance parameters, we introduce LobsterNet, a multi-task neural network that implements CFD with joint modeling of the nuisance parameters. Empirically, LobsterNet reduces estimation error across several semi-synthetic and real-world datasets compared to baselines. Our findings suggest CFD with shared nuisance parameter modeling can improve treatment assignment effect estimation under non-adherence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linjiang Cao, Maonan Wang, Xi Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem widely applied in logistics distribution and transportation management. Its complexity stems from the constraints of vehicle capacity and time windows, which pose significant challenges to traditional approaches. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new possibilities for finding approximate solutions to CVRPTW. This paper proposes a novel LLM-enhanced Q-learning framework to address the CVRPTW with real-time emergency constraints. Our solution introduces an adaptive two-phase training mechanism that transitions from the LLM-guided exploration phase to the autonomous optimization phase of Q-network. To ensure reliability, we design a three-tier self-correction mechanism based on the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for LLMs: syntactic validation, semantic verification, and physical constraint enforcement. In addition, we also prioritized replay of the experience generated by LLMs to amplify the regulatory role of LLMs in the architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a 7.3\% average reduction in cost compared to traditional Q-learning, with fewer training steps required for convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shunsuke Yoneda, Valdemar \v{S}v\'abensk\'y, Gen Li, Daisuke Deguchi, Atsushi Shimada</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital textbooks are widely used in various educational contexts, such as university courses and online lectures. Such textbooks yield learning log data that have been used in numerous educational data mining (EDM) studies for student behavior analysis and performance prediction. However, these studies have faced challenges in integrating confidential data, such as academic records and learning logs, across schools due to privacy concerns. Consequently, analyses are often conducted with data limited to a single school, which makes developing high-performing and generalizable models difficult. This study proposes a method that combines federated learning and differential features to address these issues. Federated learning enables model training without centralizing data, thereby preserving student privacy. Differential features, which utilize relative values instead of absolute values, enhance model performance and generalizability. To evaluate the proposed method, a model for predicting at-risk students was trained using data from 1,136 students across 12 courses conducted over 4 years, and validated on hold-out test data from 5 other courses. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method addresses privacy concerns while achieving performance comparable to that of models trained via centralized learning in terms of Top-n precision, nDCG, and PR-AUC. Furthermore, using differential features improved prediction performance across all evaluation datasets compared to non-differential approaches. The trained models were also applicable for early prediction, achieving high performance in detecting at-risk students in earlier stages of the semester within the validation datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tai Nguyen, Phong Le, Carola Doerr, Nguyen Dang</p>
<p>Abstract: It is well known that evolutionary algorithms can benefit from dynamic choices of the key parameters that control their behavior, to adjust their search strategy to the different stages of the optimization process. A prominent example where dynamic parameter choices have shown a provable super-constant speed-up is the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ Genetic Algorithm optimizing the OneMax function. While optimal parameter control policies result in linear expected running times, this is not possible with static parameter choices. This result has spurred a lot of interest in parameter control policies. However, many works, in particular theoretical running time analyses, focus on controlling one single parameter. Deriving policies for controlling multiple parameters remains very challenging. In this work we reconsider the problem of the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ Genetic Algorithm optimizing OneMax. We decouple its four main parameters and investigate how well state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning techniques can approximate good control policies. We show that although making deep reinforcement learning learn effectively is a challenging task, once it works, it is very powerful and is able to find policies that outperform all previously known control policies on the same benchmark. Based on the results found through reinforcement learning, we derive a simple control policy that consistently outperforms the default theory-recommended setting by $27\%$ and the irace-tuned policy, the strongest existing control policy on this benchmark, by $13\%$, for all tested problem sizes up to $40{,}000$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhong Lin, Xinyue Zeng, Jie Zhu, Song Wang, Julian Shun, Jun Wu, Dawei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in complex reasoning tasks, but their inference remains computationally inefficient. We observe a common failure mode in many prevalent LLMs, overthinking, where models generate verbose and tangential reasoning traces even for simple queries. Recent works have tried to mitigate this by enforcing fixed token budgets, however, this can lead to underthinking, especially on harder problems. Through empirical analysis, we identify that this inefficiency often stems from unclear problem-solving strategies. To formalize this, we develop a theoretical model, BBAM (Bayesian Budget Allocation Model), which models reasoning as a sequence of sub-questions with varying uncertainty, and introduce the $E^3$ metric to capture the trade-off between correctness and computation efficiency. Building on theoretical results from BBAM, we propose Plan-and-Budget, a model-agnostic, test-time framework that decomposes complex queries into sub-questions and allocates token budgets based on estimated complexity using adaptive scheduling. Plan-and-Budget improves reasoning efficiency across a range of tasks and models, achieving up to +70% accuracy gains, -39% token reduction, and +187.5% improvement in $E^3$. Notably, it elevates a smaller model (DS-Qwen-32B) to match the efficiency of a larger model (DS-LLaMA-70B)-demonstrating Plan-and-Budget's ability to close performance gaps without retraining.

<p>Abstract: Graph representation learning is effective for obtaining a meaningful latent space utilizing the structure of graph data and is widely applied, including biological networks. In particular, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful self-supervised method that relies on applying perturbations to graphs for data augmentation. However, when applying existing GCL methods to biological networks such as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs), they overlooked meaningful biologically relevant perturbations, e.g., gene knockdowns. In this study, we introduce SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning), a novel GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological perturbations derived from gene knockdown experiments as the supervision. SupGCL mathematically extends existing GCL methods that utilize non-biological perturbations to probabilistic models that introduce actual biological gene perturbation utilizing gene knockdown data. Using the GRN representation obtained by our proposed method, our aim is to improve the performance of biological downstream tasks such as patient hazard prediction and disease subtype classification (graph-level task), and gene function classification (node-level task). We applied SupGCL on real GRN datasets derived from patients with multiple types of cancer, and in all experiments SupGCL achieves better performance than state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Most materials science datasets are limited to atomic geometries (e.g., XYZ files), restricting their utility for multimodal learning and comprehensive data-centric analysis. These constraints have historically impeded the adoption of advanced machine learning techniques in the field. This work introduces MultiCrystalSpectrumSet (MCS-Set), a curated framework that expands materials datasets by integrating atomic structures with 2D projections and structured textual annotations, including lattice parameters and coordination metrics. MCS-Set enables two key tasks: (1) multimodal property and summary prediction, and (2) constrained crystal generation with partial cluster supervision. Leveraging a human-in-the-loop pipeline, MCS-Set combines domain expertise with standardized descriptors for high-quality annotation. Evaluations using state-of-the-art language and vision-language models reveal substantial modality-specific performance gaps and highlight the importance of annotation quality for generalization. MCS-Set offers a foundation for benchmarking multimodal models, advancing annotation practices, and promoting accessible, versatile materials science datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Zhao, Ruijie Li, Qiao Ning, Shikai Guo, Hui Li, Qian Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: The identification of drug-target interactions (DTI) is critical for drug discovery and repositioning, as it reveals potential therapeutic uses of existing drugs, accelerating development and reducing costs. However, most existing models focus only on direct similarity in homogeneous graphs, failing to exploit the rich similarity in heterogeneous graphs. To address this gap, inspired by real-world social interaction behaviors, we propose SOC-DGL, which comprises two specialized modules: the Affinity-Driven Graph Learning (ADGL) module, learning global similarity through an affinity-enhanced drug-target graph, and the Equilibrium-Driven Graph Learning (EDGL) module, capturing higher-order similarity by amplifying the influence of even-hop neighbors using an even-polynomial graph filter based on balance theory. This dual approach enables SOC-DGL to effectively capture similarity information across multiple interaction scales within affinity and association matrices. To address the issue of imbalance in DTI datasets, we propose an adjustable imbalance loss function that adjusts the weight of negative samples by the parameter. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SOC-DGL consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across both balanced and imbalanced scenarios. Moreover, SOC-DGL successfully predicts the top 9 drugs known to bind ABL1, and further analyzed the 10th drug, which has not been experimentally confirmed to interact with ABL1, providing supporting evidence for its potential binding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanlong Chen, Mattia Orlandi, Pierangelo Maria Rapa, Simone Benatti, Luca Benini, Yawei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks. Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqian Ye, Guangtao Zheng, Aidong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks often learn and rely on spurious correlations, i.e., superficial associations between non-causal features and the targets. For instance, an image classifier may identify camels based on the desert backgrounds. While it can yield high overall accuracy during training, it degrades generalization on more diverse scenarios where such correlations do not hold. This problem poses significant challenges for out-of-distribution robustness and trustworthiness. Existing methods typically mitigate this issue by using external group annotations or auxiliary deterministic models to learn unbiased representations. However, such information is costly to obtain, and deterministic models may fail to capture the full spectrum of biases learned by the models. To address these limitations, we propose Evidential Alignment, a novel framework that leverages uncertainty quantification to understand the behavior of the biased models without requiring group annotations. By quantifying the evidence of model prediction with second-order risk minimization and calibrating the biased models with the proposed evidential calibration technique, Evidential Alignment identifies and suppresses spurious correlations while preserving core features. We theoretically justify the effectiveness of our method as capable of learning the patterns of biased models and debiasing the model without requiring any spurious correlation annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly improves group robustness across diverse architectures and data modalities, providing a scalable and principled solution to spurious correlations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seung-Wook Kim, Seongyeol Kim, Jiah Kim, Seowon Ji, Se-Ho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) often suffers from performance degradation due to key challenges such as data heterogeneity and communication constraints. To address these limitations, we present a novel FL framework called FedWSQ, which integrates weight standardization (WS) and the proposed distribution-aware non-uniform quantization (DANUQ). WS enhances FL performance by filtering out biased components in local updates during training, thereby improving the robustness of the model against data heterogeneity and unstable client participation. In addition, DANUQ minimizes quantization errors by leveraging the statistical properties of local model updates. As a result, FedWSQ significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining superior model accuracy. Extensive experiments on FL benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedWSQ consistently outperforms existing FL methods across various challenging FL settings, including extreme data heterogeneity and ultra-low-bit communication scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Li, Chuanguang Yang, Hansheng Zeng, Zeyu Dong, Zhulin An, Yongjun Xu, Yingli Tian, Hao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics, and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD), which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency trends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler). However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental results show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions of up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset. The framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term trends while reducing computational complexity. Our codes are available at https://github.com/itsnotacie/SDKD</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Li, Shuo Shao, Yu He, Junfeng Guo, Tianwei Zhang, Zhan Qin, Pin-Yu Chen, Michael Backes, Philip Torr, Dacheng Tao, Kui Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation, traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control, spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights, system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Concept Bottleneck Reward Models (CB-RM), a reward modeling framework that enables interpretable preference learning through selective concept annotation. Unlike standard RLHF methods that rely on opaque reward functions, CB-RM decomposes reward prediction into human-interpretable concepts. To make this framework efficient in low-supervision settings, we formalize an active learning strategy that dynamically acquires the most informative concept labels. We propose an acquisition function based on Expected Information Gain and show that it significantly accelerates concept learning without compromising preference accuracy. Evaluated on the UltraFeedback dataset, our method outperforms baselines in interpretability and sample efficiency, marking a step towards more transparent, auditable, and human-aligned reward models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wooseong Jeong, Kuk-Jin Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance. While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wooseong Jeong, Jegyeong Cho, Youngho Yoon, Kuk-Jin Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across various benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to the modern economy, yet their credit risk analysis often struggles with scarce data, especially for online lenders lacking direct credit records. This paper introduces a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, leveraging SME interactions from transaction and social data to map spatial dependencies and predict loan default risks. Tests on real-world datasets from Discover and Ant Credit (23.4M nodes for supply chain analysis, 8.6M for default prediction) show the GNN surpasses traditional and other GNN baselines, with AUCs of 0.995 and 0.701 for supply chain mining and default prediction, respectively. It also helps regulators model supply chain disruption impacts on banks, accurately forecasting loan defaults from material shortages, and offers Federal Reserve stress testers key data for CCAR risk buffers. This approach provides a scalable, effective tool for assessing SME credit risk.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuyan Chen, Yutong He, Pengrui Li, Weichen Jia, Kun Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck. Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees. GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical findings.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based single-channel speech separation has improved considerably, in large part driven by increasingly compute- and parameter-efficient neural network architectures. Most such architectures are, however, designed with a fixed compute and parameter budget, and consequently cannot scale to varying compute demands or resources, which limits their use in embedded and heterogeneous devices such as mobile phones and hearables. To enable such use-cases we design a neural network architecture for speech separation capable of early-exit, and we propose an uncertainty-aware probabilistic framework to jointly model the clean speech signal and error variance which we use to derive probabilistic early-exit conditions in terms of desired signal-to-noise ratios. We evaluate our methods on both speech separation and enhancement tasks, and we show that a single early-exit model can be competitive with state-of-the-art models trained at many compute and parameter budgets. Our framework enables fine-grained dynamic compute-scaling of speech separation networks while achieving state-of-the-art performance and interpretable exit conditions.</p>

Iceberg improves the geometric mean modeling accuracy by $86.4\%$ when adapt to six real-world applications with few-shot examples and achieves a $2.47\times$ and a $1.12\times$ better offline DSE performance when adapting to two different test datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Souvik Nath, Sumit Wadhwa, Luis Perez</p>
<p>Abstract: Every day, multinational firms process thousands of transactions, each of which must adhere to tax regulations that vary by jurisdiction and are often nuanced. The determination of product and service tax codes, such as HSN or SAC is a major use case in Tax compliance. An accurate determination of such codes is imperative to avoid any tax penalties. This paper proposes a domain-adaptive small language model (SLM) with an encoder-decoder architecture for the enhanced prediction of product and service tax codes. In this approach, we address the problem of predicting hierarchical tax code sequences using unstructured product and services data. We employ an SLM based upon encoder-decoder architecture as this enables sequential generation of tax codes to capture the hierarchical dependencies present within the tax codes. Our experiments demonstrate that encoder-decoder SLMs can be successfully applied to the sequential prediction of structured tax codes, a domain that remains comparatively unexplored in current NLP research. In this paper, we demonstrate the superior performance of the domain-adaptive encoder-decoder SLMs over flat classifiers when applied to the Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN), and achieve superior results compared to decoder-only and encoder-only architectures for structured sequence generation tasks. This approach can also be scaled to other government-mandated tax commodity codes, such as United Nations Standard Products and Services Codes (UNSPSC), or Brazil's Nomenclatura Comum do Mercosul (NCM).</p>

<p>Abstract: Score-function policy gradients have delivered strong results in game-playing, robotics and language-model fine-tuning. Yet its high-variance often undermines training stability. On the other hand, pathwise policy gradients alleviate the training variance, but are reliable only when driven by an accurate action-conditioned value function which is notoriously hard to train without relying on past off-policy data. In this paper, we discuss how to construct a value-gradient driven, on-policy algorithm that allow training Q-value models purely from on-policy data, unlocking the possibility of using pathwise policy updates in the context of on-policy learning. We show how to balance stochastic policies for exploration with constrained policy updates for stable training, and evaluate important architectural components that facilitate accurate value function learning. Building on these insights, we propose Relative Entropy Pathwise Policy Optimization (REPPO), an efficient on-policy algorithm that combines the sample-efficiency of pathwise policy gradients with the simplicity and minimal memory footprint of standard on-policy learning. We demonstrate that REPPO provides strong empirical performance at decreased sample requirements, wall-clock time, memory footprint as well as high hyperparameter robustness in a set of experiments on two standard GPU-parallelized benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Travis Pence, Daisuke Yamada, Vikas Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Contemporary large models often exhibit behaviors suggesting the presence of low-level primitives that compose into modules with richer functionality, but these fundamental building blocks remain poorly understood. We investigate this compositional structure in linear layers by asking: can we identify/synthesize linear transformations from a minimal set of geometric primitives? Using Clifford algebra, we show that linear layers can be expressed as compositions of bivectors -- geometric objects encoding oriented planes -- and introduce a differentiable algorithm that decomposes them into products of rotors. This construction uses only O(log^2 d) parameters, versus O(d^2) required by dense matrices. Applied to the key, query, and value projections in LLM attention layers, our rotor-based layers match the performance of strong baselines such as block-Hadamard and low-rank approximations. Our findings provide an algebraic perspective on how these geometric primitives can compose into higher-level functions within deep models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Slimane Larabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Although existing models can interact with humans and provide satisfactory responses, they lack the ability to act autonomously or engage in independent reasoning. Furthermore, input data in these models is typically provided as explicit queries, even when some sensory data is already acquired.
  In addition, AI agents, which are computational entities designed to perform tasks and make decisions autonomously based on their programming, data inputs, and learned knowledge, have shown significant progress. However, they struggle with integrating knowledge across multiple domains, unlike humans.
  Mental imagery plays a fundamental role in the brain's thinking process, which involves performing tasks based on internal multisensory data, planned actions, needs, and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate how to integrate mental imagery into a machine thinking framework and how this could be beneficial in initiating the thinking process. Our proposed machine thinking framework integrates a Cognitive thinking unit supported by three auxiliary units: the Input Data Unit, the Needs Unit, and the Mental Imagery Unit. Within this framework, data is represented as natural language sentences or drawn sketches, serving both informative and decision-making purposes. We conducted validation tests for this framework, and the results are presented and discussed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anabel Yong, Austin Tripp, Layla Hosseini-Gerami, Brooks Paige</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) provides a principled framework for navigating trade-offs in molecular design. However, its empirical advantages over scalarized alternatives remain underexplored. We benchmark a simple Pareto-based MOBO strategy -- Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) -- against a simple fixed-weight scalarized baseline using Expected Improvement (EI), under a tightly controlled setup with identical Gaussian Process surrogates and molecular representations. Across three molecular optimization tasks, EHVI consistently outperforms scalarized EI in terms of Pareto front coverage, convergence speed, and chemical diversity. While scalarization encompasses flexible variants -- including random or adaptive schemes -- our results show that even strong deterministic instantiations can underperform in low-data regimes. These findings offer concrete evidence for the practical advantages of Pareto-aware acquisition in de novo molecular optimization, especially when evaluation budgets are limited and trade-offs are nontrivial.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper describes our participation in the shared task of hate speech detection, which is one of the subtasks of the CERIST NLP Challenge 2022. Our experiments evaluate the performance of six transformer models and their combination using 2 ensemble approaches. The best results on the training set, in a five-fold cross validation scenario, were obtained by using the ensemble approach based on the majority vote. The evaluation of this approach on the test set resulted in an F1-score of 0.60 and an Accuracy of 0.86.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Sagar, Sai Teja Gilukara</p>
<p>Abstract: Sampling-based path planning algorithms play an important role in autonomous robotics. However, a common problem among these algorithms is that the initial path generated is not optimal, and the convergence is too slow for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel image-based learning algorithm using a Convolutional Block Attention Generative Adversarial Network (CBAGAN-RRT) with a combination of spatial and channel attention and a novel loss function to design the heuristics, find a better optimal path, and improve the convergence of the algorithm, both concerning time and speed. The probability distribution of the paths generated from our GAN model is used to guide the sampling process for the RRT algorithm. We demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the previous state-of-the-art algorithms using both the image quality generation metrics, like IOU Score, Dice Score, FID score, and path planning metrics like time cost and the number of nodes. Ablation studies show the effectiveness of various components in our network architecture. The advantage of our approach is that we can avoid the complicated preprocessing in the state space, our model can be generalized to complex environments like those containing turns and narrow passages without loss of accuracy, and our model can be easily integrated with other sampling-based path planning algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anirudh Choudhary, Mosbah Aouad, Krishnakant Saboo, Angelina Hwang, Jacob Kechter, Blake Bordeaux, Puneet Bhullar, David DiCaudo, Steven Nelson, Nneka Comfere, Emma Johnson, Olayemi Sokumbi, Jason Sluzevich, Leah Swanson, Dennis Murphree, Aaron Mangold, Ravishankar Iyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common cancer subtype, with an increasing incidence and a significant impact on cancer-related mortality. SCC grading using whole slide images is inherently challenging due to the lack of a reliable protocol and substantial tissue heterogeneity. We propose RACR-MIL, the first weakly-supervised SCC grading approach achieving robust generalization across multiple anatomies (skin, head and neck, lung). RACR-MIL is an attention-based multiple-instance learning framework that enhances grade-relevant contextual representation learning and addresses tumor heterogeneity through two key innovations: (1) a hybrid WSI graph that captures both local tissue context and non-local phenotypical dependencies between tumor regions, and (2) a rank-ordering constraint in the attention mechanism that consistently prioritizes higher-grade tumor regions, aligning with pathologists diagnostic process. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple SCC datasets, achieving 3-9% higher grading accuracy, resilience to class imbalance, and up to 16% improved tumor localization. In a pilot study, pathologists reported that RACR-MIL improved grading efficiency in 60% of cases, underscoring its potential as a clinically viable cancer diagnosis and grading assistant.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Wang, Nanqing Dong, Jiahao Sun, William Knottenbelt, Yike Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm, which enables multiple and decentralized clients to collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a central aggregator. FL can be a scalable machine learning solution in big data scenarios. Traditional FL relies on the trust assumption of the central aggregator, which forms cohorts of clients honestly. However, a malicious aggregator, in reality, could abandon and replace the client's training models, or insert fake clients, to manipulate the final training results. In this work, we introduce zkFL, which leverages zero-knowledge proofs to tackle the issue of a malicious aggregator during the training model aggregation process. To guarantee the correct aggregation results, the aggregator provides a proof per round, demonstrating to the clients that the aggregator executes the intended behavior faithfully. To further reduce the verification cost of clients, we use blockchain to handle the proof in a zero-knowledge way, where miners (i.e., the participants validating and maintaining the blockchain data) can verify the proof without knowing the clients' local and aggregated models. The theoretical analysis and empirical results show that zkFL achieves better security and privacy than traditional FL, without modifying the underlying FL network structure or heavily compromising the training speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berkay Anahtarci, Can Deha Kariksiz, Naci Saldi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the use of Maximum Causal Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) within the context of discrete-time stationary Mean-Field Games (MFGs) characterized by finite state spaces and an infinite-horizon, discounted-reward setting. Although the resulting optimization problem is non-convex with respect to policies, we reformulate it as a convex optimization problem in terms of state-action occupation measures by leveraging the linear programming framework of Markov Decision Processes. Based on this convex reformulation, we introduce a gradient descent algorithm with a guaranteed convergence rate to efficiently compute the optimal solution. Moreover, we develop a new method that conceptualizes the MFG problem as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP), enabling effective computation of the mean-field equilibrium for forward reinforcement learning (RL) problems and marking an advancement in MFG solution techniques. We further illustrate the practical applicability of our GNEP approach by employing this algorithm to generate data for numerical MFG examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giacomo Delcaro, Riccardo Poli, Federico Dett\`u, Simone Formentin, Sergio Matteo Savaresi</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional vehicle dynamics estimation methods suffer from the drawback of employing independent, separately calibrated filtering modules for each variable. To address this limitation, a recent proposal introduces a unified Twin-in-the-Loop (TiL) Observer architecture. This architecture replaces the simplified control-oriented vehicle model with a full-fledged vehicle simulator (digital twin), and employs a real-time correction mechanism using a linear time-invariant output error law. Bayesian Optimization is utilized to tune the observer due to the simulator's black-box nature, leading to a high-dimensional optimization problem. This paper focuses on developing a procedure to reduce the observer's complexity by exploring both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. The effectiveness of these strategies is validated for longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics using real-world data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omer Luxembourg, Dor Tsur, Haim Permuter</p>
<p>Abstract: Transfer entropy (TE) is an information theoretic measure that reveals the directional flow of information between processes, providing valuable insights for a wide range of real-world applications. This work proposes Transfer Entropy Estimation via Transformers (TREET), a novel attention-based approach for estimating TE for stationary processes. The proposed approach employs Donsker-Varadhan representation to TE and leverages the attention mechanism for the task of neural estimation. We propose a detailed theoretical and empirical study of the TREET, comparing it to existing methods on a dedicated estimation benchmark. To increase its applicability, we design an estimated TE optimization scheme that is motivated by the functional representation lemma, and use it to estimate the capacity of communication channels with memory, which is a canonical optimization problem in information theory. We further demonstrate how an optimized TREET can be used to estimate underlying densities, providing experimental results. Finally, we apply TREET to feature analysis of patients with Apnea, demonstrating its applicability to real-world physiological data. Our work, applied with state-of-the-art deep learning methods, opens a new door for communication problems which are yet to be solved.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephen Casper, Lennart Schulze, Oam Patel, Dylan Hadfield-Menell</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite extensive diagnostics and debugging by developers, AI systems sometimes exhibit harmful unintended behaviors. Finding and fixing these is challenging because the attack surface is so large -- it is not tractable to exhaustively search for inputs that may elicit harmful behaviors. Red-teaming and adversarial training (AT) are commonly used to improve robustness, however, they empirically struggle to fix failure modes that differ from the attacks used during training. In this work, we utilize latent adversarial training (LAT) to defend against vulnerabilities without leveraging knowledge of what they are or using inputs that elicit them. LAT makes use of the compressed, abstract, and structured latent representations of concepts that the network actually uses for prediction. Here, we use it to defend against failure modes without examples that elicit them. Specifically, we use LAT to remove backdoors and defend against held-out classes of adversarial attacks. We show in image classification, text classification, and text generation tasks that LAT usually improves both robustness to novel attacks and performance on clean data relative to AT. This suggests that LAT can be a promising tool for defending against failure modes that are not explicitly identified by developers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beomsu Kim, Jaemin Kim, Jeongsol Kim, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elisa Sanchez-Bayona, Rodrigo Agerri</p>
<p>Abstract: Metaphors are a ubiquitous but often overlooked part of everyday language. As a complex cognitive-linguistic phenomenon, they provide a valuable means to evaluate whether language models can capture deeper aspects of meaning, including semantic, pragmatic, and cultural context. In this work, we present Meta4XNLI, the first parallel dataset for Natural Language Inference (NLI) newly annotated for metaphor detection and interpretation in both English and Spanish. Meta4XNLI facilitates the comparison of encoder- and decoder-based models in detecting and understanding metaphorical language in multilingual and cross-lingual settings. Our results show that fine-tuned encoders outperform decoders-only LLMs in metaphor detection. Metaphor interpretation is evaluated via the NLI framework with comparable performance of masked and autoregressive models, which notably decreases when the inference is affected by metaphorical language. Our study also finds that translation plays an important role in the preservation or loss of metaphors across languages, introducing shifts that might impact metaphor occurrence and model performance. These findings underscore the importance of resources like Meta4XNLI for advancing the analysis of the capabilities of language models and improving our understanding of metaphor processing across languages. Furthermore, the dataset offers previously unavailable opportunities to investigate metaphor interpretation, cross-lingual metaphor transferability, and the impact of translation on the development of multilingual annotated resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Razieh Nabi, Nima S. Hejazi, Mark J. van der Laan, David Benkeser</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop a general framework for estimating function-valued parameters under equality or inequality constraints in infinite-dimensional statistical models. Such constrained learning problems are common across many areas of statistics and machine learning, where estimated parameters must satisfy structural requirements such as moment restrictions, policy benchmarks, calibration criteria, or fairness considerations. To address these problems, we characterize the solution as the minimizer of a penalized population risk using a Lagrange-type formulation, and analyze it through a statistical functional lens. Central to our approach is a constraint-specific path through the unconstrained parameter space that defines the constrained solutions. For a broad class of constraint-risk pairs, this path admits closed-form expressions and reveals how constraints shape optimal adjustments. When closed forms are unavailable, we derive recursive representations that support tractable estimation. Our results also suggest natural estimators of the constrained parameter, constructed by combining estimates of unconstrained components of the data-generating distribution. Thus, our procedure can be integrated with any statistical learning approach and implemented using standard software. We provide general conditions under which the resulting estimators achieve optimal risk and constraint satisfaction, and we demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method through various examples, simulations, and real-data applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mobile device control agents can largely enhance user interactions and productivity by automating daily tasks. However, despite growing interest in developing practical agents, the absence of a commonly adopted benchmark in this area makes it challenging to quantify scientific progress. In this work, we introduce B-MoCA: a novel benchmark with interactive environments for evaluating and developing mobile device control agents. To create a realistic benchmark, we develop B-MoCA based on the Android operating system and define 131 common daily tasks. Importantly, we incorporate a randomization feature that changes the configurations of mobile devices, including user interface layouts and language settings, to assess generalization performance. We benchmark diverse agents, including agents employing large language models (LLMs) or multi-modal LLMs as well as agents trained with imitation learning using human expert demonstrations. While these agents demonstrate proficiency in executing straightforward tasks, their poor performance on complex tasks highlights significant opportunities for future research to improve effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manvik Pasula, Pramit Saha</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a simple yet effective strategy for exercise classification and muscle group activation prediction (MGAP). These tasks have significant implications for personal fitness, facilitating more affordable, accessible, safer, and simpler exercise routines. This is particularly relevant for novices and individuals with disabilities. Previous research in the field is mostly dominated by the reliance on mounted sensors and a limited scope of exercises, reducing practicality for everyday use. Furthermore, existing MGAP methodologies suffer from a similar dependency on sensors and a restricted range of muscle groups, often excluding strength training exercises, which are pivotal for a comprehensive fitness regimen. Addressing these limitations, our research employs a video-based deep learning framework that encompasses a broad spectrum of exercises and muscle groups, including those vital for strength training. Utilizing the "Workout/Exercises Video" dataset, our approach integrates the X3D and SlowFast video activity recognition models in an effective way to enhance exercise classification and MGAP performance. Our findings demonstrate that this hybrid method, obtained via weighted ensemble, outperforms existing baseline models in accuracy. Pretrained models play a crucial role in enhancing overall performance, with optimal channel reduction values for the SlowFast model identified near 10. Through an ablation study that explores fine-tuning, we further elucidate the interrelation between the two tasks. Our composite model, a weighted-average ensemble of X3D and SlowFast, sets a new benchmark in both exercise classification and MGAP across all evaluated categories, offering a robust solution to the limitations of previous approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Varun Krishna, Sriram Ganapathy</p>
<p>Abstract: The popular frameworks for self-supervised learning of speech representations have largely focused on frame-level masked prediction of speech regions. While this has shown promising downstream task performance for speech recognition and related tasks, this has largely ignored factors of speech that are encoded at coarser level, like characteristics of the speaker or channel that remain consistent through-out a speech utterance. In this work, we propose a framework for Learning Disentangled Self Supervised (termed as Learn2Diss) representations of speech, which consists of frame-level and an utterance-level encoder modules. The two encoders are initially learned independently, where the frame-level model is largely inspired by existing self supervision techniques, thereby learning pseudo-phonemic representations, while the utterance-level encoder is inspired by constrastive learning of pooled embeddings, thereby learning pseudo-speaker representations. The joint learning of these two modules consists of disentangling the two encoders using a mutual information based criterion. With several downstream evaluation experiments, we show that the proposed Learn2Diss achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of tasks, with the frame-level encoder representations improving semantic tasks, while the utterance-level representations improve non-semantic tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yancheng Wang, Yingzhen Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-attention and transformers have been widely used in deep learning. Recent efforts have been devoted to incorporating transformer blocks into different neural architectures, including those with convolutions, leading to various visual transformers for computer vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel and compact transformer block, Transformer with Learnable Token Merging (LTM), or LTM-Transformer. LTM-Transformer performs token merging in a learnable scheme. LTM-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact transformer networks, and it reduces the FLOPs and the inference time of the visual transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in popular visual transformers, including MobileViT, EfficientViT, ViT, and Swin, with LTM-Transformer blocks, leading to LTM-Transformer networks with different backbones. The LTM-Transformer is motivated by reduction of Information Bottleneck, and a novel and separable variational upper bound for the IB loss is derived. The architecture of the mask module in our LTM blocks, which generates the token merging mask, is designed to reduce the derived upper bound for the IB loss. Extensive results on computer vision tasks evidence that LTM-Transformer renders compact and efficient visual transformers with comparable or much better prediction accuracy than the original visual transformers. The code of the LTM-Transformer is available at https://github.com/Statistical-Deep-Learning/LTM}</p>

A neural network, combined with a pseudo-arclength continuation, is proposed to construct bifurcation diagrams from parameterized nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, a neural network approach is also presented for solving eigenvalue problems to analyze solution linear stability, focusing on identifying the largest eigenvalue. The effectiveness of the proposed neural network is examined through experiments on the Bratu equation and the Burgers equation. Results from a finite difference method are also presented as comparison. Varying numbers of grid points are employed in each case to assess the behavior and accuracy of both the neural network and the finite difference method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed neural network produces better solutions, generates more accurate bifurcation diagrams, has reasonable computational times, and proves effective for linear stability analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avigail Cohen Rimon, Tal Shnitzer, Mirela Ben Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel framework for representing neural fields on triangle meshes that is multi-resolution across both spatial and frequency domains. Inspired by the Neural Fourier Filter Bank (NFFB), our architecture decomposes the spatial and frequency domains by associating finer spatial resolution levels with higher frequency bands, while coarser resolutions are mapped to lower frequencies. To achieve geometry-aware spatial decomposition we leverage multiple DiffusionNet components, each associated with a different spatial resolution level. Subsequently, we apply a Fourier feature mapping to encourage finer resolution levels to be associated with higher frequencies. The final signal is composed in a wavelet-inspired manner using a sine-activated MLP, aggregating higher-frequency signals on top of lower-frequency ones. Our architecture attains high accuracy in learning complex neural fields and is robust to discontinuities, exponential scale variations of the target field, and mesh modification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through its application to diverse neural fields, such as synthetic RGB functions, UV texture coordinates, and vertex normals, illustrating different challenges. To validate our method, we compare its performance against two alternatives, showcasing the advantages of our multi-resolution architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taejin Park, Ivan Medennikov, Kunal Dhawan, Weiqing Wang, He Huang, Nithin Rao Koluguri, Krishna C. Puvvada, Jagadeesh Balam, Boris Ginsburg</p>
<p>Abstract: Sortformer is an encoder-based speaker diarization model designed for supervising speaker tagging in speech-to-text models. Instead of relying solely on permutation invariant loss (PIL), Sortformer introduces Sort Loss to resolve the permutation problem, either independently or in tandem with PIL. In addition, we propose a streamlined multi-speaker speech-to-text architecture that leverages Sortformer for speaker supervision, embedding speaker labels into the encoder using sinusoidal kernel functions. This design addresses the speaker permutation problem through sorted objectives, effectively bridging timestamps and tokens to supervise speaker labels in the output transcriptions. Experiments demonstrate that Sort Loss can boost speaker diarization performance, and incorporating the speaker supervision from Sortformer improves multi-speaker transcription accuracy. We anticipate that the proposed Sortformer and multi-speaker architecture will enable the seamless integration of speaker tagging capabilities into foundational speech-to-text systems and multimodal large language models (LLMs), offering an easily adoptable and user-friendly mechanism to enhance their versatility and performance in speaker-aware tasks. The code and trained models are made publicly available through the NVIDIA NeMo Framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luo Ji, Gao Liu, Mingyang Yin, Hongxia Yang, Jingren Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern listwise recommendation systems need to consider both long-term user perceptions and short-term interest shifts. Reinforcement learning can be applied on recommendation to study such a problem but is also subject to large search space, sparse user feedback and long interactive latency. Motivated by recent progress in hierarchical reinforcement learning, we propose a novel framework called mccHRL to provide different levels of temporal abstraction on listwise recommendation. Within the hierarchical framework, the high-level agent studies the evolution of user perception, while the low-level agent produces the item selection policy by modeling the process as a sequential decision-making problem. We argue that such framework has a well-defined decomposition of the outra-session context and the intra-session context, which are encoded by the high-level and low-level agents, respectively. To verify this argument, we implement both a simulator-based environment and an industrial dataset-based experiment. Results observe significant performance improvement by our method, compared with several well-known baselines. Data and codes have been made public.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taylor Applebaum, Sam Blackwell, Alex Davies, Thomas Edlich, Andr\'as Juh\'asz, Marc Lackenby, Nenad Toma\v{s}ev, Daniel Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: We have developed a reinforcement learning agent that often finds a minimal sequence of unknotting crossing changes for a knot diagram with up to 200 crossings, hence giving an upper bound on the unknotting number. We have used this to determine the unknotting number of 57k knots. We took diagrams of connected sums of such knots with oppositely signed signatures, where the summands were overlaid. The agent has found examples where several of the crossing changes in an unknotting collection of crossings result in hyperbolic knots. Based on this, we have shown that, given knots $K$ and $K'$ that satisfy some mild assumptions, there is a diagram of their connected sum and $u(K) + u(K')$ unknotting crossings such that changing any one of them results in a prime knot. As a by-product, we have obtained a dataset of 2.6 million distinct hard unknot diagrams; most of them under 35 crossings. Assuming the additivity of the unknotting number, we have determined the unknotting number of 43 at most 12-crossing knots for which the unknotting number is unknown.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alon Beck, Noam Levi, Yohai Bar-Sinai</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of grokking -- delayed generalization accompanied by non-monotonic test loss behavior -- in a simple binary logistic classification task, for which "memorizing" and "generalizing" solutions can be strictly defined. Surprisingly, we find that grokking arises naturally even in this minimal model when the parameters of the problem are close to a critical point, and provide both empirical and analytical insights into its mechanism. Concretely, by appealing to the implicit bias of gradient descent, we show that logistic regression can exhibit grokking when the training dataset is nearly linearly separable from the origin and there is strong noise in the perpendicular directions. The underlying reason is that near the critical point, "flat" directions in the loss landscape with nearly zero gradient cause training dynamics to linger for arbitrarily long times near quasi-stable solutions before eventually reaching the global minimum. Finally, we highlight similarities between our findings and the recent literature, strengthening the conjecture that grokking generally occurs in proximity to the interpolation threshold, reminiscent of critical phenomena often observed in physical systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Rose, Philipp Schaub, Rolf Findeisen</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a method that allows efficient and safe approximation of model predictive controllers using kernel interpolation. Since the computational complexity of the approximating function scales linearly with the number of data points, we propose to use a scoring function which chooses the most promising data. To further reduce the complexity of the approximation, we restrict our considerations to the set of closed-loop reachable states. That is, the approximating function only has to be accurate within this set. This makes our method especially suited for systems, where the set of initial conditions is small. In order to guarantee safety and high performance of the designed approximated controller, we use reachability analysis based on Monte Carlo methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mishal Fatima Minhas, Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, Falah Awwad, Osman Hasan, Muhammad Shafique</p>
<p>Abstract: The challenging deployment of compute- and memory-intensive methods from Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based Continual Learning (CL) underscores the critical need for a paradigm shift towards more efficient approaches. Neuromorphic Continual Learning (NCL) appears as an emerging solution, by leveraging the principles of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) which enable efficient CL algorithms executed in dynamically-changed environments with resource-constrained computing systems. Motivated by the need for a holistic study of NCL, in this survey, we first provide a detailed background on CL, encompassing the desiderata, settings, metrics, scenario taxonomy, Online Continual Learning (OCL) paradigm, recent DNN-based methods to address catastrophic forgetting (CF). Then, we analyze these methods considering CL desiderata, computational and memory costs, as well as network complexity, hence emphasizing the need for energy-efficient CL. Afterward, we provide background of low-power neuromorphic systems including encoding techniques, neuronal dynamics, network architectures, learning rules, hardware processors, software and hardware frameworks, datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics. Then, this survey comprehensively reviews and analyzes state-of-the-art in NCL. The key ideas, implementation frameworks, and performance assessments are also provided. This survey covers several hybrid approaches that combine supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms. It also covers optimization techniques including SNN operations reduction, weight quantization, and knowledge distillation. Then, this survey discusses the progress of real-world NCL applications. Finally, this paper provides a future perspective on the open research challenges for NCL, since the purpose of this study is to be useful for the wider neuromorphic AI research community and to inspire future research in bio-plausible OCL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ameya Daigavane, Bodhi P. Vani, Darcy Davidson, Saeed Saremi, Joshua Rackers, Joseph Kleinhenz</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformational ensembles of protein structures are immensely important both for understanding protein function and drug discovery in novel modalities such as cryptic pockets. Current techniques for sampling ensembles such as molecular dynamics (MD) are computationally inefficient, while many recent machine learning methods do not transfer to systems outside their training data. We propose JAMUN which performs MD in a smoothed, noised space of all-atom 3D conformations of molecules by utilizing the framework of walk-jump sampling. JAMUN enables ensemble generation for small peptides at rates of an order of magnitude faster than traditional molecular dynamics. The physical priors in JAMUN enables transferability to systems outside of its training data, even to peptides that are longer than those originally trained on.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angelo Moroncelli, Vishal Soni, Marco Forgione, Dario Piga, Blerina Spahiu, Loris Roveda</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, generative AI and reinforcement learning (RL) have been redefining what is possible for AI agents that take information flows as input and produce intelligent behavior. As a result, we are seeing similar advancements in embodied AI and robotics for control policy generation. Our review paper examines the integration of generative AI models with RL to advance robotics. Our primary focus is on the duality between generative AI and RL for robotics downstream tasks. Specifically, we investigate: (1) The role of prominent generative AI tools as modular priors for multi-modal input fusion in RL tasks. (2) How RL can train, fine-tune and distill generative models for policy generation, such as VLA models, similarly to RL applications in large language models. We then propose a new taxonomy based on a considerable amount of selected papers.
  Lastly, we identify open challenges accounting for model scalability, adaptation and grounding, giving recommendations and insights on future research directions. We reflect on which generative AI models best fit the RL tasks and why. On the other side, we reflect on important issues inherent to RL-enhanced generative policies, such as safety concerns and failure modes, and what are the limitations of current methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthias C. Caro, Jens Eisert, Marcel Hinsche, Marios Ioannou, Alexander Nietner, Ryan Sweke</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of testing and learning from data in the presence of resource constraints, such as limited memory or weak data access, which place limitations on the efficiency and feasibility of testing or learning. In particular, we ask the following question: Could a resource-constrained learner/tester use interaction with a resource-unconstrained but untrusted party to solve a learning or testing problem more efficiently than they could without such an interaction? In this work, we answer this question both abstractly and for concrete problems, in two complementary ways: For a wide variety of scenarios, we prove that a resource-constrained learner cannot gain any advantage through classical interaction with an untrusted prover. As a special case, we show that for the vast majority of testing and learning problems in which quantum memory is a meaningful resource, a memory-constrained quantum algorithm cannot overcome its limitations via classical communication with a memory-unconstrained quantum prover. In contrast, when quantum communication is allowed, we construct a variety of interactive proof protocols, for specific learning and testing problems, which allow memory-constrained quantum verifiers to gain significant advantages through delegation to untrusted provers. These results highlight both the limitations and potential of delegating learning and testing problems to resource-rich but untrusted third parties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mubashara Akhtar, Michael Schlichtkrull, Andreas Vlachos</p>
<p>Abstract: Current automated fact-checking (AFC) approaches typically evaluate evidence either implicitly via the predicted verdicts or through exact matches with predefined closed knowledge sources, such as Wikipedia. However, these methods are limited due to their reliance on evaluation metrics originally designed for other purposes and constraints from closed knowledge sources. In this work, we introduce \textbf{\textcolor{skyblue}{Ev\textsuperscript{2}}\textcolor{orangebrown}{R}} which combines the strengths of reference-based evaluation and verdict-level proxy scoring. Ev\textsuperscript{2}R jointly assesses how well the evidence aligns with the gold references and how reliably it supports the verdict, addressing the shortcomings of prior methods. We evaluate Ev\textsuperscript{2}R against three types of evidence evaluation approaches: reference-based, proxy-reference, and reference-less baselines. Assessments against human ratings and adversarial tests demonstrate that Ev\textsuperscript{2}R consistently outperforms existing scoring approaches in accuracy and robustness. It achieves stronger correlation with human judgments and greater robustness to adversarial perturbations, establishing it as a reliable metric for evidence evaluation in AFC.\footnote{Code is available at \href{https://github.com/mubasharaak/fc-evidence-evaluation}{https://github.com/mubasharaak/fc-evidence-evaluation}.}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Won Jun Kim, Hyungjin Chung, Jaemin Kim, Sangmin Lee, Byeongsu Sim, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient-based methods are a prototypical family of explainability techniques, especially for image-based models. Nonetheless, they have several shortcomings in that they (1) require white-box access to models, (2) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and (3) produce attributions that lie off the image manifold, leading to explanations that are not actually faithful to the model and do not align well with human perception. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Derivative-Free Diffusion Manifold-Constrainted Gradients (FreeMCG), a novel method that serves as an improved basis for explainability of a given neural network than the traditional gradient. Specifically, by leveraging ensemble Kalman filters and diffusion models, we derive a derivative-free approximation of the model's gradient projected onto the data manifold, requiring access only to the model's outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FreeMCG by applying it to both counterfactual generation and feature attribution, which have traditionally been treated as distinct tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation on both tasks, counterfactual explanation and feature attribution, we show that our method yields state-of-the-art results while preserving the essential properties expected of XAI tools.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16644">An explainable operator approximation framework under the guideline of Green&#x27;s function</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianghang Gu, Ling Wen, Yuntian Chen, Shiyi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method and finite volume method, adress partial differential equations (PDEs) by discretizing them into algebraic equations and solving these iteratively. However, this process is often computationally expensive and time-consuming. An alternative approach involves transforming PDEs into integral equations and solving them using Green's functions, which provide analytical solutions. Nevertheless, deriving Green's functions analytically is a challenging and non-trivial task, particularly for complex systems. In this study, we introduce a novel framework, termed GreensONet, which is constructed based on the strucutre of deep operator networks (DeepONet) to learn embedded Green's functions and solve PDEs via Green's integral formulation. Specifically, the Trunk Net within GreensONet is designed to approximate the unknown Green's functions of the system, while the Branch Net are utilized to approximate the auxiliary gradients of the Green's function. These outputs are subsequently employed to perform surface integrals and volume integrals, incorporating user-defined boundary conditions and source terms, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated on three types of PDEs in bounded domains: 3D heat conduction equations, reaction-diffusion equations, and Stokes equations. Comparative results in these cases demonstrate that GreenONet's accuracy and generalization ability surpass those of existing methods, including Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), DeepONet, Physics-Informed DeepONet (PI-DeepONet), and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO).</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01182">RingFormer: A Neural Vocoder with Ring Attention and Convolution-Augmented Transformer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Seongho Hong, Yong-Hoon Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: While transformers demonstrate outstanding performance across various audio tasks, their application to neural vocoders remains challenging. Neural vocoders require the generation of long audio signals at the sample level, which demands high temporal resolution. This results in significant computational costs for attention map generation and limits their ability to efficiently process both global and local information. Additionally, the sequential nature of sample generation in neural vocoders poses difficulties for real-time processing, making the direct adoption of transformers impractical. To address these challenges, we propose RingFormer, a neural vocoder that incorporates the ring attention mechanism into a lightweight transformer variant, the convolution-augmented transformer (Conformer). Ring attention effectively captures local details while integrating global information, making it well-suited for processing long sequences and enabling real-time audio generation. RingFormer is trained using adversarial training with two discriminators. The proposed model is applied to the decoder of the text-to-speech model VITS and compared with state-of-the-art vocoders such as HiFi-GAN, iSTFT-Net, and BigVGAN under identical conditions using various objective and subjective metrics. Experimental results show that RingFormer achieves comparable or superior performance to existing models, particularly excelling in real-time audio generation. Our code and audio samples are available on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaniv Shulman</p>
<p>Abstract: Local Polynomial Regression (LPR) is a widely used nonparametric method for modeling complex relationships due to its flexibility and simplicity. It estimates a regression function by fitting low-degree polynomials to localized subsets of the data, weighted by proximity. However, traditional LPR is sensitive to outliers and high-leverage points, which can significantly affect estimation accuracy. This paper revisits the kernel function used to compute regression weights and proposes a novel framework that incorporates both predictor and response variables in the weighting mechanism. The focus of this work is a conditional density kernel that robustly estimates weights by mitigating the influence of outliers through localized density estimation. A related joint density kernel is also discussed in an appendix. The proposed method is implemented in Python and is publicly available at https://github.com/yaniv-shulman/rsklpr, demonstrating competitive performance in synthetic benchmark experiments. Compared to standard LPR, the proposed approach consistently improves robustness and accuracy, especially in heteroscedastic and noisy environments, without requiring multiple iterations. This advancement provides a promising extension to traditional LPR, opening new possibilities for robust regression applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hazem Taha, Ameer M. S. Abdelhadi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces HEPPO-GAE, an FPGA-based accelerator designed to optimize the Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) stage in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Unlike previous approaches that focused on trajectory collection and actor-critic updates, HEPPO-GAE addresses GAE's computational demands with a parallel, pipelined architecture implemented on a single System-on-Chip (SoC). This design allows for the adaptation of various hardware accelerators tailored for different PPO phases. A key innovation is our strategic standardization technique, which combines dynamic reward standardization and block standardization for values, followed by 8-bit uniform quantization. This method stabilizes learning, enhances performance, and manages memory bottlenecks, achieving a 4x reduction in memory usage and a 1.5x increase in cumulative rewards. We propose a solution on a single SoC device with programmable logic and embedded processors, delivering throughput orders of magnitude higher than traditional CPU-GPU systems. Our single-chip solution minimizes communication latency and throughput bottlenecks, significantly boosting PPO training efficiency. Experimental results show a 30% increase in PPO speed and a substantial reduction in memory access time, underscoring HEPPO-GAE's potential for broad applicability in hardware-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huayu Li, Zhengxiao He, Xiwen Chen, Ci Zhang, Stuart F. Quan, William D. S. Killgore, Shu-Fen Wung, Chen X. Chen, Geng Yuan, Jin Lu, Ao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in visually interpreting medical time-series data. However, their general-purpose design can limit domain-specific precision, and the proprietary nature of many models poses challenges for fine-tuning on specialized clinical datasets. Conversely, small specialized models (SSMs) offer strong performance on focused tasks but lack the broader reasoning needed for complex medical decision-making. To address these complementary limitations, we introduce \ConMIL{} (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a novel decision-support framework distinctively synergizes three key components: (1) a new Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) mechanism, QTrans-Pooling, designed for per-class interpretability in identifying clinically relevant physiological signal segments; (2) conformal prediction, integrated with MIL to generate calibrated, set-valued outputs with statistical reliability guarantees; and (3) a structured approach for these interpretable and uncertainty-quantified SSM outputs to enhance the visual inspection capabilities of LLMs. Our experiments on arrhythmia detection and sleep stage classification demonstrate that \ConMIL{} can enhance the accuracy of LLMs such as ChatGPT4.0, Qwen2-VL-7B, and MiMo-VL-7B-RL. For example, \ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B and MiMo-VL-7B-RL both achieves 94.92% and 96.82% precision on confident samples and (70.61% and 78.02%)/(78.10% and 71.98%) on uncertain samples for the two tasks, compared to 46.13% and 13.16% using the LLM alone. These results suggest that integrating task-specific models with LLMs may offer a promising pathway toward more interpretable and trustworthy AI-driven clinical decision support.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Hofst\"atter, Teun van der Weij, Jayden Teoh, Rada Djoneva, Henning Bartsch, Francis Rhys Ward</p>
<p>Abstract: Capability evaluations are required to understand and regulate AI systems that may be deployed or further developed. Therefore, it is important that evaluations provide an accurate estimation of an AI system's capabilities. However, in numerous cases, previously latent capabilities have been elicited from models, sometimes long after initial release. Accordingly, substantial efforts have been made to develop methods for eliciting latent capabilities from models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of capability elicitation techniques by intentionally training model organisms -- language models with hidden capabilities that are revealed by a password. We introduce a novel method for training model organisms, based on circuit-breaking, which is more robust to elicitation techniques than standard password-locked models. We focus on elicitation techniques based on prompting and activation steering, and compare these to fine-tuning methods. Prompting techniques can elicit the actual capability of both password-locked and circuit-broken model organisms in the MCQA setting, while steering fails to do so. For a code-generation task, only fine-tuning can elicit the hidden capabilities of our novel model organism. Additionally, our results suggest that combining techniques improves elicitation. Still, if possible, fine-tuning should be the method of choice to improve the trustworthiness of capability evaluations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Continual learning of multiple tasks remains a major challenge for neural networks. Here, we investigate how task order influences continual learning and propose a strategy for optimizing it. Leveraging a linear teacher-student model with latent factors, we derive an analytical expression relating task similarity and ordering to learning performance. Our analysis reveals two principles that hold under a wide parameter range: (1) tasks should be arranged from the least representative to the most typical, and (2) adjacent tasks should be dissimilar. We validate these rules on both synthetic data and real-world image classification datasets (Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100), demonstrating consistent performance improvements in both multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. Our work thus presents a generalizable framework for task-order optimization in task-incremental continual learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anjian Li, Sangjae Bae, David Isele, Ryne Beeson, Faizan M. Tariq</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory prediction and planning are essential for autonomous vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in dynamic environments. Traditional approaches often treat them separately, limiting the ability for interactive planning. While recent diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in multi-agent trajectory generation, their slow sampling is less suitable for high-frequency planning tasks. In this paper, we leverage the consistency model to build a predictive planner that samples from a joint distribution of ego and surrounding agents, conditioned on the ego vehicle's navigational goal. Trained on real-world human driving datasets, our consistency model generates higher-quality trajectories with fewer sampling steps than standard diffusion models, making it more suitable for real-time deployment. To enforce multiple planning constraints simultaneously on the ego trajectory, a novel online guided sampling approach inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is introduced. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our method enables proactive behavior such as nudging and yielding, and also demonstrates smoother, safer, and more efficient trajectories and satisfaction of multiple constraints under a limited computational budget.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores how large language models (LLMs) encode interwoven scientific knowledge, using chemical elements and LLaMA-series models as a case study. We identify a 3D spiral structure in the hidden states that aligns with the conceptual structure of the periodic table, suggesting that LLMs can reflect the geometric organization of scientific concepts learned from text. Linear probing reveals that middle layers encode continuous, overlapping attributes that enable indirect recall, while deeper layers sharpen categorical distinctions and incorporate linguistic context. These findings suggest that LLMs represent symbolic knowledge not as isolated facts, but as structured geometric manifolds that intertwine semantic information across layers. We hope this work inspires further exploration of how LLMs represent and reason about scientific knowledge, particularly in domains such as materials science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anirudh Sundar, Sinead Williamson, Katherine Metcalf, Barry-John Theobald, Skyler Seto, Masha Fedzechkina</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligned representations across languages is a desired property in multilingual large language models (mLLMs), as alignment can improve performance in cross-lingual tasks. Typically alignment requires fine-tuning a model, which is computationally expensive, and sizable language data, which often may not be available. A data-efficient alternative to fine-tuning is model interventions -- a method for manipulating model activations to steer generation into the desired direction. We analyze the effect of a popular intervention (finding experts) on the alignment of cross-lingual representations in mLLMs. We identify the neurons to manipulate for a given language and introspect the embedding space of mLLMs pre- and post-manipulation. We show that modifying the mLLM's activations changes its embedding space such that cross-lingual alignment is enhanced. Further, we show that the changes to the embedding space translate into improved downstream performance on retrieval tasks, with up to 2x improvements in top-1 accuracy on cross-lingual retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashley Lewis, Michael White, Jing Liu, Toshiaki Koike-Akino, Kieran Parsons, Ye Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in customer support is constrained by hallucination (generating false information) and the high cost of proprietary models. To address these challenges, we propose a retrieval-augmented question-answering (QA) pipeline and explore how to balance human input and automation. Using a dataset of questions about a Samsung Smart TV user manual, we demonstrate that synthetic data generated by LLMs outperforms crowdsourced data in reducing hallucination in finetuned models. We also compare self-training (fine-tuning models on their own outputs) and knowledge distillation (fine-tuning on stronger models' outputs, e.g., GPT-4o), and find that self-training achieves comparable hallucination reduction. We conjecture that this surprising finding can be attributed to increased exposure bias issues in the knowledge distillation case and support this conjecture with post hoc analysis. We also improve robustness to unanswerable questions and retrieval failures with contextualized "I don't know" responses. These findings show that scalable, cost-efficient QA systems can be built using synthetic data and self-training with open-source models, reducing reliance on proprietary tools or costly human annotations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Sukwon Yun, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Tianlong Chen, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Combining existing pre-trained expert LLMs is a promising avenue for scalably tackling large-scale and diverse tasks. However, selecting task-level experts is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise per instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we show that Symbolic-MoE beats strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute avg. gain of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE generalizes well to unseen tasks and removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoming Zhao, Alexander G. Schwing</p>
<p>Abstract: Classifier-free guidance has become a staple for conditional generation with denoising diffusion models. However, a comprehensive understanding of classifier-free guidance is still missing. In this work, we carry out an empirical study to provide a fresh perspective on classifier-free guidance. Concretely, instead of solely focusing on classifier-free guidance, we trace back to the root, i.e., classifier guidance, pinpoint the key assumption for the derivation, and conduct a systematic study to understand the role of the classifier. We find that both classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance achieve conditional generation by pushing the denoising diffusion trajectories away from decision boundaries, i.e., areas where conditional information is usually entangled and is hard to learn. Based on this classifier-centric understanding, we propose a generic postprocessing step built upon flow-matching to shrink the gap between the learned distribution for a pre-trained denoising diffusion model and the real data distribution, majorly around the decision boundaries. Experiments on various datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Camilo Chac\'on Sartori, Christian Blum</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown notable potential in code generation for optimization algorithms, unlocking exciting new opportunities. This paper examines how LLMs, rather than creating algorithms from scratch, can improve existing ones without the need for specialized expertise. To explore this potential, we selected 10 baseline optimization algorithms from various domains (metaheuristics, reinforcement learning, deterministic, and exact methods) to solve the classic Travelling Salesman Problem. The results show that our simple methodology often results in LLM-generated algorithm variants that improve over the baseline algorithms in terms of solution quality, reduction in computational time, and simplification of code complexity, all without requiring specialized optimization knowledge or advanced algorithmic implementation skills.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Gu, Aldeida Aleti, Chunyang Chen, Hongyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are widely used in software engineering for code generation, but they may produce code with errors. Rather than repairing the generated code, an alternative way is to address the underlying failures of models. LM repair offers a lightweight solution to this challenge: it requires minimal data, reduces computational costs, and reduces the side effects. Unlike retraining, LM repair focuses on applying tailored updates to targeted neurons, making it ideal for scenarios with limited resources, high-performance demands, or strict safety requirements. In this paper, we propose Semantic Targeting for Analytical Repair (STAR), a pioneering and novel semantic-based optimization approach for repairing LLMs. STAR realizes the main operations of repairing LMs in an optimization process, including locating ``buggy neurons'', solving ``neuron patches'', and patching ``buggy neurons''. Correspondingly, it computes the deltas of weight matrix as the prior information to guide optimization; and attributes the targeted layers and neurons leveraging statistical insights. The neuron patches are computed with a solid semantic-based analytical formula, which directly bridges the changes to logits with the deltas of neurons, by steering latent representations. Compared to the prior work of LM repair (MINT) and optimization methods (SGD), STAR integrates their strengths while mitigating their limitations. STAR supports solving multiple failures together, significantly improving the usefulness. Evaluated on coding tasks using popular code LMs, STAR exhibits superior effectiveness (10.5%-19.9% improvements) and efficiency (2.4-7.0 times speedup). In terms of side effects, namely the balance between generalization and specificity, STAR outperforms prior work by a significant margin. Additionally, we conducted assessments on the overfitting risk of LM repair as well as the cumulative impact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuwei Yin, EunJeong Hwang, Giuseppe Carenini</p>
<p>Abstract: Intent, typically clearly formulated and planned, functions as a cognitive framework for communication and problem-solving. This paper introduces the concept of Speaking with Intent (SWI) in large language models (LLMs), where the explicitly generated intent encapsulates the model's underlying intention and provides high-level planning to guide subsequent analysis and action. By emulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is hypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of LLMs. Extensive experiments on text summarization, multi-task question answering, and mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of Speaking with Intent over direct generation without explicit intent. Further analysis corroborates the generalizability of SWI under different experimental settings. Moreover, human evaluations verify the coherence, effectiveness, and interpretability of the intent produced by SWI. The promising results in enhancing LLMs with explicit intents pave a new avenue for boosting LLMs' generation and reasoning abilities with cognitive notions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Chen, Dror Ben-Zeev, Gillian Sparks, Arya Kadakia, Trevor Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains underdiagnosed in clinical settings, presenting opportunities for automated detection to identify patients. This study evaluates natural language processing approaches for detecting PTSD from clinical interview transcripts. We compared general and mental health-specific transformer models (BERT/RoBERTa), embedding-based methods (SentenceBERT/LLaMA), and large language model prompting strategies (zero-shot/few-shot/chain-of-thought) using the DAIC-WOZ dataset. Domain-specific end-to-end models significantly outperformed general models (Mental-RoBERTa AUPRC=0.675+/-0.084 vs. RoBERTa-base 0.599+/-0.145). SentenceBERT embeddings with neural networks achieved the highest overall performance (AUPRC=0.758+/-0.128). Few-shot prompting using DSM-5 criteria yielded competitive results with two examples (AUPRC=0.737). Performance varied significantly across symptom severity and comorbidity status with depression, with higher accuracy for severe PTSD cases and patients with comorbid depression. Our findings highlight the potential of domain-adapted embeddings and LLMs for scalable screening while underscoring the need for improved detection of nuanced presentations and offering insights for developing clinically viable AI tools for PTSD assessment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training effective AI agents for multi-turn interactions requires high-quality data that captures realistic human-agent dynamics, yet such data is scarce and expensive to collect manually. We introduce APIGen-MT, a two-phase framework that generates verifiable and diverse multi-turn agent data. In the first phase, our agentic pipeline produces detailed task blueprints with ground-truth actions, leveraging a committee of LLM reviewers and iterative feedback loops. These blueprints are then transformed into complete interaction trajectories through simulated human-agent interplay. We train a family of models -- the xLAM-2-fc-r series with sizes ranging from 1B to 70B parameters. Our models outperform frontier models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 on $\tau$-bench and BFCL benchmarks, with the smaller models surpassing their larger counterparts, particularly in multi-turn settings, while maintaining superior consistency across multiple trials. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our verified blueprint-to-details approach yields high-quality training data, enabling the development of more reliable, efficient, and capable agents. We open-source 5K synthetic data trajectories and the trained xLAM-2-fc-r models to advance research in AI agents.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaid Khan, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Archiki Prasad, Jaemin Cho, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientists often infer abstract procedures from specific instances of problems and use the abstractions to generate new, related instances. For example, programs encoding the formal rules and properties of a system have been useful in fields ranging from reinforcement learning (procedural environments) to physics (simulation engines). These programs can be seen as functions which execute to different outputs based on their parameterizations (e.g., gridworld configuration or initial physical conditions). We introduce the term EFA (Executable Functional Abstraction) to denote such programs for math problems. EFA-like constructs have been shown to be useful for mathematical reasoning as problem generators for stress-testing models. However, prior work has been limited to automatically constructing abstractions for grade-school math (whose simple rules are easy to encode in programs), while generating EFAs for advanced math has thus far required human engineering. We explore the automatic construction of EFAs for advanced mathematics problems by developing EFAGen, which operationalizes the task of automatically inferring an EFA for a given seed problem and solution as a program synthesis task. We first formalize the properties of any valid EFA as executable unit tests. Using execution feedback from the unit tests, we search over candidate programs sampled from a LLM to find EFA programs that are faithful to the generalized problem and solution class underlying the seed problem. We then apply the tests as a reward signal, training LLMs to become better writers of EFAs. We show that EFAs inferred by EFAGen are faithful to the seed problems, produce learnable problem variations, and that EFAGen can infer EFAs across diverse sources of competition-level math problems. Finally, we show uses of model-written EFAs e.g., finding harder/easier problem variants, as well as data generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has revolutionized diagnostic practices, enabling advanced analysis and interpretation of radiological data. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of radiomics-based and deep learning-based approaches for disease detection in chest radiography, focusing on COVID-19, lung opacity, and viral pneumonia. While deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, learn directly from image data, radiomics-based models extract handcrafted features, offering potential advantages in data-limited scenarios. We systematically compared the diagnostic performance of various AI models, including Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons for radiomics, against state-of-the-art deep learning models such as InceptionV3, EfficientNetL, and ConvNeXtXLarge. Performance was evaluated across multiple sample sizes. At 24 samples, EfficientNetL achieved an AUC of 0.839, outperforming SVM (AUC = 0.762). At 4000 samples, InceptionV3 achieved the highest AUC of 0.996, compared to 0.885 for Random Forest. A Scheirer-Ray-Hare test confirmed significant main and interaction effects of model type and sample size on all metrics. Post hoc Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni correction further revealed consistent performance advantages for deep learning models across most conditions. These findings provide statistically validated, data-driven recommendations for model selection in diagnostic AI. Deep learning models demonstrated higher performance and better scalability with increasing data availability, while radiomics-based models may remain useful in low-data contexts. This study addresses a critical gap in AI-based diagnostic research by offering practical guidance for deploying AI models across diverse clinical environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Volkan Bakir, Polat Goktas, Sureyya Akyuz</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important in decision-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and law. Counterfactual (CF) explanations, a key approach in XAI, provide users with actionable insights by suggesting minimal modifications to input features that lead to different model outcomes. Despite significant advancements, existing CF generation methods often struggle to balance proximity, diversity, and robustness, limiting their real-world applicability. A widely adopted framework, Diverse Counterfactual Explanations (DiCE), emphasizes diversity but lacks robustness, making CF explanations sensitive to perturbations and domain constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce DiCE-Extended, an enhanced CF explanation framework that integrates multi-objective optimization techniques to improve robustness while maintaining interpretability. Our approach introduces a novel robustness metric based on the Dice-S{\o}rensen coefficient, enabling stability under small input variations. Additionally, we refine CF generation using weighted loss components (lambda_p, lambda_d, lambda_r) to balance proximity, diversity, and robustness. We empirically validate DiCE-Extended on benchmark datasets (COMPAS, Lending Club, German Credit, Adult Income) across multiple ML backends (Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow). Results demonstrate improved CF validity, stability, and alignment with decision boundaries compared to standard DiCE-generated explanations. Our findings highlight the potential of DiCE-Extended in generating more reliable and interpretable CFs for high-stakes applications. Future work could explore adaptive optimization techniques and domain-specific constraints to further enhance CF generation in real-world scenarios</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyong Jin, Runhua Xu, Chao Li, Yizhong Liu, Jianxin Li, James Joshi</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy, yet it faces significant challenges in communication efficiency and vulnerability to poisoning attacks. While sparsification techniques mitigate communication overhead by transmitting only critical model parameters, they inadvertently amplify security risks: adversarial clients can exploit sparse updates to evade detection and degrade model performance. Existing defense mechanisms, designed for standard FL communication scenarios, are ineffective in addressing these vulnerabilities within sparsified FL. To bridge this gap, we propose FLARE, a novel federated learning framework that integrates sparse index mask inspection and model update sign similarity analysis to detect and mitigate poisoning attacks in sparsified FL. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and adversarial scenarios demonstrate that FLARE significantly outperforms existing defense strategies, effectively securing sparsified FL against poisoning attacks while maintaining communication efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present SemiOccam, an image recognition network that leverages semi-supervised learning in a highly efficient manner. Existing works often rely on complex training techniques and architectures, requiring hundreds of GPU hours for training, while their generalization ability with extremely limited labeled data remains to be improved. To address these limitations, we construct a hierarchical mixture density classification mechanism by optimizing mutual information between feature representations and target classes, compressing redundant information while retaining crucial discriminative components. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three commonly used datasets, with accuracy exceeding 95% on two of them using only 4 labeled samples per class, and its simple architecture keeps training time at the minute level. Notably, this paper reveals a long-overlooked data leakage issue in the STL-10 dataset for semi-supervised learning and removes duplicates to ensure reliable experimental results. We release the deduplicated CleanSTL-10 dataset to facilitate fair and reproducible research. Code available at https://github.com/Shu1L0n9/SemiOccam.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subhendu Khatuya, Shashwat Naidu, Saptarshi Ghosh, Pawan Goyal, Niloy Ganguly</p>
<p>Abstract: The explosion of textual data has made manual document classification increasingly challenging. To address this, we introduce a robust, efficient domain-agnostic generative model framework for multi-label text classification. Instead of treating labels as mere atomic symbols, our approach utilizes predefined label descriptions and is trained to generate these descriptions based on the input text. During inference, the generated descriptions are matched to the pre-defined labels using a finetuned sentence transformer. We integrate this with a dual-objective loss function, combining cross-entropy loss and cosine similarity of the generated sentences with the predefined target descriptions, ensuring both semantic alignment and accuracy. Our proposed model LAGAMC stands out for its parameter efficiency and versatility across diverse datasets, making it well-suited for practical applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model by achieving new state-of-the-art performances across all evaluated datasets, surpassing several strong baselines. We achieve improvements of 13.94% in Micro-F1 and 24.85% in Macro-F1 compared to the closest baseline across all datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autoregressive Transformers are increasingly being deployed as end-to-end robot and autonomous vehicle (AV) policy architectures, owing to their scalability and potential to leverage internet-scale pretraining for generalization. Accordingly, tokenizing sensor data efficiently is paramount to ensuring the real-time feasibility of such architectures on embedded hardware. To this end, we present an efficient triplane-based multi-camera tokenization strategy that leverages recent advances in 3D neural reconstruction and rendering to produce sensor tokens that are agnostic to the number of input cameras and their resolution, while explicitly accounting for their geometry around an AV. Experiments on a large-scale AV dataset and state-of-the-art neural simulator demonstrate that our approach yields significant savings over current image patch-based tokenization strategies, producing up to 72% fewer tokens, resulting in up to 50% faster policy inference while achieving the same open-loop motion planning accuracy and improved offroad rates in closed-loop driving simulations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel statistical inference framework for streaming principal component analysis (PCA) using Oja's algorithm, enabling the construction of confidence intervals for individual entries of the estimated eigenvector. Most existing works on streaming PCA focus on providing sharp sin-squared error guarantees. Recently, there has been some interest in uncertainty quantification for the sin-squared error. However, uncertainty quantification or sharp error guarantees for entries of the estimated eigenvector in the streaming setting remains largely unexplored. We derive a sharp Bernstein-type concentration bound for elements of the estimated vector matching the optimal error rate up to logarithmic factors. We also establish a Central Limit Theorem for a suitably centered and scaled subset of the entries. To efficiently estimate the coordinate-wise variance, we introduce a provably consistent subsampling algorithm that leverages the median-of-means approach, empirically achieving similar accuracy to multiplier bootstrap methods while being significantly more computationally efficient. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in providing reliable uncertainty estimates with a fraction of the computational cost of existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Phase distortion refers to the alteration of the phase relationships between frequencies in a signal, which can be perceptible. In this paper, we discuss a special case of phase distortion known as phase-intercept distortion, which is created by a frequency-independent phase shift. We hypothesize that, though this form of distortion changes a signal's waveform significantly, the distortion is imperceptible. Human-subject experiment results are reported which are consistent with this hypothesis. Furthermore, we discuss how the imperceptibility of phase-intercept distortion can be useful for machine learning, specifically for data augmentation. We conducted multiple experiments using phase-intercept distortion as a novel approach to data augmentation, and obtained improved results for audio machine learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sachin Garg, Micha{\l} Derezi\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: The Nystr\"om method is a popular low-rank approximation technique for large matrices that arise in kernel methods and convex optimization. Yet, when the data exhibits heavy-tailed spectral decay, the effective dimension of the problem often becomes so large that even the Nystr\"om method may be outside of our computational budget. To address this, we propose Block-Nystr\"om, an algorithm that injects a block-diagonal structure into the Nystr\"om method, thereby significantly reducing its computational cost while recovering strong approximation guarantees. We show that Block-Nystr\"om can be used to construct improved preconditioners for second-order optimization, as well as to efficiently solve kernel ridge regression for statistical learning over Hilbert spaces. Our key technical insight is that, within the same computational budget, combining several smaller Nystr\"om approximations leads to stronger tail estimates of the input spectrum than using one larger approximation. Along the way, we provide a novel recursive preconditioning scheme for efficiently inverting the Block-Nystr\"om matrix, and provide new statistical learning bounds for a broad class of approximate kernel ridge regression solvers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omer Luxembourg, Haim Permuter, Eliya Nachmani</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) promise fast, non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers, which pick tokens to unmask based on model confidence, ignore interactions when unmasking multiple positions in parallel and effectively reduce to slow, autoregressive behavior. We propose the Dilated Unmasking Scheduler (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that partitions sequence positions into non-adjacent dilated groups and unmasked them in parallel so as to minimize an upper bound on joint entropy gain at each denoising step. By explicitly trading off the number of network calls against generation quality, DUS recovers most of the performance lost under traditional parallel unmasking strategies. Across math (GSM8K, MATH500), code (HumanEval, MBPP) and general-knowledge benchmarks (BBH, MMLU-Pro), DUS outperforms confidence-based planners, without modifying the underlying denoiser, and reveals the true speed-quality frontier of MDLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Seung-Cheol Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians, we obtain analytic phase boundaries and logit gap criteria that predict which token should dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p<10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy in a production-grade model. In this work, we utilize the context-field lens, which provides physics-grounded interpretability and motivates the development of novel generative models bridging theoretical condensed matter physics and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Y. Suzuki, Y. Yukutake, T. Ohminato, M. Yamasaki, Ahyi Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Precisely classifying earthquake types is crucial for elucidating the relationship between volcanic earthquakes and volcanic activity. However, traditional methods rely on subjective human judgment, which requires considerable time and effort. To address this issue, we developed a deep learning model using a transformer encoder for a more objective and efficient classification. Tested on Mount Asama's diverse seismic activity, our model achieved high F1 scores (0.930 for volcano tectonic, 0.931 for low-frequency earthquakes, and 0.980 for noise), superior to a conventional CNN-based method. To enhance interpretability, attention weight visualizations were analyzed, revealing that the model focuses on key waveform features similarly to human experts. However, inconsistencies in training data, such as ambiguously labeled B-type events with S-waves, were found to influence classification accuracy and attention weight distributions. Experiments addressing data selection and augmentation demonstrated the importance of balancing data quality and diversity. In addition, stations within 3 km of the crater played an important role in improving model performance and interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of Transformer-based models for automated volcanic earthquake classification, particularly in improving efficiency and interpretability. By addressing challenges such as data imbalance and subjective labeling, our approach provides a robust framework for understanding seismic activity at Mount Asama. Moreover, this framework offers opportunities for transfer learning to other volcanic regions, paving the way for enhanced volcanic hazard assessments and disaster mitigation strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giwon Lee, Wooseong Jeong, Daehee Park, Jaewoo Jeong, Kuk-Jin Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component of autonomous robot driving. While various trajectory datasets exist, effectively utilizing them for a target domain remains challenging due to differences in agent interactions and environmental characteristics. Conventional approaches, such as domain adaptation or ensemble learning, leverage multiple source datasets but suffer from domain imbalance, catastrophic forgetting, and high computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose Interaction-Merged Motion Planning (IMMP), a novel approach that leverages parameter checkpoints trained on different domains during adaptation to the target domain. IMMP follows a two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions, sufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by merging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse interactions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning benchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Agnideep Aich, Ashit Baran Aich, Dipak C. Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP), a principled framework for constructing well-calibrated prediction intervals for non-stationary time series. TCP integrates a machine learning-based quantile forecaster with an online conformal calibration layer. This layer's thresholds are updated via a modified Robbins-Monro scheme, allowing the model to dynamically adapt to volatility clustering and regime shifts without rigid parametric assumptions. We benchmark TCP against GARCH, Historical Simulation, and static Quantile Regression across diverse financial assets. Our empirical results reveal a critical flaw in static methods: while sharp, Quantile Regression is poorly calibrated, systematically over-covering the nominal 95% target. In contrast, TCP's adaptive mechanism actively works to achieve the correct coverage level, successfully navigating the coverage-sharpness tradeoff. Visualizations during the 2020 market crash confirm TCP's superior adaptive response, and a comprehensive sensitivity analysis demonstrates the framework's robustness to hyperparameter choices. Overall, TCP offers a practical and theoretically-grounded solution to the central challenge of calibrated uncertainty quantification for time series under distribution shift, advancing the interface between statistical inference and machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan B. Guti\'errez</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) turn writing into a live exchange between humans and software. We characterize this new medium as a discursive network that treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements circulate. We define the generation of erroneous information as invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external detection. We develop a general mathematical model of discursive networks that shows that a network governed only by drift and self-repair stabilizes at a modest error rate. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer review with the open-source Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm: a configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a harmonizer merges their verdicts. We identify an ethical transgression, epithesis, that occurs when humans fail to engage in the discursive network. The takeaway is practical and cultural: reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from connecting imperfect ones into networks that enforce mutual accountability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Betschinske, Steven Peters</p>
<p>Abstract: The safety validation of automatic emergency braking system (AEBS) requires accurately distinguishing between false positive (FP) and true positive (TP) system activations. While simulations allow straightforward differentiation by comparing scenarios with and without interventions, analyzing activations from open-loop resimulations - such as those from field operational testing (FOT) - is more complex. This complexity arises from scenario parameter uncertainty and the influence of driver interventions in the recorded data. Human labeling is frequently used to address these challenges, relying on subjective assessments of intervention necessity or situational criticality, potentially introducing biases and limitations. This work proposes a rule-based classification approach leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to address those issues. Applied to a simplified AEBS, the proposed method reveals key strengths, limitations, and system requirements for effective implementation. The findings suggest that combining this approach with human labeling may enhance the transparency and consistency of classification, thereby improving the overall validation process. While the rule set for classification derived in this work adopts a conservative approach, the paper outlines future directions for refinement and broader applicability. Finally, this work highlights the potential of such methods to complement existing practices, paving the way for more reliable and reproducible AEBS validation frameworks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into flexible, subquadratic architectures for infinite-context generation. Transformer-based LLMs face significant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase, due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value (KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while preserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are often limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating mechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent state-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports constant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more flexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global context compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory, forming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and fine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware algorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher model's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while significantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU benchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant improvements on associative recall tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Behraj Khan, Tahir Qasim Syed, Nouman M. Durrani, Bilal Naseem, Shabir Ahmad, Rizwan Qureshi</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models like CLIP and SAM have advanced computer vision and medical imaging via low-shot transfer learning, aiding CADD with limited data. However, their deployment faces two key challenges. \textit{distribution shift} where pre-training and post-training data distributions differ (e.g., due to inter-center image acquisition) and \textit{confidence misalignment}, which leads to overconfident errors. These issues surface differently, vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) suffer from 2D embedding shift (image-text misalignment), while medical models (e.g., SAM) encounter 3D domain shifts (e.g., scanner variation) and voxel-wise calibration need. Existing solutions are domain-specific. We propose \textbf{StaRFM}, a fusion of Fisher information penalty (FIP) and confidence misalignment penalty (CMP) tackling both challenges. It applies FIP, extended to 3D via patch-wise regularization, to reduce embedding shift, and CMP, reformulated for voxel-level predictions, to calibrate segmentation uncertainty. We derive PAC-Bayes bounds. FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, and CMP reduces calibration error via Brier score minimization. StaRFM surpasses baselines by \texttt{+}3.5\% accuracy and 28\% lower ECE on 19 vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Office-Home), achieves +4.2\% DSC over SAM-FT and 4.8mm HD95 on medical benchmarks (e.g., BraTS, ATLAS), and reduces cross-domain gaps by up to 20\%. The framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal architectural changes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Path smoothness is often overlooked in path imitation learning from expert demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning method, termed deep angular A* (DAA*), by incorporating the proposed path angular freedom (PAF) into A* to improve path similarity through adaptive path smoothness. The PAF aims to explore the effect of move angles on path node expansion by finding the trade-off between their minimum and maximum values, allowing for high adaptiveness for imitation learning. DAA* improves path optimality by closely aligning with the reference path through joint optimization of path shortening and smoothing, which correspond to heuristic distance and PAF, respectively. Throughout comprehensive evaluations on 7 datasets, including 4 maze datasets, 2 video-game datasets, and a real-world drone-view dataset containing 2 scenarios, we demonstrate remarkable improvements of our DAA* over neural A* in path similarity between the predicted and reference paths with a shorter path length when the shortest path is plausible, improving by 9.0% SPR, 6.9% ASIM, and 3.9% PSIM. Furthermore, when jointly learning pathfinding with both path loss and path probability map loss, DAA* significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art TransPath by 6.7% SPR, 6.5% PSIM, and 3.7% ASIM. We also discuss the minor trade-off between path optimality and search efficiency where applicable. Our code and model weights are available at https://github.com/zwxu064/DAAStar.git.</p>

<p>Abstract: Camera traps have long been used by wildlife researchers to monitor and study animal behavior, population dynamics, habitat use, and species diversity in a non-invasive and efficient manner. While data collection from the field has increased with new tools and capabilities, methods to develop, process, and manage the data, especially the adoption of ML/AI tools, remain challenging. These challenges include the sheer volume of data generated, the need for accurate labeling and annotation, variability in environmental conditions affecting data quality, and the integration of ML/AI tools into existing workflows that often require domain-specific customization and computational resources. This paper provides a guide to a low-resource pipeline to process camera trap data on-premise, incorporating ML/AI capabilities tailored for small research groups with limited resources and computational expertise. By focusing on practical solutions, the pipeline offers accessible approaches for data transmission, inference, and evaluation, enabling researchers to discover meaningful insights from their ever-increasing camera trap datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhossein Ansari, Ke Wang, Pulei Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models like CLIP have enabled zero-shot OOD detection by leveraging both image and textual label information. Among these, negative label-based methods such as NegLabel and CSP have shown promising results by utilizing a lexicon of words to define negative labels for distinguishing OOD samples. However, these methods suffer from detecting in-distribution samples as OOD due to negative labels that are subcategories of in-distribution labels or proper nouns. They also face limitations in handling images that match multiple in-distribution and negative labels. We propose NegRefine, a novel negative label refinement framework for zero-shot OOD detection. By introducing a filtering mechanism to exclude subcategory labels and proper nouns from the negative label set and incorporating a multi-matching-aware scoring function that dynamically adjusts the contributions of multiple labels matching an image, NegRefine ensures a more robust separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. We evaluate NegRefine on large-scale benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K. The code is available at https://github.com/ah-ansari/NegRefine.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive. Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer. MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy, while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has ushered in a new era of observational astronomy, emphasizing the need for rapid and detailed parameter estimation and population-level analyses. Traditional Bayesian inference methods, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo, face significant computational challenges when dealing with the high-dimensional parameter spaces and complex noise characteristics inherent in gravitational wave data. This review examines the emerging role of simulation-based inference methods in gravitational wave astronomy, with a focus on approaches that leverage machine-learning techniques such as normalizing flows and neural posterior estimation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based inference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio estimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency models. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse gravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter estimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and conducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed improvements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their model-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to their widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of conventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter spaces and noise conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) are powerful tools for modeling spatial and temporal data dependencies. However, their applications have been limited primarily to small-scale datasets because of memory constraints. While distributed training offers a solution, current frameworks lack support for spatiotemporal models and overlook the properties of spatiotemporal data. Informed by a scaling study on a large-scale workload, we present PyTorch Geometric Temporal Index (PGT-I), an extension to PyTorch Geometric Temporal that integrates distributed data parallel training and two novel strategies: index-batching and distributed-index-batching. Our index techniques exploit spatiotemporal structure to construct snapshots dynamically at runtime, significantly reducing memory overhead, while distributed-index-batching extends this approach by enabling scalable processing across multiple GPUs. Our techniques enable the first-ever training of an ST-GNN on the entire PeMS dataset without graph partitioning, reducing peak memory usage by up to 89% and achieving up to a 11.78x speedup over standard DDP with 128 GPUs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saptarshi Mitra, Rachid Karami, Haocheng Xu, Sitao Huang, Hyoukjun Kwon</p>
<p>Abstract: The demand for machine intelligence capable of processing continuous, long-context inputs on local devices is growing rapidly. However, the quadratic complexity and memory requirements of traditional Transformer architectures make them inefficient and often unusable for these tasks. This has spurred a paradigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and hybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses on the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic performance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically needed to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications.
  To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of carefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for long-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs. Our analysis reveals that SSMs are not only viable but superior for this domain, capable of processing sequences up to 220K tokens on a 24GB consumer GPU-approximately 4x longer than comparable Transformers. While Transformers may be up to 1.8x faster at short sequences, SSMs demonstrate a dramatic performance inversion, becoming up to 4x faster at very long contexts (~57K tokens). Our operator-level analysis reveals that custom, hardware-aware SSM kernels dominate the inference runtime, accounting for over 55% of latency on edge platforms, identifying them as a primary target for future hardware acceleration. We also provide detailed, device-specific characterization results to guide system co-design for the edge. To foster further research, we will open-source our characterization framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hayeon Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving refer to situations that deviate from the training domain, often leading to unexpected and potentially hazardous behavior from planners that lack prior exposure to such cases. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as "go straight" or "turn right." However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics. This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents in the context of autonomous driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoya Li, Xiaofei Sun, Albert Wang, Jiwei Li, Chris Shum</p>
<p>Abstract: The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources, driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models, has created an urgent need for automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show promise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.
  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures, achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40, x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100. Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that harm performance.
  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning abilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.</p>
