<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiapeng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Many studies have revealed that sentence comprehension relies more on semantic processing than on syntactic processing. However, previous studies have predominantly emphasized the preference for semantic processing, focusing on the semantic perspective. In contrast, this current study highlights the under-utilization of syntactic processing, from a syntactic perspective. Based on the traditional garden-path experiment, which involves locally ambiguous but globally unambiguous sentences, this study's empirical experiment innovatively crafted an adapted version featuring semantically ambiguous but syntactically unambiguous sentences to meet its specific research objective. This experiment, involving 140 subjects, demonstrates through descriptive and inferential statistical analyses using SPSS, Graph Pad Prism, and Cursor that Chinese learners of English tend to under-utilize syntactic processing when comprehending English sentences. The study identifies two types of parsing under-utilization: partial and complete. Further exploration reveals that trial and error in syntactic processing contributes to both. Consequently, this study lays a foundation for the development of a novel parsing method designed to fully integrate syntactic processing into sentence comprehension, thereby enhancing the level of English sentence comprehension for Chinese learners of English.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00031">Distilling Large Language Models for Efficient Clinical Information Extraction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Karthik S. Vedula, Annika Gupta, Akshay Swaminathan, Ivan Lopez, Suhana Bedi, Nigam H. Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at clinical information extraction but their computational demands limit practical deployment. Knowledge distillation--the process of transferring knowledge from larger to smaller models--offers a potential solution. We evaluate the performance of distilled BERT models, which are approximately 1,000 times smaller than modern LLMs, for clinical named entity recognition (NER) tasks. We leveraged state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemini and OpenAI models) and medical ontologies (RxNorm and SNOMED) as teacher labelers for medication, disease, and symptom extraction. We applied our approach to over 3,300 clinical notes spanning five publicly available datasets, comparing distilled BERT models against both their teacher labelers and BERT models fine-tuned on human labels. External validation was conducted using clinical notes from the MedAlign dataset. For disease extraction, F1 scores were 0.82 (teacher model), 0.89 (BioBERT trained on human labels), and 0.84 (BioBERT-distilled). For medication, F1 scores were 0.84 (teacher model), 0.91 (BioBERT-human), and 0.87 (BioBERT-distilled). For symptoms: F1 score of 0.73 (teacher model) and 0.68 (BioBERT-distilled). Distilled BERT models had faster inference (12x, 4x, 8x faster than GPT-4o, o1-mini, and Gemini Flash respectively) and lower costs (85x, 101x, 2x cheaper than GPT-4o, o1-mini, and Gemini Flash respectively). On the external validation dataset, the distilled BERT model achieved F1 scores of 0.883 (medication), 0.726 (disease), and 0.699 (symptom). Distilled BERT models were up to 101x cheaper and 12x faster than state-of-the-art LLMs while achieving similar performance on NER tasks. Distillation offers a computationally efficient and scalable alternative to large LLMs for clinical information extraction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saughmon Boujkian</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of transfer learning in machine translation across diverse linguistic families by evaluating five distinct language pairs. Leveraging pre-trained models on high-resource languages, these models were fine-tuned on low-resource languages, examining variations in hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and weight decay. The research encompasses language pairs from different linguistic backgrounds: Semitic (Modern Standard Arabic - Levantine Arabic), Bantu (Hausa - Zulu), Romance (Spanish - Catalan), Slavic (Slovakian - Macedonian), and language isolates (Eastern Armenian - Western Armenian). Results demonstrate that transfer learning is effective across different language families, although the impact of hyperparameters varies. A moderate batch size (e.g., 32) is generally more effective, while very high learning rates can disrupt model training. The study highlights the universality of transfer learning in multilingual contexts and suggests that consistent hyperparameter settings can simplify and enhance the efficiency of multilingual model training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lamya Benaddi, Charaf Ouaddi, Adnane Souha, Abdeslam Jakimi, Mohamed Rahouti, Mohammed Aledhari, Diogo Oliveira, Brahim Ouchao</p>
<p>Abstract: A chatbot is an intelligent software application that automates conversations and engages users in natural language through messaging platforms. Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots serve various functions, including customer service, information gathering, and casual conversation. Existing virtual assistant chatbots, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, demonstrate the potential of AI in Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, many current solutions rely on predefined APIs, which can result in vendor lock-in and high costs. To address these challenges, this work proposes a chatbot developed using a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model with an encoder-decoder architecture that incorporates attention mechanisms and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. By avoiding predefined APIs, this approach ensures flexibility and cost-effectiveness. The chatbot is trained, validated, and tested on a dataset specifically curated for the tourism sector in Draa-Tafilalet, Morocco. Key evaluation findings indicate that the proposed Seq2Seq model-based chatbot achieved high accuracies: approximately 99.58% in training, 98.03% in validation, and 94.12% in testing. These results demonstrate the chatbot's effectiveness in providing relevant and coherent responses within the tourism domain, highlighting the potential of specialized AI applications to enhance user experience and satisfaction in niche markets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziye Chen, Hao Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical problem-solving is a key field in artificial intelligence (AI) and a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While extensive research has focused on mathematical problem-solving, most existing work and datasets concentrate on computational tasks, leaving gaps in areas like mathematical analysis, which demands rigorous proofs and formal reasoning. We developed the DEMI-MathAnalysis dataset, comprising proof-based problems from mathematical analysis topics such as Sequences and Limits, Infinite Series, and Convex Functions. We also designed a guiding framework to rigorously enhance LLMs' ability to solve these problems. Through fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset and employing our framework, we observed significant improvements in their capability to generate logical, complete, and elegant proofs. This work addresses critical gaps in mathematical reasoning and contributes to advancing trustworthy AI capable of handling formalized mathematical language. The code is publicly accessible at LLMs for Mathematical Analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James P. Beno</p>
<p>Abstract: Bidirectional transformers excel at sentiment analysis, and Large Language Models (LLM) are effective zero-shot learners. Might they perform better as a team? This paper explores collaborative approaches between ELECTRA and GPT-4o for three-way sentiment classification. We fine-tuned (FT) four models (ELECTRA Base/Large, GPT-4o/4o-mini) using a mix of reviews from Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) and DynaSent. We provided input from ELECTRA to GPT as: predicted label, probabilities, and retrieved examples. Sharing ELECTRA Base FT predictions with GPT-4o-mini significantly improved performance over either model alone (82.74 macro F1 vs. 79.29 ELECTRA Base FT, 79.52 GPT-4o-mini) and yielded the lowest cost/performance ratio (\$0.12/F1 point). However, when GPT models were fine-tuned, including predictions decreased performance. GPT-4o FT-M was the top performer (86.99), with GPT-4o-mini FT close behind (86.77) at much less cost (\$0.38 vs. \$1.59/F1 point). Our results show that augmenting prompts with predictions from fine-tuned encoders is an efficient way to boost performance, and a fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini is nearly as good as GPT-4o FT at 76% less cost. Both are affordable options for projects with limited resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bohdan Turbal, Anastasiia Mazur, Jiaxu Zhao, Mykola Pechenizkiy</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the adversarial robustness of LLMs in transfer learning scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (MBIB Hate Speech, MBIB Political Bias, MBIB Gender Bias) and various model architectures (BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, Gemma, Phi), we reveal that transfer learning, while improving standard performance metrics, often leads to increased vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Our findings demonstrate that larger models exhibit greater resilience to this phenomenon, suggesting a complex interplay between model size, architecture, and adaptation methods. Our work highlights the crucial need for considering adversarial robustness in transfer learning scenarios and provides insights into maintaining model security without compromising performance. These findings have significant implications for the development and deployment of LLMs in real-world applications where both performance and robustness are paramount.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arinbj\"orn Kolbeinsson, Benedikt Kolbeinsson</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative language models are increasingly used for contract drafting and enhancement, creating a scenario where competing parties deploy different language models against each other. This introduces not only a game-theory challenge but also significant concerns related to AI safety and security, as the language model employed by the opposing party can be unknown. These competitive interactions can be seen as adversarial testing grounds, where models are effectively red-teamed to expose vulnerabilities such as generating biased, harmful or legally problematic text. Despite the importance of these challenges, the competitive robustness and safety of these models in adversarial settings remain poorly understood. In this small study, we approach this problem by evaluating the performance and vulnerabilities of major open-source language models in head-to-head competitions, simulating real-world contract negotiations. We further explore how these adversarial interactions can reveal potential risks, informing the development of more secure and reliable models. Our findings contribute to the growing body of research on AI safety, offering insights into model selection and optimisation in competitive legal contexts and providing actionable strategies for mitigating risks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Core Francisco Park, Andrew Lee, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Yongyi Yang, Maya Okawa, Kento Nishi, Martin Wattenberg, Hidenori Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that semantics specified by pretraining data influence how representations of different concepts are organized in a large language model (LLM). However, given the open-ended nature of LLMs, e.g., their ability to in-context learn, we can ask whether models alter these pretraining semantics to adopt alternative, context-specified ones. Specifically, if we provide in-context exemplars wherein a concept plays a different role than what the pretraining data suggests, do models reorganize their representations in accordance with these novel semantics? To answer this question, we take inspiration from the theory of conceptual role semantics and define a toy "graph tracing" task wherein the nodes of the graph are referenced via concepts seen during training (e.g., apple, bird, etc.) and the connectivity of the graph is defined via some predefined structure (e.g., a square grid). Given exemplars that indicate traces of random walks on the graph, we analyze intermediate representations of the model and find that as the amount of context is scaled, there is a sudden re-organization from pretrained semantic representations to in-context representations aligned with the graph structure. Further, we find that when reference concepts have correlations in their semantics (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.), the context-specified graph structure is still present in the representations, but is unable to dominate the pretrained structure. To explain these results, we analogize our task to energy minimization for a predefined graph topology, providing evidence towards an implicit optimization process to infer context-specified semantics. Overall, our findings indicate scaling context-size can flexibly re-organize model representations, possibly unlocking novel capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformers with causal attention can solve tasks that require positional information without using positional encodings. In this work, we propose and investigate a new hypothesis about how positional information can be stored without using explicit positional encoding. We observe that nearby embeddings are more similar to each other than faraway embeddings, allowing the transformer to potentially reconstruct the positions of tokens. We show that this pattern can occur in both the trained and the randomly initialized Transformer models with causal attention and no positional encodings over a common range of hyperparameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mourad Heddaya, Kyle MacMillan, Anup Malani, Hongyuan Mei, Chenhao Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces CaseSumm, a novel dataset for long-context summarization in the legal domain that addresses the need for longer and more complex datasets for summarization evaluation. We collect 25.6K U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) opinions and their official summaries, known as "syllabuses." Our dataset is the largest open legal case summarization dataset, and is the first to include summaries of SCOTUS decisions dating back to 1815.
  We also present a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-generated summaries using both automatic metrics and expert human evaluation, revealing discrepancies between these assessment methods. Our evaluation shows Mistral 7b, a smaller open-source model, outperforms larger models on most automatic metrics and successfully generates syllabus-like summaries. In contrast, human expert annotators indicate that Mistral summaries contain hallucinations. The annotators consistently rank GPT-4 summaries as clearer and exhibiting greater sensitivity and specificity. Further, we find that LLM-based evaluations are not more correlated with human evaluations than traditional automatic metrics. Furthermore, our analysis identifies specific hallucinations in generated summaries, including precedent citation errors and misrepresentations of case facts. These findings demonstrate the limitations of current automatic evaluation methods for legal summarization and highlight the critical role of human evaluation in assessing summary quality, particularly in complex, high-stakes domains.

<p>Abstract: Introduction: Healthcare AI models often inherit biases from their training data. While efforts have primarily targeted bias in structured data, mental health heavily depends on unstructured data. This study aims to detect and mitigate linguistic differences related to non-biological differences in the training data of AI models designed to assist in pediatric mental health screening. Our objectives are: (1) to assess the presence of bias by evaluating outcome parity across sex subgroups, (2) to identify bias sources through textual distribution analysis, and (3) to develop a de-biasing method for mental health text data. Methods: We examined classification parity across demographic groups and assessed how gendered language influences model predictions. A data-centric de-biasing method was applied, focusing on neutralizing biased terms while retaining salient clinical information. This methodology was tested on a model for automatic anxiety detection in pediatric patients. Results: Our findings revealed a systematic under-diagnosis of female adolescent patients, with a 4% lower accuracy and a 9% higher False Negative Rate (FNR) compared to male patients, likely due to disparities in information density and linguistic differences in patient notes. Notes for male patients were on average 500 words longer, and linguistic similarity metrics indicated distinct word distributions between genders. Implementing our de-biasing approach reduced diagnostic bias by up to 27%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing equity across demographic groups. Discussion: We developed a data-centric de-biasing framework to address gender-based content disparities within clinical text. By neutralizing biased language and enhancing focus on clinically essential information, our approach demonstrates an effective strategy for mitigating bias in AI healthcare models trained on text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Song, Mahmud Akhter, Dana Atzil Slonim, Maria Liakata</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores whether enhancing temporal reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve the quality of timeline summarization, the task of summarising long texts containing sequences of events, particularly social media threads . We introduce \textit{NarrativeReason}, a novel dataset focused on temporal relationships among sequential events within narratives, distinguishing it from existing temporal reasoning datasets that primarily address pair-wise event relationships. Our approach then combines temporal reasoning with timeline summarization through a knowledge distillation framework, where we first fine-tune a teacher model on temporal reasoning tasks and then distill this knowledge into a student model while simultaneously training it for the task of timeline summarization. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance on mental health-related timeline summarization tasks, which involve long social media threads with repetitions of events and a mix of emotions, highlighting the importance of leveraging temporal reasoning to improve timeline summarisation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subramaniam Vincent, Phoebe Wang, Zhan Shi, Sahas Koka, Yi Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, the capacities of Large Language Models and their evaluation have been in constant discussion and evaluation both in academic research and in the industry. Scenarios and benchmarks have been developed in several areas such as law, medicine and math (Bommasani et al., 2023) and there is continuous evaluation of model variants. One area that has not received sufficient scenario development attention is journalism, and in particular journalistic sourcing and ethics. Journalism is a crucial truth-determination function in democracy (Vincent, 2023), and sourcing is a crucial pillar to all original journalistic output. Evaluating the capacities of LLMs to annotate stories for the different signals of sourcing and how reporters justify them is a crucial scenario that warrants a benchmark approach. It offers potential to build automated systems to contrast more transparent and ethically rigorous forms of journalism with everyday fare. In this paper we lay out a scenario to evaluate LLM performance on identifying and annotating sourcing in news stories on a five-category schema inspired from journalism studies (Gans, 2004). We offer the use case, our dataset and metrics and as the first step towards systematic benchmarking. Our accuracy findings indicate LLM-based approaches have more catching to do in identifying all the sourced statements in a story, and equally, in matching the type of sources. An even harder task is spotting source justifications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text Classification (TC) stands as a cornerstone within the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly when viewed through the lens of computer science and engineering. The past decade has seen deep learning revolutionize TC, propelling advancements in text retrieval, categorization, information extraction, and summarization. The scholarly literature is rich with datasets, models, and evaluation criteria, with English being the predominant language of focus, despite studies involving Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, and others. The efficacy of TC models relies heavily on their ability to capture intricate textual relationships and nonlinear correlations, necessitating a comprehensive examination of the entire TC pipeline.
  This monograph provides an in-depth exploration of the TC pipeline, with a particular emphasis on evaluating the impact of each component on the overall performance of TC models. The pipeline includes state-of-the-art datasets, text preprocessing techniques, text representation methods, classification models, evaluation metrics, current results and future trends. Each chapter meticulously examines these stages, presenting technical innovations and significant recent findings. The work critically assesses various classification strategies, offering comparative analyses, examples, case studies, and experimental evaluations. These contributions extend beyond a typical survey, providing a detailed and insightful exploration of TC.</p>

Additionally, the shortage of specialized personnel is a critical issue because clinical depression diagnosis is highly dependent on expert professionals and is time consuming.
  In this study, we explore the use of GPT-4 for clinical depression assessment based on transcript analysis. We examine the model's ability to classify patient interviews into binary categories: depressed and not depressed. A comparative analysis is conducted considering prompt complexity (e.g., using both simple and complex prompts) as well as varied temperature settings to assess the impact of prompt complexity and randomness on the model's performance.
  Results indicate that GPT-4 exhibits considerable variability in accuracy and F1-Score across configurations, with optimal performance observed at lower temperature values (0.0-0.2) for complex prompts. However, beyond a certain threshold (temperature >= 0.3), the relationship between randomness and performance becomes unpredictable, diminishing the gains from prompt complexity.
  These findings suggest that, while GPT-4 shows promise for clinical assessment, the configuration of the prompts and model parameters requires careful calibration to ensure consistent results. This preliminary study contributes to understanding the dynamics between prompt engineering and large language models, offering insights for future development of AI-powered tools in clinical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moaiz Abrar, Yusuf Sermet, Ibrahim Demir</p>
<p>Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of several Large Language Models (LLMs) on MedRedQA, a dataset of consumer-based medical questions and answers by verified experts extracted from the AskDocs subreddit. While LLMs have shown proficiency in clinical question answering (QA) benchmarks, their effectiveness on real-world, consumer-based, medical questions remains less understood. MedRedQA presents unique challenges, such as informal language and the need for precise responses suited to non-specialist queries. To assess model performance, responses were generated using five LLMs: GPT-4o mini, Llama 3.1: 70B, Mistral-123B, Mistral-7B, and Gemini-Flash. A cross-evaluation method was used, where each model evaluated its responses as well as those of others to minimize bias. The results indicated that GPT-4o mini achieved the highest alignment with expert responses according to four out of the five models' judges, while Mistral-7B scored lowest according to three out of five models' judges. This study highlights the potential and limitations of current LLMs for consumer health medical question answering, indicating avenues for further development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hikari Tomita, Nobuhiro Nakamura, Shoichi Ishida, Toshio Kamiya, Kei Terayama</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, many studies have increasingly explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate research ideas and scientific hypotheses. However, real-world research and development often require solving complex, interdisciplinary challenges where solutions may not be readily found through existing knowledge related to the problem. Therefore, it is desirable to leverage the vast, comprehensive knowledge of LLMs to generate effective, breakthrough solutions by integrating various perspectives from other disciplines. Here, we propose SELLM (Solution Enumeration via comprehensive List and LLM), a framework leveraging LLMs and structured guidance using MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principles, such as International Patent Classification (IPC) and the periodic table of elements. SELLM systematically constructs comprehensive expert agents from the list to generate cross-disciplinary and effective solutions. To evaluate SELLM's practicality, we applied it to two challenges: improving light extraction in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) lighting and developing electrodes for next-generation memory materials. The results demonstrate that SELLM significantly facilitates the generation of effective solutions compared to cases without specific customization or effort, showcasing the potential of SELLM to enable LLMs to generate effective solutions even for challenging problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Retkowski, Alexander Waibel</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with precise length control, particularly in zero-shot settings. We conduct a comprehensive study evaluating LLMs' length control capabilities across multiple measures and propose practical methods to improve controllability. Our experiments with LLaMA 3 reveal stark differences in length adherence across measures and highlight inherent biases of the model. To address these challenges, we introduce a set of methods: length approximation, target adjustment, sample filtering, and automated revisions. By combining these methods, we demonstrate substantial improvements in length compliance while maintaining or enhancing summary quality, providing highly effective zero-shot strategies for precise length control without the need for model fine-tuning or architectural changes. With our work, we not only advance our understanding of LLM behavior in controlled text generation but also pave the way for more reliable and adaptable summarization systems in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giuliano Lorenzoni, Ivens Portugal, Paulo Alencar, Donald Cowan</p>
<p>Abstract: This study evaluates fine-tuning strategies for text classification using the DistilBERT model, specifically the distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english variant. Through structured experiments, we examine the influence of hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs on accuracy, F1-score, and loss. Polynomial regression analyses capture foundational and incremental impacts of these hyperparameters, focusing on fine-tuning adjustments relative to a baseline model.
  Results reveal variability in metrics due to hyperparameter configurations, showing trade-offs among performance metrics. For example, a higher learning rate reduces loss in relative analysis (p=0.027) but challenges accuracy improvements. Meanwhile, batch size significantly impacts accuracy and F1-score in absolute regression (p=0.028 and p=0.005) but has limited influence on loss optimization (p=0.170). The interaction between epochs and batch size maximizes F1-score (p=0.001), underscoring the importance of hyperparameter interplay.
  These findings highlight the need for fine-tuning strategies addressing non-linear hyperparameter interactions to balance performance across metrics. Such variability and metric trade-offs are relevant for tasks beyond text classification, including NLP and computer vision. This analysis informs fine-tuning strategies for large language models and promotes adaptive designs for broader model applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichi Zhang, Zhuo Chen, Lingbing Guo, Yajing Xu, Shaokai Chen, Mengshu Sun, Binbin Hu, Zhiqiang Zhang, Lei Liang, Wen Zhang, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in text generation within current NLP research. However, the lack of factual accuracy is still a dark cloud hanging over the LLM skyscraper. Structural knowledge prompting (SKP) is a prominent paradigm to integrate external knowledge into LLMs by incorporating structural representations, achieving state-of-the-art results in many knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing methods often focus on specific problems, lacking a comprehensive exploration of the generalization and capability boundaries of SKP. This paper aims to evaluate and rethink the generalization capability of the SKP paradigm from four perspectives including Granularity, Transferability, Scalability, and Universality. To provide a thorough evaluation, we introduce a novel multi-granular, multi-level benchmark called SUBARU, consisting of 9 different tasks with varying levels of granularity and difficulty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raymond Bernard (PhD), Shaina Raza (PhD), Subhabrata Das (PhD), Rahul Murugan</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable coherence of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing evaluation methods often suffer from fluency bias and rely heavily on multiple-choice formats, making it difficult to assess factual accuracy and complex reasoning effectively. LLMs thus frequently generate factually inaccurate responses, especially in complex reasoning tasks, highlighting two prominent challenges: (1) the inadequacy of existing methods to evaluate reasoning and factual accuracy effectively, and (2) the reliance on human evaluators for nuanced judgment, as illustrated by Williams and Huckle (2024)[1], who found manual grading indispensable despite automated grading advancements.
  To address evaluation gaps in open-ended reasoning tasks, we introduce the EQUATOR Evaluator (Evaluation of Question Answering Thoroughness in Open-ended Reasoning). This framework combines deterministic scoring with a focus on factual accuracy and robust reasoning assessment. Using a vector database, EQUATOR pairs open-ended questions with human-evaluated answers, enabling more precise and scalable evaluations. In practice, EQUATOR significantly reduces reliance on human evaluators for scoring and improves scalability compared to Williams and Huckle's (2004)[1] methods.
  Our results demonstrate that this framework significantly outperforms traditional multiple-choice evaluations while maintaining high accuracy standards. Additionally, we introduce an automated evaluation process leveraging smaller, locally hosted LLMs. We used LLaMA 3.2B, running on the Ollama binaries to streamline our assessments. This work establishes a new paradigm for evaluating LLM performance, emphasizing factual accuracy and reasoning ability, and provides a robust methodological foundation for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Malin, Tatiana Kalganova, Nikoloas Boulgouris</p>
<p>Abstract: This review examines the means with which faithfulness has been evaluated across open-ended summarization, question-answering and machine translation tasks. We find that the use of LLMs as a faithfulness evaluator is commonly the metric that is most highly correlated with human judgement. The means with which other studies have mitigated hallucinations is discussed, with both retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and prompting framework approaches having been linked with superior faithfulness, whilst other recommendations for mitigation are provided. Research into faithfulness is integral to the continued widespread use of LLMs, as unfaithful responses can pose major risks to many areas whereby LLMs would otherwise be suitable. Furthermore, evaluating open-ended generation provides a more comprehensive measure of LLM performance than commonly used multiple-choice benchmarking, which can help in advancing the trust that can be placed within LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijia Xu, Nebojsa Jojic, Sudha Rao, Chris Brockett, Bill Dolan</p>
<p>Abstract: With rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), there has been an increasing application of LLMs in creative content ideation and generation. A critical question emerges: can current LLMs provide ideas that are diverse enough to truly bolster the collective creativity? We examine two state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and LLaMA-3, on story generation and discover that LLM-generated stories often consist of plot elements that are echoed across a number of generations. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Sui Generis score, which estimates how unlikely a plot element is to appear in alternative storylines generated by the same LLM. Evaluating on 100 short stories, we find that LLM-generated stories often contain combinations of idiosyncratic plot elements echoed frequently across generations, while the original human-written stories are rarely recreated or even echoed in pieces. Moreover, our human evaluation shows that the ranking of Sui Generis scores among story segments correlates moderately with human judgment of surprise level, even though score computation is completely automatic without relying on human judgment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Helia Hashemi, Jason Eisner, Corby Rosset, Benjamin Van Durme, Chris Kedzie</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for the automated evaluation of natural language texts. A manually constructed rubric describes how to assess multiple dimensions of interest. To evaluate a text, a large language model (LLM) is prompted with each rubric question and produces a distribution over potential responses. The LLM predictions often fail to agree well with human judges -- indeed, the humans do not fully agree with one another. However, the multiple LLM distributions can be $\textit{combined}$ to $\textit{predict}$ each human judge's annotations on all questions, including a summary question that assesses overall quality or relevance. LLM-Rubric accomplishes this by training a small feed-forward neural network that includes both judge-specific and judge-independent parameters. When evaluating dialogue systems in a human-AI information-seeking task, we find that LLM-Rubric with 9 questions (assessing dimensions such as naturalness, conciseness, and citation quality) predicts human judges' assessment of overall user satisfaction, on a scale of 1--4, with RMS error $< 0.5$, a $2\times$ improvement over the uncalibrated baseline.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models have enhanced AI systems' capabilities in autonomous tool usage and reasoning. However, their ability in location or map-based reasoning - which improves daily life by optimizing navigation, facilitating resource discovery, and streamlining logistics - has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we introduce MapEval, a benchmark designed to assess diverse and complex map-based user queries with geo-spatial reasoning. MapEval features three task types (textual, API-based, and visual) that require collecting world information via map tools, processing heterogeneous geo-spatial contexts (e.g., named entities, travel distances, user reviews or ratings, images), and compositional reasoning, which all state-of-the-art foundation models find challenging. Comprising 700 unique multiple-choice questions about locations across 180 cities and 54 countries, MapEval evaluates foundation models' ability to handle spatial relationships, map infographics, travel planning, and navigation challenges. Using MapEval, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 28 prominent foundation models. While no single model excelled across all tasks, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o, and Gemini-1.5-Pro achieved competitive performance overall. However, substantial performance gaps emerged, particularly in MapEval, where agents with Claude-3.5-Sonnet outperformed GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro by 16% and 21%, respectively, and the gaps became even more amplified when compared to open-source LLMs. Our detailed analyses provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current models, though all models still fall short of human performance by more than 20% on average, struggling with complex map images and rigorous geo-spatial reasoning. This gap highlights MapEval's critical role in advancing general-purpose foundation models with stronger geo-spatial understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has brought significant improvements to a wide range of tasks in real-world applications. However, LLMs still exhibit certain limitations in extracting implicit semantic information. In this paper, we apply MLLMs to the Multi-modal Entity Set Expansion (MESE) task, which aims to expand a handful of seed entities with new entities belonging to the same semantic class, and multi-modal information is provided with each entity. We explore the capabilities of MLLMs to understand implicit semantic information at the entity-level granularity through the MESE task, introducing a listwise ranking method LUSAR that maps local scores to global rankings. Our LUSAR demonstrates significant improvements in MLLM's performance on the MESE task, marking the first use of generative MLLM for ESE tasks and extending the applicability of listwise ranking.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming essential tools for various natural language processing tasks but often suffer from generating outdated or incorrect information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by incorporating external, real-time information retrieval to ground LLM responses. However, the existing RAG systems frequently struggle with the quality of retrieval documents, as irrelevant or noisy documents degrade performance, increase computational overhead, and undermine response reliability. To tackle this problem, we propose Multi-Agent Filtering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MAIN-RAG), a training-free RAG framework that leverages multiple LLM agents to collaboratively filter and score retrieved documents. Specifically, MAIN-RAG introduces an adaptive filtering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the relevance filtering threshold based on score distributions, effectively minimizing noise while maintaining high recall of relevant documents. The proposed approach leverages inter-agent consensus to ensure robust document selection without requiring additional training data or fine-tuning. Experimental results across four QA benchmarks demonstrate that MAIN-RAG consistently outperforms traditional RAG approaches, achieving a 2-11% improvement in answer accuracy while reducing the number of irrelevant retrieved documents. Quantitative analysis further reveals that our approach achieves superior response consistency and answer accuracy over baseline methods, offering a competitive and practical alternative to training-based solutions.</p>

Recently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMS) have been employed to improve the performance. However, current approaches ignore that correction difficulty varies across different instances and treat these samples equally, enhancing the challenge of model learning. To address this problem, we propose a multi-granularity Curriculum Learning (CL) framework. Specifically, we first calculate the correction difficulty of these samples and feed them into the model from easy to hard batch by batch. Then Instance-Level CL is employed to help the model optimize in the appropriate direction automatically by regulating the loss function. Extensive experimental results and comprehensive analyses of various datasets prove the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Layer removal has emerged as a promising approach for compressing large language models (LLMs) by leveraging redundancy within layers to reduce model size and accelerate inference. However, this technique often compromises internal consistency, leading to performance degradation and instability, with varying impacts across different model architectures. In this work, we propose Taco-SVD, a task-aware framework that retains task-critical singular value directions, preserving internal consistency while enabling efficient compression. Unlike direct layer removal, Taco-SVD preserves task-critical transformations to mitigate performance degradation. By leveraging gradient-based attribution methods, Taco-SVD aligns singular values with downstream task objectives. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Taco-SVD outperforms existing methods in perplexity and task performance across different architectures while ensuring minimal computational overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. However, current RAG methods face two limitations: (1) they only cover limited RAG scenarios. (2) They suffer from limited task diversity due to the lack of a general RAG dataset. To address these limitations, we propose RAG-Instruct, a general method for synthesizing diverse and high-quality RAG instruction data based on any source corpus. Our approach leverages (1) five RAG paradigms, which encompass diverse query-document relationships, and (2) instruction simulation, which enhances instruction diversity and quality by utilizing the strengths of existing instruction datasets. Using this method, we construct a 40K instruction dataset from Wikipedia, comprehensively covering diverse RAG scenarios and tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RAG-Instruct effectively enhances LLMs' RAG capabilities, achieving strong zero-shot performance and significantly outperforming various RAG baselines across a diverse set of tasks.

<p>Abstract: We explore local vs. global evolution of knowledge systems through the framework of socio-epistemic networks (SEN), applying two complementary methods to a corpus of scientific texts. The framework comprises three interconnected layers-social, semiotic (material), and semantic-proposing a multilayered approach to understanding structural developments of knowledge. To analyse diachronic changes on the semantic layer, we first use information-theoretic measures based on relative entropy to detect semantic shifts, assess their significance, and identify key driving features. Second, variations in document embedding densities reveal changes in semantic neighbourhoods, tracking how concentration of similar documents increase, remain stable, or disperse. This enables us to trace document trajectories based on content (topics) or metadata (authorship, institution). Case studies of Joseph Silk and Hans-J\"urgen Treder illustrate how individual scholar's work aligns with broader disciplinary shifts in general relativity and gravitation research, demonstrating the applications, limitations, and further potential of this approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Or Haim Anidjar, Revital Marbel, Roi Yozevitch</p>
<p>Abstract: Approaching Speech-to-Text and Automatic Speech Recognition problems in low-resource languages is notoriously challenging due to the scarcity of validated datasets and the diversity of dialects. Arabic, Russian, and Portuguese exemplify these difficulties, being low-resource languages due to the many dialects of these languages across different continents worldwide. Moreover, the variety of accents and pronunciations of such languages complicate ASR models' success. With the increasing popularity of Deep Learning and Transformers, acoustic models like the renowned Wav2Vec2 have achieved superior performance in the Speech Recognition field compared to state-of-the-art approaches. However, despite Wav2Vec2's improved efficiency over traditional methods, its performance significantly declines for under-represented languages, even though it requires significantly less labeled data. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework that enhances ASR systems fine-tuned on Wav2Vec2 through data augmentation techniques. To validate our framework's effectiveness, we conducted a detailed experimental evaluation using three datasets from Mozilla's Common Voice project in Arabic, Russian, and Portuguese. Additionally, the framework presented in this paper demonstrates robustness to different diacritics. Ultimately, our approach outperforms two previous baseline models, which are the pre-trained Wav2Vec2 and the well-known Whisper ASR model, resulting in an average relative improvement of 33.9\% in Word Error Rate and a 53.2\% relative improvement in Character Error Rate.</p>

<p>Abstract: Agents have demonstrated their potential in scientific reasoning tasks through large language models. However, they often face challenges such as insufficient accuracy and degeneration of thought when handling complex reasoning tasks, which impede their performance. To overcome these issues, we propose the Reactive and Reflection agents with Multi-Path Reasoning (RR-MP) Framework, aimed at enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our approach improves scientific reasoning accuracy by employing a multi-path reasoning mechanism where each path consists of a reactive agent and a reflection agent that collaborate to prevent degeneration of thought inherent in single-agent reliance. Additionally, the RR-MP framework does not require additional training; it utilizes multiple dialogue instances for each reasoning path and a separate summarizer to consolidate insights from all paths. This design integrates diverse perspectives and strengthens reasoning across each path. We conducted zero-shot and few-shot evaluations on tasks involving moral scenarios, college-level physics, and mathematics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness and advantages of the RR-MP framework in managing complex scientific reasoning tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper sets out the first web-based transcription system for the Irish language - Fotheidil, a system that utilises speech-related AI technologies as part of the ABAIR initiative. The system includes both off-the-shelf pre-trained voice activity detection and speaker diarisation models and models trained specifically for Irish automatic speech recognition and capitalisation and punctuation restoration. Semi-supervised learning is explored to improve the acoustic model of a modular TDNN-HMM ASR system, yielding substantial improvements for out-of-domain test sets and dialects that are underrepresented in the supervised training set. A novel approach to capitalisation and punctuation restoration involving sequence-to-sequence models is compared with the conventional approach using a classification model. Experimental results show here also substantial improvements in performance. The system will be made freely available for public use, and represents an important resource to researchers and others who transcribe Irish language materials. Human-corrected transcriptions will be collected and included in the training dataset as the system is used, which should lead to incremental improvements to the ASR model in a cyclical, community-driven fashion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Yang, Volodymyr Kindratenko, ChengXiang Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Training language models (LMs) and their application agents is increasingly costly due to large datasets and models, making test failures difficult to bear. Simplified language environments serve as primordial training and testing grounds, retaining essential commonsense and communication skills but in a more digestible form, potentially enhancing the learning efficiency of LMs, and thus reducing the required model size and data volume for effective training and evaluation. In these simplified language environments, workable strategies for small models, datasets, and agents may be adaptable to larger models, datasets, and agents in complex language environments.
  To create such environments, we focus on two aspects: i) minimizing language dataset noise and complexity, and ii) preserving the essential text distribution characteristics. Unlike previous methods, we propose a pipeline to refine text data by eliminating noise, minimizing vocabulary, and maintaining genre-specific patterns (e.g., for books, conversation, code, etc.). Implementing this pipeline with large LMs, we have created a leaner suite of LM training and evaluation datasets: 71M Leaner-Pretrain, 7M Leaner-Instruct, Leaner-Glue for assessing linguistic proficiency, and Leaner-Eval for testing instruction-following ability.
  Our experiments show that leaner pre-training boosts LM learning efficiency. Tiny LMs trained on these datasets outperform those trained on original datasets in instruction-following across different language granularity levels. Moreover, the Leaner-Pretrain dataset's alignment with conventional large LM training sets enables resource-optimized analysis of how learning objectives, model architectures, and training techniques impact performance on language modeling and downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yomal De Mel, Kasun Wickramasinghe, Nisansa de Silva, Surangika Ranathunga</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to reasons of convenience and lack of tech literacy, transliteration (i.e., Romanizing native scripts instead of using localization tools) is eminently prevalent in the context of low-resource languages such as Sinhala, which have their own writing script. In this study, our focus is on Romanized Sinhala transliteration. We propose two methods to address this problem: Our baseline is a rule-based method, which is then compared against our second method where we approach the transliteration problem as a sequence-to-sequence task akin to the established Neural Machine Translation (NMT) task. For the latter, we propose a Transformer-based Encode-Decoder solution. We witnessed that the Transformer-based method could grab many ad-hoc patterns within the Romanized scripts compared to the rule-based method. The code base associated with this paper is available on GitHub - https://github.com/kasunw22/Sinhala-Transliterator/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayoub Ben Chaliah, Hela Dellagi</p>
<p>Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a major challenge when adapting large language models (LLMs) to new tasks or domains. Conventional fine-tuning often overwrites existing knowledge, causing performance degradation on original tasks. We introduce Superposition in Transformers, a novel architecture that leverages autoencoders to superimpose the hidden representations of a base model and a fine-tuned model within a shared parameter space. By using B-spline-based blending coefficients and autoencoders that adaptively reconstruct hidden states based on the input data distribution, our method effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables a new paradigm of "in-model" superposition. This approach preserves original model capabilities while allowing compact domain-specific expertise to be added, and it supports dynamic switching between model states during inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, not only in generating human-like text, but also in acquiring knowledge. This highlights the need to go beyond the typical Natural Language Processing downstream benchmarks and asses the various aspects of LLMs including knowledge and reasoning. Numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate LLMs knowledge, but they predominantly focus on the English language. Given that many LLMs are multilingual, relying solely on benchmarking English knowledge is insufficient. To address this issue, we introduce AraSTEM, a new Arabic multiple-choice question dataset aimed at evaluating LLMs knowledge in STEM subjects. The dataset spans a range of topics at different levels which requires models to demonstrate a deep understanding of scientific Arabic in order to achieve high accuracy. Our findings show that publicly available models of varying sizes struggle with this dataset, and underscores the need for more localized language models. The dataset is freely accessible on Hugging Face.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingqi Gao, Yixin Liu, Xinyu Hu, Xiaojun Wan, Jonathan Bragg, Arman Cohan</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating and ranking the capabilities of different LLMs is crucial for understanding their performance and alignment with human preferences. Due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of human evaluations, an automatic LLM bencher (i.e., an automatic evaluation framework that aims to rank LLMs based on their alignment with human preferences) is indispensable. An automatic LLM bencher consists of four components: the input set (e.g., a user instruction), the evaluation model (e.g., an LLM), the evaluation type (e.g., pairwise comparison), and the aggregation method (e.g., the ELO rating system). However, previous work has not thoroughly explored how to select these components or how their different combinations influence the results. In this work, through controlled experiments, we provide a series of recommendations on how to choose each component to better automate the evaluation of LLMs. Furthermore, we discovered that when evaluating LLMs with similar performance, the performance of the automatic LLM bencher declines sharply, underscoring the limitations of current benchers and calling for future work. Lastly, we found that the evaluation models' performance at the instance level (e.g., the accuracy of selecting the best output) does not always align with their effectiveness when used as a component of a bencher, highlighting the importance of dedicated system-level evaluation of benchers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models offer new opportunities to devise automated implementation generation methods that can tackle problem solving activities beyond traditional methods, which require algorithmic specifications and can use only static domain knowledge, like performance metrics and libraries of basic building blocks. Large Language Models could support creating new methods to support problem solving activities for open-ended problems, like problem framing, exploring possible solving approaches, feature elaboration and combination, more advanced implementation assessment, and handling unexpected situations. This report summarized the current work on Large Language Models, including model prompting, Reinforcement Learning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengcheng Mai, Yuxiang Wang, Ziyu Gong, Hanxiang Wang, Yihua Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Document-level relation extraction (Doc-RE) aims to extract relations between entities across multiple sentences. Therefore, Doc-RE requires more comprehensive reasoning abilities like humans, involving complex cross-sentence interactions between entities, contexts, and external general knowledge, compared to the sentence-level RE. However, most existing Doc-RE methods focus on optimizing single reasoning ability, but lack the ability to utilize external knowledge for comprehensive reasoning on long documents. To solve these problems, a knowledge retrieval augmented method, named KnowRA, was proposed with comprehensive reasoning to autonomously determine whether to accept external knowledge to assist DocRE. Firstly, we constructed a document graph for semantic encoding and integrated the co-reference resolution model into KnowRA to augment the co-reference reasoning ability. Then, we further expanded the document graph into a document knowledge graph by retrieving the external knowledge base and introduced the axis attention mechanism into KnowRA to improve its common-sense and logical reasoning abilities, respectively. Finally, a knowledge filtering method was presented in the common-sense and co-reference reasoning module to filter out irrelevant knowledge. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets verified the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KnowRA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yipeng Kang, Junqi Wang, Yexin Li, Fangwei Zhong, Xue Feng, Mengmeng Wang, Wenming Tu, Quansen Wang, Hengli Li, Zilong Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into critical applications, aligning their behavior with human values presents significant challenges. Current methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often focus on a limited set of values and can be resource-intensive. Furthermore, the correlation between values has been largely overlooked and remains underutilized. Our framework addresses this limitation by mining a causal graph that elucidates the implicit relationships among various values within the LLMs. Leveraging the causal graph, we implement two lightweight mechanisms for value steering: prompt template steering and Sparse Autoencoder feature steering, and analyze the effects of altering one value dimension on others. Extensive experiments conducted on Gemma-2B-IT and Llama3-8B-IT demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our steering methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language models have made remarkable advancements in understanding and generating human language, achieving notable success across a wide array of applications. However, evaluating these models remains a significant challenge, particularly for resource-limited languages such as Turkish. To address this gap, we introduce the Turkish MMLU (TR-MMLU) benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to assess the linguistic and conceptual capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in Turkish. TR-MMLU is constructed from a carefully curated dataset comprising 6200 multiple-choice questions across 62 sections, selected from a pool of 280000 questions spanning 67 disciplines and over 800 topics within the Turkish education system. This benchmark provides a transparent, reproducible, and culturally relevant tool for evaluating model performance. It serves as a standard framework for Turkish NLP research, enabling detailed analyses of LLMs' capabilities in processing Turkish text and fostering the development of more robust and accurate language models. In this study, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on TR-MMLU, providing insights into their strengths and limitations for Turkish-specific tasks. Our findings reveal critical challenges, such as the impact of tokenization and fine-tuning strategies, and highlight areas for improvement in model design. By setting a new standard for evaluating Turkish language models, TR-MMLU aims to inspire future innovations and support the advancement of Turkish NLP research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Gros</p>
<p>Abstract: Within computing research, there are two spellings for an increasingly important term - dialogue and dialog. We analyze thousands of research papers to understand this "dialog(ue) debacle". Among publications in top venues that use "dialog(ue)" in the title or abstract, 72% use "dialogue", 24% use "dialog", and 5% use both in the same title and abstract. This split distribution is more common in Computing than any other academic discipline. We investigate trends over ~20 years of NLP/AI research, not finding clear evidence of a shift over time. Author nationality is weakly correlated with spelling choice, but far from explains the mixed use. Many prolific authors publish papers with both spellings. We use several methods (such as syntactic parses and LM embeddings) to study how dialog(ue) context influences spelling, finding limited influence. Combining these results together, we discuss different theories that might explain the dialog(ue) divergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomasz Rutowski, Amir Harati, Yang Lu, Elizabeth Shriberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models for speech-based depression classification offer promise for health care applications. Despite growing work on depression classification, little is understood about how the length of speech-input impacts model performance. We analyze results for speaker-independent depression classification using a corpus of over 1400 hours of speech from a human-machine health screening application. We examine performance as a function of response input length for two NLP systems that differ in overall performance.
  Results for both systems show that performance depends on natural length, elapsed length, and ordering of the response within a session. Systems share a minimum length threshold, but differ in a response saturation threshold, with the latter higher for the better system. At saturation it is better to pose a new question to the speaker, than to continue the current response. These and additional reported results suggest how applications can be better designed to both elicit and process optimal input lengths for depression classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomek Rutowski, Amir Harati, Elizabeth Shriberg, Yang Lu, Piotr Chlebek, Ricardo Oliveira</p>
<p>Abstract: Mental health risk prediction is a growing field in the speech community, but many studies are based on small corpora. This study illustrates how variations in test and train set sizes impact performance in a controlled study. Using a corpus of over 65K labeled data points, results from a fully crossed design of different train/test size combinations are provided. Two model types are included: one based on language and the other on speech acoustics. Both use methods current in this domain. An age-mismatched test set was also included. Results show that (1) test sizes below 1K samples gave noisy results, even for larger training set sizes; (2) training set sizes of at least 2K were needed for stable results; (3) NLP and acoustic models behaved similarly with train/test size variations, and (4) the mismatched test set showed the same patterns as the matched test set. Additional factors are discussed, including label priors, model strength and pre-training, unique speakers, and data lengths. While no single study can specify exact size requirements, results demonstrate the need for appropriately sized train and test sets for future studies of mental health risk prediction from speech and language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel B. Hier, Michael D. Carrithers, Thanh Son Do, Tayo Obafemi-Ajayi</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinician notes are a rich source of patient information but often contain inconsistencies due to varied writing styles, colloquialisms, abbreviations, medical jargon, grammatical errors, and non-standard formatting. These inconsistencies hinder the extraction of meaningful data from electronic health records (EHRs), posing challenges for quality improvement, population health, precision medicine, decision support, and research.
  We present a large language model approach to standardizing a corpus of 1,618 clinical notes. Standardization corrected an average of $4.9 +/- 1.8$ grammatical errors, $3.3 +/- 5.2$ spelling errors, converted $3.1 +/- 3.0$ non-standard terms to standard terminology, and expanded $15.8 +/- 9.1$ abbreviations and acronyms per note. Additionally, notes were re-organized into canonical sections with standardized headings. This process prepared notes for key concept extraction, mapping to medical ontologies, and conversion to interoperable data formats such as FHIR.
  Expert review of randomly sampled notes found no significant data loss after standardization. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that standardization of clinical notes can improve their readability, consistency, and usability, while also facilitating their conversion into interoperable data formats.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present OLMo 2, the next generation of our fully open language models. OLMo 2 includes dense autoregressive models with improved architecture and training recipe, pretraining data mixtures, and instruction tuning recipes. Our modified model architecture and training recipe achieve both better training stability and improved per-token efficiency. Our updated pretraining data mixture introduces a new, specialized data mix called Dolmino Mix 1124, which significantly improves model capabilities across many downstream task benchmarks when introduced via late-stage curriculum training (i.e. specialized data during the annealing phase of pretraining). Finally, we incorporate best practices from T\"ulu 3 to develop OLMo 2-Instruct, focusing on permissive data and extending our final-stage reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Our OLMo 2 base models sit at the Pareto frontier of performance to compute, often matching or outperforming open-weight only models like Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 while using fewer FLOPs and with fully transparent training data, code, and recipe. Our fully open OLMo 2-Instruct models are competitive with or surpassing open-weight only models of comparable size, including Qwen 2.5, Llama 3.1 and Gemma 2. We release all OLMo 2 artifacts openly -- models at 7B and 13B scales, both pretrained and post-trained, including their full training data, training code and recipes, training logs and thousands of intermediate checkpoints. The final instruction model is available on the Ai2 Playground as a free research demo.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionised numerous fields, with LLM-as-a-service (LLMSaaS) having a strong generalisation ability that offers accessible solutions directly without the need for costly training. In contrast to the widely studied prompt engineering for task solving directly (in vivo), this paper explores its potential in in-vitro applications. These involve using LLM to generate labels to help the supervised training of mainstream models by (1) noisy label correction and (2) training data augmentation with LLM-generated labels. In this paper, we evaluate this approach in the emerging field of empathy computing -- automating the prediction of psychological questionnaire outcomes from inputs like text sequences. Specifically, crowdsourced datasets in this domain often suffer from noisy labels that misrepresent underlying empathy. By leveraging LLM-generated labels to train pre-trained language models (PLMs) like RoBERTa, we achieve statistically significant accuracy improvements over baselines, achieving a state-of-the-art Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.648 on NewsEmp benchmarks. In addition, we bring insightful discussions, including current challenges in empathy computing, data biases in training data and evaluation metric selection.

<p>Abstract: Despite the global prevalence of Modern Standard Chinese language, counterspeech (CS) resources for Chinese remain virtually nonexistent. To address this gap in East Asian counterspeech research we introduce the a corpus of Modern Standard Mandarin counterspeech that focuses on combating hate speech in Mainland China. This paper proposes a novel approach of generating CS by using an LLM-as-a-Judge, simulated annealing, LLMs zero-shot CN generation and a round-robin algorithm. This is followed by manual verification for quality and contextual relevance. This paper details the methodology for creating effective counterspeech in Chinese and other non-Eurocentric languages, including unique cultural patterns of which groups are maligned and linguistic patterns in what kinds of discourse markers are programmatically marked as hate speech (HS). Analysis of the generated corpora, we provide strong evidence for the lack of open-source, properly labeled Chinese hate speech data and the limitations of using an LLM-as-Judge to score possible answers in Chinese. Moreover, the present corpus serves as the first East Asian language based CS corpus and provides an essential resource for future research on counterspeech generation and evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Zhu, Peihao Wang, Ruisi Cai, Jason D. Lee, Pan Li, Zhangyang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers rely on both content-based and position-based addressing mechanisms to make predictions, but existing positional encoding techniques often diminish the effectiveness of position-based addressing. Many current methods enforce rigid patterns in attention maps, limiting the ability to model long-range dependencies and adapt to diverse tasks. Additionally, most positional encodings are learned as general biases, lacking the specialization required for different instances within a dataset. To address this, we propose con$\textbf{T}$extualized equivari$\textbf{A}$nt $\textbf{P}$osition $\textbf{E}$mbedding ($\textbf{TAPE}$), a novel framework that enhances positional embeddings by incorporating sequence content across layers. TAPE introduces dynamic, context-aware positional encodings, overcoming the constraints of traditional fixed patterns. By enforcing permutation and orthogonal equivariance, TAPE ensures the stability of positional encodings during updates, improving robustness and adaptability. Our method can be easily integrated into pre-trained transformers, offering parameter-efficient fine-tuning with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments shows that TAPE achieves superior performance in language modeling, arithmetic reasoning, and long-context retrieval tasks compared to existing positional embedding techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a context-aware model for robust counterspeech generation, which achieved significant success in the MCG-COLING-2025 shared task. Our approach particularly excelled in low-resource language settings. By leveraging a simulated annealing algorithm fine-tuned on multilingual datasets, the model generates factually accurate responses to hate speech.
  We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across four languages (Basque, English, Italian, and Spanish), with our system ranking first for Basque, second for Italian, and third for both English and Spanish. Notably, our model swept all three top positions for Basque, highlighting its effectiveness in low-resource scenarios.
  Evaluation of the shared task employs both traditional metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, Novelty) and JudgeLM based on LLM. We present a detailed analysis of our results, including an empirical evaluation of the model performance and comprehensive score distributions across evaluation metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhexiong Liu, Diane Litman, Elaine Wang, Tianwen Li, Mason Gobat, Lindsay Clare Matsumura, Richard Correnti</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to revise essays in response to feedback is important for students' writing success. An automated writing evaluation (AWE) system that supports students in revising their essays is thus essential. We present eRevise+RF, an enhanced AWE system for assessing student essay revisions (e.g., changes made to an essay to improve its quality in response to essay feedback) and providing revision feedback. We deployed the system with 6 teachers and 406 students across 3 schools in Pennsylvania and Louisiana. The results confirmed its effectiveness in (1) assessing student essays in terms of evidence usage, (2) extracting evidence and reasoning revisions across essays, and (3) determining revision success in responding to feedback. The evaluation also suggested eRevise+RF is a helpful system for young students to improve their argumentative writing skills through revision and formative feedback.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mayur Shirke, Amey Shembade, Madhushri Wagh, Pavan Thorat, Raviraj Joshi</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the effectiveness of layer pruning for developing more efficient BERT models tailored to specific downstream tasks in low-resource languages. Our primary objective is to evaluate whether pruned BERT models can maintain high performance while reducing model size and complexity. We experiment with several BERT variants, including MahaBERT-v2 and Google-Muril, applying different pruning strategies and comparing their performance to smaller, scratch-trained models like MahaBERT-Small and MahaBERT-Smaller. We fine-tune these models on Marathi datasets, specifically Short Headlines Classification (SHC), Long Paragraph Classification (LPC) and Long Document Classification (LDC), to assess their classification accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that pruned models, despite having fewer layers, achieve comparable performance to their fully-layered counterparts while consistently outperforming scratch-trained models of similar size. Notably, pruning layers from the middle of the model proves to be the most effective strategy, offering performance competitive with pruning from the top and bottom. However, there is no clear winner, as different pruning strategies perform better in different model and dataset combinations. Additionally, monolingual BERT models outperform multilingual ones in these experiments. This approach, which reduces computational demands, provides a faster and more efficient alternative to training smaller models from scratch, making advanced NLP models more accessible for low-resource languages without compromising classification accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiyang Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing integration of Large Language Model (LLM) based search engines has transformed the landscape of information retrieval. However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially ranking manipulation attacks, where attackers craft webpage content to manipulate the LLM's ranking and promote specific content, gaining an unfair advantage over competitors. In this paper, we study the dynamics of ranking manipulation attacks. We frame this problem as an Infinitely Repeated Prisoners' Dilemma, where multiple players strategically decide whether to cooperate or attack. We analyze the conditions under which cooperation can be sustained, identifying key factors such as attack costs, discount rates, attack success rates, and trigger strategies that influence player behavior. We identify tipping points in the system dynamics, demonstrating that cooperation is more likely to be sustained when players are forward-looking. However, from a defense perspective, we find that simply reducing attack success probabilities can, paradoxically, incentivize attacks under certain conditions. Furthermore, defensive measures to cap the upper bound of attack success rates may prove futile in some scenarios. These insights highlight the complexity of securing LLM-based systems. Our work provides a theoretical foundation and practical insights for understanding and mitigating their vulnerabilities, while emphasizing the importance of adaptive security strategies and thoughtful ecosystem design.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the effectiveness of Iterative Self-Improvement (ISI) techniques. However, continuous training on self-generated data leads to reduced output diversity, a limitation particularly critical in reasoning tasks where diverse solution paths are essential. We present DIVE (Diversified Iterative Self-Improvement), a novel framework that addresses this challenge through two key components: Sample Pool Expansion for broader solution exploration, and Data Selection for balancing diversity and quality in preference pairs. Experiments on MATH and GSM8k datasets show that DIVE achieves a 10% to 45% relative increase in output diversity metrics while maintaining performance quality compared to vanilla ISI. Our ablation studies confirm both components' significance in achieving these improvements. Code is available at https://github.com/qinyiwei/DIVE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianshi Zheng, Jiazheng Wang, Zihao Wang, Jiaxin Bai, Hang Yin, Zheye Deng, Yangqiu Song, Jianxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers, as a fundamental deep learning architecture, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning. This paper investigates the generalizable first-order logical reasoning ability of transformers with their parameterized knowledge and explores ways to improve it. The first-order reasoning capability of transformers is assessed through their ability to perform first-order logical entailment, which is quantitatively measured by their performance in answering knowledge graph queries. We establish connections between (1) two types of distribution shifts studied in out-of-distribution generalization and (2) the unseen knowledge and query settings discussed in the task of knowledge graph query answering, enabling a characterization of fine-grained generalizability. Results on our comprehensive dataset show that transformers outperform previous methods specifically designed for this task and provide detailed empirical evidence on the impact of input query syntax, token embedding, and transformer architectures on the reasoning capability of transformers. Interestingly, our findings reveal a mismatch between positional encoding and other design choices in transformer architectures employed in prior practices. This discovery motivates us to propose a more sophisticated, logic-aware architecture, TEGA, to enhance the capability for generalizable first-order logical entailment in transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianli Wang, Nils Feldhus, Simon Ostermann, Luis Felipe Villa-Arenas, Sebastian M\"oller, Vera Schmitt</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual examples are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) as valuable data to improve models, and in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to understand model behavior. The automated generation of counterfactual examples remains a challenging task even for large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance on many tasks. In this paper, we first introduce ZeroCF, a faithful approach for leveraging important words derived from feature attribution methods to generate counterfactual examples in a zero-shot setting. Second, we present a new framework, FitCF, which further verifies aforementioned counterfactuals by label flip verification and then inserts them as demonstrations for few-shot prompting, outperforming two state-of-the-art baselines. Through ablation studies, we identify the importance of each of FitCF's core components in improving the quality of counterfactuals, as assessed through flip rate, perplexity, and similarity measures. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of LIME and Integrated Gradients as backbone attribution methods for FitCF and find that the number of demonstrations has the largest effect on performance. Finally, we reveal a strong correlation between the faithfulness of feature attribution scores and the quality of generated counterfactuals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Zhang, Yulong Li, Zichen Yu, Feilong Tang, Zhixiang Lu, Chong Li, Kang Dang, Jionglong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-sequence causal reasoning seeks to uncover causal relationships within extended time series data but is hindered by complex dependencies and the challenges of validating causal links. To address the limitations of large-scale language models (e.g., GPT-4) in capturing intricate emotional causality within extended dialogues, we propose CauseMotion, a long-sequence emotional causal reasoning framework grounded in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and multimodal fusion. Unlike conventional methods relying only on textual information, CauseMotion enriches semantic representations by incorporating audio-derived features-vocal emotion, emotional intensity, and speech rate-into textual modalities. By integrating RAG with a sliding window mechanism, it effectively retrieves and leverages contextually relevant dialogue segments, thus enabling the inference of complex emotional causal chains spanning multiple conversational turns. To evaluate its effectiveness, we constructed the first benchmark dataset dedicated to long-sequence emotional causal reasoning, featuring dialogues with over 70 turns. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RAG-based multimodal integrated approach, the efficacy of substantially enhances both the depth of emotional understanding and the causal inference capabilities of large-scale language models. A GLM-4 integrated with CauseMotion achieves an 8.7% improvement in causal accuracy over the original model and surpasses GPT-4o by 1.2%. Additionally, on the publicly available DiaASQ dataset, CauseMotion-GLM-4 achieves state-of-the-art results in accuracy, F1 score, and causal reasoning accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyao Tang, Lishuang Li, Liteng Mi, Haiming Wu, Hongbin Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot event-relational reasoning is an important task in natural language processing, and existing methods jointly learn a variety of event-relational prefixes and inference-form prefixes to achieve such tasks. However, training prefixes consumes large computational resources and lacks interpretability. Additionally, learning various relational and inferential knowledge inefficiently exploits the connections between tasks. Therefore, we first propose a method for Reasoning-Oriented Locating and Editing (ROLE), which locates and edits the key modules of the language model for reasoning about event relations, enhancing interpretability and also resource-efficiently optimizing the reasoning ability. Subsequently, we propose a method for Analogy-Based Locating and Editing (ABLE), which efficiently exploits the similarities and differences between tasks to optimize the zero-shot reasoning capability. Experimental results show that ROLE improves interpretability and reasoning performance with reduced computational cost. ABLE achieves SOTA results in zero-shot reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in various intelligent tasks but still struggle with complex action reasoning tasks that require systematic search. To address this limitation, we propose a method that bridges the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs with the symbolic reasoning strengths of action languages. Our approach, termed "LLM+AL," leverages the LLM's strengths in semantic parsing and commonsense knowledge generation alongside the action language's proficiency in automated reasoning based on encoded knowledge. We compare LLM+AL against state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT-4, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini Ultra 1.0, and o1-preview, using benchmarks for complex reasoning about actions. Our findings indicate that, although all methods exhibit errors, LLM+AL, with relatively minimal human corrections, consistently leads to correct answers, whereas standalone LLMs fail to improve even with human feedback. LLM+AL also contributes to automated generation of action languages.</p>

However, this assumption oversimplifies the real document-topic distribution, limiting the model's performance. In response, we propose a novel method that introduces the diffusion process into the sampling process of document-topic distribution to overcome this limitation and maintain an easy optimization process. We validate our method through extensive experiments on two mainstream datasets, proving its effectiveness in improving topic modeling performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper aims to document an effective way to improve multimodal co-learning by using aggressive modality dropout. We find that by using aggressive modality dropout we are able to reverse negative co-learning (NCL) to positive co-learning (PCL). Aggressive modality dropout can be used to "prep" a multimodal model for unimodal deployment, and dramatically increases model performance during negative co-learning, where during some experiments we saw a 20% gain in accuracy. We also benchmark our modality dropout technique against PCL to show that our modality drop out technique improves co-learning during PCL, although it does not have as much as an substantial effect as it does during NCL.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shoutao Guo, Shaolei Zhang, Zhengrui Ma, Yang Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Simultaneous generation models write generation results while reading streaming inputs, necessitating a policy-maker to determine the appropriate output timing. Existing simultaneous generation methods generally adopt the traditional encoder-decoder architecture and learn the generation and policy-making capabilities through complex dynamic programming techniques. Although LLMs excel at text generation, they face challenges in taking on the role of policy-makers through traditional training methods, limiting their exploration in simultaneous generation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM-driven Simultaneous Generation (LSG) framework, which allows the off-the-shelf LLM to decide the generation timing and produce output concurrently. Specifically, LSG selects the generation policy that minimizes latency as the baseline policy. Referring to the baseline policy, LSG enables the LLM to devise an improved generation policy that better balances latency and generation quality, and writes generation results accordingly. Experiments on simultaneous translation and streaming automatic speech recognition tasks show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance utilizing the open-source LLMs and demonstrate practicality in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) based embedding models have established new state-of-the-art benchmarks for text embedding tasks, particularly in dense vector-based retrieval. However, these models predominantly focus on English, leaving multilingual embedding capabilities largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we present LUSIFER, a novel zero-shot approach that adapts LLM-based embedding models for multilingual tasks without requiring multilingual supervision. LUSIFER's architecture combines a multilingual encoder, serving as a language-universal learner, with an LLM-based embedding model optimized for embedding-specific tasks. These components are seamlessly integrated through a minimal set of trainable parameters that act as a connector, effectively transferring the multilingual encoder's language understanding capabilities to the specialized embedding model. Additionally, to comprehensively evaluate multilingual embedding performance, we introduce a new benchmark encompassing 5 primary embedding tasks, 123 diverse datasets, and coverage across 14 languages. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LUSIFER significantly enhances the multilingual performance across various embedding tasks, particularly for medium and low-resource languages, without requiring explicit multilingual training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huichi Zhou, Kin-Hei Lee, Zhonghao Zhan, Yue Chen, Zhenhao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant responses tailored to user queries. However, these systems remain vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks that can significantly degrade LLM performance through the injection of malicious content. To address these challenges, we propose TrustRAG, a robust framework that systematically filters compromised and irrelevant content before it reaches the language model. Our approach implements a two-stage defense mechanism: first, it employs K-means clustering to identify potential attack patterns in retrieved documents based on their semantic embeddings, effectively isolating suspicious content. Second, it leverages cosine similarity and ROUGE metrics to detect malicious documents while resolving discrepancies between the model's internal knowledge and external information through a self-assessment process. TrustRAG functions as a plug-and-play, training-free module that integrates seamlessly with any language model, whether open or closed-source, maintaining high contextual relevance while strengthening defenses against attacks. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that TrustRAG delivers substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy, efficiency, and attack resistance compared to existing approaches across multiple model architectures and datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cameron C. Yetman</p>
<p>Abstract: The extraordinary success of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) on a diverse array of tasks has led to an explosion of scientific and philosophical theorizing aimed at explaining how they do what they do. Unfortunately, disagreement over fundamental theoretical issues has led to stalemate, with entrenched camps of LLM optimists and pessimists often committed to very different views of how these systems work. Overcoming stalemate requires agreement on fundamental questions, and the goal of this paper is to address one such question, namely: is LLM behavior driven partly by representation-based information processing of the sort implicated in biological cognition, or is it driven entirely by processes of memorization and stochastic table look-up? This is a question about what kind of algorithm LLMs implement, and the answer carries serious implications for higher level questions about whether these systems have beliefs, intentions, concepts, knowledge, and understanding. I argue that LLM behavior is partially driven by representation-based information processing, and then I describe and defend a series of practical techniques for investigating these representations and developing explanations on their basis. The resulting account provides a groundwork for future theorizing about language models and their successors.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the fast-changing realm of information, the capacity to construct coherent timelines from extensive event-related content has become increasingly significant and challenging. The complexity arises in aggregating related documents to build a meaningful event graph around a central topic. This paper proposes CHRONOS - Causal Headline Retrieval for Open-domain News Timeline SummarizatiOn via Iterative Self-Questioning, which offers a fresh perspective on the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the task of Timeline Summarization (TLS). By iteratively reflecting on how events are linked and posing new questions regarding a specific news topic to gather information online or from an offline knowledge base, LLMs produce and refresh chronological summaries based on documents retrieved in each round. Furthermore, we curate Open-TLS, a novel dataset of timelines on recent news topics authored by professional journalists to evaluate open-domain TLS where information overload makes it impossible to find comprehensive relevant documents from the web. Our experiments indicate that CHRONOS is not only adept at open-domain timeline summarization, but it also rivals the performance of existing state-of-the-art systems designed for closed-domain applications, where a related news corpus is provided for summarization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efforts towards endowing robots with the ability to speak have benefited from recent advancements in NLP, in particular large language models. However, as powerful as current models have become, they still operate on sentence or multi-sentence level input, not on the word-by-word input that humans operate on, affecting the degree of responsiveness that they offer, which is critical in situations where humans interact with robots using speech. In this paper, we review the literature on interactive systems that operate incrementally (i.e., at the word level or below it). We motivate the need for incremental systems, survey incremental modeling of important aspects of dialogue like speech recognition and language generation. Primary focus is on the part of the system that makes decisions, known as the dialogue manager. We find that there is very little research on incremental dialogue management, offer some requirements for practical incremental dialogue management, and the implications of incremental dialogue for embodied, robotic platforms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Ravenda, Seyed Ali Bahrainian, Andrea Raballo, Antonietta Mira, Noriko Kando</p>
<p>Abstract: In psychological practice, standardized questionnaires serve as essential tools for assessing mental constructs (e.g., attitudes, traits, and emotions) through structured questions (aka items). With the increasing prevalence of social media platforms where users share personal experiences and emotions, researchers are exploring computational methods to leverage this data for rapid mental health screening. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach that completes psychological questionnaires by analyzing social media posts. Our method retrieves the most relevant user posts for each question in a psychological survey and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict questionnaire scores in a zero-shot setting. Our findings are twofold. First we demonstrate that this approach can effectively predict users' responses to psychological questionnaires, such as the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), achieving performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art models on Reddit-based benchmark datasets without relying on training data. Second, we show how this methodology can be generalized as a scalable screening tool, as the final assessment is systematically derived by completing standardized questionnaires and tracking how individual item responses contribute to the diagnosis, aligning with established psychometric practices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks by understanding input information and predicting corresponding outputs. However, the internal mechanisms by which LLMs comprehend input and make effective predictions remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the working mechanism of LLMs in information processing from the perspective of Information Bottleneck Theory. We propose a non-training construction strategy to define a task space and identify the following key findings: (1) LLMs compress input information into specific task spaces (e.g., sentiment space, topic space) to facilitate task understanding; (2) they then extract and utilize relevant information from the task space at critical moments to generate accurate predictions. Based on these insights, we introduce two novel approaches: an Information Compression-based Context Learning (IC-ICL) and a Task-Space-guided Fine-Tuning (TS-FT). IC-ICL enhances reasoning performance and inference efficiency by compressing retrieved example information into the task space. TS-FT employs a space-guided loss to fine-tune LLMs, encouraging the learning of more effective compression and selection mechanisms. Experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of task space construction. Additionally, IC-ICL not only improves performance but also accelerates inference speed by over 40\%, while TS-FT achieves superior results with a minimal strategy adjustment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengze Zhang, Changshan Li, Shiyang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: The exponential growth of data and advancements in big data technologies have created a demand for more efficient and automated approaches to data analysis and storytelling. However, automated data analysis systems still face challenges in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for data insight discovery, augmented analysis, and data storytelling. This paper introduces the Multidimensional Data Storytelling Framework (MDSF) based on large language models for automated insight generation and context-aware storytelling. The framework incorporates advanced preprocessing techniques, augmented analysis algorithms, and a unique scoring mechanism to identify and prioritize actionable insights. The use of fine-tuned LLMs enhances contextual understanding and generates narratives with minimal manual intervention. The architecture also includes an agent-based mechanism for real-time storytelling continuation control. Key findings reveal that MDSF outperforms existing methods across various datasets in terms of insight ranking accuracy, descriptive quality, and narrative coherence. The experimental evaluation demonstrates MDSF's ability to automate complex analytical tasks, reduce interpretive biases, and improve user satisfaction. User studies further underscore its practical utility in enhancing content structure, conclusion extraction, and richness of detail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinshuo Hu, Zifei Shan, Xinping Zhao, Zetian Sun, Zhenyu Liu, Dongfang Li, Shaolin Ye, Xinyuan Wei, Qian Chen, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation prevails in large language models, embedding models are becoming increasingly crucial. Despite the growing number of general embedding models, prior work often overlooks the critical role of training data quality. In this work, we introduce KaLM-Embedding, a general multilingual embedding model that leverages a large quantity of cleaner, more diverse, and domain-specific training data. Our model has been trained with key techniques proven to enhance performance: (1) persona-based synthetic data to create diversified examples distilled from LLMs, (2) ranking consistency filtering to remove less informative samples, and (3) semi-homogeneous task batch sampling to improve training efficacy. Departing from traditional BERT-like architectures, we adopt Qwen2-0.5B as the pre-trained model, facilitating the adaptation of auto-regressive language models for general embedding tasks. Extensive evaluations of the MTEB benchmark across multiple languages show that our model outperforms others of comparable size, setting a new standard for multilingual embedding models with <1B parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reasoning is fundamental to human intelligence, and critical for problem-solving, decision-making, and critical thinking. Reasoning refers to drawing new conclusions based on existing knowledge, which can support various applications like clinical diagnosis, basic education, and financial analysis. Though a good number of surveys have been proposed for reviewing reasoning-related methods, none of them has systematically investigated these methods from the viewpoint of their dependent knowledge base. Both the scenarios to which the knowledge bases are applied and their storage formats are significantly different. Hence, investigating reasoning methods from the knowledge base perspective helps us better understand the challenges and future directions. To fill this gap, this paper first classifies the knowledge base into symbolic and parametric ones. The former explicitly stores information in human-readable symbols, and the latter implicitly encodes knowledge within parameters. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview of reasoning methods using symbolic knowledge bases, parametric knowledge bases, and both of them. Finally, we identify the future direction toward enhancing reasoning capabilities to bridge the gap between human and machine intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonduk Seo, Zonghao Yuan, Yi Bu</p>
<p>Abstract: Cultural values alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical challenge due to their tendency to embed Western-centric biases from training data, leading to misrepresentations and fairness issues in cross-cultural contexts. Recent approaches, such as role-assignment and few-shot learning, often struggle with reliable cultural alignment as they heavily rely on pre-trained knowledge, lack scalability, and fail to capture nuanced cultural values effectively. To address these issues, we propose ValuesRAG, a novel and effective framework that applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with in-context learning to integrate cultural and demographic knowledge dynamically during text generation. Leveraging the World Values Survey (WVS) dataset, ValuesRAG first generates summaries of values for each individual. Subsequently, we curated several representative regional datasets to serve as test datasets and retrieve relevant summaries of values based on demographic features, followed by a reranking step to select the top-k relevant summaries. ValuesRAG consistently outperforms baseline methods, both in the main experiment and in the ablation study where only the values summary was provided, highlighting ValuesRAG's potential to foster culturally aligned AI systems and enhance the inclusivity of AI-driven applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Wang, Xunlong Zou, Shuo Sun, Wenyu Zhang, Yingxu He, Zhuohan Liu, Chengwei Wei, Nancy F. Chen, AiTi Aw</p>
<p>Abstract: Singlish, a Creole language rooted in English, is a key focus in linguistic research within multilingual and multicultural contexts. However, its spoken form remains underexplored, limiting insights into its linguistic structure and applications. To address this gap, we standardize and annotate the largest spoken Singlish corpus, introducing the Multitask National Speech Corpus (MNSC). These datasets support diverse tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Spoken Question Answering (SQA), Spoken Dialogue Summarization (SDS), and Paralinguistic Question Answering (PQA). We release standardized splits and a human-verified test set to facilitate further research. Additionally, we propose SingAudioLLM, a multi-task multimodal model leveraging multimodal large language models to handle these tasks concurrently. Experiments reveal our models adaptability to Singlish context, achieving state-of-the-art performance and outperforming prior models by 10-30% in comparison with other AudioLLMs and cascaded solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixing Xu, Shivank Nag, Dong Li, Lu Tian, Emad Barsoum</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based LLMs have achieved exceptional performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, the standard self-attention mechanism suffers from quadratic time complexity and linearly increased cache size. Sliding window attention (SWA) solves this problem by restricting the attention range to a fixed-size local context window. Nevertheless, SWA employs a uniform window size for each head in each layer, making it inefficient in capturing context of varying scales. To mitigate this limitation, we propose Multi-Scale Window Attention (MSWA) which applies diverse window sizes across heads and layers in the Transformer. It not only allows for different window sizes among heads within the same layer but also progressively increases window size allocation from shallow to deep layers, thus enabling the model to capture contextual information with different lengths and distances. Experimental results on language modeling and common-sense reasoning tasks substantiate that MSWA outperforms traditional local attention in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngjun Son, Chaewon Kim, Jaejin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset deduplication plays a crucial role in enhancing data quality, ultimately improving training performance and efficiency of LLMs. A commonly used method for data deduplication is the MinHash LSH algorithm. Recently, NVIDIA introduced a GPU-based MinHash LSH deduplication method, but it remains suboptimal, leaving room for further improvement in processing efficiency. This paper proposes a GPU-accelerated deduplication framework \sys that optimizes MinHash LSH for GPU clusters and leverages computationally efficient and partially reusable non-cryptographic hash functions. \sys significantly outperforms the CPU-based deduplication tool included in SlimPajama by up to 58.3 times and the GPU-based deduplication tool included in NVIDIA NeMo Curator by up to 8.6 times when processing 1 million documents with a node of four GPUs. Deduplication of 1.2 trillion tokens is completed in just 5.1 hours in a four-node, 16-GPU environment. The related code is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/mcrl/FED).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyao Ma, Xiaokang Zhang, Jing Zhang, Jifan Yu, Sijia Luo, Jie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) often struggle to produce accurate responses on the first attempt for complex reasoning tasks like code generation. Prior research tackles this challenge by generating multiple candidate solutions and validating them with LLM-generated unit tests. The execution results of unit tests serve as reward signals to identify correct solutions. As LLMs always confidently make mistakes, these unit tests are not reliable, thereby diminishing the quality of reward signals. Motivated by the observation that scaling the number of solutions improves LLM performance, we explore the impact of scaling unit tests to enhance reward signal quality. Our pioneer experiment reveals a positive correlation between the number of unit tests and reward signal quality, with greater benefits observed in more challenging problems. Based on these insights, we propose CodeRM-8B, a lightweight yet effective unit test generator that enables efficient and high-quality unit test scaling. Additionally, we implement a dynamic scaling mechanism that adapts the number of unit tests based on problem difficulty, further improving efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves performance across various models on three benchmarks (e.g., with gains of 18.43% for Llama3-8B and 3.42% for GPT-4o-mini on HumanEval Plus).</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01056">Risks of Cultural Erasure in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rida Qadri, Aida M. Davani, Kevin Robinson, Vinodkumar Prabhakaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are increasingly being integrated into applications that shape the production and discovery of societal knowledge such as search, online education, and travel planning. As a result, language models will shape how people learn about, perceive and interact with global cultures making it important to consider whose knowledge systems and perspectives are represented in models. Recognizing this importance, increasingly work in Machine Learning and NLP has focused on evaluating gaps in global cultural representational distribution within outputs. However, more work is needed on developing benchmarks for cross-cultural impacts of language models that stem from a nuanced sociologically-aware conceptualization of cultural impact or harm. We join this line of work arguing for the need of metricizable evaluations of language technologies that interrogate and account for historical power inequities and differential impacts of representation on global cultures, particularly for cultures already under-represented in the digital corpora. We look at two concepts of erasure: omission: where cultures are not represented at all and simplification i.e. when cultural complexity is erased by presenting one-dimensional views of a rich culture. The former focuses on whether something is represented, and the latter on how it is represented. We focus our analysis on two task contexts with the potential to influence global cultural production. First, we probe representations that a language model produces about different places around the world when asked to describe these contexts. Second, we analyze the cultures represented in the travel recommendations produced by a set of language model applications. Our study shows ways in which the NLP community and application developers can begin to operationalize complex socio-cultural considerations into standard evaluations and benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanwen Huang, Yong Zhang, Ning Cheng, Zhitao Li, Shaojun Wang, Jing Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from context faithfulness hallucinations, where outputs deviate from retrieved information due to insufficient context utilization and high output uncertainty. Our uncertainty evaluation experiments reveal a strong correlation between high uncertainty and hallucinations. We hypothesize that attention mechanisms encode signals indicative of contextual utilization, validated through probing analysis. Based on these insights, we propose Dynamic Attention-Guided Context Decoding (DAGCD), a lightweight framework that integrates attention distributions and uncertainty signals in a single-pass decoding process. Experiments across QA datasets demonstrate DAGCD's effectiveness, achieving significant improvements in faithfulness and robustness while maintaining computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Osama, Ashim Dey, Kawsar Ahmed, Muhammad Ashad Kabir</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic text summarization, particularly headline generation, remains a critical yet underexplored area for Bengali religious news. Existing approaches to headline generation typically rely solely on the article content, overlooking crucial contextual features such as sentiment, category, and aspect. This limitation significantly hinders their effectiveness and overall performance. This study addresses this limitation by introducing a novel corpus, BeliN (Bengali Religious News) - comprising religious news articles from prominent Bangladeshi online newspapers, and MultiGen - a contextual multi-input feature fusion headline generation approach. Leveraging transformer-based pre-trained language models such as BanglaT5, mBART, mT5, and mT0, MultiGen integrates additional contextual features - including category, aspect, and sentiment - with the news content. This fusion enables the model to capture critical contextual information often overlooked by traditional methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MultiGen over the baseline approach that uses only news content, achieving a BLEU score of 18.61 and ROUGE-L score of 24.19, compared to baseline approach scores of 16.08 and 23.08, respectively. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating contextual features in headline generation for low-resource languages. By bridging linguistic and cultural gaps, this research advances natural language processing for Bengali and other underrepresented languages.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junya Ono, Hiromi Wakaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) has been attracting attention by methods for modeling multi-turn contexts. The multi-turn input to a pretraining model implicitly assumes that the current turn and other turns are distinguished during the training process by inserting special tokens into the input sequence. This paper proposes a priority-based attention method to distinguish each turn explicitly by adding dialogue features into the attention mechanism, called Turn Emphasis with Dialogue (TED). It has a priority for each turn according to turn position and speaker information as dialogue features. It takes multi-head self-attention between turn-based vectors for multi-turn input and adjusts attention scores with the dialogue features. We evaluate TED on four typical benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that TED has high overall performance in all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance on IEMOCAP with numerous turns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonsuk Jang, Thierry Tambe</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but their increasing size poses significant challenges in memory usage and computational costs. Quantizing both weights and activations can address these issues, with fine-grained block-wise quantization emerging as a promising hardware-supported solution to mitigate outliers. However, existing methods struggle to capture nuanced block data distributions. To address this, we propose BlockDialect, a block-wise fine-grained mixed format technique that assigns a per-block optimal number format from formatbook for better data representation. Additionally, we introduce DialectFP4, a formatbook of FP4 variants (akin to dialects) that adapt to diverse data distributions. Importantly, DialectFP4 ensures hardware efficiency by selecting representable values as scaled integers compatible with low-precision integer arithmetic. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage approach for online DialectFP4 activation quantization. BlockDialect achieves 11.40% (6.90%) accuracy gain on the LLaMA3-8B (LLaMA2-7B) model compared to MXFP4 format with a comparable bit usage per data, while being only 5.89% (3.31%) below full precision even when quantizing full-path matrix multiplication. Focusing on how to represent over how to scale, our work presents a promising path for energy-efficient LLM inference.</p>

Some of them use the shortest dependency path(SDP) information to represent the argument classification task. There is an issue with this representation since even missing one word from the dependency parsing graph may totally change the final prediction. To this end, the full adjacency matrix of the dependency graph is used to embed individual tokens using a graph convolutional network(GCN). An ablation study is also done to show the effect of the dependency graph on the overall performance. The results show a significant improvement when dependency graph information is used. The proposed model slightly outperforms state-of-the-art models on BEE over different datasets.</p>

This short paper primarily focuses on intrinsic bias mitigation and measurement strategies for language models, building on prior research that demonstrates a lack of correlation between intrinsic and extrinsic approaches. We delve deeper into intrinsic measurements, identifying inconsistencies and suggesting that these benchmarks may reflect different facets of gender stereotype. Our methodology involves analyzing data distributions across datasets and integrating gender stereotype components informed by social psychology. By adjusting the distribution of two datasets, we achieve a better alignment of outcomes. Our findings underscore the complexity of gender stereotyping in language models and point to new directions for developing more refined techniques to detect and reduce bias.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Brinkmann, Christian Bizer</p>
<p>Abstract: Structured product data, in the form of attribute-value pairs, is essential for e-commerce platforms to support features such as faceted product search and attribute-based product comparison. However, vendors often provide unstructured product descriptions, making attribute value extraction necessary to ensure data consistency and usability. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for product attribute value extraction in few-shot scenarios. Recent research has shown that self-refinement techniques can improve the performance of LLMs on tasks such as code generation and text-to-SQL translation. For other tasks, the application of these techniques has resulted in increased costs due to processing additional tokens, without achieving any improvement in performance. This paper investigates applying two self-refinement techniques, error-based prompt rewriting and self-correction, to the product attribute value extraction task. The self-refinement techniques are evaluated across zero-shot, few-shot in-context learning, and fine-tuning scenarios using GPT-4o. The experiments show that both self-refinement techniques have only a marginal impact on the model's performance across the different scenarios, while significantly increasing processing costs. For scenarios with training data, fine-tuning yields the highest performance, while the ramp-up costs of fine-tuning are balanced out as the amount of product descriptions increases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyuan He, Jianfei Yu, Wenya Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) with rule-based reasoning offers a powerful solution for improving the flexibility and reliability of Knowledge Base Completion (KBC). Traditional rule-based KBC methods offer verifiable reasoning yet lack flexibility, while LLMs provide strong semantic understanding yet suffer from hallucinations. With the aim of combining LLMs' understanding capability with the logical and rigor of rule-based approaches, we propose a novel framework consisting of a Subgraph Extractor, an LLM Proposer, and a Rule Reasoner. The Subgraph Extractor first samples subgraphs from the KB. Then, the LLM uses these subgraphs to propose diverse and meaningful rules that are helpful for inferring missing facts. To effectively avoid hallucination in LLMs' generations, these proposed rules are further refined by a Rule Reasoner to pinpoint the most significant rules in the KB for Knowledge Base Completion. Our approach offers several key benefits: the utilization of LLMs to enhance the richness and diversity of the proposed rules and the integration with rule-based reasoning to improve reliability. Our method also demonstrates strong performance across diverse KB datasets, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of the proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Weber, Moritz Huber, Maximilian Auch, Alexander D\"oschl, Max-Emanuel Keller, Peter Mandl</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, toxic content and hate speech have become widespread phenomena on the internet. Moderators of online newspapers and forums are now required, partly due to legal regulations, to carefully review and, if necessary, delete reader comments. This is a labor-intensive process. Some providers of large language models already offer solutions for automated hate speech detection or the identification of toxic content. These include GPT-4o from OpenAI, Jigsaw's (Google) Perspective API, and OpenAI's Moderation API. Based on the selected German test dataset HOCON34k, which was specifically created for developing tools to detect hate speech in reader comments of online newspapers, these solutions are compared with each other and against the HOCON34k baseline. The test dataset contains 1,592 annotated text samples. For GPT-4o, three different promptings are used, employing a Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Few-Shot approach. The results of the experiments demonstrate that GPT-4o outperforms both the Perspective API and the Moderation API, and exceeds the HOCON34k baseline by approximately 5 percentage points, as measured by a combined metric of MCC and F2-score.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the increasing code reasoning capabilities of existing large language models (LLMs) and breakthroughs in reasoning models like OpenAI o1 and o3, there is a growing need to develop more challenging and comprehensive benchmarks that effectively test their sophisticated competition-level coding abilities. Existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and USACO, fall short due to the unavailability of private test cases, lack of support for special judges, and misaligned execution environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce CodeElo, a standardized competition-level code generation benchmark that effectively addresses all these challenges for the first time. CodeElo benchmark is mainly based on the official CodeForces platform and tries to align with the platform as much as possible. We compile the recent six months of contest problems on CodeForces with detailed information such as contest divisions, problem difficulty ratings, and problem algorithm tags. We introduce a unique judging method in which problems are submitted directly to the platform and develop a reliable Elo rating calculation system that aligns with the platform and is comparable with human participants but has lower variance. By testing on our CodeElo, we provide the Elo ratings of 30 existing popular open-source and 3 proprietary LLMs for the first time. The results show that o1-mini and QwQ-32B-Preview stand out significantly, achieving Elo ratings of 1578 and 1261, respectively, while other models struggle even with the easiest problems, placing in the lowest 20 percent among all human participants. Detailed analysis experiments are also conducted to provide insights into performance across algorithms and comparisons between using C++ and Python, which can suggest directions for future studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoshuai Song, Yanan Wu, Weixun Wang, Jiaheng Liu, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-Correction aims to enable large language models (LLMs) to self-verify and self-refine their initial responses without external feedback. However, LLMs often fail to effectively self-verify and generate correct feedback, further misleading refinement and leading to the failure of self-correction, especially in complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Program-driven Self-Correction (ProgCo). First, program-driven verification (ProgVe) achieves complex verification logic and extensive validation through self-generated, self-executing verification pseudo-programs. Then, program-driven refinement (ProgRe) receives feedback from ProgVe, conducts dual reflection and refinement on both responses and verification programs to mitigate misleading of incorrect feedback in complex reasoning tasks. Experiments on three instruction-following and mathematical benchmarks indicate that ProgCo achieves effective self-correction, and can be further enhance performance when combined with real program tools.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01273">Does a Large Language Model Really Speak in Human-Like Language?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mose Park, Yunjin Choi, Jong-June Jeon</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged, attracting considerable attention due to their ability to generate highly natural, human-like text. This study compares the latent community structures of LLM-generated text and human-written text within a hypothesis testing procedure. Specifically, we analyze three text sets: original human-written texts ($\mathcal{O}$), their LLM-paraphrased versions ($\mathcal{G}$), and a twice-paraphrased set ($\mathcal{S}$) derived from $\mathcal{G}$. Our analysis addresses two key questions: (1) Is the difference in latent community structures between $\mathcal{O}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ the same as that between $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{S}$? (2) Does $\mathcal{G}$ become more similar to $\mathcal{O}$ as the LLM parameter controlling text variability is adjusted? The first question is based on the assumption that if LLM-generated text truly resembles human language, then the gap between the pair ($\mathcal{O}$, $\mathcal{G}$) should be similar to that between the pair ($\mathcal{G}$, $\mathcal{S}$), as both pairs consist of an original text and its paraphrase. The second question examines whether the degree of similarity between LLM-generated and human text varies with changes in the breadth of text generation. To address these questions, we propose a statistical hypothesis testing framework that leverages the fact that each text has corresponding parts across all datasets due to their paraphrasing relationship. This relationship enables the mapping of one dataset's relative position to another, allowing two datasets to be mapped to a third dataset. As a result, both mapped datasets can be quantified with respect to the space characterized by the third dataset, facilitating a direct comparison between them. Our results indicate that GPT-generated text remains distinct from human-authored text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Luo, Junjie Liu, Sirong Wu, Yuhui Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Media bias in news articles arises from the political polarisation of media outlets, which can reinforce societal stereotypes and beliefs. Reporting on the same event often varies significantly between outlets, reflecting their political leanings through polarised language and focus. Although previous studies have attempted to generate bias-free summaries from multiperspective news articles, they have not effectively addressed the challenge of mitigating inherent media bias. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{NeutraSum}, a novel framework that integrates two neutrality losses to adjust the semantic space of generated summaries, thus minimising media bias. These losses, designed to balance the semantic distances across polarised inputs and ensure alignment with expert-written summaries, guide the generation of neutral and factually rich summaries. To evaluate media bias, we employ the political compass test, which maps political leanings based on economic and social dimensions. Experimental results on the Allsides dataset demonstrate that NeutraSum not only improves summarisation performance but also achieves significant reductions in media bias, offering a promising approach for neutral news summarisation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vaskar Nath, Pranav Raja, Claire Yoon, Sean Hendryx</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advances in AI, the development of systems capable of executing complex, multi-step reasoning tasks involving multiple tools remains a significant challenge. Current benchmarks fall short in capturing the real-world complexity of tool-use reasoning, where verifying the correctness of not only the final answer but also the intermediate steps is important for evaluation, development, and identifying failures during inference time. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolComp, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate multi-step tool-use reasoning. ToolComp is developed through a collaboration between models and human annotators, featuring human-edited/verified prompts, final answers, and process supervision labels, allowing for the evaluation of both final outcomes and intermediate reasoning. Evaluation across six different model families demonstrates the challenging nature of our dataset, with the majority of models achieving less than 50% accuracy. Additionally, we generate synthetic training data to compare the performance of outcome-supervised reward models (ORMs) with process-supervised reward models (PRMs) to assess their ability to improve complex tool-use reasoning as evaluated by ToolComp. Our results show that PRMs generalize significantly better than ORMs, achieving a 19% and 11% improvement in rank@1 accuracy for ranking base and fine-tuned model trajectories, respectively. These findings highlight the critical role of process supervision in both the evaluation and training of AI models, paving the way for more robust and capable systems in complex, multi-step tool-use tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Question answering systems are rapidly advancing, but their opaque nature may impact user trust. We explored trust through an anti-monitoring framework, where trust is predicted to be correlated with presence of citations and inversely related to checking citations. We tested this hypothesis with a live question-answering experiment that presented text responses generated using a commercial Chatbot along with varying citations (zero, one, or five), both relevant and random, and recorded if participants checked the citations and their self-reported trust in the generated responses. We found a significant increase in trust when citations were present, a result that held true even when the citations were random; we also found a significant decrease in trust when participants checked the citations. These results highlight the importance of citations in enhancing trust in AI-generated content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaushik Roy, Harshul Surana, Darssan Eswaramoorthi, Yuxin Zi, Vedant Palit, Ritvik Garimella, Amit Sheth</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting the attention of healthcare professionals for their potential to assist in diagnostic assessments, which could alleviate the strain on the healthcare system caused by a high patient load and a shortage of providers. For LLMs to be effective in supporting diagnostic assessments, it is essential that they closely replicate the standard diagnostic procedures used by clinicians. In this paper, we specifically examine the diagnostic assessment processes described in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for major depressive disorder (MDD) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). We investigate various prompting and fine-tuning techniques to guide both proprietary and open-source LLMs in adhering to these processes, and we evaluate the agreement between LLM-generated diagnostic outcomes and expert-validated ground truth. For fine-tuning, we utilize the Mentalllama and Llama models, while for prompting, we experiment with proprietary models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as llama-3.1-8b and mixtral-8x7b.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxue Cheng, Junyi Li, Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities, yet still face the hallucination issue. Typical text generation approaches adopt an auto-regressive generation without deliberate reasoning, which often results in untrustworthy and factually inaccurate responses. In this paper, we propose HaluSearch, a novel framework that incorporates tree search-based algorithms (e.g. MCTS) to enable an explicit slow thinking generation process for mitigating hallucinations of LLMs during inference. Specifically, HaluSearch frames text generation as a step-by-step reasoning process, using a self-evaluation reward model to score each generation step and guide the tree search towards the most reliable generation pathway for fully exploiting the internal knowledge of LLMs. To balance efficiency and quality, we introduce a hierarchical thinking system switch mechanism inspired by the dual process theory in cognitive science, which dynamically alternates between fast and slow thinking modes at both the instance and step levels, adapting to the complexity of questions and reasoning states. We conduct extensive experiments on both English and Chinese datasets and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) acquire, retain, and apply knowledge remains an open challenge. This paper introduces a novel framework, K-(CSA)^2, which categorizes LLM knowledge along two dimensions: correctness and confidence. The framework defines six categories of knowledge, ranging from highly confident correctness to confidently held misconceptions, enabling a nuanced evaluation of model comprehension beyond binary accuracy. Using this framework, we demonstrate how techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and reinforcement learning with human feedback fundamentally alter the knowledge structures of internal (pre-trained) and external (context-dependent) knowledge in LLMs. CoT particularly enhances base model performance and shows synergistic benefits when applied to aligned LLMs. Moreover, our layer-wise analysis reveals that higher layers in LLMs encode more high-confidence knowledge, while low-confidence knowledge tends to emerge in middle-to-lower layers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Zhao, Yang Deng, See-Kiong Ng, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, they can be easily misled by unfaithful arguments during conversations, even when their original statements are correct. To this end, we investigate the problem of maintaining faithful integrity in LLMs. This involves ensuring that LLMs adhere to their faithful statements in the face of opposing arguments and are able to correct their incorrect statements when presented with faithful arguments. In this work, we propose a novel framework, named Alignment for Faithful Integrity with Confidence Estimation (AFICE), which aims to align the LLM responses with faithful integrity. Specifically, AFICE first designs a Bilateral Confidence Estimation (BCE) approach for estimating the uncertainty of each response generated by the LLM given a specific context, which simultaneously estimate the model's confidence to the question based on the internal states during decoding as well as to the answer based on cumulative probability ratios. With the BCE, we construct a conversational preference dataset composed of context, original statement, and argument, which is adopted for aligning the LLM for faithful integrity using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experimental results on a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in the LLM's ability to maintain faithful responses when encountering opposing arguments, ensuring both the practical utility and trustworthiness of LLMs in complex interactive settings.

<p>Abstract: Existing Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs), which encapsulate extensive medical knowledge, demonstrate excellent capabilities in understanding medical images and responding to human queries based on these images. However, there remain challenges in visual localization in medical images, which is crucial for abnormality detection and interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a novel UMed-LVLM designed with Unveiling Medical abnormalities. Specifically, we collect a Medical Abnormalities Unveiling (MAU) dataset and propose a two-stage training method for UMed-LVLM training. To collect MAU dataset, we propose a prompt method utilizing the GPT-4V to generate diagnoses based on identified abnormal areas in medical images. Moreover, the two-stage training method includes Abnormal-Aware Instruction Tuning and Abnormal-Aware Rewarding, comprising Abnormal Localization Rewarding and Vision Relevance Rewarding. Experimental results demonstrate that our UMed-LVLM surpasses existing Med-LVLMs in identifying and understanding medical abnormality. In addition, this work shows that enhancing the abnormality detection capabilities of Med-LVLMs significantly improves their understanding of medical images and generalization capability.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models, researchers have created increasingly advanced spoken dialogue systems that can naturally converse with humans. However, these systems still struggle to handle the full complexity of real-world conversations, including audio events, musical contexts, and emotional expressions, mainly because current dialogue datasets are constrained in both scale and scenario diversity. In this paper, we propose leveraging synthetic data to enhance the dialogue models across diverse scenarios. We introduce ShareChatX, the first comprehensive, large-scale dataset for spoken dialogue that spans diverse scenarios. Based on this dataset, we introduce OmniChat, a multi-turn dialogue system with a heterogeneous feature fusion module, designed to optimize feature selection in different dialogue contexts. In addition, we explored critical aspects of training dialogue systems using synthetic data. Through comprehensive experimentation, we determined the ideal balance between synthetic and real data, achieving state-of-the-art results on the real-world dialogue dataset DailyTalk. We also highlight the crucial importance of synthetic data in tackling diverse, complex dialogue scenarios, especially those involving audio and music.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dibakar Gope, David Mansell, Danny Loh, Ian Bratt</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way we think about language understanding and generation, enthralling both researchers and developers. However, deploying LLMs for inference has been a significant challenge due to their unprecedented size and resource requirements. While quantizing model weights to sub-byte precision has emerged as a promising solution to ease memory pressure, the group quantization formats commonly used for LLM quantization have significant compute overheads and a resource-intensive dequantization process. As a result, a higher proportion of compute instructions do not perform multiplies, i.e., real work, rendering them unsuitable for meeting the required latency requirements for LLMs deployed on commodity CPUs. In this work, we propose a set of highly optimized kernels to accelerate LLM inference and unleash the full potential of CPUs, particularly Arm CPUs. These kernels amortize the cost of loading the operands and the cost of weight unpacking across multiple output rows. This, along with the introduction of an optimized interleaved group data layout for weights and decompression path optimizations to reduce unnecessary operations and dequantization overhead while maximizing the use of vector and matrix multiply operations, significantly improves the efficiency of MAC operations. Furthermore, we present a groupwise non-uniform codebook-based quantization method for ultra-low-precision quantization of LLMs to better match non-uniform patterns in their weight distributions, demonstrating better throughput during token generation while ensuring better quality than the state-of-the-art. Applying these improvements to 4-bit LLMs results in a 3-3.2x improvement in prompt processing and a 2x improvement in autoregressive decoding on Arm CPUs, compared to LLaMA.cpp-based solution.

<p>Abstract: We introduce a large language model (LLM) capable of processing speech inputs and show that tuning it further with reinforcement learning on human preference (RLHF) enables it to adapt better to disordered speech than traditional fine-tuning. Our method replaces low-frequency text tokens in an LLM's vocabulary with audio tokens and enables the model to recognize speech by fine-tuning it on speech with transcripts. We then use RL with rewards based on syntactic and semantic accuracy measures generalizing the LLM further to recognize disordered speech. While the resulting LLM does not outperform existing systems for speech recognition, we find that tuning with reinforcement learning using custom rewards leads to substantially better performance than supervised fine-tuning of the language model, specifically when adapting to speech in a different setting. This presents a compelling alternative tuning strategy for speech recognition using large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengnan Zhao, Lihe Zhang, Xingyi Yang, Tianhang Zheng, Baocai Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Security concerns surrounding text-to-image diffusion models have driven researchers to unlearn inappropriate concepts through fine-tuning. Recent fine-tuning methods typically align the prediction distributions of unsafe prompts with those of predefined text anchors. However, these techniques exhibit a considerable performance trade-off between eliminating undesirable concepts and preserving other concepts. In this paper, we systematically analyze the impact of diverse text anchors on unlearning performance. Guided by this analysis, we propose AdvAnchor, a novel approach that generates adversarial anchors to alleviate the trade-off issue. These adversarial anchors are crafted to closely resemble the embeddings of undesirable concepts to maintain overall model performance, while selectively excluding defining attributes of these concepts for effective erasure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdvAnchor outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AdvAnchor.</p>

<p>Abstract: While safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as the cornerstone for powerful systems such as multi-agent frameworks to solve complex real-world problems, they still suffer from potential adversarial queries, such as jailbreak attacks, which attempt to induce harmful content. Researching attack methods allows us to better understand the limitations of LLM and make trade-offs between helpfulness and safety. However, existing jailbreak attacks are primarily based on opaque optimization techniques (e.g. token-level gradient descent) and heuristic search methods like LLM refinement, which fall short in terms of transparency, transferability, and computational cost. In light of these limitations, we draw inspiration from the evolution and infection processes of biological viruses and propose LLM-Virus, a jailbreak attack method based on evolutionary algorithm, termed evolutionary jailbreak. LLM-Virus treats jailbreak attacks as both an evolutionary and transfer learning problem, utilizing LLMs as heuristic evolutionary operators to ensure high attack efficiency, transferability, and low time cost. Our experimental results on multiple safety benchmarks show that LLM-Virus achieves competitive or even superior performance compared to existing attack methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Learning experiments have critical requirements regarding the careful handling of their datasets as well as the efficient and correct usage of APIs that interact with hardware accelerators. On the one hand, software mistakes during data handling can contaminate experiments and lead to incorrect results. On the other hand, poorly coded APIs that interact with the hardware can lead to sub-optimal usage and untrustworthy conclusions. In this work we investigate the use of Linear Logic for the analysis of Deep Learning experiments. We show that primitives and operators of Linear Logic can be used to express: (i) an abstract representation of the control flow of an experiment, (ii) a set of available experimental resources, such as API calls to the underlying data-structures and hardware as well as (iii) reasoning rules about the correct consumption of resources during experiments. Our proposed model is not only lightweight but also easy to comprehend having both a symbolic and a visual component. Finally, its artifacts are themselves proofs in Linear Logic that can be readily verified by off-the-shelf reasoners.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image content safety has become a significant challenge with the rise of visual media on online platforms. Meanwhile, in the age of AI-generated content (AIGC), many image generation models are capable of producing harmful content, such as images containing sexual or violent material. Thus, it becomes crucial to identify such unsafe images based on established safety rules. Pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer potential in this regard, given their strong pattern recognition abilities. Existing approaches typically fine-tune MLLMs with human-labeled datasets, which however brings a series of drawbacks. First, relying on human annotators to label data following intricate and detailed guidelines is both expensive and labor-intensive. Furthermore, users of safety judgment systems may need to frequently update safety rules, making fine-tuning on human-based annotation more challenging. This raises the research question: Can we detect unsafe images by querying MLLMs in a zero-shot setting using a predefined safety constitution (a set of safety rules)? Our research showed that simply querying pre-trained MLLMs does not yield satisfactory results. This lack of effectiveness stems from factors such as the subjectivity of safety rules, the complexity of lengthy constitutions, and the inherent biases in the models. To address these challenges, we propose a MLLM-based method includes objectifying safety rules, assessing the relevance between rules and images, making quick judgments based on debiased token probabilities with logically complete yet simplified precondition chains for safety rules, and conducting more in-depth reasoning with cascaded chain-of-thought processes if necessary. Experiment results demonstrate that our method is highly effective for zero-shot image safety judgment tasks.</p>

The proposed framework formalizes the emergence of language and symbol systems through decentralized Bayesian inference across multiple agents, extending beyond conventional discriminative model-based approaches to emergent communication. This study makes the following two key contributions: First, we propose generative EmCom as a novel framework for understanding emergent communication, demonstrating how communication emergence in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can be derived from control as inference while clarifying its relationship to conventional discriminative approaches. Second, we propose a mathematical formulation showing the interpretation of LLMs as collective world models that integrate multiple agents' experiences through CPC. The framework provides a unified theoretical foundation for understanding how shared symbol systems emerge through collective predictive coding processes, bridging individual cognitive development and societal language evolution. Through mathematical formulations and discussion on prior works, we demonstrate how this framework explains fundamental aspects of language emergence and offers practical insights for understanding LLMs and developing sophisticated AI systems for improving human-AI interaction and multi-agent systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The number of parameters in large-scale language models based on transformers is gradually increasing, and the scale of computing clusters is also growing. The technology of quickly mobilizing large amounts of computing resources for parallel computing is becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we propose an automatic parallel algorithm that automatically plans the parallel strategy with maximum throughput based on model and hardware information. By decoupling the training time into computation, communication, and overlap, we established a training duration simulation model. Based on this simulation model, we prune the parallel solution space to shorten the search time required. The multi-node experiment results show that the algorithm can estimate the parallel training duration in real time with an average accuracy of 96%. In our test, the recommendation strategy provided by the algorithm is always globally optimal.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that enhances downstream task execution by retrieving additional information, such as knowledge, skills, and tools from external sources. Graph, by its intrinsic "nodes connected by edges" nature, encodes massive heterogeneous and relational information, making it a golden resource for RAG in tremendous real-world applications. As a result, we have recently witnessed increasing attention on equipping RAG with Graph, i.e., GraphRAG. However, unlike conventional RAG, where the retriever, generator, and external data sources can be uniformly designed in the neural-embedding space, the uniqueness of graph-structured data, such as diverse-formatted and domain-specific relational knowledge, poses unique and significant challenges when designing GraphRAG for different domains. Given the broad applicability, the associated design challenges, and the recent surge in GraphRAG, a systematic and up-to-date survey of its key concepts and techniques is urgently desired. Following this motivation, we present a comprehensive and up-to-date survey on GraphRAG. Our survey first proposes a holistic GraphRAG framework by defining its key components, including query processor, retriever, organizer, generator, and data source. Furthermore, recognizing that graphs in different domains exhibit distinct relational patterns and require dedicated designs, we review GraphRAG techniques uniquely tailored to each domain. Finally, we discuss research challenges and brainstorm directions to inspire cross-disciplinary opportunities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hoang Long Vu, Phuong Tuan Dat, Pham Thao Nhi, Nguyen Song Hao, Nguyen Thi Thu Trang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research in speaker recognition aims to address vulnerabilities due to variations between enrolment and test utterances, particularly in the multi-genre phenomenon where the utterances are in different speech genres. Previous resources for Vietnamese speaker recognition are either limited in size or do not focus on genre diversity, leaving studies in multi-genre effects unexplored. This paper introduces VoxVietnam, the first multi-genre dataset for Vietnamese speaker recognition with over 187,000 utterances from 1,406 speakers and an automated pipeline to construct a dataset on a large scale from public sources. Our experiments show the challenges posed by the multi-genre phenomenon to models trained on a single-genre dataset, and demonstrate a significant increase in performance upon incorporating the VoxVietnam into the training process. Our experiments are conducted to study the challenges of the multi-genre phenomenon in speaker recognition and the performance gain when the proposed dataset is used for multi-genre training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenkai Tu, Guojia Wan, Zhengchun Shang, Bo Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) provide a structured representation of knowledge but often suffer from challenges of incompleteness. To address this, link prediction or knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer missing new facts based on existing facts in KGs. Previous knowledge graph embedding models are limited in their ability to capture expressive features, especially when compared to deeper, multi-layer models. These approaches also assign a single static embedding to each entity and relation, disregarding the fact that entities and relations can exhibit different behaviors in varying graph contexts. Due to complex context over a fact triple of a KG, existing methods have to leverage complex non-linear context encoder, like transformer, to project entity and relation into low dimensional representations, resulting in high computation cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose Triple Receptance Perception (TRP) architecture to model sequential information, enabling the learning of dynamic context of entities and relations. Then we use tensor decomposition to calculate triple scores, providing robust relational decoding capabilities. This integration allows for more expressive representations. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as YAGO3-10, UMLS, FB15k, and FB13 in link prediction and triple classification tasks demonstrate that our method performs better than several state-of-the-art models, proving the effectiveness of the integration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nishit Anand, Ashish Seth, Ramani Duraiswami, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-language models (ALMs) excel in zero-shot audio classification, a task where models classify previously unseen audio clips at test time by leveraging descriptive natural language prompts. We introduce TSPE (Task-Specific Prompt Ensemble), a simple, training-free hard prompting method that boosts ALEs' zero-shot performance by customizing prompts for diverse audio classification tasks. Rather than using generic template-based prompts like "Sound of a car" we generate context-rich prompts, such as "Sound of a car coming from a tunnel". Specifically, we leverage label information to identify suitable sound attributes, such as "loud" and "feeble", and appropriate sound sources, such as "tunnel" and "street" and incorporate this information into the prompts used by Audio-Language Models (ALMs) for audio classification. Further, to enhance audio-text alignment, we perform prompt ensemble across TSPE-generated task-specific prompts. When evaluated on 12 diverse audio classification datasets, TSPE improves performance across ALMs by showing an absolute improvement of 1.23-16.36% over vanilla zero-shot evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianjie Luo, Jingwen Chen, Yehao Li, Yingwei Pan, Jianlin Feng, Hongyang Chao, Ting Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, zero-shot image captioning has gained increasing attention, where only text data is available for training. The remarkable progress in text-to-image diffusion model presents the potential to resolve this task by employing synthetic image-caption pairs generated by this pre-trained prior. Nonetheless, the defective details in the salient regions of the synthetic images introduce semantic misalignment between the synthetic image and text, leading to compromised results. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Patch-wise Cross-modal feature Mix-up (PCM) mechanism to adaptively mitigate the unfaithful contents in a fine-grained manner during training, which can be integrated into most of encoder-decoder frameworks, introducing our PCM-Net. Specifically, for each input image, salient visual concepts in the image are first detected considering the image-text similarity in CLIP space. Next, the patch-wise visual features of the input image are selectively fused with the textual features of the salient visual concepts, leading to a mixed-up feature map with less defective content. Finally, a visual-semantic encoder is exploited to refine the derived feature map, which is further incorporated into the sentence decoder for caption generation. Additionally, to facilitate the model training with synthetic data, a novel CLIP-weighted cross-entropy loss is devised to prioritize the high-quality image-text pairs over the low-quality counterparts. Extensive experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k datasets demonstrate the superiority of our PCM-Net compared with state-of-the-art VLMs-based approaches. It is noteworthy that our PCM-Net ranks first in both in-domain and cross-domain zero-shot image captioning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenhan Huang, Tejaswini Pedapati, Pin-Yu Chen, Jianxi Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt learning is an effective way to exploit the potential of large-scale pre-trained foundational models. Continuous prompts parameterize context tokens in prompts by turning them into differentiable vectors. Deep continuous prompts insert prompts not only in the input but also in the intermediate hidden representations. Manually designed deep continuous prompts exhibit a remarkable improvement compared to the zero-shot pre-trained model on downstream tasks. How to automate the continuous prompt design is an underexplored area, and a fundamental question arises, is manually designed deep prompt strategy optimal? To answer this question, we propose a method dubbed differentiable prompt learning (DPL). The DPL method is formulated as an optimization problem to automatically determine the optimal context length of the prompt to be added to each layer, where the objective is to maximize the performance. We test the DPL method on the pre-trained CLIP. We empirically find that by using only limited data, our DPL method can find deep continuous prompt configuration with high confidence. The performance on the downstream tasks exhibits the superiority of the automatic design: our method boosts the average test accuracy by 2.60% on 11 datasets compared to baseline methods. Besides, our method focuses only on the prompt configuration (i.e. context length for each layer), which means that our method is compatible with the baseline methods that have sophisticated designs to boost the performance. The DPL method can be deployed to large language models or computer vision models at no cost.</p>

The recent exception being a series of papers e.g. by Indrzejczak, Zawidzki and K\"rbis.

Using a Montague- and Tich\'y-style formalization of  natural language, the paper successfully handles deduction with intensional transitives whose complements are non-referring descriptions, and derives Strawsonian rules for existential presuppositions of sentences with such descriptions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Szeider</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) perform exceptionally well at natural language tasks, they often struggle with precise formal reasoning and the rigorous specification of problems. We present MCP-Solver, a prototype implementation of the Model Context Protocol that demonstrates the potential for systematic integration between LLMs and constraint programming systems. Our implementation provides interfaces for the creation, editing, and validation of a constraint model. Through an item-based editing approach with integrated validation, the system ensures model consistency at every modification step and enables structured iterative refinement. The system handles concurrent solving sessions and maintains a persistent knowledge base of modeling insights. Initial experiments suggest that this integration can effectively combine LLMs' natural language understanding with constraint-solving capabilities. Our open-source implementation is proof of concept for integrating formal reasoning systems with LLMs through standardized protocols. While further research is needed to establish comprehensive formal guarantees, this work takes a first step toward principled integration of natural language processing with constraint-based reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual Instruction Tuning typically requires a large amount of vision-language training data. This data often containing redundant information that increases computational costs without proportional performance gains. In this work, we introduce ICONS, a gradient-driven Influence CONsensus approach for vision-language data Selection that selects a compact training dataset for efficient multi-task training. The key element of our approach is cross-task influence consensus, which uses majority voting across task-specific influence matrices to identify samples that are consistently valuable across multiple tasks, allowing us to effectively prioritize data that optimizes for overall performance. Experiments show that models trained on our selected data (20% of LLaVA-665K) achieve 98.6% of the relative performance obtained using the full dataset. Additionally, we release this subset, LLaVA-ICONS-133K, a compact yet highly informative subset of LLaVA-665K visual instruction tuning data, preserving high impact training data for efficient vision-language model development.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00659">Why Are Positional Encodings Nonessential for Deep Autoregressive Transformers? Revisiting a Petroglyph</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuki Irie</p>
<p>Abstract: Do autoregressive Transformer language models require explicit positional encodings (PEs)? The answer is "no" as long as they have more than one layer -- they can distinguish sequences with permuted tokens without requiring explicit PEs. This property has been known since early efforts (those contemporary with GPT-2) adopting the Transformer for language modeling. However, this result does not appear to have been well disseminated and was even rediscovered recently. This may be partially due to a sudden growth of the language modeling community after the advent of GPT-2, but perhaps also due to the lack of a clear explanation in prior publications, despite being commonly understood by practitioners in the past. Here we review this long-forgotten explanation why explicit PEs are nonessential for multi-layer autoregressive Transformers (in contrast, one-layer models require PEs to discern order information of their input tokens). We also review the origin of this result, and hope to re-establish it as a common knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Behrouz, Peilin Zhong, Vahab Mirrokni</p>
<p>Abstract: Over more than a decade there has been an extensive research effort on how to effectively utilize recurrent models and attention. While recurrent models aim to compress the data into a fixed-size memory (called hidden state), attention allows attending to the entire context window, capturing the direct dependencies of all tokens. This more accurate modeling of dependencies, however, comes with a quadratic cost, limiting the model to a fixed-length context. We present a new neural long-term memory module that learns to memorize historical context and helps attention to attend to the current context while utilizing long past information. We show that this neural memory has the advantage of fast parallelizable training while maintaining a fast inference. From a memory perspective, we argue that attention due to its limited context but accurate dependency modeling performs as a short-term memory, while neural memory due to its ability to memorize the data, acts as a long-term, more persistent, memory. Based on these two modules, we introduce a new family of architectures, called Titans, and present three variants to address how one can effectively incorporate memory into this architecture. Our experimental results on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, genomics, and time series tasks show that Titans are more effective than Transformers and recent modern linear recurrent models. They further can effectively scale to larger than 2M context window size with higher accuracy in needle-in-haystack tasks compared to baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Solving arithmetic tasks is a simple and fundamental skill, yet modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have great difficulty with them. We introduce the Integrated Gated Calculator (IGC), a module that enables LLMs to perform arithmetic by emulating a calculator on the GPU. We finetune a Llama model with our module and test it on the BigBench Arithmetic benchmark, where it beats the State of the Art, outperforming all models on the benchmark, including models almost two orders of magnitude larger. Our approach takes only a single iteration to run and requires no external tools. It performs arithmetic operations entirely inside the LLM without the need to produce intermediate tokens. It is computationally efficient, interpretable, and avoids side-effects on tasks that do not require arithmetic operations. It reliably achieves 98\% to 99\% accuracy across multiple training runs and for all subtasks, including the substantially harder subtask of multiplication, which was previously unsolved.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingzi Xu, Amir Tavanaei, Kavosh Asadi, Karim Bouyarmane</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite very fast progress, efficiently training large language models (LLMs) in very long contexts remains challenging. Existing methods fall back to training LLMs with short contexts (a maximum of a few thousands tokens in training) and use inference time techniques when evaluating on long contexts (above 1M tokens context window at inference). As opposed to long-context-inference, training on very long context input prompts is quickly limited by GPU memory availability and by the prohibitively long training times it requires on state-of-the-art hardware. Meanwhile, many real-life applications require not only inference but also training/fine-tuning with long context on specific tasks. Such applications include, for example, augmenting the context with various sources of raw reference information for fact extraction, fact summarization, or fact reconciliation tasks. We propose adjoint sharding, a novel technique that comprises sharding gradient calculation during training to reduce memory requirements by orders of magnitude, making training on very long context computationally tractable. Adjoint sharding is based on the adjoint method and computes equivalent gradients to backpropagation. We also propose truncated adjoint sharding to speed up the algorithm while maintaining performance. We provide a distributed version, and a paralleled version of adjoint sharding to further speed up training. Empirical results show the proposed adjoint sharding algorithm reduces memory usage by up to 3X with a 1.27B parameter large language model on 1M context length training. This allows to increase the maximum context length during training or fine-tuning of a 1.27B parameter model from 35K tokens to above 100K tokens on a training infrastructure composed of five AWS P4 instances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaofeng Cheng, Haitian Lu, Chengxu Yang, Xuyang Wang, Ta Li, Yonghong Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Effectively distinguishing the pronunciation correlations between different written texts is a significant issue in linguistic acoustics. Traditionally, such pronunciation correlations are obtained through manually designed pronunciation lexicons. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to automatically acquire these pronunciation correlations, called automatic text pronunciation correlation (ATPC). The supervision required for this method is consistent with the supervision needed for training end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) systems, i.e., speech and corresponding text annotations. First, the iteratively-trained timestamp estimator (ITSE) algorithm is employed to align the speech with their corresponding annotated text symbols. Then, a speech encoder is used to convert the speech into speech embeddings. Finally, we compare the speech embeddings distances of different text symbols to obtain ATPC. Experimental results on Mandarin show that ATPC enhances E2E-ASR performance in contextual biasing and holds promise for dialects or languages lacking artificial pronunciation lexicons.</p>

However, the generated speech samples often lack semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose SLM and LLM Integration for spontaneous spoken Dialogue gEneration (SLIDE). Specifically, we first utilize an LLM to generate the textual content of spoken dialogue. Next, we convert the textual dialogues into phoneme sequences and use a two-tower transformer-based duration predictor to predict the duration of each phoneme. Finally, an SLM conditioned on the spoken phoneme sequences is used to vocalize the textual dialogue. Experimental results on the Fisher dataset demonstrate that our system can generate naturalistic spoken dialogue while maintaining high semantic coherence.</p>

Critically, we provide a rigorous mathematical derivation demonstrating that the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) in a standard Transformer is a specialized case (a closure) of this generalized cross-attention, revealing its role in implicit knowledge retrieval and validating our design. This theoretical framework provides a new lens for understanding FFNs and lays the foundation for future research exploring enhanced interpretability, adaptability, and scalability, enabling richer interplay with external knowledge bases and other systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Song, Xinyu Wang, Yihao Wang, Yifan Tang, Ru Zhang, Jianyi Liu, Gongshen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread use of social media, user-generated content has surged on online platforms. When such content includes hateful, abusive, offensive, or cyberbullying behavior, it is classified as toxic speech, posing a significant threat to the online ecosystem's integrity and safety. While manual content moderation is still prevalent, the overwhelming volume of content and the psychological strain on human moderators underscore the need for automated toxic speech detection. Previously proposed detection methods often rely on large annotated datasets; however, acquiring such datasets is both costly and challenging in practice. To address this issue, we propose an uncertainty-guided firewall for toxic speech in few-shot scenarios, U-GIFT, that utilizes self-training to enhance detection performance even when labeled data is limited. Specifically, U-GIFT combines active learning with Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to automatically identify high-quality samples from unlabeled data, prioritizing the selection of pseudo-labels with higher confidence for training based on uncertainty estimates derived from model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that U-GIFT significantly outperforms competitive baselines in few-shot detection scenarios. In the 5-shot setting, it achieves a 14.92\% performance improvement over the basic model. Importantly, U-GIFT is user-friendly and adaptable to various pre-trained language models (PLMs). It also exhibits robust performance in scenarios with sample imbalance and cross-domain settings, while showcasing strong generalization across various language applications. We believe that U-GIFT provides an efficient solution for few-shot toxic speech detection, offering substantial support for automated content moderation in cyberspace, thereby acting as a firewall to promote advancements in cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Designing structured visuals such as presentation slides is essential for communicative needs, necessitating both content creation and visual planning skills. In this work, we tackle the challenge of automated slide generation, where models produce slide presentations from natural language (NL) instructions. We first introduce the SlidesBench benchmark, the first benchmark for slide generation with 7k training and 585 testing examples derived from 310 slide decks across 10 domains. SlidesBench supports evaluations that are (i)reference-based to measure similarity to a target slide, and (ii)reference-free to measure the design quality of generated slides alone. We benchmark end-to-end image generation and program generation methods with a variety of models, and find that programmatic methods produce higher-quality slides in user-interactable formats. Built on the success of program generation, we create AutoPresent, an 8B Llama-based model trained on 7k pairs of instructions paired with code for slide generation, and achieve results comparable to the closed-source model GPT-4o. We further explore iterative design refinement where the model is tasked to self-refine its own output, and we found that this process improves the slide's quality. We hope that our work will provide a basis for future work on generating structured visuals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sakshi Garg, Jose Renau</p>
<p>Abstract: In current chip design processes, using multiple tools to obtain a gate-level netlist often results in the loss of source code correlation. SynAlign addresses this challenge by automating the alignment process, simplifying iterative design, reducing overhead, and maintaining correlation across various tools. This enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of chip design workflows.
  Improving characteristics such as frequency through iterative design is essential for enhancing accelerators and chip designs. While synthesis tools produce netlists with critical path information, designers often lack the tools to trace these netlist cells back to their original source code. Mapping netlist components to source code provides early feedback on timing and power for frontend designers.
  SynAlign automatically aligns post-optimized netlists with the original source code without altering compilers or synthesis processes. Its alignment strategy relies on the consistent design structure throughout the chip design cycle, even with changes in compiler flow. This consistency allows engineers to maintain a correlation between modified designs and the original source code across various tools. Remarkably, SynAlign can tolerate up to 61\% design net changes without impacting alignment accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqi Zhang, Hang Zhang, Xin Li, Jiashuo Sun, Yongliang Shen, Weiming Lu, Deli Zhao, Yueting Zhuang, Lidong Bing</p>
<p>Abstract: Compared to image-text pair data, interleaved corpora enable Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand the world more naturally like humans. However, such existing datasets are crawled from webpage, facing challenges like low knowledge density, loose image-text relations, and poor logical coherence between images. On the other hand, the internet hosts vast instructional videos (e.g., online geometry courses) that are widely used by humans to learn foundational subjects, yet these valuable resources remain underexplored in VLM training. In this paper, we introduce a high-quality \textbf{multimodal textbook} corpus with richer foundational knowledge for VLM pretraining. It collects over 2.5 years of instructional videos, totaling 22,000 class hours. We first use an LLM-proposed taxonomy to systematically gather instructional videos. Then we progressively extract and refine visual (keyframes), audio (ASR), and textual knowledge (OCR) from the videos, and organize as an image-text interleaved corpus based on temporal order. Compared to its counterparts, our video-centric textbook offers more coherent context, richer knowledge, and better image-text alignment. Experiments demonstrate its superb pretraining performance, particularly in knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks like ScienceQA and MathVista. Moreover, VLMs pre-trained on our textbook exhibit outstanding interleaved context awareness, leveraging visual and textual cues in their few-shot context for task solving~\footnote{Our code are available at \url{https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/multimodal_textbook}}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haina Zhu, Yizhi Zhou, Hangting Chen, Jianwei Yu, Ziyang Ma, Rongzhi Gu, Wei Tan, Xie Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) in various music informatics understanding tasks, including music tagging, instrument classification, key detection, and more. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised music representation learning model for music understanding. Distinguished from previous studies adopting random projection or existing neural codec, the proposed model, named MuQ, is trained to predict tokens generated by Mel Residual Vector Quantization (Mel-RVQ). Our Mel-RVQ utilizes residual linear projection structure for Mel spectrum quantization to enhance the stability and efficiency of target extraction and lead to better performance. Experiments in a large variety of downstream tasks demonstrate that MuQ outperforms previous self-supervised music representation models with only 0.9K hours of open-source pre-training data. Scaling up the data to over 160K hours and adopting iterative training consistently improve the model performance. To further validate the strength of our model, we present MuQ-MuLan, a joint music-text embedding model based on contrastive learning, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot music tagging task on the MagnaTagATune dataset. Code and checkpoints are open source in https://github.com/tencent-ailab/MuQ.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah Mushtaq, Muhammad Rafay Naeem, Ibrahim Ghaznavi, Muhammad Imran Taj, Imran Hashmi, Junaid Qadir</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining significant attention for their ability to harness collective intelligence in complex problem-solving, decision-making, and planning tasks. This aligns with the concept of the wisdom of crowds, where diverse agents contribute collectively to generating effective solutions, making it particularly suitable for educational settings. Senior design projects, also known as capstone or final year projects, are pivotal in engineering education as they integrate theoretical knowledge with practical application, fostering critical thinking, teamwork, and real-world problem-solving skills. In this paper, we explore the use of Multi-Agent LLMs in supporting these senior design projects undertaken by engineering students, which often involve multidisciplinary considerations and conflicting objectives, such as optimizing technical performance while addressing ethical, social, and environmental concerns. We propose a framework where distinct LLM agents represent different expert perspectives, such as problem formulation agents, system complexity agents, societal and ethical agents, or project managers, thus facilitating a holistic problem-solving approach. This implementation leverages standard multi-agent system (MAS) concepts such as coordination, cooperation, and negotiation, incorporating prompt engineering to develop diverse personas for each agent. These agents engage in rich, collaborative dialogues to simulate human engineering teams, guided by principles from swarm AI to efficiently balance individual contributions towards a unified solution. We adapt these techniques to create a collaboration structure for LLM agents, encouraging interdisciplinary reasoning and negotiation similar to real-world senior design projects. To assess the efficacy of this framework, we collected six proposals of engineering and computer science of...</p>

<p>Abstract: Faces and humans are crucial elements in social interaction and are widely included in everyday photos and videos. Therefore, a deep understanding of faces and humans will enable multi-modal assistants to achieve improved response quality and broadened application scope. Currently, the multi-modal assistant community lacks a comprehensive and scientific evaluation of face and human understanding abilities. In this paper, we first propose a hierarchical ability taxonomy that includes three levels of abilities. Then, based on this taxonomy, we collect images and annotations from publicly available datasets in the face and human community and build a semi-automatic data pipeline to produce problems for the new benchmark. Finally, the obtained Face-Human-Bench comprises a development set with 900 problems and a test set with 1800 problems, supporting both English and Chinese. We conduct evaluations over 25 mainstream multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) with our Face-Human-Bench, focusing on the correlation between abilities, the impact of the relative position of targets on performance, and the impact of Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting on performance. Moreover, inspired by multi-modal agents, we also explore which abilities of MLLMs need to be supplemented by specialist models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced human-AI interaction but struggle with cultural understanding, often misinterpreting symbols, gestures, and artifacts due to biases in predominantly Western-centric training data. In this paper, we construct CultureVerse, a large-scale multimodal benchmark covering 19, 682 cultural concepts, 188 countries/regions, 15 cultural concepts, and 3 question types, with the aim of characterizing and improving VLMs' multicultural understanding capabilities. Then, we propose CultureVLM, a series of VLMs fine-tuned on our dataset to achieve significant performance improvement in cultural understanding. Our evaluation of 16 models reveals significant disparities, with a stronger performance in Western concepts and weaker results in African and Asian contexts. Fine-tuning on our CultureVerse enhances cultural perception, demonstrating cross-cultural, cross-continent, and cross-dataset generalization without sacrificing performance on models' general VLM benchmarks. We further present insights on cultural generalization and forgetting. We hope that this work could lay the foundation for more equitable and culturally aware multimodal AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuzheng Gao, Chaozheng Wang, Cuiyun Gao, Xiaoqian Jiao, Chun Yong Chong, Shan Gao, Michael Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Test cases are essential for validating the reliability and quality of software applications. Recent studies have demonstrated the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate useful test cases for given source code. However, the existing work primarily relies on human-written plain prompts, which often leads to suboptimal results since the performance of LLMs can be highly influenced by the prompts. Moreover, these approaches use the same prompt for all LLMs, overlooking the fact that different LLMs might be best suited to different prompts. Given the wide variety of possible prompt formulations, automatically discovering the optimal prompt for each LLM presents a significant challenge. Although there are methods on automated prompt optimization in the natural language processing field, they are hard to produce effective prompts for the test case generation task. First, the methods iteratively optimize prompts by simply combining and mutating existing ones without proper guidance, resulting in prompts that lack diversity and tend to repeat the same errors in the generated test cases. Second, the prompts are generally lack of domain contextual knowledge, limiting LLMs' performance in the task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing both visual and textual information. However, the critical challenge of alignment between visual and linguistic representations is not fully understood. This survey presents a comprehensive examination of alignment and misalignment in LVLMs through an explainability lens. We first examine the fundamentals of alignment, exploring its representational and behavioral aspects, training methodologies, and theoretical foundations. We then analyze misalignment phenomena across three semantic levels: object, attribute, and relational misalignment. Our investigation reveals that misalignment emerges from challenges at multiple levels: the data level, the model level, and the inference level. We provide a comprehensive review of existing mitigation strategies, categorizing them into parameter-frozen and parameter-tuning approaches. Finally, we outline promising future research directions, emphasizing the need for standardized evaluation protocols and in-depth explainability studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehun Kim, Ji-Hoon Kim, Yeunju Choi, Tan Dat Nguyen, Seongkyu Mun, Joon Son Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of voice conversion is to transform the speech of a source speaker to sound like that of a reference speaker while preserving the original content. A key challenge is to extract disentangled linguistic content from the source and voice style from the reference. While existing approaches leverage various methods to isolate the two, a generalization still requires further attention, especially for robustness in zero-shot scenarios. In this paper, we achieve successful disentanglement of content and speaker features by tuning self-supervised speech features with adapters. The adapters are trained to dynamically encode nuanced features from rich self-supervised features, and the decoder fuses them to produce speech that accurately resembles the reference with minimal loss of content. Moreover, we leverage a conditional flow matching decoder with cross-attention speaker conditioning to further boost the synthesis quality and efficiency. Subjective and objective evaluations in a zero-shot scenario demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing models in speech quality and similarity to the reference speech.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D visual grounding (3DVG) involves localizing entities in a 3D scene referred to by natural language text. Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered sophisticated reasoning capabilities into the realm of video through Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs). However, VideoLLMs currently rely on a single vision encoder for all of their visual processing, which limits the amount and type of visual information that can be conveyed to the LLM. Our method, MERV, Multi-Encoder Representation of Videos, instead leverages multiple frozen visual encoders to create a unified representation of a video, providing the VideoLLM with a comprehensive set of specialized visual knowledge. Spatio-temporally aligning the features from each encoder allows us to tackle a wider range of open-ended and multiple-choice video understanding questions and outperform prior state-of-the-art works. MERV is up to 3.7% better in accuracy than Video-LLaVA across the standard suite video understanding benchmarks, while also having a better Video-ChatGPT score. We also improve upon SeViLA, the previous best on zero-shot Perception Test accuracy, by 2.2%. MERV introduces minimal extra parameters and trains faster than equivalent single-encoder methods while parallelizing the visual processing. Finally, we provide qualitative evidence that MERV successfully captures domain knowledge from each of its encoders. Our results offer promising directions in utilizing multiple vision encoders for comprehensive video understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruosen Li, Teerth Patel, Xinya Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays, the quality of responses generated by different modern large language models (LLMs) is hard to evaluate and compare automatically. Recent studies suggest and predominantly use LLMs for reference-free evaluation of open-ended question answering. More specifically, they use the recognized "strongest" LLM as the evaluator, which conducts pairwise comparisons of candidate models' answers and provides a ranking score. However, this intuitive method has multiple problems, such as bringing in self-enhancement (favoring its own answers) and positional bias. We draw insights and lessons from the educational domain (Cho & MacArthur, 2011; Walsh, 2014) to improve LLM-based evaluations. Specifically, we propose (1) the peer rank (PR) algorithm that takes into account each peer LLM's pairwise preferences of all answer pairs, and outputs a final ranking of models; and (2) peer discussion (PD), where we prompt two LLMs to discuss and try to reach a mutual agreement on the preferences of two answers. We conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets. We find that our approaches achieve higher accuracy and align better with human judgments. Interestingly, PR can induce a relatively accurate self-ranking of models under the anonymous setting, where each model's name is unrevealed. Our work provides space to explore evaluating models that are hard to compare for humans.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown remarkable performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including challenging mathematical reasoning. However, most existing open-source models are only pre-trained on large-scale internet data and without math-related optimization. In this paper, we present WizardMath, which enhances the mathematical CoT reasoning abilities of LLMs without using external python tools, by applying our proposed Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF) method to the domain of math. Through extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the extraordinary capabilities of our model. Remarkably, WizardMath-Mistral 7B surpasses top-tier open-source LLMs by a substantial margin with higher data efficiency. Furthermore, WizardMath 70B even outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude 2, Gemini Pro and GPT-4-early-version.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Junayed Hasan, Suhra Noor, Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical texts, such as admission notes, discharge summaries, and progress notes, contain rich and valuable information that can be used for clinical decision making. However, a severe bottleneck in using transformer encoders for processing clinical texts comes from the input length limit of these models: transformer-based encoders use fixed-length inputs. Therefore, these models discard part of the inputs while processing medical text. There is a risk of losing vital knowledge from clinical text if only part of it is processed. This paper proposes a novel method to preserve the knowledge of long clinical texts in the models using aggregated ensembles of transformer encoders. Previous studies used either ensemble or aggregation, but we studied the effects of fusing these methods. We trained several pre-trained BERT-like transformer encoders on two clinical outcome tasks: mortality prediction and length of stay prediction. Our method achieved better results than all baseline models for prediction tasks on long clinical notes. We conducted extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III clinical database's admission notes by combining multiple unstructured and high-dimensional datasets, demonstrating our method's effectiveness and superiority over existing approaches. This study shows that fusing ensemble and aggregation improves the model performance for clinical prediction tasks, particularly the mortality and the length of hospital stay.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language models, characterized by their black-box nature, often hallucinate and display sensitivity to input perturbations, causing concerns about trust. To enhance trust, it is imperative to gain a comprehensive understanding of the model's failure modes and develop effective strategies to improve their performance. In this study, we introduce a methodology designed to examine how input perturbations affect language models across various scales, including pre-trained models and large language models (LLMs). Utilizing fine-tuning, we enhance the model's robustness to input perturbations. Additionally, we investigate whether exposure to one perturbation enhances or diminishes the model's performance with respect to other perturbations. To address robustness against multiple perturbations, we present three distinct fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, we broaden the scope of our methodology to encompass large language models (LLMs) by leveraging a chain of thought (CoT) prompting approach augmented with exemplars. We employ the Tabular-NLI task to showcase how our proposed strategies adeptly train a robust model, enabling it to address diverse perturbations while maintaining accuracy on the original dataset. https://msin-infotabs.github.io/</p>

<p>Abstract: Natural language serves as a common and straightforward signal for humans to interact seamlessly with machines. Recognizing the importance of this interface, the machine learning community is investing considerable effort in generating data that is semantically coherent with textual instructions. While strides have been made in text-to-data generation spanning image editing, audio synthesis, video creation, and beyond, low-resource areas characterized by expensive annotations or complex data structures, such as molecules, motion dynamics, and time series, often lack textual labels. This deficiency impedes supervised learning, thereby constraining the application of advanced generative models for text-to-data tasks. In response to these challenges in the low-resource scenario, we propose Text2Data, a novel approach that utilizes unlabeled data to understand the underlying data distribution through an unsupervised diffusion model. Subsequently, it undergoes controllable finetuning via a novel constraint optimization-based learning objective that ensures controllability and effectively counteracts catastrophic forgetting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Text2Data is able to achieve enhanced performance regarding controllability across various modalities, including molecules, motions and time series, when compared to existing baselines.</p>

Furthermore, this paper acknowledges the vast diversity of potential living conditions across the universe, which could foster unique cosmologies, ethical codes, and worldviews among different civilizations. Recognizing the Earth-centric bias inherent in current LLM designs, we propose the novel concept of using LLM agents with diverse ethical paradigms and simulating interactions between entities with distinct moral principles. This innovative research not only introduces a novel method for comprehending potential inter-civilizational dynamics but also holds practical value in enabling entities with divergent value systems to strategize, prevent conflicts, and engage in games under conditions of asymmetric information.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuji Naraki, Ryosuke Yamaki, Yoshikazu Ikeda, Takafumi Horie, Kotaro Yoshida, Ryotaro Shimizu, Hiroki Naganuma</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Named Entity Recognition (NER) is recognized as a critical technology, employed across a wide array of applications. Traditional methodologies for annotating datasets for NER models are challenged by high costs and variations in dataset quality. This research introduces a novel hybrid annotation approach that synergizes human effort with the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach not only aims to ameliorate the noise inherent in manual annotations, such as omissions, thereby enhancing the performance of NER models, but also achieves this in a cost-effective manner. Additionally, by employing a label mixing strategy, it addresses the issue of class imbalance encountered in LLM-based annotations. Through an analysis across multiple datasets, this method has been consistently shown to provide superior performance compared to traditional annotation methods, even under constrained budget conditions. This study illuminates the potential of leveraging LLMs to improve dataset quality, introduces a novel technique to mitigate class imbalances, and demonstrates the feasibility of achieving high-performance NER in a cost-effective way.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Munief Hassan Tahir, Sana Shams, Layba Fiaz, Farah Adeeba, Sarmad Hussain</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on multilingual data have revolutionized natural language processing research, by transitioning from languages and task specific model pipelines to a single model adapted on a variety of tasks. However majority of existing multilingual NLP benchmarks for LLMs provide evaluation data in only few languages with little linguistic diversity. In addition these benchmarks lack quality assessment against the respective state-of the art models. This study presents an in-depth examination of 7 prominent LLMs: GPT-3.5-turbo, Llama 2-7B-Chat, Llama 3.1-8B, Bloomz 3B, Bloomz 7B1, Ministral-8B and Whisper (Large, medium and small variant) across 17 tasks using 22 datasets, 13.8 hours of speech, in a zero-shot setting, and their performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, has been compared and analyzed. Our experiments show that SOTA models currently outperform encoder-decoder models in majority of Urdu NLP tasks under zero-shot settings. However, comparing Llama 3.1-8B over prior version Llama 2-7B-Chat, we can deduce that with improved language coverage, LLMs can surpass these SOTA models. Our results emphasize that models with fewer parameters but richer language-specific data, like Llama 3.1-8B, often outperform larger models with lower language diversity, such as GPT-3.5, in several tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) systems are increasingly being deployed across diverse industries and research domains. Developers and end-users interact with these systems through the use of prompting and prompt engineering. Although prompt engineering is a widely adopted and extensively researched area, it suffers from conflicting terminology and a fragmented ontological understanding of what constitutes an effective prompt due to its relatively recent emergence. We establish a structured understanding of prompt engineering by assembling a taxonomy of prompting techniques and analyzing their applications. We present a detailed vocabulary of 33 vocabulary terms, a taxonomy of 58 LLM prompting techniques, and 40 techniques for other modalities. Additionally, we provide best practices and guidelines for prompt engineering, including advice for prompting state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs such as ChatGPT. We further present a meta-analysis of the entire literature on natural language prefix-prompting. As a culmination of these efforts, this paper presents the most comprehensive survey on prompt engineering to date.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengbin Yue, Siyuan Wang, Wei Chen, Xuanjing Huang, Zhongyu Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant breakthroughs in various natural language processing tasks. However, generating factually consistent responses in knowledge-intensive scenarios remains a challenge due to issues such as hallucination, difficulty in acquiring long-tailed knowledge, and limited memory expansion. This paper introduces SMART, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages external knowledge to enhance the interpretability and factual consistency of LLM-generated responses. SMART comprises four specialized agents, each performing a specific sub-trajectory action to navigate complex knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose a multi-agent co-training paradigm, Long-Short Trajectory Learning, which ensures synergistic collaboration among agents while maintaining fine-grained execution by each agent. Extensive experiments on five knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate SMART's superior performance compared to widely adopted knowledge internalization and knowledge enhancement methods. Our framework can extend beyond knowledge-intensive tasks to more complex scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/yueshengbin/SMART.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob K Christopher, Brian R Bartoldson, Tal Ben-Nun, Michael Cardei, Bhavya Kailkhura, Ferdinando Fioretto</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a widely adopted method to accelerate large language model inference without sacrificing the quality of the model outputs. While this technique has facilitated notable speed improvements by enabling parallel sequence verification, its efficiency remains inherently limited by the reliance on incremental token generation in existing draft models. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an adaptation of speculative decoding which uses discrete diffusion models to generate draft sequences. This allows parallelization of both the drafting and verification steps, providing significant speed-ups to the inference process. Our proposed approach, Speculative Diffusion Decoding (SpecDiff), is validated on standard language generation benchmarks and empirically demonstrated to provide a up to 8.7x speed-up over standard generation processes and up to 2.5x speed-up over existing speculative decoding approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen Cheng, Ke Sun, Xinyu Zhang, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code completion capabilities, giving rise to a new generation of LLM-based Code Completion Tools (LCCTs). Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these tools possess unique workflows, integrating multiple information sources as input and prioritizing code suggestions over natural language interaction, which introduces distinct security challenges. Additionally, LCCTs often rely on proprietary code datasets for training, raising concerns about the potential exposure of sensitive data. This paper exploits these distinct characteristics of LCCTs to develop targeted attack methodologies on two critical security risks: jailbreaking and training data extraction attacks. Our experimental results expose significant vulnerabilities within LCCTs, including a 99.4% success rate in jailbreaking attacks on GitHub Copilot and a 46.3% success rate on Amazon Q. Furthermore, We successfully extracted sensitive user data from GitHub Copilot, including 54 real email addresses and 314 physical addresses associated with GitHub usernames. Our study also demonstrates that these code-based attack methods are effective against general-purpose LLMs, such as the GPT series, highlighting a broader security misalignment in the handling of code by modern LLMs. These findings underscore critical security challenges associated with LCCTs and suggest essential directions for strengthening their security frameworks.

<p>Abstract: While the Mamba architecture demonstrates superior inference efficiency and competitive performance on short-context natural language processing (NLP) tasks, empirical evidence suggests its capacity to comprehend long contexts is limited compared to transformer-based models. In this study, we investigate the long-context efficiency issues of the Mamba models and propose ReMamba, which enhances Mamba's ability to comprehend long contexts. ReMamba incorporates selective compression and adaptation techniques within a two-stage re-forward process, incurring minimal additional inference costs overhead.

<p>Abstract: The development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has seen significant advancements with increasing demands in various fields (e.g., multimodal agents, embodied intelligence). While model-driven approaches attempt to enhance MLLMs capabilities through diverse architectures, the gains have become increasingly marginal. Conversely, data-driven methods, which scale up image-text instruction data, are more effective but face limited data diversity and complexity challenges. The absence of high-quality data constitutes a significant development barrier for MLLMs. To address the data quality bottleneck, we propose MMEvol, a novel multimodal instruction data evolution framework. This framework iteratively improve data quality through a refined combination of fine-grained perception, cognitive reasoning, and interaction evolution, generating a more complex and diverse image-text instruction dataset that empowers MLLMs with enhanced capabilities. Beginning with an initial set of instructions, SEED-163K, we utilize MMEvol to systematically broaden the diversity of instruction types, extend visual reasoning steps to improve cognitive reasoning abilities, and thoroughly explore fine-grained information within images to enhance visual understanding and robustness. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive qualitative analysis and quantitative experiments across 13 vision-language tasks. Compared to baseline models trained with the initial seed data, the results demonstrate that our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.1 percentage points. Furthermore, our approach reaches state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in nine tasks using significantly less data compared to state-of-the-art models.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00927">Text Clustering as Classification with LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Huang, Guoxiu He</p>
<p>Abstract: Text clustering remains valuable in real-world applications where manual labeling is cost-prohibitive. It facilitates efficient organization and analysis of information by grouping similar texts based on their representations. However, implementing this approach necessitates fine-tuned embedders for downstream data and sophisticated similarity metrics. To address this issue, this study presents a novel framework for text clustering that effectively leverages the in-context learning capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs). Instead of fine-tuning embedders, we propose to transform the text clustering into a classification task via LLM. First, we prompt LLM to generate potential labels for a given dataset. Second, after integrating similar labels generated by the LLM, we prompt the LLM to assign the most appropriate label to each sample in the dataset. Our framework has been experimentally proven to achieve comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art clustering methods that employ embeddings, without requiring complex fine-tuning or clustering algorithms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eunseong Choi, Sunkyung Lee, Minjin Choi, June Park, Jongwuk Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant performance gains using advanced prompting techniques over various tasks. However, the increasing length of prompts leads to high computational costs and often obscures crucial information. Prompt compression has been proposed to alleviate these issues, but it faces challenges in (i) capturing the global context and (ii) training the compressor effectively. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel prompt compression method, namely Reading To Compressing (R2C), utilizing the Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) architecture to identify the important information in the prompt. Specifically, the cross-attention scores of the FiD are used to discern essential chunks and sentences from the prompt. R2C effectively captures the global context without compromising semantic consistency while detouring the necessity of pseudo-labels for training the compressor. Empirical results show that R2C retains key contexts, enhancing the LLM performance by 6% in out-of-domain evaluations while reducing the prompt length by 80%.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13334">BiasJailbreak:Analyzing Ethical Biases and Jailbreak Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Isack Lee, Haebin Seong</p>
<p>Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive proficiency in various tasks, they present potential safety risks, such as `jailbreaks', where malicious inputs can coerce LLMs into generating harmful content bypassing safety alignments. In this paper, we delve into the ethical biases in LLMs and examine how those biases could be exploited for jailbreaks. Notably, these biases result in a jailbreaking success rate in GPT-4o models that differs by 20\% between non-binary and cisgender keywords and by 16\% between white and black keywords, even when the other parts of the prompts are identical. We introduce the concept of BiasJailbreak, highlighting the inherent risks posed by these safety-induced biases. BiasJailbreak generates biased keywords automatically by asking the target LLM itself, and utilizes the keywords to generate harmful output. Additionally, we propose an efficient defense method BiasDefense, which prevents jailbreak attempts by injecting defense prompts prior to generation. BiasDefense stands as an appealing alternative to Guard Models, such as Llama-Guard, that require additional inference cost after text generation. Our findings emphasize that ethical biases in LLMs can actually lead to generating unsafe output, and suggest a method to make the LLMs more secure and unbiased. To enable further research and improvements, we open-source our code and artifacts of BiasJailbreak, providing the community with tools to better understand and mitigate safety-induced biases in LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling has garnered significant attention from the research community, largely due to the substantial advancements of the o1 model released by OpenAI. By allocating more computational resources during the inference phase, large language models~(LLMs) can extensively explore the solution space by generating more thought tokens or diverse solutions, thereby producing more accurate responses. However, developing an o1-like reasoning approach is challenging, and researchers have been making various attempts to advance this open area of research. In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration into enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs through reward-guided tree search algorithms. This framework is implemented by integrating the policy model, reward model, and search algorithm. It is primarily constructed around a tree search algorithm, where the policy model navigates a dynamically expanding tree guided by a specially trained reward model. The implemented framework is denoted as \textbf{STILL-1}. We thoroughly explore various design considerations necessary for implementing this framework and provide a detailed report of the technical aspects. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we focus on mathematical reasoning tasks and conduct extensive evaluations on four challenging datasets, significantly enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on developing translation models and related applications for 36 Indian languages, including Assamese, Awadhi, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Braj, Bodo, Dogri, English, Konkani, Gondi, Gujarati, Hindi, Hinglish, Ho, Kannada, Kangri, Kashmiri (Arabic and Devanagari), Khasi, Mizo, Magahi, Maithili, Malayalam, Marathi, Manipuri (Bengali and Meitei), Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Santali, Sinhala, Sindhi (Arabic and Devanagari), Tamil, Tulu, Telugu, and Urdu. Achieving this requires parallel and other types of corpora for all 36 * 36 language pairs, addressing challenges like script variations, phonetic differences, and syntactic diversity. For instance, languages like Kashmiri and Sindhi, which use multiple scripts, demand script normalization for alignment, while low-resource languages such as Khasi and Santali require synthetic data augmentation to ensure sufficient coverage and quality.
  To address these challenges, this work proposes strategies for corpus creation by leveraging existing resources, developing parallel datasets, generating domain-specific corpora, and utilizing synthetic data techniques. Additionally, it evaluates machine translation across various dimensions, including standard and discourse-level translation, domain-specific translation, reference-based and reference-free evaluation, error analysis, and automatic post-editing. By integrating these elements, the study establishes a comprehensive framework to improve machine translation quality and enable better cross-lingual communication in India's linguistically diverse ecosystem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meihao Fan, Ju Fan, Nan Tang, Lei Cao, Guoliang Li, Xiaoyong Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Answering natural language (NL) questions about tables, known as Tabular Question Answering (TQA), is crucial because it allows users to quickly and efficiently extract meaningful insights from structured data, effectively bridging the gap between human language and machine-readable formats. Many of these tables are derived from web sources or real-world scenarios, which require meticulous data preparation (or data prep) to ensure accurate responses. However, preparing such tables for NL questions introduces new requirements that extend beyond traditional data preparation. This question-aware data preparation involves specific tasks such as column augmentation and filtering tailored to particular questions, as well as question-aware value normalization or conversion, highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach in this context. Because each of the above tasks is unique, a single model (or agent) may not perform effectively across all scenarios. In this paper, we propose AutoPrep, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that leverages the strengths of multiple agents, each specialized in a certain type of data prep, ensuring more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Given an NL question over a table, AutoPrep performs data prep through three key components. Planner: Determines a logical plan, outlining a sequence of high-level operations. Programmer: Translates this logical plan into a physical plan by generating the corresponding low-level code. Executor: Executes the generated code to process the table. To support this multi-agent framework, we design a novel Chain-of-Clauses reasoning mechanism for high-level operation suggestion, and a tool-augmented method for low-level code generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samarth Goel, Reagan J. Lee, Kannan Ramchandran</p>
<p>Abstract: Embedding models are crucial for tasks in Information Retrieval (IR) and semantic similarity measurement, yet their handling of longer texts and associated positional biases remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate the impact of content position and input size on text embeddings. Our experiments reveal that embedding models, irrespective of their positional encoding mechanisms, disproportionately prioritize the beginning of an input. Ablation studies demonstrate that insertion of irrelevant text or removal at the start of a document reduces cosine similarity between altered and original embeddings by up to 12.3% more than ablations at the end. Regression analysis further confirms this bias, with sentence importance declining as position moves further from the start, even with with content-agnosticity. We hypothesize that this effect arises from pre-processing strategies and chosen positional encoding techniques. These findings quantify the sensitivity of retrieval systems and suggest a new lens towards embedding model robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in language understanding, generation, and reasoning, yet their potential in finance remains underexplored due to the complexity and specialization of financial knowledge. In this work, we report the development of the Baichuan4-Finance series, including a comprehensive suite of foundational Baichuan4-Finance-Base and an aligned language model Baichuan4-Finance, which are built upon Baichuan4-Turbo base model and tailored for finance domain. Firstly, we have dedicated significant effort to building a detailed pipeline for improving data quality. Moreover, in the continual pre-training phase, we propose a novel domain self-constraint training strategy, which enables Baichuan4-Finance-Base to acquire financial knowledge without losing general capabilities. After Supervised Fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and AI Feedback, the chat model Baichuan4-Finance is able to tackle various financial certification questions and real-world scenario applications. We evaluate Baichuan4-Finance on many widely used general datasets and two holistic financial benchmarks. The evaluation results show that Baichuan4-Finance-Base surpasses almost all competitive baselines on financial tasks by significant margins without sacrificing performance on general LLM benchmarks. At the same time, Baichuan4-Finance demonstrates even more impressive performance on financial application scenarios, showcasing its potential to foster community innovation in the financial LLM field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingxu Han, Zhenting Wang, Chunrong Fang, Shiyu Zhao, Shiqing Ma, Zhenyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning is critical for large language models (LLMs) to excel in a wide range of tasks. While methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhance LLM performance by decomposing problems into intermediate steps, they also incur significant overhead in token usage, leading to increased costs. We find that the reasoning process of current LLMs is unnecessarily lengthy and it can be compressed by including a reasonable token budget in the prompt, but the choice of token budget plays a crucial role in the actual compression effectiveness. We then propose a token-budget-aware LLM reasoning framework, which dynamically estimates token budgets for different problems based on reasoning complexity and uses the estimated token budgets to guide the reasoning process. Experiments show that our method effectively reduces token costs in CoT reasoning with only a slight performance reduction, offering a practical solution to balance efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning.

<p>Abstract: Despite recent advancements in speech processing, zero-resource speech translation (ST) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) remain challenging problems. In this work, we propose to leverage a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) to perform ST and ASR in languages for which the model has never seen paired audio-text data. We achieve this by using a pre-trained multilingual speech encoder, a multilingual LLM, and a lightweight adaptation module that maps the audio representations to the token embedding space of the LLM. We perform several experiments both in ST and ASR to understand how to best train the model and what data has the most impact on performance in previously unseen languages. In ST, our best model is capable to achieve BLEU scores over 23 in CoVoST2 for two previously unseen languages, while in ASR, we achieve WERs of up to 28.2\%. We finally show that the performance of our system is bounded by the ability of the LLM to output text in the desired language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asma Ben Abacha, Wen-wai Yim, Yujuan Fu, Zhaoyi Sun, Meliha Yetisgen, Fei Xia, Thomas Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Several studies showed that Large Language Models (LLMs) can answer medical questions correctly, even outperforming the average human score in some medical exams. However, to our knowledge, no study has been conducted to assess the ability of language models to validate existing or generated medical text for correctness and consistency. In this paper, we introduce MEDEC (https://github.com/abachaa/MEDEC), the first publicly available benchmark for medical error detection and correction in clinical notes, covering five types of errors (Diagnosis, Management, Treatment, Pharmacotherapy, and Causal Organism). MEDEC consists of 3,848 clinical texts, including 488 clinical notes from three US hospital systems that were not previously seen by any LLM. The dataset has been used for the MEDIQA-CORR shared task to evaluate seventeen participating systems [Ben Abacha et al., 2024]. In this paper, we describe the data creation methods and we evaluate recent LLMs (e.g., o1-preview, GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for the tasks of detecting and correcting medical errors requiring both medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We also conducted a comparative study where two medical doctors performed the same task on the MEDEC test set. The results showed that MEDEC is a sufficiently challenging benchmark to assess the ability of models to validate existing or generated notes and to correct medical errors. We also found that although recent LLMs have a good performance in error detection and correction, they are still outperformed by medical doctors in these tasks. We discuss the potential factors behind this gap, the insights from our experiments, the limitations of current evaluation metrics, and share potential pointers for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongjian Yue, Xinrun Xu, Xiaojun Ma, Lun Du, Zhiming Ding, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance in textual understanding and tabular reasoning tasks. However, their ability to comprehend and analyze hybrid text, containing textual and tabular data, remains unexplored. The hybrid text often appears in the form of hybrid long documents (HLDs), which far exceed the token limit of LLMs. Consequently, we apply an Automated Information Extraction framework (AIE) to enable LLMs to process the HLDs and carry out experiments to analyse four important aspects of information extraction from HLDs. Given the findings: 1) The effective way to select and summarize the useful part of a HLD. 2) An easy table serialization way is enough for LLMs to understand tables. 3) The naive AIE has adaptability in many complex scenarios. 4) The useful prompt engineering to enhance LLMs on HLDs. To address the issue of dataset scarcity in HLDs and support future work, we also propose the Financial Reports Numerical Extraction (FINE) dataset. The dataset and code are publicly available in the attachments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on generating extensive intermediate reasoning units (e.g., tokens, sentences) to enhance final answer quality across a wide range of complex tasks. While generating multiple reasoning paths or iteratively refining rationales proves effective for improving performance, these approaches inevitably result in significantly higher inference costs. In this work, we propose a novel sentence-level rationale reduction training framework that leverages likelihood-based criteria, verbosity, to identify and remove redundant reasoning sentences. Unlike previous approaches that utilize token-level reduction, our sentence-level reduction framework maintains model performance while reducing generation length. This preserves the original reasoning abilities of LLMs and achieves an average 17.15% reduction in generation costs across various models and tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anandaswarup Vadapalli</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: This work explores the use of external phrase break prediction models to enhance listener comprehension in End-to-End Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems.
  Methods: The effectiveness of these models is evaluated based on listener preferences in subjective tests. Two approaches are explored: (1) a bidirectional LSTM model with task-specific embeddings trained from scratch, and (2) a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned on phrase break prediction. Both models are trained on a multi-speaker English corpus to predict phrase break locations in text. The End-to-End TTS system used comprises a Tacotron2 model with Dynamic Convolutional Attention for mel spectrogram prediction and a WaveRNN vocoder for waveform generation.
  Results: The listening tests show a clear preference for text synthesized with predicted phrase breaks over text synthesized without them.
  Conclusion: These results confirm the value of incorporating external phrasing models within End-to-End TTS to enhance listener comprehension.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroki Furuta, Yutaka Matsuo, Aleksandra Faust, Izzeddin Gur</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model agents (LMA) recently emerged as a promising paradigm on muti-step decision making tasks, often outperforming humans and other reinforcement learning agents. Despite the promise, their performance on real-world applications that often involve combinations of tasks is still underexplored. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark, called CompWoB -- 50 new compositional web automation tasks reflecting more realistic assumptions. We show that while existing prompted LMAs (gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4) achieve 94.0% average success rate on base tasks, their performance degrades to 24.9% success rate on compositional tasks. On the other hand, transferred LMAs (finetuned only on base tasks) show less generalization gap, dropping from 85.4% to 54.8%. By balancing data distribution across tasks, we train a new model, HTML-T5++, that surpasses human-level performance (95.2%) on MiniWoB, and achieves the best zero-shot performance on CompWoB (61.5%). While these highlight the promise of small-scale finetuned and transferred models for task compositionality, their performance further degrades under different instruction compositions changing combinational order. In contrast to the recent remarkable success of LMA, our benchmark and detailed analysis emphasize the necessity of building LMAs that are robust and generalizable to task compositionality for real-world deployment.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08877">Aligning the Objective of LLM-based Program Repair</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjielong Xu, Ying Fu, Shin Hwei Tan, Pinjia He</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved decent results on automated program repair (APR). However, the next token prediction training objective of decoder-only LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) is misaligned with the masked span prediction objective of current infilling-style methods, which impedes LLMs from fully leveraging pre-trained knowledge for program repair. In addition, while some LLMs can locate and repair bugs in certain functions using the related artifacts (e.g., test cases), existing methods still depend on statement-level fault localization methods to provide a list of buggy hunks for repair. This restriction hinders LLMs from exploring potential patches beyond the given locations.
  In this paper, we investigate a new approach to adapt LLMs to program repair. Our core insight is that LLM's APR capability can be greatly improved by simply aligning the output to their training objective and allowing them to refine the whole program without first identifying faulty statements. Based on this insight, we designed D4C, a straightforward prompting framework for APR. D4C can repair 180 bugs correctly in Defects4J, with each patch being sampled only 10 times. This surpasses the SOTA APR methods with perfect fault localization by 10% and reduces the patch sampling number by 90%. Our findings reveal that (1) objective alignment is crucial for fully exploiting LLM's pre-trained capability, and (2) replacing the traditional localize-buggy-hunks-then-repair workflow with direct debugging is more effective for LLM-based APR methods. Thus, we believe this paper introduces a new mindset for harnessing LLMs in APR.</p>

<p>Abstract: The burgeoning landscape of text-to-image models, exemplified by innovations such as Midjourney and DALLE 3, has revolutionized content creation across diverse sectors. However, these advancements bring forth critical ethical concerns, particularly with the misuse of open-source models to generate content that violates societal norms. Addressing this, we introduce Ethical-Lens, a framework designed to facilitate the value-aligned usage of text-to-image tools without necessitating internal model revision. Ethical-Lens ensures value alignment in text-to-image models across toxicity and bias dimensions by refining user commands and rectifying model outputs. Systematic evaluation metrics, combining GPT4-V, HEIM, and FairFace scores, assess alignment capability. Our experiments reveal that Ethical-Lens enhances alignment capabilities to levels comparable with or superior to commercial models like DALLE 3, ensuring user-generated content adheres to ethical standards while maintaining image quality. This study indicates the potential of Ethical-Lens to ensure the sustainable development of open-source text-to-image tools and their beneficial integration into society.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haocheng Dai, Sarang Joshi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have become foundational, demonstrating remarkable success across a variety of downstream tasks. Despite their advantages, these models, akin to other foundational systems, inherit biases from the disproportionate distribution of real-world data, leading to misconceptions about the actual environment. Prevalent datasets like ImageNet are often riddled with non-causal, spurious correlations that can diminish VLM performance in scenarios where these contextual elements are absent. This study presents an investigation into how a simple linear probe can effectively distill task-specific core features from CLIP's embedding for downstream applications. Our analysis reveals that the CLIP text representations are often tainted by spurious correlations, inherited in the biased pre-training dataset. Empirical evidence suggests that relying on visual representations from CLIP, as opposed to text embedding, is more practical to refine the skewed perceptions in VLMs, emphasizing the superior utility of visual representations in overcoming embedded biases. Our codes will be available here.</p>

<p>Abstract: We encounter arguments everyday in the form of social media posts, presidential debates, news articles, and even advertisements. A ubiquitous, influential example is the opinion piece (op-ed). Opinion pieces can provide valuable perspectives, but they often represent only one side of a story, which can make readers susceptible to confirmation bias and echo chambers. Exposure to different perspectives can help readers overcome these obstacles and form more robust, nuanced views on important societal issues. We designed ArguMentor, a human-AI collaboration system that highlights claims in opinion pieces, identifies counter-arguments for them using a LLM, and generates a context-based summary of based on current events. It further enhances user understanding through additional features like a Q\&A bot (that answers user questions pertaining to the text), DebateMe (an agent that users can argue any side of the piece with) and highlighting (where users can highlight a word or passage to get its definition or context). Our evaluation on news op-eds shows that participants can generate more arguments and counter-arguments and display higher critical thinking skills after engaging with the system. Further discussion highlights a more general need for this kind of a system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Zhou, Yan Shu, Bo Zhao, Boya Wu, Zhengyang Liang, Shitao Xiao, Minghao Qin, Xi Yang, Yongping Xiong, Bo Zhang, Tiejun Huang, Zheng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The evaluation of Long Video Understanding (LVU) performance poses an important but challenging research problem. Despite previous efforts, the existing video understanding benchmarks are severely constrained by several issues, especially the insufficient lengths of videos, a lack of diversity in video types and evaluation tasks, and the inappropriateness for evaluating LVU performances. To address the above problems, we propose a new benchmark called MLVU (Multi-task Long Video Understanding Benchmark) for the comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of LVU. MLVU presents the following critical values: \textit{1)} The substantial and flexible extension of video lengths, which enables the benchmark to evaluate LVU performance across a wide range of durations. \textit{2)} The inclusion of various video genres, e.g., movies, surveillance footage, egocentric videos, cartoons, game videos, etc., which reflects the models' LVU performances in different scenarios. \textit{3)} The development of diversified evaluation tasks, which enables a comprehensive examination of MLLMs' key abilities in long-video understanding. The empirical study with 23 latest MLLMs reveals significant room for improvement in today's technique, as all existing methods struggle with most of the evaluation tasks and exhibit severe performance degradation when handling longer videos. Additionally, it suggests that factors such as context length, image-understanding ability, and the choice of LLM backbone can play critical roles in future advancements. We anticipate that MLVU will advance the research of long video understanding by providing a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiye Zhou, Shucheng Wang, Jun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the training of large language models, parameter-efficient techniques such as LoRA optimize memory usage and reduce communication overhead and memory usage during the fine-tuning phase. However, applying such techniques directly during the pre-training phase results in poor performance, primarily because the premature implementation of low-rank training significantly reduces model accuracy. Existing methods like ReLoRA and GaLore have attempted to address this challenge by updating the low-rank subspace. However, they still fall short of achieving the accuracy of full-rank training. Specifically, ReLoRA restricts the frequency of updates to preserve optimizer states consistency, hindering its ability to closely approximate full-rank training behavior. Meanwhile, GaLore relies on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to approximate the full-rank space, which introduces accuracy loss during the approximation process. In this paper, we introduce SwitchLoRA, a parameter-efficient training technique that frequently and smoothly replaces the trainable parameters of LoRA adapters with alternative parameters. SwitchLoRA updates the low-rank subspace incrementally, targeting only a few dimensions at a time to minimize the impact on optimizer states. This allows a higher update frequency, thereby enhancing accuracy by enabling the updated parameters to more closely mimic full-rank behavior during the pre-training phase. Our results demonstrate that SwitchLoRA actually surpasses full-rank training, reducing perplexity from 15.23 to 15.01 on the LLaMA 1.3B model, while also cutting communication overhead by 54\% and memory usage by 13\%. Furthermore, after full fine-tuning the SwitchLoRA pre-trained model and the full-rank pre-trained model on the GLUE benchmark, the SwitchLoRA pre-trained model showed an average accuracy gain of about 1\% over the full-rank pre-trained model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanzeng Xia, Hao Liu, Yisong Yue, Tongxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is a frontier paradigm for solving reinforcement learning problems in the foundation model era. While ICRL capabilities have been demonstrated in transformers through task-specific training, the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box remains largely unexplored. Recent findings highlight that LLMs often face challenges when dealing with numerical contexts, and limited attention has been paid to evaluating their performance through preference feedback generated by the environment. This paper is the first to investigate LLMs as in-context decision-makers under the problem of Dueling Bandits (DB), a stateless preference-based reinforcement learning setting that extends the classic Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model by querying for preference feedback. We compare GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and o1-Preview against nine well-established DB algorithms. Our results reveal that our top-performing LLM, GPT-4 Turbo, has the zero-shot relative decision-making ability to achieve surprisingly low weak regret across all the DB environment instances by quickly including the best arm in duels. However, an optimality gap exists between LLMs and classic DB algorithms in terms of strong regret. LLMs struggle to converge and consistently exploit even when explicitly prompted to do so, and are sensitive to prompt variations. To bridge this gap, we propose an agentic flow framework: LLM with Enhanced Algorithmic Dueling (LEAD), which integrates off-the-shelf DB algorithms with LLM agents through fine-grained adaptive interplay. We show that LEAD has theoretical guarantees inherited from classic DB algorithms on both weak and strong regret. We validate its efficacy and robustness even with noisy and adversarial prompts. The design of our framework sheds light on how to enhance the trustworthiness of LLMs used for in-context decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeong Hun Yeo, Chae Won Kim, Hyunjun Kim, Hyeongseop Rha, Seunghee Han, Wen-Huang Cheng, Yong Man Ro</p>
<p>Abstract: Lip reading aims to predict spoken language by analyzing lip movements. Despite advancements in lip reading technologies, performance degrades when models are applied to unseen speakers due to their sensitivity to variations in visual information such as lip appearances. To address this challenge, speaker adaptive lip reading technologies have advanced by focusing on effectively adapting a lip reading model to target speakers in the visual modality. However, the effectiveness of adapting language information, such as vocabulary choice, of the target speaker has not been explored in previous works. Additionally, existing datasets for speaker adaptation have limited vocabulary sizes and pose variations, which restrict the validation of previous speaker-adaptive methods in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel speaker-adaptive lip reading method that adapts a pre-trained model to target speakers at both vision and language levels. Specifically, we integrate prompt tuning and the LoRA approach, applying them to a pre-trained lip reading model to effectively adapt the model to target speakers. Furthermore, to validate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, we introduce a new dataset, VoxLRS-SA, derived from VoxCeleb2 and LRS3. It contains a vocabulary of approximately 100K words, offers diverse pose variations, and enables the validation of adaptation methods in the wild, sentence-level lip reading for the first time in English. Through various experiments, we demonstrate that the existing speaker-adaptive method also improves performance in the wild at the sentence level. Moreover, we show that the proposed method achieves larger improvements compared to the previous works.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516">RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector Retrieval</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly important. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of attention computation, scaling LLMs to longer contexts incurs extremely slow inference speed and high GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both accelerate attention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By leveraging the dynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention proposes to build approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieve the most relevant ones through vector search during generation. Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS indexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in the attention mechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of query vectors. Our evaluation demonstrates that RetrievalAttention achieves near full attention accuracy while only requiring access to 1--3% of the data. This leads to a significant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs, with a much lower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) to serve 128K tokens for LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapid developments of AI tools are expected to offer unprecedented assistance to the research of natural science including chemistry. However, neither existing unimodal task-specific specialist models nor emerging general large multimodal models (LMM) can cover the wide range of chemical data modality and task categories. To address the real demands of chemists, a cross-modal Chemical General Intelligence (CGI) system, which serves as a truly practical and useful research assistant utilizing the great potential of LMMs, is in great need. In this work, we introduce the first Cross-modal Dialogue Foundation Model for Chemistry (ChemDFM-X). Diverse multimodal data are generated from an initial modality by approximate calculations and task-specific model predictions. This strategy creates sufficient chemical training corpora, while significantly reducing excessive expense, resulting in an instruction-tuning dataset containing 7.6M data. After instruction finetuning, ChemDFM-X is evaluated on extensive experiments of different chemical tasks with various data modalities. The results demonstrate the capacity of ChemDFM-X for multimodal and inter-modal knowledge comprehension. ChemDFM-X marks a significant milestone toward aligning all modalities in chemistry, a step closer to CGI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting Liu, Zunnan Xu, Yue Hu, Liangtao Shi, Zhiqiang Wang, Quanjun Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), which aims to ground a local visual region via natural language, is a task that heavily relies on multimodal alignment. Most existing methods utilize powerful pre-trained models to transfer visual/linguistic knowledge by full fine-tuning. However, full fine-tuning the entire backbone not only breaks the rich prior knowledge embedded in the pre-training, but also incurs significant computational costs. Motivated by the recent emergence of Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) methods, we aim to solve the REC task in an effective and efficient manner. Directly applying these PETL methods to the REC task is inappropriate, as they lack the specific-domain abilities for precise local visual perception and visual-language alignment. Therefore, we propose a novel framework of Multimodal Prior-guided Parameter Efficient Tuning, namely MaPPER. Specifically, MaPPER comprises Dynamic Prior Adapters guided by an aligned prior, and Local Convolution Adapters to extract precise local semantics for better visual perception. Moreover, the Prior-Guided Text module is proposed to further utilize the prior for facilitating the cross-modal alignment. Experimental results on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that MaPPER achieves the best accuracy compared to the full fine-tuning and other PETL methods with only 1.41% tunable backbone parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyan Jiang, Rui Meng, Xinyi Yang, Semih Yavuz, Yingbo Zhou, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in developing universal text embedding models that can generalize across tasks (e.g., MTEB). However, progress in learning universal multimodal embedding models has been relatively slow despite its importance and practicality. In this work, we aim to explore the potential for building universal embeddings capable of handling a wide range of downstream tasks. Our contributions are twofold: (1) MMEB (Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark), which covers 4 meta-tasks (i.e. classification, visual question answering, multimodal retrieval, and visual grounding) and 36 datasets, including 20 training and 16 evaluation datasets covering both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, and (2) VLM2Vec (Vision-Language Model -> Vector), a contrastive training framework that converts any state-of-the-art vision-language model into an embedding model via training on MMEB. Unlike previous models such as CLIP and BLIP, which encodes text or images independently without any task instruction, VLM2Vec can process any combination of images and text to generate a fixed-dimensional vector based on task instructions. We build a series of VLM2Vec models on SoTA VLMs like Phi-3.5-V, LLaVA-1.6 and evaluate them on MMEB's evaluation split. Our results show that VLM2Vec achieves an absolute average improvement of 10% to 20% over existing multimodal embedding models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets in MMEB. We show that VLMs are secretly strong embedding models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haochen Wang, Anlin Zheng, Yucheng Zhao, Tiancai Wang, Zheng Ge, Xiangyu Zhang, Zhaoxiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces reconstructive visual instruction tuning (ROSS), a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that exploit vision-centric supervision signals. In contrast to conventional visual instruction tuning approaches that exclusively supervise text outputs, ROSS prompts LMMs to supervise visual outputs via reconstructing input images. By doing so, it capitalizes on the inherent richness and detail present within input images themselves, which are often lost in pure text supervision. However, producing meaningful feedback from natural images is challenging due to the heavy spatial redundancy of visual signals. To address this issue, ROSS employs a denoising objective to reconstruct latent representations of input images, avoiding directly regressing exact raw RGB values. This intrinsic activation design inherently encourages LMMs to maintain image detail, thereby enhancing their fine-grained comprehension capabilities and reducing hallucinations. Empirically, ROSS consistently brings significant improvements across different visual encoders and language models. In comparison with extrinsic assistance state-of-the-art alternatives that aggregate multiple visual experts, ROSS delivers competitive performance with a single SigLIP visual encoder, demonstrating the efficacy of our vision-centric supervision tailored for visual outputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erik Arakelyan, Pasquale Minervini, Pat Verga, Patrick Lewis, Isabelle Augenstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern Question Answering (QA) and Reasoning approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) commonly use prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), assuming the resulting generation will have a more granular exploration and reasoning over the question space and scope. However, such methods struggle with generating outputs that are faithful to the intermediate chain of reasoning produced by the model. On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high degree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code generation and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise strictly. We introduce $\textbf{F}$aithful $\textbf{L}$ogic-$\textbf{A}$ided $\textbf{R}$easoning and $\textbf{E}$xploration ($\textbf{FLARE}$), a novel interpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task decompositions. We use the LLM to plan a solution, soft-formalise the query into facts and predicates using a logic programming code and simulate that code execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search over the defined space. Our method allows us to compute the faithfulness of the reasoning process w.r.t. the generated code and analyse the steps of the multi-hop search without relying on external solvers. Our methods achieve SOTA results on $\mathbf{7}$ out of $\mathbf{9}$ diverse reasoning benchmarks. We also show that model faithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further demonstrate that $\textbf{FLARE}$ allows pinpointing the decisive factors sufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during the multi-hop search.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chun-Yi Kuan, Hung-yi Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs) have shown impressive capabilities in understanding and reasoning about audio and speech information. However, these models still face challenges, including hallucinating non-existent sound events, misidentifying the order of sound events, and incorrectly attributing sound sources, which undermine their reliability and real-world application. To systematically evaluate these issues, we propose three distinct tasks: object existence, temporal order, and object attribute within audio. These tasks assess the models' comprehension of critical audio information aspects. Our experimental results reveal limitations in these fundamental tasks, underscoring the need for better models in recognizing specific sound events, determining event sequences, and identifying sound sources. To improve performance in these areas, we introduce a multi-turn chain-of-thought approach, which demonstrates significantly improved model performance across the proposed tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinrui He, Yikun Ban, Jiaru Zou, Tianxin Wei, Curtiss B. Cook, Jingrui He</p>
<p>Abstract: Missing data imputation is a critical challenge in various domains, such as healthcare and finance, where data completeness is vital for accurate analysis. Large language models (LLMs), trained on vast corpora, have shown strong potential in data generation, making them a promising tool for data imputation. However, challenges persist in designing effective prompts for a finetuning-free process and in mitigating the risk of LLM hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, LLM-Forest, which introduces a "forest" of few-shot learning LLM "trees" with confidence-based weighted voting, inspired by ensemble learning (Random Forest). This framework is established on a new concept of bipartite information graphs to identify high-quality relevant neighboring entries with both feature and value granularity. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM-Forest.</p>

<p>Abstract: L-systems can be made to model and create simulations of many biological processes, such as plant development. Finding an L-system for a given process is typically solved by hand, by experts, in a massively time-consuming process. It would be significant if this could be done automatically from data, such as from sequences of images. In this paper, we are interested in inferring a particular type of L-system, deterministic context-free L-system (D0L-system) from a sequence of strings. We introduce the characteristic graph of a sequence of strings, which we then utilize to translate our problem (inferring D0L-system) in polynomial time into the maximum independent set problem (MIS) and the SAT problem. After that, we offer a classical exact algorithm and an approximate quantum algorithm for the problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Do June Min, Karel Mundnich, Andy Lapastora, Erfan Soltanmohammadi, Srikanth Ronanki, Kyu Han</p>
<p>Abstract: One common approach for question answering over speech data is to first transcribe speech using automatic speech recognition (ASR) and then employ text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on the transcriptions. While this cascaded pipeline has proven effective in many practical settings, ASR errors can propagate to the retrieval and generation steps. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SpeechRAG, a novel framework designed for open-question answering over spoken data. Our proposed approach fine-tunes a pre-trained speech encoder into a speech adapter fed into a frozen large language model (LLM)--based retrieval model. By aligning the embedding spaces of text and speech, our speech retriever directly retrieves audio passages from text-based queries, leveraging the retrieval capacity of the frozen text retriever. Our retrieval experiments on spoken question answering datasets show that direct speech retrieval does not degrade over the text-based baseline, and outperforms the cascaded systems using ASR. For generation, we use a speech language model (SLM) as a generator, conditioned on audio passages rather than transcripts. Without fine-tuning of the SLM, this approach outperforms cascaded text-based models when there is high WER in the transcripts.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces text2midi, an end-to-end model to generate MIDI files from textual descriptions. Leveraging the growing popularity of multimodal generative approaches, text2midi capitalizes on the extensive availability of textual data and the success of large language models (LLMs). Our end-to-end system harnesses the power of LLMs to generate symbolic music in the form of MIDI files. Specifically, we utilize a pretrained LLM encoder to process captions, which then condition an autoregressive transformer decoder to produce MIDI sequences that accurately reflect the provided descriptions. This intuitive and user-friendly method significantly streamlines the music creation process by allowing users to generate music pieces using text prompts. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations, incorporating both automated and human studies, that show our model generates MIDI files of high quality that are indeed controllable by text captions that may include music theory terms such as chords, keys, and tempo. We release the code and music samples on our demo page (https://github.com/AMAAI-Lab/Text2midi) for users to interact with text2midi.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence-based language generators are now a part of most people's lives. However, by default, they tend to generate "average" language without reflecting the ways in which people differ. Here, we propose a lightweight modification to the standard language model transformer architecture - "PsychAdapter" - that uses empirically derived trait-language patterns to generate natural language for specified personality, demographic, and mental health characteristics (with or without prompting). We applied PsychAdapters to modify OpenAI's GPT-2, Google's Gemma, and Meta's Llama 3 and found generated text to reflect the desired traits. For example, expert raters evaluated PsychAdapter's generated text output and found it matched intended trait levels with 87.3% average accuracy for Big Five personalities, and 96.7% for depression and life satisfaction. PsychAdapter is a novel method to introduce psychological behavior patterns into language models at the foundation level, independent of prompting, by influencing every transformer layer. This approach can create chatbots with specific personality profiles, clinical training tools that mirror language associated with psychological conditionals, and machine translations that match an authors reading or education level without taking up LLM context windows. PsychAdapter also allows for the exploration psychological constructs through natural language expression, extending the natural language processing toolkit to study human psychology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifang Chen, Jiayan Huo, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) mechanism has become a powerful enhancement to the Transformer architecture, which enables models to capture token relationships when encoding positional information. However, the RoPE mechanisms make the computations of attention mechanisms more complicated, which makes efficient algorithms challenging. Earlier research introduced almost linear time, i.e., $n^{1+o(1)}$ where $n$ is the number of input tokens, algorithms for the forward computation under specific parameter settings. However, achieving a subquadratic time algorithm for other parameter regimes remains impossible unless the widely accepted Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is disproven. In this work, we develop the first almost linear time algorithm for backward computations in the RoPE-based attention under bounded entries. Our approach builds on recent advancements in fast RoPE attention computations, utilizing a novel combination of the polynomial method and the Fast Fourier Transform. Furthermore, we show that with lower bounds derived from the SETH, the bounded entry condition is necessary for subquadratic performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ermo Hua, Che Jiang, Xingtai Lv, Kaiyan Zhang, Ning Ding, Youbang Sun, Biqing Qi, Yuchen Fan, Xuekai Zhu, Bowen Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Extending the context length of Language Models (LMs) by improving Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has become a trend. While existing works mainly address RoPE's limitations within attention mechanism, this paper provides an analysis across nearly all parts of LMs, uncovering their adverse effects on length generalization for RoPE-based attention. Using Discrete Signal Processing theory, we show that RoPE enables periodic attention by implicitly achieving Non-Uniform Discrete Fourier Transform. However, this periodicity is undermined by the spectral damage caused by: 1) linear layers and activation functions outside of attention; 2) insufficiently trained frequency components brought by time-domain truncation. Building on our observations, we propose Fourier Position Embedding (FoPE), which enhances attention's frequency-domain properties to improve both its periodic extension and length generalization. FoPE constructs Fourier Series and zero-outs the destructive frequency components, increasing model robustness against the spectrum damage. Experiments across various model scales show that, within varying context windows, FoPE can maintain a more stable perplexity and a more consistent accuracy in a needle-in-haystack task compared to RoPE and ALiBi. Several analyses and ablations bring further support to our method and theoretical modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic Video Dubbing (AVD) generates speech aligned with lip motion and facial emotion from scripts. Recent research focuses on modeling multimodal context to enhance prosody expressiveness but overlooks two key issues: 1) Multiscale prosody expression attributes in the context influence the current sentence's prosody. 2) Prosody cues in context interact with the current sentence, impacting the final prosody expressiveness. To tackle these challenges, we propose M2CI-Dubber, a Multiscale Multimodal Context Interaction scheme for AVD. This scheme includes two shared M2CI encoders to model the multiscale multimodal context and facilitate its deep interaction with the current sentence. By extracting global and local features for each modality in the context, utilizing attention-based mechanisms for aggregation and interaction, and employing an interaction-based graph attention network for fusion, the proposed approach enhances the prosody expressiveness of synthesized speech for the current sentence. Experiments on the Chem dataset show our model outperforms baselines in dubbing expressiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaojian Yu, Yilun Zhao, Arman Cohan, Xiao-Ping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce self-invoking code generation, a new task designed to evaluate the progressive reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. In this task, models are presented with a base problem and a related, more complex problem. They must solve the base problem and then utilize its solution to address the more complex one. This work features three key contributions. First, we propose a general recipe for generating more challenging versions of existing benchmarks, resulting in three new benchmarks: HumanEval Pro, MBPP Pro, and BigCodeBench-Lite Pro, specifically designed to assess LLMs on self-invoking code generation. Second, from the analysis of experimental results over twenty LLMs on our benchmarks, we have two important observations: (i) Most LLMs excel in traditional code generation benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP, but their performance declines on self-invoking tasks. For example, o1-mini achieves 96.2% pass@1 on HumanEval but only 76.2% on HumanEval Pro. (ii) On self-invoking code generation task, the instruction-tuned models demonstrate only marginal improvements compared to the base models. Third, we disclose the types of failure modes that exist in our evaluation results. All these results underscore the need for further advancements in self-invoking code generation tasks and provide a new direction for future research on enhancing LLMs' code reasoning capabilities.</p>
