<p><b>Authors:</b> Kongyang Chen, Dongping zhang, Yaping Chai, Weibin Zhang, Shaowei Wang, Jiaxing Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has spurred the widespread adoption of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) in various daily life domains. Federated Learning (FL) is frequently utilized to build a global HAR model by aggregating user contributions without transmitting raw individual data. Despite substantial progress in user privacy protection with FL, challenges persist. Regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) empower users to request data removal, raising a new query in FL: How can a HAR client request data removal without compromising other clients' privacy? In response, we propose a lightweight machine unlearning method for refining the FL HAR model by selectively removing a portion of a client's training data. Our method employs a third-party dataset unrelated to model training. Using KL divergence as a loss function for fine-tuning, we aim to align the predicted probability distribution on forgotten data with the third-party dataset. Additionally, we introduce a membership inference evaluation method to assess unlearning effectiveness. Experimental results across diverse datasets show our method achieves unlearning accuracy comparable to \textit{retraining} methods, resulting in speedups ranging from hundreds to thousands.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xia Chen, Alexander Rex, Janis Woelke, Christoph Eckert, Boris Bensmann, Richard Hanke-Rauschenbach, Philipp Geyer</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we propose to adopt a novel framework, Knowledge-integrated Machine Learning, for advancing Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis (PEMWE) development. Given the significance of PEMWE in green hydrogen production and the inherent challenges in optimizing its performance, our framework aims to meld data-driven models with domain-specific insights systematically to address the domain challenges. We first identify the uncertainties originating from data acquisition conditions, data-driven model mechanisms, and domain expertise, highlighting their complementary characteristics in carrying information from different perspectives. Building upon this foundation, we showcase how to adeptly decompose knowledge and extract unique information to contribute to the data augmentation, modeling process, and knowledge discovery. We demonstrate a hierarchical three-level framework, termed the "Ladder of Knowledge-integrated Machine Learning", in the PEMWE context, applying it to three case studies within a context of cell degradation analysis to affirm its efficacy in interpolation, extrapolation, and information representation. This research lays the groundwork for more knowledge-informed enhancements in ML applications in engineering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher J. Banks, Aeron Sanchez, Vicki Stewart, Kate Bowen, Graham Smith, Rowland R. Kao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diagnostic tests which can detect pre-clinical or sub-clinical infection, are one of the most powerful tools in our armoury of weapons to control infectious diseases. Considerable effort has been therefore paid to improving diagnostic testing for human, plant and animal diseases, including strategies for targeting the use of diagnostic tests towards individuals who are more likely to be infected. Here, we follow other recent proposals to further refine this concept, by using machine learning to assess the situational risk under which a diagnostic test is applied to augment its interpretation . We develop this to predict the occurrence of breakdowns of cattle herds due to bovine tuberculosis, exploiting the availability of exceptionally detailed testing records. We show that, without compromising test specificity, test sensitivity can be improved so that the proportion of infected herds detected by the skin test, improves by over 16 percentage points. While many risk factors are associated with increased risk of becoming infected, of note are several factors which suggest that, in some herds there is a higher risk of infection going undetected, including effects that are correlated to the veterinary practice conducting the test, and number of livestock moved off the herd.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanishk Gandhi, Denise Lee, Gabriel Grand, Muxin Liu, Winson Cheng, Archit Sharma, Noah D. Goodman</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models are rarely shown fruitful mistakes while training. They then struggle to look beyond the next token, suffering from a snowballing of errors and struggling to predict the consequence of their actions several steps ahead. In this paper, we show how language models can be taught to search by representing the process of search in language, as a flattened string -- a stream of search (SoS). We propose a unified language for search that captures an array of different symbolic search strategies. We demonstrate our approach using the simple yet difficult game of Countdown, where the goal is to combine input numbers with arithmetic operations to reach a target number. We pretrain a transformer-based language model from scratch on a dataset of streams of search generated by heuristic solvers. We find that SoS pretraining increases search accuracy by 25% over models trained to predict only the optimal search trajectory. We further finetune this model with two policy improvement methods: Advantage-Induced Policy Alignment (APA) and Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR). The finetuned SoS models solve 36% of previously unsolved problems, including problems that cannot be solved by any of the heuristic solvers. Our results indicate that language models can learn to solve problems via search, self-improve to flexibly use different search strategies, and potentially discover new ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohan Biswas, Kasturi Ganguly, Arijit Das, Diganta Saha</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's digital world, cyberbullying is a serious problem that can harm the mental and physical health of people who use social media. This paper explains just how serious cyberbullying is and how it really affects indi-viduals exposed to it. It also stresses how important it is to find better ways to detect cyberbullying so that online spaces can be safer. Plus, it talks about how making more accurate tools to spot cyberbullying will be really helpful in the future. Our paper introduces a deep learning-based ap-proach, primarily employing BERT and BiLSTM architectures, to effective-ly address cyberbullying. This approach is designed to analyse large vol-umes of posts and predict potential instances of cyberbullying in online spaces. Our results demonstrate the superiority of the hateBERT model, an extension of BERT focused on hate speech detection, among the five mod-els, achieving an accuracy rate of 89.16%. This research is a significant con-tribution to "Computational Intelligence for Social Transformation," prom-ising a safer and more inclusive digital landscape.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhananjay Saikumar, Blesson Varghese</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) consist of millions of parameters, necessitating high-performance computing during training and inference. Pruning is one solution that significantly reduces the space and time complexities of DNNs. Traditional pruning methods that are applied post-training focus on streamlining inference, but there are recent efforts to leverage sparsity early on by pruning before training. Pruning methods, such as iterative magnitude-based pruning (IMP) achieve up to a 90% parameter reduction while retaining accuracy comparable to the original model. However, this leads to impractical runtime as it relies on multiple train-prune-reset cycles to identify and eliminate redundant parameters. In contrast, training agnostic early pruning methods, such as SNIP and SynFlow offer fast pruning but fall short of the accuracy achieved by IMP at high sparsities. To bridge this gap, we present Dual Gradient-Based Rapid Iterative Pruning (DRIVE), which leverages dense training for initial epochs to counteract the randomness inherent at the initialization. Subsequently, it employs a unique dual gradient-based metric for parameter ranking. It has been experimentally demonstrated for VGG and ResNet architectures on CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny ImageNet, and ResNet on ImageNet that DRIVE consistently has superior performance over other training-agnostic early pruning methods in accuracy. Notably, DRIVE is 43$\times$ to 869$\times$ faster than IMP for pruning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weichao Lan, Yiu-ming Cheung, Qing Xu, Buhua Liu, Zhikai Hu, Mengke Li, Zhenghua Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has become a widely used technique in the field of model compression, which aims to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a lightweight student model for efficient network development. In addition to the supervision of ground truth, the vanilla KD method regards the predictions of the teacher as soft labels to supervise the training of the student model. Based on vanilla KD, various approaches have been developed to further improve the performance of the student model. However, few of these previous methods have considered the reliability of the supervision from teacher models. Supervision from erroneous predictions may mislead the training of the student model. This paper therefore proposes to tackle this problem from two aspects: Label Revision to rectify the incorrect supervision and Data Selection to select appropriate samples for distillation to reduce the impact of erroneous supervision. In the former, we propose to rectify the teacher's inaccurate predictions using the ground truth. In the latter, we introduce a data selection technique to choose suitable training samples to be supervised by the teacher, thereby reducing the impact of incorrect predictions to some extent. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and show that our method can be combined with other distillation approaches, improving their performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabiana Ferracina, Bala Krishnamoorthy, Mahantesh Halappanavar, Shengwei Hu, Vidyasagar Sathuvalli</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the application of machine learning algorithms to predict the suitability of Russet potato clones for advancement in breeding trials. Leveraging data from manually collected trials in the state of Oregon, we investigate the potential of a wide variety of state-of-the-art binary classification models. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset that includes preprocessing, feature engineering, and imputation to address missing values. We focus on several key metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) for model evaluation. The top-performing models, namely the multi-layer perceptron (MLPC), histogram-based gradient boosting classifier (HGBC), and a support vector machine (SVC), demonstrate consistent and significant results. Variable selection further enhances model performance and identifies influential features in predicting trial outcomes. The findings emphasize the potential of machine learning in streamlining the selection process for potato varieties, offering benefits such as increased efficiency, substantial cost savings, and judicious resource utilization. Our study contributes insights into precision agriculture and showcases the relevance of advanced technologies for informed decision-making in breeding programs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingxiang Liu, Sheng Sun, Yuxuan Liang, Jingjing Xue, Min Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The existing federated learning (FL) methods for spatio-temporal forecasting fail to capture the inherent spatio-temporal heterogeneity, which calls for personalized FL (PFL) methods to model the spatio-temporally variant patterns. While contrastive learning approach is promising in addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity, the existing methods are noneffective in determining negative pairs and can hardly apply to PFL paradigm. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel PFL method, named Federated dUal sEmantic aLignment-based contraStive learning (FUELS), which can adaptively align positive and negative pairs based on semantic similarity, thereby injecting precise spatio-temporal heterogeneity into the latent representation space by auxiliary contrastive tasks. From temporal perspective, a hard negative filtering module is introduced to dynamically align heterogeneous temporal representations for the supplemented intra-client contrastive task. From spatial perspective, we design lightweight-but-efficient prototypes as client-level semantic representations, based on which the server evaluates spatial similarity and yields client-customized global prototypes for the supplemented inter-client contrastive task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FUELS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with communication cost decreasing by around 94%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis Sigcha, Luigi Borz\`i, Ignacio Pav\'on, N\'elson Costa, Susana Costa, Pedro Arezes, Juan-Manuel L\'opez, Guillermo De Arcas</p>
<p>Abstract: Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the most incapacitating symptoms in Parkinsons disease, affecting more than 50 percent of patients in advanced stages of the disease. The presence of FOG may lead to falls and a loss of independence with a consequent reduction in the quality of life. Wearable technology and artificial intelligence have been used for automatic FOG detection to optimize monitoring. However, differences between laboratory and daily-life conditions present challenges for the implementation of reliable detection systems. Consequently, improvement of FOG detection methods remains important to provide accurate monitoring mechanisms intended for free-living and real-time use. This paper presents advances in automatic FOG detection using a single body-worn triaxial accelerometer and a novel classification algorithm based on Transformers and convolutional networks. This study was performed with data from 21 patients who manifested FOG episodes while performing activities of daily living in a home setting. Results indicate that the proposed FOG-Transformer can bring a significant improvement in FOG detection using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO CV). These results bring opportunities for the implementation of accurate monitoring systems for use in ambulatory or home settings.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03707">Investigating the Robustness of Counterfactual Learning to Rank Models: A Reproducibility Study</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zechun Niu, Jiaxin Mao, Qingyao Ai, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR) has attracted extensive attention in the IR community for its ability to leverage massive logged user interaction data to train ranking models. While the CLTR models can be theoretically unbiased when the user behavior assumption is correct and the propensity estimation is accurate, their effectiveness is usually empirically evaluated via simulation-based experiments due to a lack of widely-available, large-scale, real click logs. However, the mainstream simulation-based experiments are somewhat limited as they often feature a single, deterministic production ranker and simplified user simulation models to generate the synthetic click logs. As a result, the robustness of CLTR models in complex and diverse situations is largely unknown and needs further investigation.
  To address this problem, in this paper, we aim to investigate the robustness of existing CLTR models in a reproducibility study with extensive simulation-based experiments that (1) use both deterministic and stochastic production rankers, each with different ranking performance, and (2) leverage multiple user simulation models with different user behavior assumptions. We find that the DLA models and IPS-DCM show better robustness under various simulation settings than IPS-PBM and PRS with offline propensity estimation. Besides, the existing CLTR models often fail to outperform the naive click baselines when the production ranker has relatively high ranking performance or certain randomness, which suggests an urgent need for developing new CLTR algorithms that work for these settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Urban air mobility is an innovative mode of transportation in which electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles operate between nodes called vertiports. We outline a self-organized vertiport arrival system based on deep reinforcement learning. The airspace around the vertiport is assumed to be circular, and the vehicles can freely operate inside. Each aircraft is considered an individual agent and follows a shared policy, resulting in decentralized actions that are based on local information. We investigate the development of the reinforcement learning policy during training and illustrate how the algorithm moves from suboptimal local holding patterns to a safe and efficient final policy. The latter is validated in simulation-based scenarios and also deployed on small-scale unmanned aerial vehicles to showcase its real-world usability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angus Nicolson, Lisa Schut, J. Alison Noble, Yarin Gal</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent interpretability methods propose using concept-based explanations to translate the internal representations of deep learning models into a language that humans are familiar with: concepts. This requires understanding which concepts are present in the representation space of a neural network. One popular method for finding concepts is Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), which are learnt using a probe dataset of concept exemplars. In this work, we investigate three properties of CAVs. CAVs may be: (1) inconsistent between layers, (2) entangled with different concepts, and (3) spatially dependent. Each property provides both challenges and opportunities in interpreting models. We introduce tools designed to detect the presence of these properties, provide insight into how they affect the derived explanations, and provide recommendations to minimise their impact. Understanding these properties can be used to our advantage. For example, we introduce spatially dependent CAVs to test if a model is translation invariant with respect to a specific concept and class. Our experiments are performed on ImageNet and a new synthetic dataset, Elements. Elements is designed to capture a known ground truth relationship between concepts and classes. We release this dataset to facilitate further research in understanding and evaluating interpretability methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03715">Direct Nash Optimization: Teaching Language Models to Self-Improve with General Preferences</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Corby Rosset, Ching-An Cheng, Arindam Mitra, Michael Santacroce, Ahmed Awadallah, Tengyang Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies post-training large language models (LLMs) using preference feedback from a powerful oracle to help a model iteratively improve over itself. The typical approach for post-training LLMs involves Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which traditionally separates reward learning and subsequent policy optimization. However, such a reward maximization approach is limited by the nature of "point-wise" rewards (such as Bradley-Terry model), which fails to express complex intransitive or cyclic preference relations. While advances on RLHF show reward learning and policy optimization can be merged into a single contrastive objective for stability, they yet still remain tethered to the reward maximization framework. Recently, a new wave of research sidesteps the reward maximization presumptions in favor of directly optimizing over "pair-wise" or general preferences. In this paper, we introduce Direct Nash Optimization (DNO), a provable and scalable algorithm that marries the simplicity and stability of contrastive learning with theoretical generality from optimizing general preferences. Because DNO is a batched on-policy algorithm using a regression-based objective, its implementation is straightforward and efficient. Moreover, DNO enjoys monotonic improvement across iterations that help it improve even over a strong teacher (such as GPT-4). In our experiments, a resulting 7B parameter Orca-2.5 model aligned by DNO achieves the state-of-the-art win-rate against GPT-4-Turbo of 33% on AlpacaEval 2.0 (even after controlling for response length), an absolute gain of 26% (7% to 33%) over the initializing model. It outperforms models with far more parameters, including Mistral Large, Self-Rewarding LM (70B parameters), and older versions of GPT-4.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ege C. Kaya, Abolfazl Hashemi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we approach the problem of multi-task submodular optimization with the perspective of local distributional robustness, within the neighborhood of a reference distribution which assigns an importance score to each task. We initially propose to introduce a regularization term which makes use of the relative entropy to the standard multi-task objective. We then demonstrate through duality that this novel formulation itself is equivalent to the maximization of a submodular function, which may be efficiently carried out through standard greedy selection methods. This approach bridges the existing gap in the optimization of performance-robustness trade-offs in multi-task subset selection. To numerically validate our theoretical results, we test the proposed method in two different setting, one involving the selection of satellites in low Earth orbit constellations in the context of a sensor selection problem, and the other involving an image summarization task using neural networks. Our method is compared with two other algorithms focused on optimizing the performance of the worst-case task, and on directly optimizing the performance on the reference distribution itself. We conclude that our novel formulation produces a solution that is locally distributional robust, and computationally inexpensive.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruqian Zhang, Yijiao Zhang, Annie Qu, Zhongyi Zhu, Juan Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: The popularity of transfer learning stems from the fact that it can borrow information from useful auxiliary datasets. Existing statistical transfer learning methods usually adopt a global similarity measure between the source data and the target data, which may lead to inefficiency when only local information is shared. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian transfer learning method named "CONCERT" to allow robust local information transfer for high-dimensional data analysis. A novel conditional spike-and-slab prior is introduced in the joint distribution of target and source parameters for information transfer. By incorporating covariate-specific priors, we can characterize the local similarities and make the sources work collaboratively to help improve the performance on the target. Distinguished from existing work, CONCERT is a one-step procedure, which achieves variable selection and information transfer simultaneously. Variable selection consistency is established for our CONCERT. To make our algorithm scalable, we adopt the variational Bayes framework to facilitate implementation. Extensive experiments and a genetic data analysis demonstrate the validity and the advantage of CONCERT over existing cutting-edge transfer learning methods. We also extend our CONCERT to the logistical models with numerical studies showing its superiority over other methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03774">Exploration is Harder than Prediction: Cryptographically Separating Reinforcement Learning from Supervised Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Noah Golowich, Ankur Moitra, Dhruv Rohatgi</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised learning is often computationally easy in practice. But to what extent does this mean that other modes of learning, such as reinforcement learning (RL), ought to be computationally easy by extension? In this work we show the first cryptographic separation between RL and supervised learning, by exhibiting a class of block MDPs and associated decoding functions where reward-free exploration is provably computationally harder than the associated regression problem. We also show that there is no computationally efficient algorithm for reward-directed RL in block MDPs, even when given access to an oracle for this regression problem.
  It is known that being able to perform regression in block MDPs is necessary for finding a good policy; our results suggest that it is not sufficient. Our separation lower bound uses a new robustness property of the Learning Parities with Noise (LPN) hardness assumption, which is crucial in handling the dependent nature of RL data. We argue that separations and oracle lower bounds, such as ours, are a more meaningful way to prove hardness of learning because the constructions better reflect the practical reality that supervised learning by itself is often not the computational bottleneck.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anli du Preez, Peter A. Beling, Tyler Cody</p>
<p>Abstract: The machine learning formulation of online learning is incomplete from a systems theoretic perspective. Typically, machine learning research emphasizes domains and tasks, and a problem solving worldview. It focuses on algorithm parameters, features, and samples, and neglects the perspective offered by considering system structure and system behavior or dynamics. Online learning is an active field of research and has been widely explored in terms of statistical theory and computational algorithms, however, in general, the literature still lacks formal system theoretical frameworks for modeling online learning systems and resolving systems-related concept drift issues. Furthermore, while the machine learning formulation serves to classify methods and literature, the systems theoretic formulation presented herein serves to provide a framework for the top-down design of online learning systems, including a novel definition of online learning and the identification of key design parameters. The framework is formulated in terms of input-output systems and is further divided into system structure and system behavior. Concept drift is a critical challenge faced in online learning, and this work formally approaches it as part of the system behavior characteristics. Healthcare provider fraud detection using machine learning is used as a case study throughout the paper to ground the discussion in a real-world online learning challenge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sabyasachi Sahoo, Mostafa ElAraby, Jonas Ngnawe, Yann Pequignot, Frederic Precioso, Christian Gagne</p>
<p>Abstract: Test Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses the problem of distribution shift by enabling pretrained models to learn new features on an unseen domain at test time. However, it poses a significant challenge to maintain a balance between learning new features and retaining useful pretrained features. In this paper, we propose Layerwise EArly STopping (LEAST) for TTA to address this problem. The key idea is to stop adapting individual layers during TTA if the features being learned do not appear beneficial for the new domain. For that purpose, we propose using a novel gradient-based metric to measure the relevance of the current learnt features to the new domain without the need for supervised labels. More specifically, we propose to use this metric to determine dynamically when to stop updating each layer during TTA. This enables a more balanced adaptation, restricted to layers benefiting from it, and only for a certain number of steps. Such an approach also has the added effect of limiting the forgetting of pretrained features useful for dealing with new domains. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Layerwise Early Stopping improves the performance of existing TTA approaches across multiple datasets, domain shifts, model architectures, and TTA losses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mukund Telukunta, Sukruth Rao, Gabriella Stickney, Venkata Sriram Siddardh Nadendla, Casey Canfield</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern kidney placement incorporates several intelligent recommendation systems which exhibit social discrimination due to biases inherited from training data. Although initial attempts were made in the literature to study algorithmic fairness in kidney placement, these methods replace true outcomes with surgeons' decisions due to the long delays involved in recording such outcomes reliably. However, the replacement of true outcomes with surgeons' decisions disregards expert stakeholders' biases as well as social opinions of other stakeholders who do not possess medical expertise. This paper alleviates the latter concern and designs a novel fairness feedback survey to evaluate an acceptance rate predictor (ARP) that predicts a kidney's acceptance rate in a given kidney-match pair. The survey is launched on Prolific, a crowdsourcing platform, and public opinions are collected from 85 anonymous crowd participants. A novel social fairness preference learning algorithm is proposed based on minimizing social feedback regret computed using a novel logit-based fairness feedback model. The proposed model and learning algorithm are both validated using simulation experiments as well as Prolific data. Public preferences towards group fairness notions in the context of kidney placement have been estimated and discussed in detail. The specific ARP tested in the Prolific survey has been deemed fair by the participants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dennis Wu, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Teng-Yun Hsiao, Han Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a two-stage memory retrieval dynamics for modern Hopfield models, termed $\mathtt{U\text{-}Hop}$, with enhanced memory capacity. Our key contribution is a learnable feature map $\Phi$ which transforms the Hopfield energy function into a kernel space. This transformation ensures convergence between the local minima of energy and the fixed points of retrieval dynamics within the kernel space. Consequently, the kernel norm induced by $\Phi$ serves as a novel similarity measure. It utilizes the stored memory patterns as learning data to enhance memory capacity across all modern Hopfield models. Specifically, we accomplish this by constructing a separation loss $\mathcal{L}_\Phi$ that separates the local minima of kernelized energy by separating stored memory patterns in kernel space. Methodologically, $\mathtt{U\text{-}Hop}$ memory retrieval process consists of: \textbf{(Stage~I.)} minimizing separation loss for a more uniformed memory (local minimum) distribution, followed by \textbf{(Stage~II.)} standard Hopfield energy minimization for memory retrieval. This results in a significant reduction of possible meta-stable states in the Hopfield energy function, thus enhancing memory capacity by preventing memory confusion. Empirically, with real-world datasets, we demonstrate that $\mathtt{U\text{-}Hop}$ outperforms all existing modern Hopfield models and SOTA similarity measures, achieving substantial improvements in both associative memory retrieval and deep learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Pei-Hsuan Chang, Robin Luo, Hong-Yu Chen, Weijian Li, Wei-Po Wang, Han Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce an Outlier-Efficient Modern Hopfield Model (termed $\mathtt{OutEffHop}$) and use it to address the outlier-induced challenge of quantizing gigantic transformer-based models. Our main contribution is a novel associative memory model facilitating \textit{outlier-efficient} associative memory retrievals. Interestingly, this memory model manifests a model-based interpretation of an outlier-efficient attention mechanism ($\text{Softmax}_1$): it is an approximation of the memory retrieval process of $\mathtt{OutEffHop}$. Methodologically, this allows us to debut novel outlier-efficient Hopfield layers a powerful attention alternative with superior post-quantization performance. Theoretically, the Outlier-Efficient Modern Hopfield Model retains and improves the desirable properties of the standard modern Hopfield models, including fixed point convergence and exponential storage capacity. Empirically, we demonstrate the proposed model's efficacy across large-scale transformer-based and Hopfield-based models (including BERT, OPT, ViT and STanHop-Net), benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods including $\mathtt{Clipped\_Softmax}$ and $\mathtt{Gated\_Attention}$. Notably, $\mathtt{OutEffHop}$ achieves on average $\sim$22+\% reductions in both average kurtosis and maximum infinity norm of model outputs accross 4 models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenwei Xu, Yu-Chao Huang, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Weijian Li, Ammar Gilani, Hsi-Sheng Goan, Han Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the \textbf{B}i-Directional \textbf{S}parse \textbf{Hop}field Network (\textbf{BiSHop}), a novel end-to-end framework for deep tabular learning. BiSHop handles the two major challenges of deep tabular learning: non-rotationally invariant data structure and feature sparsity in tabular data. Our key motivation comes from the recent established connection between associative memory and attention mechanisms. Consequently, BiSHop uses a dual-component approach, sequentially processing data both column-wise and row-wise through two interconnected directional learning modules. Computationally, these modules house layers of generalized sparse modern Hopfield layers, a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model with adaptable sparsity. Methodologically, BiSHop facilitates multi-scale representation learning, capturing both intra-feature and inter-feature interactions, with adaptive sparsity at each scale. Empirically, through experiments on diverse real-world datasets, we demonstrate that BiSHop surpasses current SOTA methods with significantly less HPO runs, marking it a robust solution for deep tabular learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mary M. Lucas, Xiaoyang Wang, Chia-Hsuan Chang, Christopher C. Yang, Jacqueline E. Braughton, Quyen M. Ngo</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness of machine learning models in healthcare has drawn increasing attention from clinicians, researchers, and even at the highest level of government. On the other hand, the importance of developing and deploying interpretable or explainable models has been demonstrated, and is essential to increasing the trustworthiness and likelihood of adoption of these models. The objective of this study was to develop and implement a framework for addressing both these issues - fairness and explainability. We propose an explainable fairness framework, first developing a model with optimized performance, and then using an in-processing approach to mitigate model biases relative to the sensitive attributes of race and sex. We then explore and visualize explanations of the model changes that lead to the fairness enhancement process through exploring the changes in importance of features. Our resulting-fairness enhanced models retain high sensitivity with improved fairness and explanations of the fairness-enhancement that may provide helpful insights for healthcare providers to guide clinical decision-making and resource allocation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zitao Shuai, Liyue Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) has arised as an efficient scheme for multimodal representation learning, but it requires large-scale multimodal data for pre-training, making it an obstacle especially for biomedical applications. To overcome the data limitation, federated learning (FL) can be a promising strategy to scale up the dataset for biomedical VLP while protecting data privacy. However, client data are often heterogeneous in real-world scenarios, and we observe that local training on heterogeneous client data would distort the multimodal representation learning and lead to biased cross-modal alignment. To address this challenge, we propose Federated distributional Robust Guidance-Based (FedRGB) learning framework for federated VLP with robustness to data heterogeneity. Specifically, we utilize a guidance-based local training scheme to reduce feature distortions, and employ a distribution-based min-max optimization to learn unbiased cross-modal alignment. The experiments on real-world datasets show our method successfully promotes efficient federated multimodal learning for biomedical VLP with data heterogeneity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xudong Guo, Daming Shi, Junjie Yu, Wenhui Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of multi-agent systems, especially the success of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), is reshaping our future across diverse domains like autonomous vehicle networks. However, MARL still faces significant challenges, particularly in achieving zero-shot scalability, which allows trained MARL models to be directly applied to unseen tasks with varying numbers of agents. In addition, real-world multi-agent systems usually contain agents with different functions and strategies, while the existing scalable MARL methods only have limited heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a novel MARL framework named Scalable and Heterogeneous Proximal Policy Optimization (SHPPO), integrating heterogeneity into parameter-shared PPO-based MARL networks. we first leverage a latent network to adaptively learn strategy patterns for each agent. Second, we introduce a heterogeneous layer for decision-making, whose parameters are specifically generated by the learned latent variables. Our approach is scalable as all the parameters are shared except for the heterogeneous layer, and gains both inter-individual and temporal heterogeneity at the same time. We implement our approach based on the state-of-the-art backbone PPO-based algorithm as SHPPO, while our approach is agnostic to the backbone and can be seamlessly plugged into any parameter-shared MARL method. SHPPO exhibits superior performance over the baselines such as MAPPO and HAPPO in classic MARL environments like Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) and Google Research Football (GRF), showcasing enhanced zero-shot scalability and offering insights into the learned latent representation's impact on team performance by visualization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03870">Optimizing Convolutional Neural Networks for Identifying Invasive Pollinator Apis Mellifera and Finding a Ligand drug to Protect California&#x27;s Biodiversity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Arnav Swaroop</p>
<p>Abstract: In North America, there are many diverse species of native bees crucial for the environment, who are the primary pollinators of most native floral species. The Californian agriculture industry imports European honeybees (Apis Mellifera) primarily for pollinating almonds. Unfortunately, this has resulted in the unintended consequence of disrupting the native ecosystem and threatening many native bee species as they are outcompeted for food. Our first step for protecting the native species is identification with the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to differentiate common native bee species from invasive ones. Removing invasive colonies efficiently without harming native species is difficult as pesticides cause myriad diseases in native species. Our approach seeks to prevent the formation of new queens, causing the colony's collapse. Workers secrete royal jelly, a substance that causes fertility and longevity; it is fed to future honeybee queens. Targeting the production of this substance is safe as no native species use it; small organic molecules (ligands) prevent the proteins Apisimin and MRJP1 from combining and producing an oligomer used to form the substance. Ideal ligands bind to only one of these proteins preventing them from joining together: they have a high affinity for one receptor and a significantly lower affinity for the other. We optimized the CNN to provide a framework for creating Machine Learning models that excel at differentiating between subspecies of insects by measuring the effects of image alteration and class grouping on model performance. The CNN is able to achieve an accuracy of 82% in differentiating between invasive and native bee species; 3 ligands have been identified as effective. Our new approach offers a promising solution to curb the spread of invasive bees within California through an identification and neutralization method.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the smart grid, the prosumers can sell unused electricity back to the power grid, assuming the prosumers own renewable energy sources and storage units. The maximizing of their profits under a dynamic electricity market is a problem that requires intelligent planning. To address this, we propose a framework based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) using recurrent rewards. By using the information about the rewards modeled effectively with PPO to maximize our objective, we were able to get over 30\% improvement over the other naive algorithms in accumulating total profits. This shows promise in getting reinforcement learning algorithms to perform tasks required to plan their actions in complex domains like financial markets. We also introduce a novel method for embedding longs based on soliton waves that outperformed normal embedding in our use case with random floating point data augmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, advancements in deep learning techniques have considerably enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of medical diagnostics. In this work, a novel approach using multi-task learning (MTL) for the simultaneous classification of lung sounds and lung diseases is proposed. Our proposed model leverages MTL with four different deep learning models such as 2D CNN, ResNet50, MobileNet and Densenet to extract relevant features from the lung sound recordings. The ICBHI 2017 Respiratory Sound Database was employed in the current study. The MTL for MobileNet model performed better than the other models considered, with an accuracy of74\% for lung sound analysis and 91\% for lung diseases classification. Results of the experimentation demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in classifying both lung sounds and lung diseases concurrently.
  In this study,using the demographic data of the patients from the database, risk level computation for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease is also carried out. For this computation, three machine learning algorithms namely Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forest classifierswere employed. Among these ML algorithms, the Random Forest classifier had the highest accuracy of 92\%.This work helps in considerably reducing the physician's burden of not just diagnosing the pathology but also effectively communicating to the patient about the possible causes or outcomes.</p>

These questions encompass the choice and scale of the pre-training data, optimal architecture selections, and promising pre-training objectives. Our analysis highlights areas not yet covered in current research, inviting further exploration to enhance the field's understanding. Additionally, we address the challenges in comparing different models, emphasizing the need for standardized data splitting and robust statistical analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pre-trained deep learning (DL) models are increasingly accessible in public repositories, i.e., model zoos. Given a new prediction task, finding the best model to fine-tune can be computationally intensive and costly, especially when the number of pre-trained models is large. Selecting the right pre-trained models is crucial, yet complicated by the diversity of models from various model families (like ResNet, Vit, Swin) and the hidden relationships between models and datasets. Existing methods, which utilize basic information from models and datasets to compute scores indicating model performance on target datasets, overlook the intrinsic relationships, limiting their effectiveness in model selection. In this study, we introduce TransferGraph, a novel framework that reformulates model selection as a graph learning problem. TransferGraph constructs a graph using extensive metadata extracted from models and datasets, while capturing their inherent relationships. Through comprehensive experiments across 16 real datasets, both images and texts, we demonstrate TransferGraph's effectiveness in capturing essential model-dataset relationships, yielding up to a 32% improvement in correlation between predicted performance and the actual fine-tuning results compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

Using Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) for hyperparameter optimization, it explores optimal configurations across MNIST, FASHION-MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets. Over 30,000 configurations are evaluated, revealing data augmentation and weight initialization randomness as main performance contributors. Correlation analysis shows different optimizers prefer distinct randomization types. The complete implementation and dataset are available on GitHub.</p>

To address the difficulty of training policies from scratch in MORL, we introduce demonstration-guided multi-objective reinforcement learning (DG-MORL).

Our empirical studies demonstrate DG-MORL's superiority over existing MORL algorithms, establishing its robustness and efficacy, particularly under challenging conditions.

<p>Abstract: In the BCI field, introspection and interpretation of brain signals are desired for providing feedback or to guide rapid paradigm prototyping but are challenging due to the high noise level and dimensionality of the signals. Deep neural networks are often introspected by transforming their learned feature representations into 2- or 3-dimensional subspace visualizations using projection algorithms like Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). Unfortunately, these methods are computationally expensive, making the projection of data streams in real-time a non-trivial task. In this study, we introduce a novel variant of UMAP, called approximate UMAP (aUMAP). It aims at generating rapid projections for real-time introspection. To study its suitability for real-time projecting, we benchmark the methods against standard UMAP and its neural network counterpart parametric UMAP. Our results show that approximate UMAP delivers projections that replicate the projection space of standard UMAP while decreasing projection speed by an order of magnitude and maintaining the same training time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for modern machine learning systems, requiring models to adapt to new tasks while retaining knowledge from previous ones. Addressing this challenge necessitates the development of efficient algorithms capable of learning from data streams and accumulating knowledge over time. This paper proposes a novel approach to continual learning utilizing the weight consolidation method. Our method, a simple yet powerful technique, enhances robustness against catastrophic forgetting by interpolating between old and new model weights after each novel task, effectively merging two models to facilitate exploration of local minima emerging after arrival of new concepts. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach can complement existing rehearsal-based replay approaches, improving their accuracy and further mitigating the forgetting phenomenon. Additionally, our method provides an intuitive mechanism for controlling the stability-plasticity trade-off. Experimental results showcase the significant performance enhancement to state-of-the-art experience replay algorithms the proposed weight consolidation approach offers.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Zhou, Huangjie Zheng, Zhendong Wang, Mingzhang Yin, Hai Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Score identity Distillation (SiD), an innovative data-free method that distills the generative capabilities of pretrained diffusion models into a single-step generator. SiD not only facilitates an exponentially fast reduction in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) during distillation but also approaches or even exceeds the FID performance of the original teacher diffusion models. By reformulating forward diffusion processes as semi-implicit distributions, we leverage three score-related identities to create an innovative loss mechanism. This mechanism achieves rapid FID reduction by training the generator using its own synthesized images, eliminating the need for real data or reverse-diffusion-based generation, all accomplished within significantly shortened generation time. Upon evaluation across four benchmark datasets, the SiD algorithm demonstrates high iteration efficiency during distillation and surpasses competing distillation approaches, whether they are one-step or few-step, data-free, or dependent on training data, in terms of generation quality. This achievement not only redefines the benchmarks for efficiency and effectiveness in diffusion distillation but also in the broader field of diffusion-based generation. Our PyTorch implementation will be publicly accessible on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Wei, Bo Peng, Ruiwen Xie, Yangtao Chen, Yu Qin, Peng Wen, Stefan Bauer, Po-Yen Tung</p>
<p>Abstract: A tremendous range of design tasks in materials, physics, and biology can be formulated as finding the optimum of an objective function depending on many parameters without knowing its closed-form expression or the derivative. Traditional derivative-free optimization techniques often rely on strong assumptions about objective functions, thereby failing at optimizing non-convex systems beyond 100 dimensions. Here, we present a tree search method for derivative-free optimization that enables accelerated optimal design of high-dimensional complex systems. Specifically, we introduce stochastic tree expansion, dynamic upper confidence bound, and short-range backpropagation mechanism to evade local optimum, iteratively approximating the global optimum using machine learning models. This development effectively confronts the dimensionally challenging problems, achieving convergence to global optima across various benchmark functions up to 2,000 dimensions, surpassing the existing methods by 10- to 20-fold. Our method demonstrates wide applicability to a wide range of real-world complex systems spanning materials, physics, and biology, considerably outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms. This enables efficient autonomous knowledge discovery and facilitates self-driving virtual laboratories. Although we focus on problems within the realm of natural science, the advancements in optimization techniques achieved herein are applicable to a broader spectrum of challenges across all quantitative disciplines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Irofti, Iulian-Andrei H\^iji, Andrei P\u{a}tra\c{s}cu, Nicolae Cleju</p>
<p>Abstract: We study in this paper the improvement of one-class support vector machines (OC-SVM) through sparse representation techniques for unsupervised anomaly detection. As Dictionary Learning (DL) became recently a common analysis technique that reveals hidden sparse patterns of data, our approach uses this insight to endow unsupervised detection with more control on pattern finding and dimensions. We introduce a new anomaly detection model that unifies the OC-SVM and DL residual functions into a single composite objective, subsequently solved through K-SVD-type iterative algorithms. A closed-form of the alternating K-SVD iteration is explicitly derived for the new composite model and practical implementable schemes are discussed. The standard DL model is adapted for the Dictionary Pair Learning (DPL) context, where the usual sparsity constraints are naturally eliminated. Finally, we extend both objectives to the more general setting that allows the use of kernel functions. The empirical convergence properties of the resulting algorithms are provided and an in-depth analysis of their parametrization is performed while also demonstrating their numerical performance in comparison with existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leif Feddersen, Catherine Cleophas</p>
<p>Abstract: Demand forecasts are the crucial basis for numerous business decisions, ranging from inventory management to strategic facility planning. While machine learning (ML) approaches offer accuracy gains, their interpretability and acceptance are notoriously lacking. Addressing this dilemma, we introduce Hierarchical Neural Additive Models for time series (HNAM). HNAM expands upon Neural Additive Models (NAM) by introducing a time-series specific additive model with a level and interacting covariate components.
  Covariate interactions are only allowed according to a user-specified interaction hierarchy. For example, weekday effects may be estimated independently of other covariates, whereas a holiday effect may depend on the weekday and an additional promotion may depend on both former covariates that are lower in the interaction hierarchy.
  Thereby, HNAM yields an intuitive forecasting interface in which analysts can observe the contribution for each known covariate. We evaluate the proposed approach and benchmark its performance against other state-of-the-art machine learning and statistical models extensively on real-world retail data. The results reveal that HNAM offers competitive prediction performance whilst providing plausible explanations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xize Liang, Chao Chen, Jie Wang, Yue Wu, Zhihang Fu, Zhihao Shi, Feng Wu, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: The preference alignment aims to enable large language models (LLMs) to generate responses that conform to human values, which is essential for developing general AI systems. Ranking-based methods -- a promising class of alignment approaches -- learn human preferences from datasets containing response pairs by optimizing the log-likelihood margins between preferred and dis-preferred responses. However, due to the inherent differences in annotators' preferences, ranking labels of comparisons for response pairs are unavoidably noisy. This seriously hurts the reliability of existing ranking-based methods. To address this problem, we propose a provably noise-tolerant preference alignment method, namely RObust Preference Optimization (ROPO). To the best of our knowledge, ROPO is the first preference alignment method with noise-tolerance guarantees. The key idea of ROPO is to dynamically assign conservative gradient weights to response pairs with high label uncertainty, based on the log-likelihood margins between the responses. By effectively suppressing the gradients of noisy samples, our weighting strategy ensures that the expected risk has the same gradient direction independent of the presence and proportion of noise. Experiments on three open-ended text generation tasks with four base models ranging in size from 2.8B to 13B demonstrate that ROPO significantly outperforms existing ranking-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Romain Egele, Felix Mohr, Tom Viering, Prasanna Balaprakash</p>
<p>Abstract: To reach high performance with deep learning, hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is essential. This process is usually time-consuming due to costly evaluations of neural networks. Early discarding techniques limit the resources granted to unpromising candidates by observing the empirical learning curves and canceling neural network training as soon as the lack of competitiveness of a candidate becomes evident. Despite two decades of research, little is understood about the trade-off between the aggressiveness of discarding and the loss of predictive performance. Our paper studies this trade-off for several commonly used discarding techniques such as successive halving and learning curve extrapolation. Our surprising finding is that these commonly used techniques offer minimal to no added value compared to the simple strategy of discarding after a constant number of epochs of training. The chosen number of epochs depends mostly on the available compute budget. We call this approach i-Epoch (i being the constant number of epochs with which neural networks are trained) and suggest to assess the quality of early discarding techniques by comparing how their Pareto-Front (in consumed training epochs and predictive performance) complement the Pareto-Front of i-Epoch.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning plays an important role in the operation of current wind energy production systems. One central application is predictive maintenance to increase efficiency and lower electricity costs by reducing downtimes. Integrating physics-based knowledge in neural networks to enforce their physical plausibilty is a promising method to improve current approaches, but incomplete system information often impedes their application in real world scenarios. We describe a simple and efficient way for physics-constrained deep learning-based predictive maintenance for wind turbine gearbox bearings with partial system knowledge. The approach is based on temperature nowcasting constrained by physics, where unknown system coefficients are treated as learnable neural network parameters. Results show improved generalization performance to unseen environments compared to a baseline neural network, which is especially important in low data scenarios often encountered in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaith Rjoub, Saidul Islam, Jamal Bentahar, Mohammed Amin Almaiah, Rana Alrawashdeh</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to an explosion of data generated by interconnected devices, presenting both opportunities and challenges for intelligent decision-making in complex environments. Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches often struggle to fully harness this data due to their limited ability to process and interpret the intricate patterns and dependencies inherent in IoT applications. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates transformer architectures with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to address these challenges. By leveraging the self-attention mechanism of transformers, our approach enhances RL agents' capacity for understanding and acting within dynamic IoT environments, leading to improved decision-making processes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various IoT scenarios, from smart home automation to industrial control systems, showing marked improvements in decision-making efficiency and adaptability. Our contributions include a detailed exploration of the transformer's role in processing heterogeneous IoT data, a comprehensive evaluation of the framework's performance in diverse environments, and a benchmark against traditional RL methods. The results indicate significant advancements in enabling RL agents to navigate the complexities of IoT ecosystems, highlighting the potential of our approach to revolutionize intelligent automation and decision-making in the IoT landscape.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zachary R. Fox, Ayana Ghosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting and enhancing inherent properties based on molecular structures is paramount to design tasks in medicine, materials science, and environmental management. Most of the current machine learning and deep learning approaches have become standard for predictions, but they face challenges when applied across different datasets due to reliance on correlations between molecular representation and target properties. These approaches typically depend on large datasets to capture the diversity within the chemical space, facilitating a more accurate approximation, interpolation, or extrapolation of the chemical behavior of molecules. In our research, we introduce an active learning approach that discerns underlying cause-effect relationships through strategic sampling with the use of a graph loss function. This method identifies the smallest subset of the dataset capable of encoding the most information representative of a much larger chemical space. The identified causal relations are then leveraged to conduct systematic interventions, optimizing the design task within a chemical space that the models have not encountered previously. While our implementation focused on the QM9 quantum-chemical dataset for a specific design task-finding molecules with a large dipole moment-our active causal learning approach, driven by intelligent sampling and interventions, holds potential for broader applications in molecular, materials design and discovery.</p>

<p>Abstract: Methods for learning latent user representations from historical behavior logs have gained traction for recommendation tasks in e-commerce, content streaming, and other settings. However, this area still remains relatively underexplored in video and mobile gaming contexts. In this work, we present a novel method for overcoming this limitation by extending a long-range Transformer model from the natural language processing domain to player behavior data. We discuss specifics of behavior tracking in games and propose preprocessing and tokenization approaches by viewing in-game events in an analogous way to words in sentences, thus enabling learning player representations in a self-supervised manner in the absence of ground-truth annotations. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in fitting the distribution of behavior events by evaluating intrinsic language modeling metrics. Furthermore, we qualitatively analyze the emerging structure of the learned embedding space and show its value for generating insights into behavior patterns to inform downstream applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the geometry of conditional optimal transport (COT) and prove a dynamical formulation which generalizes the Benamou-Brenier Theorem. With these tools, we propose a simulation-free flow-based method for conditional generative modeling. Our method couples an arbitrary source distribution to a specified target distribution through a triangular COT plan. We build on the framework of flow matching to train a conditional generative model by approximating the geodesic path of measures induced by this COT plan. Our theory and methods are applicable in the infinite-dimensional setting, making them well suited for inverse problems. Empirically, we demonstrate our proposed method on two image-to-image translation tasks and an infinite-dimensional Bayesian inverse problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Seyde, Peter Werner, Wilko Schwarting, Markus Wulfmeier, Daniela Rus</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning approaches have shown surprisingly strong capabilities of bang-bang policies for solving continuous control benchmarks. The underlying coarse action space discretizations often yield favourable exploration characteristics while final performance does not visibly suffer in the absence of action penalization in line with optimal control theory. In robotics applications, smooth control signals are commonly preferred to reduce system wear and energy efficiency, but action costs can be detrimental to exploration during early training. In this work, we aim to bridge this performance gap by growing discrete action spaces from coarse to fine control resolution, taking advantage of recent results in decoupled Q-learning to scale our approach to high-dimensional action spaces up to dim(A) = 38. Our work indicates that an adaptive control resolution in combination with value decomposition yields simple critic-only algorithms that yield surprisingly strong performance on continuous control tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kehan Long, Jorge Cortes, Nikolay Atanasov</p>
<p>Abstract: This article presents novel methods for synthesizing distributionally robust stabilizing neural controllers and certificates for control systems under model uncertainty. A key challenge in designing controllers with stability guarantees for uncertain systems is the accurate determination of and adaptation to shifts in model parametric uncertainty during online deployment. We tackle this with a novel distributionally robust formulation of the Lyapunov derivative chance constraint ensuring a monotonic decrease of the Lyapunov certificate. To avoid the computational complexity involved in dealing with the space of probability measures, we identify a sufficient condition in the form of deterministic convex constraints that ensures the Lyapunov derivative constraint is satisfied. We integrate this condition into a loss function for training a neural network-based controller and show that, for the resulting closed-loop system, the global asymptotic stability of its equilibrium can be certified with high confidence, even with Out-of-Distribution (OoD) model uncertainties. To demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed methodology, we compare it with an uncertainty-agnostic baseline approach and several reinforcement learning approaches in two control problems in simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Owen Oertell, Jonathan D. Chang, Yiyi Zhang, Kiant\'e Brantley, Wen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has improved guided image generation with diffusion models by directly optimizing rewards that capture image quality, aesthetics, and instruction following capabilities. However, the resulting generative policies inherit the same iterative sampling process of diffusion models that causes slow generation. To overcome this limitation, consistency models proposed learning a new class of generative models that directly map noise to data, resulting in a model that can generate an image in as few as one sampling iteration. In this work, to optimize text-to-image generative models for task specific rewards and enable fast training and inference, we propose a framework for fine-tuning consistency models via RL. Our framework, called Reinforcement Learning for Consistency Model (RLCM), frames the iterative inference process of a consistency model as an RL procedure. RLCM improves upon RL fine-tuned diffusion models on text-to-image generation capabilities and trades computation during inference time for sample quality. Experimentally, we show that RLCM can adapt text-to-image consistency models to objectives that are challenging to express with prompting, such as image compressibility, and those derived from human feedback, such as aesthetic quality. Comparing to RL finetuned diffusion models, RLCM trains significantly faster, improves the quality of the generation measured under the reward objectives, and speeds up the inference procedure by generating high quality images with as few as two inference steps.

The general informational parameters as the global quantitative measure of the neural systems computing potential as absolute and relative neural power were proposed. Neural information organizing and processing follows the way in which nature manages neural information by developing functions, functionalities and circuits related to different internal or peripheral components and also to the whole system through a non-deterministic memorization, fragmentation and aggregation of afferent and efferent information, deep neural information processing representing multiple alternations of fragmentation and aggregation stages. The relevant neural characteristics were integrated into a neural machine type model that incorporates unitary also peripheral or interface components as the central ones. The proposed approach allows overcoming the technical constraints in artificial computational implementations of neural information processes and also provides a more relevant description of natural ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Giuliano, S. Andrew Gadsden, Waleed Hilal, John Yawney</p>
<p>Abstract: The volume of remote sensing data is experiencing rapid growth, primarily due to the plethora of space and air platforms equipped with an array of sensors. Due to limited hardware and battery constraints the data is transmitted back to Earth for processing. The large amounts of data along with security concerns call for new compression and encryption techniques capable of preserving reconstruction quality while minimizing the transmission cost of this data back to Earth. This study investigates image compression based on convolutional variational autoencoders (CVAE), which are capable of substantially reducing the volume of transmitted data while guaranteeing secure lossy image reconstruction. CVAEs have been demonstrated to outperform conventional compression methods such as JPEG2000 by a substantial margin on compression benchmark datasets. The proposed model draws on the strength of the CVAEs capability to abstract data into highly insightful latent spaces, and combining it with the utilization of an entropy bottleneck is capable of finding an optimal balance between compressibility and reconstruction quality. The balance is reached by optimizing over a composite loss function that represents the rate-distortion curve.</p>

We design a new DM-based unsupervised multi-domain image-to-image transition framework and constrain the generation of 3D fMRI statistic maps using the latent space of an auxiliary classifier that distinguishes statistic maps from different pipelines.

<p>Abstract: In the realm of medical imaging, inverse problems aim to infer high-quality images from incomplete, noisy measurements, with the objective of minimizing expenses and risks to patients in clinical settings. The Diffusion Models have recently emerged as a promising approach to such practical challenges, proving particularly useful for the zero-shot inference of images from partially acquired measurements in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT). A central challenge in this approach, however, is how to guide an unconditional prediction to conform to the measurement information. Existing methods rely on deficient projection or inefficient posterior score approximation guidance, which often leads to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose \underline{\textbf{B}}i-level \underline{G}uided \underline{D}iffusion \underline{M}odels ({BGDM}), a zero-shot imaging framework that efficiently steers the initial unconditional prediction through a \emph{bi-level} guidance strategy. Specifically, BGDM first approximates an \emph{inner-level} conditional posterior mean as an initial measurement-consistent reference point and then solves an \emph{outer-level} proximal optimization objective to reinforce the measurement consistency. Our experimental findings, using publicly available MRI and CT medical datasets, reveal that BGDM is more effective and efficient compared to the baselines, faithfully generating high-fidelity medical images and substantially reducing hallucinatory artifacts in cases of severe degradation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Spyridon Chavlis, Panayiota Poirazi</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are at the core of most Deep learning (DL) algorithms that successfully tackle complex problems like image recognition, autonomous driving, and natural language processing. However, unlike biological brains who tackle similar problems in a very efficient manner, DL algorithms require a large number of trainable parameters, making them energy-intensive and prone to overfitting. Here, we show that a new ANN architecture that incorporates the structured connectivity and restricted sampling properties of biological dendrites counteracts these limitations. We find that dendritic ANNs are more robust to overfitting and outperform traditional ANNs on several image classification tasks while using significantly fewer trainable parameters. This is achieved through the adoption of a different learning strategy, whereby most of the nodes respond to several classes, unlike classical ANNs that strive for class-specificity. These findings suggest that the incorporation of dendrites can make learning in ANNs precise, resilient, and parameter-efficient and shed new light on how biological features can impact the learning strategies of ANNs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ThEdu series pursues the smooth transition from an intuitive way of doing mathematics at secondary school to a more formal approach to the subject in STEM education, while favouring software support for this transition by exploiting the power of theorem-proving technologies. What follows is a brief description of how the present volume contributes to this enterprise.
  The 12th International Workshop on Theorem Proving Components for Educational Software(ThEdu'23), was a satellite event of the 29th international Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE 2023), July 1-4, 2023, Rome, Italy. ThEdu'23 was very successful, with one invited talk, by Yves Bertot (Inria, France), "The challenges of using Type Theory to teach Mathematics", and seven regular contributions. An open call  for papers was then issued, to which eight contributions were submitted. Seven submissions have been accepted by our reviewers, who jointly produced at least three careful reports on each of the contributions. The resulting revised papers are collected in the present volume.
  We, the volume editors, hope that this collection of papers will further promote the development of theorem-proving based software, and that it will allow to improve the mutual understanding between computer scientists, mathematicians and stakeholders in education.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lars Ankile, Anthony Simeonov, Idan Shenfeld, Pulkit Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: While learning from demonstrations is powerful for acquiring visuomotor policies, high-performance imitation without large demonstration datasets remains challenging for tasks requiring precise, long-horizon manipulation. This paper proposes a pipeline for improving imitation learning performance with a small human demonstration budget. We apply our approach to assembly tasks that require precisely grasping, reorienting, and inserting multiple parts over long horizons and multiple task phases. Our pipeline combines expressive policy architectures and various techniques for dataset expansion and simulation-based data augmentation. These help expand dataset support and supervise the model with locally corrective actions near bottleneck regions requiring high precision. We demonstrate our pipeline on four furniture assembly tasks in simulation, enabling a manipulator to assemble up to five parts over nearly 2500 time steps directly from RGB images, outperforming imitation and data augmentation baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunxiao Li (John), Charlie Liu (John), Jonathan Chung (John),  Zhengyang (John),  Lu, Piyush Jha, Vijay Ganesh</p>
<p>Abstract: Restart policy is an important technique used in modern Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) solvers, wherein some parts of the solver state are erased at certain intervals during the run of the solver. In most solvers, variable activities are preserved across restart boundaries, resulting in solvers continuing to search parts of the assignment tree that are not far from the one immediately prior to a restart. To enable the solver to search possibly "distant" parts of the assignment tree, we study the effect of resets, a variant of restarts which not only erases the assignment trail, but also randomizes the activity scores of the variables of the input formula after reset, thus potentially enabling a better global exploration of the search space.
  In this paper, we model the problem of whether to trigger reset as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, and propose two reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive reset policies using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson sampling algorithms. These two algorithms balance the exploration-exploitation tradeoff by adaptively choosing arms (reset vs. no reset) based on their estimated rewards during the solver's run. We implement our reset policies in four baseline SOTA CDCL solvers and compare the baselines against the reset versions on Satcoin benchmarks and SAT Competition instances. Our results show that RL-based reset versions outperform the corresponding baseline solvers on both Satcoin and the SAT competition instances, suggesting that our RL policy helps to dynamically and profitably adapt the reset frequency for any given input instance. We also introduce the concept of a partial reset, where at least a constant number of variable activities are retained across reset boundaries. Building on previous results, we show that there is an exponential separation between O(1) vs. $\Omega(n)$-length partial resets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Adcock, Simone Brugiapaglia, Nick Dexter, Sebastian Moraga</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning approximations to smooth target functions of many variables from finite sets of pointwise samples is an important task in scientific computing and its many applications in computational science and engineering. Despite well over half a century of research on high-dimensional approximation, this remains a challenging problem. Yet, significant advances have been made in the last decade towards efficient methods for doing this, commencing with so-called sparse polynomial approximation methods and continuing most recently with methods based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In tandem, there have been substantial advances in the relevant approximation theory and analysis of these techniques. In this work, we survey this recent progress. We describe the contemporary motivations for this problem, which stem from parametric models and computational uncertainty quantification; the relevant function classes, namely, classes of infinite-dimensional, Banach-valued, holomorphic functions; fundamental limits of learnability from finite data for these classes; and finally, sparse polynomial and DNN methods for efficiently learning such functions from finite data. For the latter, there is currently a significant gap between the approximation theory of DNNs and the practical performance of deep learning. Aiming to narrow this gap, we develop the topic of practical existence theory, which asserts the existence of dimension-independent DNN architectures and training strategies that achieve provably near-optimal generalization errors in terms of the amount of training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tyler Cody, Bingtong Li, Peter A. Beling</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the urgent need for messaging standards in the operational test and evaluation (T&E) of machine learning (ML) applications, particularly in edge ML applications embedded in systems like robots, satellites, and unmanned vehicles. It examines the suitability of the IEEE Standard 1671 (IEEE Std 1671), known as the Automatic Test Markup Language (ATML), an XML-based standard originally developed for electronic systems, for ML application testing. The paper explores extending IEEE Std 1671 to encompass the unique challenges of ML applications, including the use of datasets and dependencies on software. Through modeling various tests such as adversarial robustness and drift detection, this paper offers a framework adaptable to specific applications, suggesting that minor modifications to ATML might suffice to address the novelties of ML. This paper differentiates ATML's focus on testing from other ML standards like Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) or Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), which concentrate on ML model specification. We conclude that ATML is a promising tool for effective, near real-time operational T&E of ML applications, an essential aspect of AI lifecycle management, safety, and governance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyue Zhang, Yao Zhao, Yanxun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In applications such as biomedical studies, epidemiology, and social sciences, recurrent events often co-occur with longitudinal measurements and a terminal event, such as death. Therefore, jointly modeling longitudinal measurements, recurrent events, and survival data while accounting for their dependencies is critical. While joint models for the three components exist in statistical literature, many of these approaches are limited by heavy parametric assumptions and scalability issues. Recently, incorporating deep learning techniques into joint modeling has shown promising results. However, current methods only address joint modeling of longitudinal measurements at regularly-spaced observation times and survival events, neglecting recurrent events. In this paper, we develop TransformerLSR, a flexible transformer-based deep modeling and inference framework to jointly model all three components simultaneously. TransformerLSR integrates deep temporal point processes into the joint modeling framework, treating recurrent and terminal events as two competing processes dependent on past longitudinal measurements and recurrent event times. Additionally, TransformerLSR introduces a novel trajectory representation and model architecture to potentially incorporate a priori knowledge of known latent structures among concurrent longitudinal variables. We demonstrate the effectiveness and necessity of TransformerLSR through simulation studies and analyzing a real-world medical dataset on patients after kidney transplantation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sabee Grewal, Vishnu Iyer, William Kretschmer, Daniel Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: We define a quantum learning task called agnostic tomography, where given copies of an arbitrary state $\rho$ and a class of quantum states $\mathcal{C}$, the goal is to output a succinct description of a state that approximates $\rho$ at least as well as any state in $\mathcal{C}$ (up to some small error $\varepsilon$). This task generalizes ordinary quantum tomography of states in $\mathcal{C}$ and is more challenging because the learning algorithm must be robust to perturbations of $\rho$.
  We give an efficient agnostic tomography algorithm for the class $\mathcal{C}$ of $n$-qubit stabilizer product states. Assuming $\rho$ has fidelity at least $\tau$ with a stabilizer product state, the algorithm runs in time $n^{O(1 + \log(1/\tau))} / \varepsilon^2$. This runtime is quasipolynomial in all parameters, and polynomial if $\tau$ is a constant.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Scott Ettinger, Kratarth Goel, Avikalp Srivastava, Rami Al-Rfou</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion forecasting has become an increasingly critical component of autonomous robotic systems. Onboard compute budgets typically limit the accuracy of real-time systems. In this work we propose methods of improving motion forecasting systems subject to limited compute budgets by combining model ensemble and distillation techniques. The use of ensembles of deep neural networks has been shown to improve generalization accuracy in many application domains. We first demonstrate significant performance gains by creating a large ensemble of optimized single models. We then develop a generalized framework to distill motion forecasting model ensembles into small student models which retain high performance with a fraction of the computing cost. For this study we focus on the task of motion forecasting using real world data from autonomous driving systems. We develop ensemble models that are very competitive on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and Argoverse leaderboards. From these ensembles, we train distilled student models which have high performance at a fraction of the compute costs. These experiments demonstrate distillation from ensembles as an effective method for improving accuracy of predictive models for robotic systems with limited compute budgets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ajay Jaiswal, Bodun Hu, Lu Yin, Yeonju Ro, Shiwei Liu, Tianlong Chen, Aditya Akella</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (e.g., LLaMa, GPTs) are omnipresent achieving remarkable success in language understanding and generation. However, such impressive capability typically comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges for autoregressive token-by-token generation. To mitigate computation overload incurred during generation, several early-exit and layer-dropping strategies have been proposed. Despite some promising success due to the redundancy across LLMs layers on metrics like Rough-L/BLUE, our careful knowledge-intensive evaluation unveils issues such as generation collapse, hallucination of wrong facts, and noticeable performance drop even at the trivial exit ratio of 10-15% of layers. We attribute these errors primarily to ineffective handling of the KV cache through state copying during early-exit. In this work, we observed the saturation of computationally expensive feed-forward blocks of LLM layers and proposed FFN-SkipLLM, which is a novel fine-grained skip strategy of autoregressive LLMs. More specifically, FFN-SkipLLM is an input-adaptive feed-forward skipping strategy that can skip 25-30% of FFN blocks of LLMs with marginal change in performance on knowledge-intensive generation tasks without any requirement to handle KV cache. Our extensive experiments and ablation across benchmarks like MT-Bench, Factoid-QA, and variable-length text summarization illustrate how our simple and ease-at-use method can facilitate faster autoregressive decoding.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03868">Extract, Define, Canonicalize: An LLM-based Framework for Knowledge Graph Construction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Zhang, Harold Soh</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we are interested in automated methods for knowledge graph creation (KGC) from input text. Progress on large language models (LLMs) has prompted a series of recent works applying them to KGC, e.g., via zero/few-shot prompting. Despite successes on small domain-specific datasets, these models face difficulties scaling up to text common in many real-world applications. A principal issue is that in prior methods, the KG schema has to be included in the LLM prompt to generate valid triplets; larger and more complex schema easily exceed the LLMs' context window length. To address this problem, we propose a three-phase framework named Extract-Define-Canonicalize (EDC): open information extraction followed by schema definition and post-hoc canonicalization. EDC is flexible in that it can be applied to settings where a pre-defined target schema is available and when it is not; in the latter case, it constructs a schema automatically and applies self-canonicalization. To further improve performance, we introduce a trained component that retrieves schema elements relevant to the input text; this improves the LLMs' extraction performance in a retrieval-augmented generation-like manner. We demonstrate on three KGC benchmarks that EDC is able to extract high-quality triplets without any parameter tuning and with significantly larger schemas compared to prior works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gianluca Barone, Aashrit Cunchala, Rudy Nunez</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard classification theory assumes that the distribution of images in the test and training sets are identical. Unfortunately, real-life scenarios typically feature unseen data ("out-of-distribution data") which is different from data in the training distribution("in-distribution"). This issue is most prevalent in social justice problems where data from under-represented groups may appear in the test data without representing an equal proportion of the training data. This may result in a model returning confidently wrong decisions and predictions. We are interested in the following question: Can the performance of a neural network improve on facial images of out-of-distribution data when it is trained simultaneously on multiple datasets of in-distribution data? We approach this problem by incorporating the Outlier Exposure model and investigate how the model's performance changes when other datasets of facial images were implemented. We observe that the accuracy and other metrics of the model can be increased by applying Outlier Exposure, incorporating a trainable weight parameter to increase the machine's emphasis on outlier images, and by re-weighting the importance of different class labels. We also experimented with whether sorting the images and determining outliers via image features would have more of an effect on the metrics than sorting by average pixel value. Our goal was to make models not only more accurate but also more fair by scanning a more expanded range of images. We also tested the datasets in reverse order to see whether a more fair dataset with balanced features has an effect on the model's accuracy.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03891">Can only LLMs do Reasoning?: Potential of Small Language Models in Task Planning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Gawon Choi, Hyemin Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: In robotics, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) is becoming prevalent, especially for understanding human commands. In particular, LLMs are utilized as domain-agnostic task planners for high-level human commands. LLMs are capable of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and this allows LLMs to be task planners. However, we need to consider that modern robots still struggle to perform complex actions, and the domains where robots can be deployed are limited in practice. This leads us to pose a question: If small LMs can be trained to reason in chains within a single domain, would even small LMs be good task planners for the robots? To train smaller LMs to reason in chains, we build `COmmand-STeps datasets' (COST) consisting of high-level commands along with corresponding actionable low-level steps, via LLMs. We release not only our datasets but also the prompt templates used to generate them, to allow anyone to build datasets for their domain. We compare GPT3.5 and GPT4 with the finetuned GPT2 for task domains, in tabletop and kitchen environments, and the result shows that GPT2-medium is comparable to GPT3.5 for task planning in a specific domain. Our dataset, code, and more output samples can be found in https://github.com/Gawon-Choi/small-LMs-Task-Planning</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maryam Ahmed, Tooba Bibi, Rizwan Ahmed Khan, Sidra Nasir</p>
<p>Abstract: The study introduces an integrated framework combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for the enhanced diagnosis of breast cancer using the CBIS-DDSM dataset. Utilizing a fine-tuned ResNet50 architecture, our investigation not only provides effective differentiation of mammographic images into benign and malignant categories but also addresses the opaque "black-box" nature of deep learning models by employing XAI methodologies, namely Grad-CAM, LIME, and SHAP, to interpret CNN decision-making processes for healthcare professionals. Our methodology encompasses an elaborate data preprocessing pipeline and advanced data augmentation techniques to counteract dataset limitations, and transfer learning using pre-trained networks, such as VGG-16, DenseNet and ResNet was employed. A focal point of our study is the evaluation of XAI's effectiveness in interpreting model predictions, highlighted by utilising the Hausdorff measure to assess the alignment between AI-generated explanations and expert annotations quantitatively. This approach plays a critical role for XAI in promoting trustworthiness and ethical fairness in AI-assisted diagnostics. The findings from our research illustrate the effective collaboration between CNNs and XAI in advancing diagnostic methods for breast cancer, thereby facilitating a more seamless integration of advanced AI technologies within clinical settings. By enhancing the interpretability of AI-driven decisions, this work lays the groundwork for improved collaboration between AI systems and medical practitioners, ultimately enriching patient care. Furthermore, the implications of our research extend well beyond the current methodologies, advocating for subsequent inquiries into the integration of multimodal data and the refinement of AI explanations to satisfy the needs of clinical practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a nonparametric construction for deep learning compatible modern Hopfield models and utilize this framework to debut an efficient variant. Our key contribution stems from interpreting the memory storage and retrieval processes in modern Hopfield models as a nonparametric regression problem subject to a set of query-memory pairs. Crucially, our framework not only recovers the known results from the original dense modern Hopfield model but also fills the void in the literature regarding efficient modern Hopfield models, by introducing \textit{sparse-structured} modern Hopfield models with sub-quadratic complexity. We establish that this sparse model inherits the appealing theoretical properties of its dense analogue -- connection with transformer attention, fixed point convergence and exponential memory capacity -- even without knowing details of the Hopfield energy function. Additionally, we showcase the versatility of our framework by constructing a family of modern Hopfield models as extensions, including linear, random masked, top-$K$ and positive random feature modern Hopfield models. Empirically, we validate the efficacy of our framework in both synthetic and realistic settings.</p>

In this work, we introduce Concept Weaver, a method for composing customized text-to-image diffusion models at inference time. Specifically, the method breaks the process into two steps: creating a template image aligned with the semantics of input prompts, and then personalizing the template using a concept fusion strategy. The fusion strategy incorporates the appearance of the target concepts into the template image while retaining its structural details. The results indicate that our method can generate multiple custom concepts with higher identity fidelity compared to alternative approaches. Furthermore, the method is shown to seamlessly handle more than two concepts and closely follow the semantic meaning of the input prompt without blending appearances across different subjects.</p>

<p>Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellite missions have been providing detailed images about the state of the Earth and its land cover for over 50 years. Long term missions, such as NASA's Landsat, Terra, and Aqua satellites, and more recently, the ESA's Sentinel missions, record images of the entire world every few days. Although single images provide point-in-time data, repeated images of the same area, or satellite image time series (SITS) provide information about the changing state of vegetation and land use. These SITS are useful for modeling dynamic processes and seasonal changes such as plant phenology. They have potential benefits for many aspects of land and natural resource management, including applications in agricultural, forest, water, and disaster management, urban planning, and mining. However, the resulting satellite image time series (SITS) are complex, incorporating information from the temporal, spatial, and spectral dimensions. Therefore, deep learning methods are often deployed as they can analyze these complex relationships. This review presents a summary of the state-of-the-art methods of modelling environmental, agricultural, and other Earth observation variables from SITS data using deep learning methods. We aim to provide a resource for remote sensing experts interested in using deep learning techniques to enhance Earth observation models with temporal information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ana-Maria Cretu, Miruna Rusu, Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye</p>
<p>Abstract: Smart meters, devices measuring the electricity and gas consumption of a household, are currently being deployed at a fast rate throughout the world. The data they collect are extremely useful, including in the fight against climate change. However, these data and the information that can be inferred from them are highly sensitive. Re-pseudonymization, i.e., the frequent replacement of random identifiers over time, is widely used to share smart meter data while mitigating the risk of re-identification. We here show how, in spite of re-pseudonymization, households' consumption records can be pieced together with high accuracy in large-scale datasets. We propose the first deep learning-based profiling attack against re-pseudonymized smart meter data. Our attack combines neural network embeddings, which are used to extract features from weekly consumption records and are tailored to the smart meter identification task, with a nearest neighbor classifier. We evaluate six neural networks architectures as the embedding model. Our results suggest that the Transformer and CNN-LSTM architectures vastly outperform previous methods as well as other architectures, successfully identifying the correct household 73.4% of the time among 5139 households based on electricity and gas consumption records (54.5% for electricity only). We further show that the features extracted by the embedding model maintain their effectiveness when transferred to a set of users disjoint from the one used to train the model. Finally, we extensively evaluate the robustness of our results. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that even frequent re-pseudonymization strategies can be reversed, strongly limiting their ability to prevent re-identification in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahzad Ali, Yu Rim Lee, Soo Young Park, Won Young Tak, Soon Ki Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Downsampling images and labels, often necessitated by limited resources or to expedite network training, leads to the loss of small objects and thin boundaries. This undermines the segmentation network's capacity to interpret images accurately and predict detailed labels, resulting in diminished performance compared to processing at original resolutions. This situation exemplifies the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, with higher downsampling factors further impairing segmentation outcomes. Preserving information during downsampling is especially critical for medical image segmentation tasks. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel method named Edge-preserving Probabilistic Downsampling (EPD). It utilizes class uncertainty within a local window to produce soft labels, with the window size dictating the downsampling factor. This enables a network to produce quality predictions at low resolutions. Beyond preserving edge details more effectively than conventional nearest-neighbor downsampling, employing a similar algorithm for images, it surpasses bilinear interpolation in image downsampling, enhancing overall performance. Our method significantly improved Intersection over Union (IoU) to 2.85%, 8.65%, and 11.89% when downsampling data to 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8, respectively, compared to conventional interpolation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Ghaith Altarabichi, S{\l}awomir Nowaczyk, Sepideh Pashami, Peyman Sheikholharam Mashhadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are often challenging to apply in real-world settings since evolutionary computations involve a large number of evaluations of a typically expensive fitness function. For example, an evaluation could involve training a new machine learning model. An approximation (also known as meta-model or a surrogate) of the true function can be used in such applications to alleviate the computation cost. In this paper, we propose a two-stage surrogate-assisted evolutionary approach to address the computational issues arising from using Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection in a wrapper setting for large datasets. We define 'Approximation Usefulness' to capture the necessary conditions to ensure correctness of the EA computations when an approximation is used. Based on this definition, we propose a procedure to construct a lightweight qualitative meta-model by the active selection of data instances. We then use a meta-model to carry out the feature selection task. We apply this procedure to the GA-based algorithm CHC (Cross generational elitist selection, Heterogeneous recombination and Cataclysmic mutation) to create a Qualitative approXimations variant, CHCQX. We show that CHCQX converges faster to feature subset solutions of significantly higher accuracy (as compared to CHC), particularly for large datasets with over 100K instances. We also demonstrate the applicability of the thinking behind our approach more broadly to Swarm Intelligence (SI), another branch of the Evolutionary Computation (EC) paradigm with results of PSOQX, a qualitative approximation adaptation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joachim Schaeffer, Giacomo Galuppini, Jinwook Rhyu, Patrick A. Asinger, Robin Droop, Rolf Findeisen, Richard D. Braatz</p>
<p>Abstract: Batteries are dynamic systems with complicated nonlinear aging, highly dependent on cell design, chemistry, manufacturing, and operational conditions. Prediction of battery cycle life and estimation of aging states is important to accelerate battery R&D, testing, and to further the understanding of how batteries degrade. Beyond testing, battery management systems rely on real-time models and onboard diagnostics and prognostics for safe operation. Estimating the state of health and remaining useful life of a battery is important to optimize performance and use resources optimally.
  This tutorial begins with an overview of first-principles, machine learning, and hybrid battery models. Then, a typical pipeline for the development of interpretable machine learning models is explained and showcased for cycle life prediction from laboratory testing data. We highlight the challenges of machine learning models, motivating the incorporation of physics in hybrid modeling approaches, which are needed to decipher the aging trajectory of batteries but require more data and further work on the physics of battery degradation. The tutorial closes with a discussion on generalization and further research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amin Dada, Marie Bauer, Amanda Butler Contreras, Osman Alperen Kora\c{s}, Constantin Marc Seibold, Kaleb E Smith, Jens Kleesiek</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the potential to significantly contribute to patient care, diagnostics, and administrative processes. Emerging biomedical LLMs address healthcare-specific challenges, including privacy demands and computational constraints. However, evaluation of these models has primarily been limited to non-clinical tasks, which do not reflect the complexity of practical clinical applications. Additionally, there has been no thorough comparison between biomedical and general-domain LLMs for clinical tasks. To fill this gap, we present the Clinical Language Understanding Evaluation (CLUE), a benchmark tailored to evaluate LLMs on real-world clinical tasks. CLUE includes two novel datasets derived from MIMIC IV discharge letters and four existing tasks designed to test the practical applicability of LLMs in healthcare settings. Our evaluation covers several biomedical and general domain LLMs, providing insights into their clinical performance and applicability. CLUE represents a step towards a standardized approach to evaluating and developing LLMs in healthcare to align future model development with the real-world needs of clinical application. We publish our evaluation and data generation scripts: https://github.com/dadaamin/CLUE</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vladan Stojni\'c, Yannis Kalantidis, Giorgos Tolias</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on zero-shot classification, i.e. classification when provided merely with a list of class names. In this paper, we tackle the case of zero-shot classification in the presence of unlabeled data. We leverage the graph structure of the unlabeled data and introduce ZLaP, a method based on label propagation (LP) that utilizes geodesic distances for classification. We tailor LP to graphs containing both text and image features and further propose an efficient method for performing inductive inference based on a dual solution and a sparsification step. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method on 14 common datasets and show that ZLaP outperforms the latest related works.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerrod Wigmore, Brooke Shrader, Eytan Modiano</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a powerful approach to training neural network control policies for stochastic queuing networks (SQN). However, traditional DRL methods rely on offline simulations or static datasets, limiting their real-world application in SQN control. This work proposes Online Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Controls (ODRLC) as an alternative, where an intelligent agent interacts directly with a real environment and learns an optimal control policy from these online interactions. SQNs present a challenge for ODRLC due to the unbounded nature of the queues within the network resulting in an unbounded state-space. An unbounded state-space is particularly challenging for neural network policies as neural networks are notoriously poor at extrapolating to unseen states. To address this challenge, we propose an intervention-assisted framework that leverages strategic interventions from known stable policies to ensure the queue sizes remain bounded. This framework combines the learning power of neural networks with the guaranteed stability of classical control policies for SQNs. We introduce a method to design these intervention-assisted policies to ensure strong stability of the network. Furthermore, we extend foundational DRL theorems for intervention-assisted policies and develop two practical algorithms specifically for ODRLC of SQNs. Finally, we demonstrate through experiments that our proposed algorithms outperform both classical control approaches and prior ODRLC algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giovanni Ciatto, Andrea Agiollo, Matteo Magnini, Andrea Omicini</p>
<p>Abstract: Background. Endowing intelligent systems with semantic data commonly requires designing and instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge. Especially in the early phases, those activities are typically performed manually by human experts possibly leveraging on their own experience. The resulting process is therefore time-consuming, error-prone, and often biased by the personal background of the ontology designer. Objective. To mitigate that issue, we propose a novel domain-independent approach to automatically instantiate ontologies with domain-specific knowledge, by leveraging on large language models (LLMs) as oracles. Method. Starting from (i) an initial schema composed by inter-related classes andproperties and (ii) a set of query templates, our method queries the LLM multi- ple times, and generates instances for both classes and properties from its replies. Thus, the ontology is automatically filled with domain-specific knowledge, compliant to the initial schema. As a result, the ontology is quickly and automatically enriched with manifold instances, which experts may consider to keep, adjust, discard, or complement according to their own needs and expertise. Contribution. We formalise our method in general way and instantiate it over various LLMs, as well as on a concrete case study. We report experiments rooted in the nutritional domain where an ontology of food meals and their ingredients is semi-automatically instantiated from scratch, starting from a categorisation of meals and their relationships. There, we analyse the quality of the generated ontologies and compare ontologies attained by exploiting different LLMs. Finally, we provide a SWOT analysis of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vishaal Udandarao, Ameya Prabhu, Adhiraj Ghosh, Yash Sharma, Philip H. S. Torr, Adel Bibi, Samuel Albanie, Matthias Bethge</p>
<p>Abstract: Web-crawled pretraining datasets underlie the impressive "zero-shot" evaluation performance of multimodal models, such as CLIP for classification/retrieval and Stable-Diffusion for image generation. However, it is unclear how meaningful the notion of "zero-shot" generalization is for such multimodal models, as it is not known to what extent their pretraining datasets encompass the downstream concepts targeted for during "zero-shot" evaluation. In this work, we ask: How is the performance of multimodal models on downstream concepts influenced by the frequency of these concepts in their pretraining datasets? We comprehensively investigate this question across 34 models and five standard pretraining datasets (CC-3M, CC-12M, YFCC-15M, LAION-400M, LAION-Aesthetics), generating over 300GB of data artifacts. We consistently find that, far from exhibiting "zero-shot" generalization, multimodal models require exponentially more data to achieve linear improvements in downstream "zero-shot" performance, following a sample inefficient log-linear scaling trend. This trend persists even when controlling for sample-level similarity between pretraining and downstream datasets, and testing on purely synthetic data distributions. Furthermore, upon benchmarking models on long-tailed data sampled based on our analysis, we demonstrate that multimodal models across the board perform poorly. We contribute this long-tail test set as the "Let it Wag!" benchmark to further research in this direction. Taken together, our study reveals an exponential need for training data which implies that the key to "zero-shot" generalization capabilities under large-scale training paradigms remains to be found.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Botao Ren, Botian Xu, Yifan Pu, Jingyi Wang, Zhidong Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: In many image domains, the spatial distribution of objects in a scene exhibits meaningful patterns governed by their semantic relationships. In most modern detection pipelines, however, the detection proposals are processed independently, overlooking the underlying relationships between objects. In this work, we introduce a transformer-based approach to capture these inter-object relationships to refine classification and regression outcomes for detected objects. Building on two-stage detectors, we tokenize the region of interest (RoI) proposals to be processed by a transformer encoder. Specific spatial and geometric relations are incorporated into the attention weights and adaptively modulated and regularized. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent performance improvement on three benchmarks including DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5, and HRSC 2016, especially ranking first on both DOTA-v1.5 and HRSC 2016. Specifically, our new method has an increase of 1.59 mAP on DOTA-v1.0, 4.88 mAP on DOTA-v1.5, and 2.1 mAP on HRSC 2016, respectively, compared to the baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Disentangling attributes of various sensory signals is central to human-like perception and reasoning and a critical task for higher-order cognitive and neuro-symbolic AI systems. An elegant approach to represent this intricate factorization is via high-dimensional holographic vectors drawing on brain-inspired vector symbolic architectures. However, holographic factorization involves iterative computation with high-dimensional matrix-vector multiplications and suffers from non-convergence problems.
  In this paper, we present H3DFact, a heterogeneous 3D integrated in-memory compute engine capable of efficiently factorizing high-dimensional holographic representations. H3DFact exploits the computation-in-superposition capability of holographic vectors and the intrinsic stochasticity associated with memristive-based 3D compute-in-memory. Evaluated on large-scale factorization and perceptual problems, H3DFact demonstrates superior capability in factorization accuracy and operational capacity by up to five orders of magnitude, with 5.5x compute density, 1.2x energy efficiency improvements, and 5.9x less silicon footprint compared to iso-capacity 2D designs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo\~ao Vitorino, Miguel Silva, Eva Maia, Isabel Pra\c{c}a</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing cybersecurity threats make it essential to use high-quality data to train Machine Learning (ML) models for network traffic analysis, without noisy or missing data. By selecting the most relevant features for cyber-attack detection, it is possible to improve both the robustness and computational efficiency of the models used in a cybersecurity system. This work presents a feature selection and consensus process that combines multiple methods and applies them to several network datasets. Two different feature sets were selected and were used to train multiple ML models with regular and adversarial training. Finally, an adversarial evasion robustness benchmark was performed to analyze the reliability of the different feature sets and their impact on the susceptibility of the models to adversarial examples. By using an improved dataset with more data diversity, selecting the best time-related features and a more specific feature set, and performing adversarial training, the ML models were able to achieve a better adversarially robust generalization. The robustness of the models was significantly improved without their generalization to regular traffic flows being affected, without increases of false alarms, and without requiring too many computational resources, which enables a reliable detection of suspicious activity and perturbed traffic flows in enterprise computer networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dexterous manipulation, often facilitated by multi-fingered robotic hands, holds solid impact for real-world applications. Soft robotic hands, due to their compliant nature, offer flexibility and adaptability during object grasping and manipulation. Yet, benefits come with challenges, particularly in the control development for finger coordination. Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be employed to train object-specific in-hand manipulation policies, but limiting adaptability and generalizability. We introduce a Continual Policy Distillation (CPD) framework to acquire a versatile controller for in-hand manipulation, to rotate different objects in shape and size within a four-fingered soft gripper. The framework leverages Policy Distillation (PD) to transfer knowledge from expert policies to a continually evolving student policy network. Exemplar-based rehearsal methods are then integrated to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enhance generalization. The performance of the CPD framework over various replay strategies demonstrates its effectiveness in consolidating knowledge from multiple experts and achieving versatile and adaptive behaviours for in-hand manipulation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enrico Donato, Egidio Falotico, Thomas George Thuruthel</p>
<p>Abstract: Perception is essential for the active interaction of physical agents with the external environment. The integration of multiple sensory modalities, such as touch and vision, enhances this perceptual process, creating a more comprehensive and robust understanding of the world. Such fusion is particularly useful for highly deformable bodies such as soft robots. Developing a compact, yet comprehensive state representation from multi-sensory inputs can pave the way for the development of complex control strategies. This paper introduces a perception model that harmonizes data from diverse modalities to build a holistic state representation and assimilate essential information. The model relies on the causality between sensory input and robotic actions, employing a generative model to efficiently compress fused information and predict the next observation. We present, for the first time, a study on how touch can be predicted from vision and proprioception on soft robots, the importance of the cross-modal generation and why this is essential for soft robotic interactions in unstructured environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcus Schwarting, Nathan A. Seifert, Michael J. Davis, Ben Blaiszik, Ian Foster, Kirill Prozument</p>
<p>Abstract: Rotational spectroscopy is the most accurate method for determining structures of molecules in the gas phase. It is often assumed that a rotational spectrum is a unique "fingerprint" of a molecule. The availability of large molecular databases and the development of artificial intelligence methods for spectroscopy makes the testing of this assumption timely. In this paper, we pose the determination of molecular structures from rotational spectra as an inverse problem. Within this framework, we adopt a funnel-based approach to search for molecular twins, which are two or more molecules, which have similar rotational spectra but distinctly different molecular structures. We demonstrate that there are twins within standard levels of computational accuracy by generating rotational constants for many molecules from several large molecular databases, indicating the inverse problem is ill-posed. However, some twins can be distinguished by increasing the accuracy of the theoretical methods or by performing additional experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Can computers perceive the physical properties of objects solely through vision? Research in cognitive science and vision science has shown that humans excel at identifying materials and estimating their physical properties based purely on visual appearance. In this paper, we present a novel approach for dense prediction of the physical properties of objects using a collection of images. Inspired by how humans reason about physics through vision, we leverage large language models to propose candidate materials for each object. We then construct a language-embedded point cloud and estimate the physical properties of each 3D point using a zero-shot kernel regression approach. Our method is accurate, annotation-free, and applicable to any object in the open world. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in various physical property reasoning tasks, such as estimating the mass of common objects, as well as other properties like friction and hardness.</p>

<p>Abstract: This technical report delves into an in-depth exploration of adversarial attacks specifically targeted at Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) utilized for image classification. The study also investigates defense mechanisms aimed at bolstering the robustness of machine learning models. The research focuses on comprehending the ramifications of two prominent attack methodologies: the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and the Carlini-Wagner (CW) approach. These attacks are examined concerning three pre-trained image classifiers: Resnext50_32x4d, DenseNet-201, and VGG-19, utilizing the Tiny-ImageNet dataset. Furthermore, the study proposes the robustness of defensive distillation as a defense mechanism to counter FGSM and CW attacks. This defense mechanism is evaluated using the CIFAR-10 dataset, where CNN models, specifically resnet101 and Resnext50_32x4d, serve as the teacher and student models, respectively. The proposed defensive distillation model exhibits effectiveness in thwarting attacks such as FGSM. However, it is noted to remain susceptible to more sophisticated techniques like the CW attack. The document presents a meticulous validation of the proposed scheme. It provides detailed and comprehensive results, elucidating the efficacy and limitations of the defense mechanisms employed. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, the study offers insights into the dynamics of adversarial attacks on DNNs, as well as the effectiveness of defensive strategies in mitigating their impact.</p>

<p>Abstract: Several companies--such as Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI--have deployed techniques to watermark AI-generated content to enable proactive detection. However, existing literature mainly focuses on user-agnostic detection. Attribution aims to further trace back the user of a generative-AI service who generated a given content detected as AI-generated. Despite its growing importance, attribution is largely unexplored. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by providing the first systematic study on watermark-based, user-aware detection and attribution of AI-generated content. Specifically, we theoretically study the detection and attribution performance via rigorous probabilistic analysis. Moreover, we develop an efficient algorithm to select watermarks for the users to enhance attribution performance. Both our theoretical and empirical results show that watermark-based detection and attribution inherit the accuracy and (non-)robustness properties of the watermarking method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Qiu, Lingxiao Wang, Chenjia Bai, Zhuoran Yang, Zhaoran Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In view of its power in extracting feature representation, contrastive self-supervised learning has been successfully integrated into the practice of (deep) reinforcement learning (RL), leading to efficient policy learning in various applications. Despite its tremendous empirical successes, the understanding of contrastive learning for RL remains elusive. To narrow such a gap, we study how RL can be empowered by contrastive learning in a class of Markov decision processes (MDPs) and Markov games (MGs) with low-rank transitions. For both models, we propose to extract the correct feature representations of the low-rank model by minimizing a contrastive loss. Moreover, under the online setting, we propose novel upper confidence bound (UCB)-type algorithms that incorporate such a contrastive loss with online RL algorithms for MDPs or MGs. We further theoretically prove that our algorithm recovers the true representations and simultaneously achieves sample efficiency in learning the optimal policy and Nash equilibrium in MDPs and MGs. We also provide empirical studies to demonstrate the efficacy of the UCB-based contrastive learning method for RL. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first provably efficient online RL algorithm that incorporates contrastive learning for representation learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianxiang Yu, Qingqing Ge, Xiang Li, Aoying Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Heterogeneous graph contrastive learning has received wide attention recently. Some existing methods use meta-paths, which are sequences of object types that capture semantic relationships between objects, to construct contrastive views. However, most of them ignore the rich meta-path context information that describes how two objects are connected by meta-paths. Further, they fail to distinguish negative samples, which could adversely affect the model performance. To address the problems, we propose MEOW, which considers both meta-path contexts and weighted negative samples. Specifically, MEOW constructs a coarse view and a fine-grained view for contrast. The former reflects which objects are connected by meta-paths, while the latter uses meta-path contexts and characterizes details on how the objects are connected. Then, we theoretically analyze the InfoNCE loss and recognize its limitations for computing gradients of negative samples. To better distinguish negative samples, we learn hard-valued weights for them based on node clustering and use prototypical contrastive learning to pull close embeddings of nodes in the same cluster. In addition, we propose a variant model AdaMEOW that adaptively learns soft-valued weights of negative samples to further improve node representation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show the superiority of MEOW and AdaMEOW against other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Minimizing the difference of two submodular (DS) functions is a problem that naturally occurs in various machine learning problems. Although it is well known that a DS problem can be equivalently formulated as the minimization of the difference of two convex (DC) functions, existing algorithms do not fully exploit this connection. A classical algorithm for DC problems is called the DC algorithm (DCA). We introduce variants of DCA and its complete form (CDCA) that we apply to the DC program corresponding to DS minimization. We extend existing convergence properties of DCA, and connect them to convergence properties on the DS problem. Our results on DCA match the theoretical guarantees satisfied by existing DS algorithms, while providing a more complete characterization of convergence properties. In the case of CDCA, we obtain a stronger local minimality guarantee. Our numerical results show that our proposed algorithms outperform existing baselines on two applications: speech corpus selection and feature selection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Bang Zheng, Xi-Le Zhao, Junhua Zeng, Chao Li, Qibin Zhao, Heng-Chao Li, Ting-Zhu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Tensor network (TN) representation is a powerful technique for computer vision and machine learning. TN structure search (TN-SS) aims to search for a customized structure to achieve a compact representation, which is a challenging NP-hard problem. Recent "sampling-evaluation"-based methods require sampling an extensive collection of structures and evaluating them one by one, resulting in prohibitively high computational costs. To address this issue, we propose a novel TN paradigm, named SVD-inspired TN decomposition (SVDinsTN), which allows us to efficiently solve the TN-SS problem from a regularized modeling perspective, eliminating the repeated structure evaluations. To be specific, by inserting a diagonal factor for each edge of the fully-connected TN, SVDinsTN allows us to calculate TN cores and diagonal factors simultaneously, with the factor sparsity revealing a compact TN structure. In theory, we prove a convergence guarantee for the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves approximately 100 to 1000 times acceleration compared to the state-of-the-art TN-SS methods while maintaining a comparable level of representation ability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Yu, Toni J. B. Liu, Albert Tseng, Christopher De Sa</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperbolic space has proven to be well-suited for capturing hierarchical relations in data, such as trees and directed acyclic graphs. Prior work introduced the concept of entailment cones, which uses partial orders defined by nested cones in the Poincar\'e ball to model hierarchies. Here, we introduce the ``shadow cones" framework, a physics-inspired entailment cone construction. Specifically, we model partial orders as subset relations between shadows formed by a light source and opaque objects in hyperbolic space. The shadow cones framework generalizes entailment cones to a broad class of formulations and hyperbolic space models beyond the Poincar\'e ball. This results in clear advantages over existing constructions: for example, shadow cones possess better optimization properties over constructions limited to the Poincar\'e ball. Our experiments on datasets of various sizes and hierarchical structures show that shadow cones consistently and significantly outperform existing entailment cone constructions. These results indicate that shadow cones are an effective way to model partial orders in hyperbolic space, offering physically intuitive and novel insights about the nature of such structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noam Levi, Yaron Oz</p>
<p>Abstract: We study universal traits which emerge both in real-world complex datasets, as well as in artificially generated ones. Our approach is to analogize data to a physical system and employ tools from statistical physics and Random Matrix Theory (RMT) to reveal their underlying structure. We focus on the feature-feature covariance matrix, analyzing both its local and global eigenvalue statistics. Our main observations are: (i) The power-law scalings that the bulk of its eigenvalues exhibit are vastly different for uncorrelated normally distributed data compared to real-world data, (ii) this scaling behavior can be completely modeled by generating Gaussian data with long range correlations, (iii) both generated and real-world datasets lie in the same universality class from the RMT perspective, as chaotic rather than integrable systems, (iv) the expected RMT statistical behavior already manifests for empirical covariance matrices at dataset sizes significantly smaller than those conventionally used for real-world training, and can be related to the number of samples required to approximate the population power-law scaling behavior, (v) the Shannon entropy is correlated with local RMT structure and eigenvalues scaling, is substantially smaller in strongly correlated datasets compared to uncorrelated ones, and requires fewer samples to reach the distribution entropy. These findings show that with sufficient sample size, the Gram matrix of natural image datasets can be well approximated by a Wishart random matrix with a simple covariance structure, opening the door to rigorous studies of neural network dynamics and generalization which rely on the data Gram matrix.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nico Uhlemann, Felix Fent, Markus Lienkamp</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we assess the state of the art in pedestrian trajectory prediction within the context of generating single trajectories, a critical aspect aligning with the requirements in autonomous systems. The evaluation is conducted on the widely-used ETH/UCY dataset where the Average Displacement Error (ADE) and the Final Displacement Error (FDE) are reported. Alongside this, we perform an ablation study to investigate the impact of the observed motion history on prediction performance. To evaluate the scalability of each approach when confronted with varying amounts of agents, the inference time of each model is measured. Following a quantitative analysis, the resulting predictions are compared in a qualitative manner, giving insight into the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches. The results demonstrate that although a constant velocity model (CVM) provides a good approximation of the overall dynamics in the majority of cases, additional features need to be incorporated to reflect common pedestrian behavior observed. Therefore, this study presents a data-driven analysis with the intent to guide the future development of pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sergio Calvo-Ordonez, Chun-Wun Cheng, Jiahao Huang, Lipei Zhang, Guang Yang, Carola-Bibiane Schonlieb, Angelica I Aviles-Rivero</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models stand as a critical tool in generative modelling, enabling the generation of complex data distributions. This family of generative models yields record-breaking performance in tasks such as image synthesis, video generation, and molecule design. Despite their capabilities, their efficiency, especially in the reverse process, remains a challenge due to slow convergence rates and high computational costs. In this paper, we introduce an approach that leverages continuous dynamical systems to design a novel denoising network for diffusion models that is more parameter-efficient, exhibits faster convergence, and demonstrates increased noise robustness. Experimenting with Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), our framework operates with approximately a quarter of the parameters, and $\sim$ 30\% of the Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) compared to standard U-Nets in DDPMs. Furthermore, our model is notably faster in inference than the baseline when measured in fair and equal conditions. We also provide a mathematical intuition as to why our proposed reverse process is faster as well as a mathematical discussion of the empirical tradeoffs in the denoising downstream task. Finally, we argue that our method is compatible with existing performance enhancement techniques, enabling further improvements in efficiency, quality, and speed.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming computational materials science, improving the prediction of material properties, and accelerating the discovery of novel materials. Recently, publicly available material data repositories have grown rapidly. This growth encompasses not only more materials, but also a greater variety and quantity of their associated properties. Existing machine learning efforts in materials science focus primarily on single-modality tasks, i.e., relationships between materials and a single physical property, thus not taking advantage of the rich and multimodal set of material properties. Here, we introduce Multimodal Learning for Materials (MultiMat), which enables self-supervised multi-modality training of foundation models for materials. We demonstrate our framework's potential using data from the Materials Project database on multiple axes: (i) MultiMat achieves state-of-the-art performance for challenging material property prediction tasks; (ii) MultiMat enables novel and accurate material discovery via latent space similarity, enabling screening for stable materials with desired properties; and (iii) MultiMat encodes interpretable emergent features that may provide novel scientific insights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aristotelis Ballas, Vasileios Papapanagiotou, Christos Diou</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the recent increase in research activity, deep-learning models have not yet been widely accepted in several real-world settings, such as medicine. The shortage of high-quality annotated data often hinders the development of robust and generalizable models, which do not suffer from degraded effectiveness when presented with out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) offers a potential solution to labeled data scarcity, as it takes advantage of unlabeled data to increase model effectiveness and robustness. However, the selection of appropriate transformations during the learning process is not a trivial task and even breaks down the ability of the network to extract meaningful information. In this research, we propose uncovering the optimal augmentations for applying contrastive learning in 1D phonocardiogram (PCG) classification. We perform an extensive comparative evaluation of a wide range of audio-based augmentations, evaluate models on multiple datasets across downstream tasks, and report on the impact of each augmentation. We demonstrate that depending on its training distribution, the effectiveness of a fully-supervised model can degrade up to 32%, while SSL models only lose up to 10% or even improve in some cases. We argue and experimentally demonstrate that, contrastive SSL pretraining can assist in providing robust classifiers which can generalize to unseen, OOD data, without relying on time- and labor-intensive annotation processes by medical experts. Furthermore, the proposed evaluation protocol sheds light on the most promising and appropriate augmentations for robust PCG signal processing, by calculating their effect size on model training. Finally, we provide researchers and practitioners with a roadmap towards producing robust models for PCG classification, in addition to an open-source codebase for developing novel approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vihari Piratla, Juyeon Heo, Katherine M. Collins, Sukriti Singh, Adrian Weller</p>
<p>Abstract: Model explanations can be valuable for interpreting and debugging predictive models. We study a specific kind called Concept Explanations, where the goal is to interpret a model using human-understandable concepts. Although popular for their easy interpretation, concept explanations are known to be noisy. We begin our work by identifying various sources of uncertainty in the estimation pipeline that lead to such noise. We then propose an uncertainty-aware Bayesian estimation method to address these issues, which readily improved the quality of explanations. We demonstrate with theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation that explanations computed by our method are robust to train-time choices while also being label-efficient. Further, our method proved capable of recovering relevant concepts amongst a bank of thousands, in an evaluation with real-datasets and off-the-shelf models, demonstrating its scalability. We believe the improved quality of uncertainty-aware concept explanations make them a strong candidate for more reliable model interpretation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Yaqub, Shahzad Ahmad, Malik Abdul Manan, Imran Shabir Chuhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time traffic flow prediction holds significant importance within the domain of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The task of achieving a balance between prediction precision and computational efficiency presents a significant challenge. In this article, we present a novel deep-learning method called Federated Learning and Asynchronous Graph Convolutional Network (FLAGCN). Our framework incorporates the principles of asynchronous graph convolutional networks with federated learning to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of real-time traffic flow prediction. The FLAGCN model employs a spatial-temporal graph convolution technique to asynchronously address spatio-temporal dependencies within traffic data effectively. To efficiently handle the computational requirements associated with this deep learning model, this study used a graph federated learning technique known as GraphFL. This approach is designed to facilitate the training process. The experimental results obtained from conducting tests on two distinct traffic datasets demonstrate that the utilization of FLAGCN leads to the optimization of both training and inference durations while maintaining a high level of prediction accuracy. FLAGCN outperforms existing models with significant improvements by achieving up to approximately 6.85% reduction in RMSE, 20.45% reduction in MAPE, compared to the best-performing existing models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongping Ye, Xiaobing Pei, Haoran Yang, Ruiqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Hypergraphs provide an effective modeling approach for modeling high-order relationships in many real-world datasets. To capture such complex relationships, several hypergraph neural networks have been proposed for learning hypergraph structure, which propagate information from nodes to hyperedges and then from hyperedges back to nodes. However, most existing methods focus on information propagation between hyperedges and nodes, neglecting the interactions among hyperedges themselves. In this paper, we propose HeIHNN, a hyperedge interaction-aware hypergraph neural network, which captures the interactions among hyperedges during the convolution process and introduce a novel mechanism to enhance information flow between hyperedges and nodes. Specifically, HeIHNN integrates the interactions between hyperedges into the hypergraph convolution by constructing a three-stage information propagation process. After propagating information from nodes to hyperedges, we introduce a hyperedge-level convolution to update the hyperedge embeddings. Finally, the embeddings that capture rich information from the interaction among hyperedges will be utilized to update the node embeddings. Additionally, we introduce a hyperedge outlier removal mechanism in the information propagation stages between nodes and hyperedges, which dynamically adjusts the hypergraph structure using the learned embeddings, effectively removing outliers. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets show the competitive performance of HeIHNN compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangming Li, Max Ruiz Luyten, Mihaela van der Schaar</p>
<p>Abstract: The essence of score-based generative models (SGM) is to optimize a score-based model towards the score function. However, we show that noisy samples incur another objective function, rather than the one with score function, which will wrongly optimize the model. To address this problem, we first consider a new setting where every noisy sample is paired with a risk vector, indicating the data quality (e.g., noise level). This setting is very common in real-world applications, especially for medical and sensor data. Then, we introduce risk-sensitive SDE, a type of stochastic differential equation (SDE) parameterized by the risk vector. With this tool, we aim to minimize a measure called perturbation instability, which we define to quantify the negative impact of noisy samples on optimization. We will prove that zero instability measure is only achievable in the case where noisy samples are caused by Gaussian perturbation. For non-Gaussian cases, we will also provide its optimal coefficients that minimize the misguidance of noisy samples. To apply risk-sensitive SDE in practice, we extend widely used diffusion models to their risk-sensitive versions and derive a risk-free loss that is efficient for computation. We also have conducted numerical experiments to confirm the validity of our theorems and show that they let SGM be robust to noisy samples for optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate the computational limits of the memory retrieval dynamics of modern Hopfield models from the fine-grained complexity analysis. Our key contribution is the characterization of a phase transition behavior in the efficiency of all possible modern Hopfield models based on the norm of patterns. Specifically, we establish an upper bound criterion for the norm of input query patterns and memory patterns. Only below this criterion, sub-quadratic (efficient) variants of the modern Hopfield model exist, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). To showcase our theory, we provide a formal example of efficient constructions of modern Hopfield models using low-rank approximation when the efficient criterion holds. This includes a derivation of a lower bound on the computational time, scaling linearly with $\max\{$\# of stored memory patterns, length of input query sequence$\}$. In addition, we prove its memory retrieval error bound and exponential memory capacity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nate Gillman, Michael Freeman, Daksh Aggarwal, Chia-Hong Hsu, Calvin Luo, Yonglong Tian, Chen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: As synthetic data becomes higher quality and proliferates on the internet, machine learning models are increasingly trained on a mix of human- and machine-generated data. Despite the successful stories of using synthetic data for representation learning, using synthetic data for generative model training creates "self-consuming loops" which may lead to training instability or even collapse, unless certain conditions are met. Our paper aims to stabilize self-consuming generative model training. Our theoretical results demonstrate that by introducing an idealized correction function, which maps a data point to be more likely under the true data distribution, self-consuming loops can be made exponentially more stable. We then propose self-correction functions, which rely on expert knowledge (e.g. the laws of physics programmed in a simulator), and aim to approximate the idealized corrector automatically and at scale. We empirically validate the effectiveness of self-correcting self-consuming loops on the challenging human motion synthesis task, and observe that it successfully avoids model collapse, even when the ratio of synthetic data to real data is as high as 100%.</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore machine unlearning (MU) in the domain of large language models (LLMs), referred to as LLM unlearning. This initiative aims to eliminate undesirable data influence (e.g., sensitive or illegal information) and the associated model capabilities, while maintaining the integrity of essential knowledge generation and not affecting causally unrelated information. We envision LLM unlearning becoming a pivotal element in the life-cycle management of LLMs, potentially standing as an essential foundation for developing generative AI that is not only safe, secure, and trustworthy, but also resource-efficient without the need of full retraining. We navigate the unlearning landscape in LLMs from conceptual formulation, methodologies, metrics, and applications. In particular, we highlight the often-overlooked aspects of existing LLM unlearning research, e.g., unlearning scope, data-model interaction, and multifaceted efficacy assessment. We also draw connections between LLM unlearning and related areas such as model editing, influence functions, model explanation, adversarial training, and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we outline an effective assessment framework for LLM unlearning and explore its applications in copyright and privacy safeguards and sociotechnical harm reduction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vijayalakshmi Saravanan, Perry Siehien, Shinjae Yoo, Hubertus Van Dam, Thomas Flynn, Christopher Kelly, Khaled Z Ibrahim</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting abrupt changes in real-time data streams from scientific simulations presents a challenging task, demanding the deployment of accurate and efficient algorithms. Identifying change points in live data stream involves continuous scrutiny of incoming observations for deviations in their statistical characteristics, particularly in high-volume data scenarios. Maintaining a balance between sudden change detection and minimizing false alarms is vital. Many existing algorithms for this purpose rely on known probability distributions, limiting their feasibility. In this study, we introduce the Kernel-based Cumulative Sum (KCUSUM) algorithm, a non-parametric extension of the traditional Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) method, which has gained prominence for its efficacy in online change point detection under less restrictive conditions. KCUSUM splits itself by comparing incoming samples directly with reference samples and computes a statistic grounded in the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) non-parametric framework. This approach extends KCUSUM's pertinence to scenarios where only reference samples are available, such as atomic trajectories of proteins in vacuum, facilitating the detection of deviations from the reference sample without prior knowledge of the data's underlying distribution. Furthermore, by harnessing MMD's inherent random-walk structure, we can theoretically analyze KCUSUM's performance across various use cases, including metrics like expected delay and mean runtime to false alarms. Finally, we discuss real-world use cases from scientific simulations such as NWChem CODAR and protein folding data, demonstrating KCUSUM's practical effectiveness in online change point detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Su, Zhi Tian, Xiaoyu Shen, Xunliang Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling law principles indicate a power-law correlation between loss and variables such as model size, dataset size, and computational resources utilized during training. These principles play a vital role in optimizing various aspects of model pre-training, ultimately contributing to the success of large language models such as GPT-4, Llama and Gemini. However, the original scaling law paper by OpenAI did not disclose the complete details necessary to derive the precise scaling law formulas, and their conclusions are only based on models containing up to 1.5 billion parameters. Though some subsequent works attempt to unveil these details and scale to larger models, they often neglect the training dependency of important factors such as the learning rate, context length and batch size, leading to their failure to establish a reliable formula for predicting the test loss trajectory. In this technical report, we confirm that the scaling law formulations proposed in the original OpenAI paper remain valid when scaling the model size up to 33 billion, but the constant coefficients in these formulas vary significantly with the experiment setup. We meticulously identify influential factors and provide transparent, step-by-step instructions to estimate all constant terms in scaling-law formulas by training on models with only 1M~60M parameters. Using these estimated formulas, we showcase the capability to accurately predict various attributes for models with up to 33B parameters before their training, including (1) the minimum possible test loss; (2) the minimum required training steps and processed tokens to achieve a specific loss; (3) the critical batch size with an optimal time/computation trade-off at any loss value; and (4) the complete test loss trajectory with arbitrary batch size.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing neural operator architectures face challenges when solving multiphysics problems with coupled partial differential equations (PDEs), due to complex geometries, interactions between physical variables, and the lack of large amounts of high-resolution training data. To address these issues, we propose Codomain Attention Neural Operator (CoDA-NO), which tokenizes functions along the codomain or channel space, enabling self-supervised learning or pretraining of multiple PDE systems. Specifically, we extend positional encoding, self-attention, and normalization layers to the function space. CoDA-NO can learn representations of different PDE systems with a single model. We evaluate CoDA-NO's potential as a backbone for learning multiphysics PDEs over multiple systems by considering few-shot learning settings. On complex downstream tasks with limited data, such as fluid flow simulations and fluid-structure interactions, we found CoDA-NO to outperform existing methods on the few-shot learning task by over $36\%$.

<p>Abstract: To understand the risks posed by a new AI system, we must understand what it can and cannot do. Building on prior work, we introduce a programme of new "dangerous capability" evaluations and pilot them on Gemini 1.0 models. Our evaluations cover four areas: (1) persuasion and deception; (2) cyber-security; (3) self-proliferation; and (4) self-reasoning. We do not find evidence of strong dangerous capabilities in the models we evaluated, but we flag early warning signs. Our goal is to help advance a rigorous science of dangerous capability evaluation, in preparation for future models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoxuan Bai, Jingxuan Yang, Weiduo Gong, Yi Zhang, Qiujing Lu, Shuo Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent systems are increasingly integral to our daily lives, yet rare safety-critical events present significant latent threats to their practical deployment. Addressing this challenge hinges on accurately predicting the probability of safety-critical events occurring within a given time step from the current state, a metric we define as 'criticality'. The complexity of predicting criticality arises from the extreme data imbalance caused by rare events in high dimensional variables associated with the rare events, a challenge we refer to as the curse of rarity. Existing methods tend to be either overly conservative or prone to overlooking safety-critical events, thus struggling to achieve both high precision and recall rates, which severely limits their applicability. This study endeavors to develop a criticality prediction model that excels in both precision and recall rates for evaluating the criticality of safety-critical autonomous systems. We propose a multi-stage learning framework designed to progressively densify the dataset, mitigating the curse of rarity across stages. To validate our approach, we evaluate it in two cases: lunar lander and bipedal walker scenarios. The results demonstrate that our method surpasses traditional approaches, providing a more accurate and dependable assessment of criticality in intelligent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Fischer, Marko Orescanin, Justin Loomis, Patrick McClure</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is an approach to training machine learning models that takes advantage of multiple distributed datasets while maintaining data privacy and reducing communication costs associated with sharing local datasets. Aggregation strategies have been developed to pool or fuse the weights and biases of distributed deterministic models; however, modern deterministic deep learning (DL) models are often poorly calibrated and lack the ability to communicate a measure of epistemic uncertainty in prediction, which is desirable for remote sensing platforms and safety-critical applications. Conversely, Bayesian DL models are often well calibrated and capable of quantifying and communicating a measure of epistemic uncertainty along with a competitive prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, because the weights and biases in Bayesian DL models are defined by a probability distribution, simple application of the aggregation methods associated with FL schemes for deterministic models is either impossible or results in sub-optimal performance. In this work, we use independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID partitions of the CIFAR-10 dataset and a fully variational ResNet-20 architecture to analyze six different aggregation strategies for Bayesian DL models. Additionally, we analyze the traditional federated averaging approach applied to an approximate Bayesian Monte Carlo dropout model as a lightweight alternative to more complex variational inference methods in FL. We show that aggregation strategy is a key hyperparameter in the design of a Bayesian FL system with downstream effects on accuracy, calibration, uncertainty quantification, training stability, and client compute requirements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqi Shao, Michael G. H. Bell, Ze Wang, D. Glenn Geers, Xusheng Yao, Junbin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate, and effective traffic forecasting is vital for smart traffic systems, crucial in urban traffic planning and management. Current Spatio-Temporal Transformer models, despite their prediction capabilities, struggle with balancing computational efficiency and accuracy, favoring global over local information, and handling spatial and temporal data separately, limiting insight into complex interactions. We introduce the Criss-Crossed Dual-Stream Enhanced Rectified Transformer model (CCDSReFormer), which includes three innovative modules: Enhanced Rectified Spatial Self-attention (ReSSA), Enhanced Rectified Delay Aware Self-attention (ReDASA), and Enhanced Rectified Temporal Self-attention (ReTSA). These modules aim to lower computational needs via sparse attention, focus on local information for better traffic dynamics understanding, and merge spatial and temporal insights through a unique learning method. Extensive tests on six real-world datasets highlight CCDSReFormer's superior performance. An ablation study also confirms the significant impact of each component on the model's predictive accuracy, showcasing our model's ability to forecast traffic flow effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhishang Luo, Truong Son Hy, Puoya Tabaghi, Donghyeon Koh, Michael Defferrard, Elahe Rezaei, Ryan Carey, Rhett Davis, Rajeev Jain, Yusu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The run-time for optimization tools used in chip design has grown with the complexity of designs to the point where it can take several days to go through one design cycle which has become a bottleneck. Designers want fast tools that can quickly give feedback on a design. Using the input and output data of the tools from past designs, one can attempt to build a machine learning model that predicts the outcome of a design in significantly shorter time than running the tool. The accuracy of such models is affected by the representation of the design data, which is usually a netlist that describes the elements of the digital circuit and how they are connected. Graph representations for the netlist together with graph neural networks have been investigated for such models. However, the characteristics of netlists pose several challenges for existing graph learning frameworks, due to the large number of nodes and the importance of long-range interactions between nodes. To address these challenges, we represent the netlist as a directed hypergraph and propose a Directional Equivariant Hypergraph Neural Network (DE-HNN) for the effective learning of (directed) hypergraphs. Theoretically, we show that our DE-HNN can universally approximate any node or hyperedge based function that satisfies certain permutation equivariant and invariant properties natural for directed hypergraphs. We compare the proposed DE-HNN with several State-of-the-art (SOTA) machine learning models for (hyper)graphs and netlists, and show that the DE-HNN significantly outperforms them in predicting the outcome of optimized place-and-route tools directly from the input netlists.

To accelerate research and reduce the cost of experiments, we introduce training methods for CIFAR-10 which reach 94% accuracy in 3.29 seconds, 95% in 10.4 seconds, and 96% in 46.3 seconds, when run on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.

<p>Abstract: Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) provides an efficient and tailored method for assessing the proficiency of examinees, by dynamically adjusting test questions based on their performance. Widely adopted across diverse fields like education, healthcare, sports, and sociology, CAT has revolutionized testing practices. While traditional methods rely on psychometrics and statistics, the increasing complexity of large-scale testing has spurred the integration of machine learning techniques. This paper aims to provide a machine learning-focused survey on CAT, presenting a fresh perspective on this adaptive testing method. By examining the test question selection algorithm at the heart of CAT's adaptivity, we shed light on its functionality. Furthermore, we delve into cognitive diagnosis models, question bank construction, and test control within CAT, exploring how machine learning can optimize these components. Through an analysis of current methods, strengths, limitations, and challenges, we strive to develop robust, fair, and efficient CAT systems. By bridging psychometric-driven CAT research with machine learning, this survey advocates for a more inclusive and interdisciplinary approach to the future of adaptive testing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harry Dong, Beidi Chen, Yuejie Chi</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of transformer-based large language models (LLMs), they have been applied to many fields due to their remarkable utility, but this comes at a considerable computational cost at deployment. Fortunately, some methods such as pruning or constructing a mixture of experts (MoE) aim at exploiting sparsity in transformer feedforward (FF) blocks to gain boosts in speed and reduction in memory requirements. However, these techniques can be very costly and inflexible in practice, as they often require training or are restricted to specific types of architectures. To address this, we introduce GRIFFIN, a novel training-free MoE that selects unique FF experts at the sequence level for efficient generation across a plethora of LLMs with different non-ReLU activation functions. This is possible due to a critical observation that many trained LLMs naturally produce highly structured FF activation patterns within a sequence, which we call flocking. Despite our method's simplicity, we show with 50% of the FF parameters, GRIFFIN maintains the original model's performance with little to no degradation on a variety of classification and generation tasks, all while improving latency (e.g. 1.25$\times$ speed-up in Llama 2 13B on an NVIDIA L40).

<p><b>Authors:</b> I\~nigo Urteaga, Chris H. Wiggins</p>
<p>Abstract: We extend Bayesian multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms beyond their original setting by making use of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods.
  A MAB is a sequential decision making problem where the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes long term payoff, where only the reward of the executed action is observed. In the stochastic MAB, the reward for each action is generated from an unknown distribution, often assumed to be stationary. To decide which action to take next, a MAB agent must learn the characteristics of the unknown reward distribution, e.g., compute its sufficient statistics. However, closed-form expressions for these statistics are analytically intractable except for simple, stationary cases.
  We here utilize SMC for estimation of the statistics Bayesian MAB agents compute, and devise flexible policies that can address a rich class of bandit problems: i.e., MABs with nonlinear, stateless- and context-dependent reward distributions that evolve over time. We showcase how non-stationary bandits, where time dynamics are modeled via linear dynamical systems, can be successfully addressed by SMC-based Bayesian bandit agents. We empirically demonstrate good regret performance of the proposed SMC-based bandit policies in several MAB scenarios that have remained elusive, i.e., in non-stationary bandits with nonlinear rewards.</p>

We provide theoretical bounds for the estimation error on the proposed algorithm and its regularized version under mild conditions. Meanwhile, we provide some extensions of the proposed method to deal with large networks in practice. These Mixed-SLIM methods outperform state-of-art methods in simulations and substantial empirical datasets for both community detection and mixed membership community detection problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huan Qing, Jingli Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of community detection in overlapping weighted networks, where nodes can belong to multiple communities and edge weights can be finite real numbers. To model such complex networks, we propose a general framework - the mixed membership distribution-free (MMDF) model. MMDF has no distribution constraints of edge weights and can be viewed as generalizations of some previous models, including the well-known mixed membership stochastic blockmodels. Especially, overlapping signed networks with latent community structures can also be generated from our model. We use an efficient spectral algorithm with a theoretical guarantee of convergence rate to estimate community memberships under the model. We also propose the fuzzy weighted modularity to evaluate the quality of community detection for overlapping weighted networks with positive and negative edge weights. We then provide a method to determine the number of communities for weighted networks by taking advantage of our fuzzy weighted modularity. Numerical simulations and real data applications are carried out to demonstrate the usefulness of our mixed membership distribution-free model and our fuzzy weighted modularity.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we synthesize a data-driven method to predict the optimal topology of an ad-hoc robot network. This problem is technically a multi-task classification problem. However, we divide it into a class of multi-class classification problems that can be more efficiently solved. For this purpose, we first compose an algorithm to create ground-truth optimal topologies associated with various configurations of a robot network. This algorithm incorporates a complex collection of optimality criteria that our learning model successfully manages to learn. This model is an stacked ensemble whose output is the topology prediction for a particular robot. Each stacked ensemble instance constitutes three low-level estimators whose outputs will be aggregated by a high-level boosting blender. Applying our model to a network of 10 robots displays over 80% accuracy in the prediction of optimal topologies corresponding to various configurations of the cited network.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advances in deep learning have revolutionized cyber-physical applications, including the development of Autonomous Vehicles. However, real-world collisions involving autonomous control of vehicles have raised significant safety concerns regarding the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in safety-critical tasks, particularly Perception. The inherent unverifiability of DNNs poses a key challenge in ensuring their safe and reliable operation.
  In this work, we propose Perception Simplex (PS), a fault-tolerant application architecture designed for obstacle detection and collision avoidance. We analyze an existing LiDAR-based classical obstacle detection algorithm to establish strict bounds on its capabilities and limitations. Such analysis and verification have not been possible for deep learning-based perception systems yet. By employing verifiable obstacle detection algorithms, PS identifies obstacle existence detection faults in the output of unverifiable DNN-based object detectors. When faults with potential collision risks are detected, appropriate corrective actions are initiated. Through extensive analysis and software-in-the-loop simulations, we demonstrate that PS provides predictable and deterministic fault tolerance against obstacle existence detection faults, establishing a robust safety guarantee.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a framework to integrate tensor network (TN) methods with reinforcement learning (RL) for solving dynamical optimisation tasks. We consider the RL actor-critic method, a model-free approach for solving RL problems, and introduce TNs as the approximators for its policy and value functions. Our "actor-critic with tensor networks" (ACTeN) method is especially well suited to problems with large and factorisable state and action spaces. As an illustration of the applicability of ACTeN we solve the exponentially hard task of sampling rare trajectories in two paradigmatic stochastic models, the East model of glasses and the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), the latter being particularly challenging to other methods due to the absence of detailed balance. With substantial potential for further integration with the vast array of existing RL methods, the approach introduced here is promising both for applications in physics and to multi-agent RL problems more generally.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ning Lu, Shengcai Liu, Zhirui Zhang, Qi Wang, Haifeng Liu, Ke Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Word-level textual adversarial attacks have demonstrated notable efficacy in misleading Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Despite their success, the underlying reasons for their effectiveness and the fundamental characteristics of adversarial examples (AEs) remain obscure. This work aims to interpret word-level attacks by examining their $n$-gram frequency patterns. Our comprehensive experiments reveal that in approximately 90\% of cases, word-level attacks lead to the generation of examples where the frequency of $n$-grams decreases, a tendency we term as the $n$-gram Frequency Descend ($n$-FD). This finding suggests a straightforward strategy to enhance model robustness: training models using examples with $n$-FD. To examine the feasibility of this strategy, we employed the $n$-gram frequency information, as an alternative to conventional loss gradients, to generate perturbed examples in adversarial training. The experiment results indicate that the frequency-based approach performs comparably with the gradient-based approach in improving model robustness. Our research offers a novel and more intuitive perspective for understanding word-level textual adversarial attacks and proposes a new direction to improve model robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: We give a pair of algorithms that efficiently learn a quantum state prepared by Clifford gates and $O(\log n)$ non-Clifford gates. Specifically, for an $n$-qubit state $|\psi\rangle$ prepared with at most $t$ non-Clifford gates, our algorithms use $\mathsf{poly}(n,2^t,1/\varepsilon)$ time and copies of $|\psi\rangle$ to learn $|\psi\rangle$ to trace distance at most $\varepsilon$.
  The first algorithm for this task is more efficient, but requires entangled measurements across two copies of $|\psi\rangle$. The second algorithm uses only single-copy measurements at the cost of polynomial factors in runtime and sample complexity. Our algorithms more generally learn any state with sufficiently large stabilizer dimension, where a quantum state has stabilizer dimension $k$ if it is stabilized by an abelian group of $2^k$ Pauli operators. We also develop an efficient property testing algorithm for stabilizer dimension, which may be of independent interest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Huang, Benjamin S. Wessler, Michael C. Hughes</p>
<p>Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a degenerative valve condition that causes substantial morbidity and mortality. This condition is under-diagnosed and under-treated. In clinical practice, AS is diagnosed with expert review of transthoracic echocardiography, which produces dozens of ultrasound images of the heart. Only some of these views show the aortic valve. To automate screening for AS, deep networks must learn to mimic a human expert's ability to identify views of the aortic valve then aggregate across these relevant images to produce a study-level diagnosis. We find previous approaches to AS detection yield insufficient accuracy due to relying on inflexible averages across images. We further find that off-the-shelf attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) performs poorly. We contribute a new end-to-end MIL approach with two key methodological innovations. First, a supervised attention technique guides the learned attention mechanism to favor relevant views. Second, a novel self-supervised pretraining strategy applies contrastive learning on the representation of the whole study instead of individual images as commonly done in prior literature. Experiments on an open-access dataset and an external validation set show that our approach yields higher accuracy while reducing model size.</p>

In this paper, we discuss "post-variational strategies", which shift tunable parameters from the quantum computer to the classical computer, opting for ensemble strategies when optimizing quantum models. We discuss various strategies and design principles for constructing individual quantum circuits, where the resulting ensembles can be optimized with convex programming. Further, we discuss architectural designs of post-variational quantum neural networks and analyze the propagation of estimation errors throughout such neural networks. Finally, we show that empirically, post-variational quantum neural networks using our architectural designs can potentially provide better results than variational algorithms and performance comparable to that of two-layer neural networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of the digital world has propelled sentiment analysis into a critical tool across diverse sectors such as marketing, politics, customer service, and healthcare. While there have been significant advancements in sentiment analysis for widely spoken languages, low-resource languages, such as Bangla, remain largely under-researched due to resource constraints. Furthermore, the recent unprecedented performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various applications highlights the need to evaluate them in the context of low-resource languages. In this study, we present a sizeable manually annotated dataset encompassing 33,606 Bangla news tweets and Facebook comments. We also investigate zero- and few-shot in-context learning with several language models, including Flan-T5, GPT-4, and Bloomz, offering a comparative analysis against fine-tuned models. Our findings suggest that monolingual transformer-based models consistently outperform other models, even in zero and few-shot scenarios. To foster continued exploration, we intend to make this dataset and our research tools publicly available to the broader research community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingyu Feng, Ting Gao, Wang Xiao, Jinqiao Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting early warning indicators for abrupt dynamical transitions in complex systems or high-dimensional observation data is essential in many real-world applications, such as brain diseases, natural disasters, and engineering reliability. To this end, we develop a novel approach: the directed anisotropic diffusion map that captures the latent evolutionary dynamics in the low-dimensional manifold. Then three effective warning signals (Onsager-Machlup Indicator, Sample Entropy Indicator, and Transition Probability Indicator) are derived through the latent coordinates and the latent stochastic dynamical systems. To validate our framework, we apply this methodology to authentic electroencephalogram (EEG) data. We find that our early warning indicators are capable of detecting the tipping point during state transition. This framework not only bridges the latent dynamics with real-world data but also shows the potential ability for automatic labeling on complex high-dimensional time series.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wolfgang Stammer, Felix Friedrich, David Steinmann, Manuel Brack, Hikaru Shindo, Kristian Kersting</p>
<p>Abstract: Current AI research mainly treats explanations as a means for model inspection. Yet, this neglects findings from human psychology that describe the benefit of self-explanations in an agent's learning process. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel approach in the context of image classification, termed Learning by Self-Explaining (LSX). LSX utilizes aspects of self-refining AI and human-guided explanatory machine learning. The underlying idea is that a learner model, in addition to optimizing for the original predictive task, is further optimized based on explanatory feedback from an internal critic model. Intuitively, a learner's explanations are considered "useful" if the internal critic can perform the same task given these explanations. We provide an overview of important components of LSX and, based on this, perform extensive experimental evaluations via three different example instantiations. Our results indicate improvements via Learning by Self-Explaining on several levels: in terms of model generalization, reducing the influence of confounding factors, and providing more task-relevant and faithful model explanations. Overall, our work provides evidence for the potential of self-explaining within the learning phase of an AI model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Berglund, Meg Tong, Max Kaufmann, Mikita Balesni, Asa Cooper Stickland, Tomasz Korbak, Owain Evans</p>
<p>Abstract: We expose a surprising failure of generalization in auto-regressive large language models (LLMs). If a model is trained on a sentence of the form "A is B", it will not automatically generalize to the reverse direction "B is A". This is the Reversal Curse. For instance, if a model is trained on "Valentina Tereshkova was the first woman to travel to space", it will not automatically be able to answer the question, "Who was the first woman to travel to space?". Moreover, the likelihood of the correct answer ("Valentina Tershkova") will not be higher than for a random name. Thus, models do not generalize a prevalent pattern in their training set: if "A is B" occurs, "B is A" is more likely to occur. It is worth noting, however, that if "A is B" appears in-context, models can deduce the reverse relationship. We provide evidence for the Reversal Curse by finetuning GPT-3 and Llama-1 on fictitious statements such as "Uriah Hawthorne is the composer of Abyssal Melodies" and showing that they fail to correctly answer "Who composed Abyssal Melodies?". The Reversal Curse is robust across model sizes and model families and is not alleviated by data augmentation. We also evaluate ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on questions about real-world celebrities, such as "Who is Tom Cruise's mother? [A: Mary Lee Pfeiffer]" and the reverse "Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?". GPT-4 correctly answers questions like the former 79% of the time, compared to 33% for the latter.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nian Si</p>
<p>Abstract: In modern recommendation systems, the standard pipeline involves training machine learning models on historical data to predict user behaviors and improve recommendations continuously. However, these data training loops can introduce interference in A/B tests, where data generated by control and treatment algorithms, potentially with different distributions, are combined. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach called weighted training. This approach entails training a model to predict the probability of each data point appearing in either the treatment or control data and subsequently applying weighted losses during model training. We demonstrate that this approach achieves the least variance among all estimators that do not cause shifts in the training distributions. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate the lower bias and variance of our approach compared to other methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiying Yu, Quan Sun, Xiaosong Zhang, Yufeng Cui, Fan Zhang, Yue Cao, Xinlong Wang, Jingjing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models demonstrate remarkable generalist ability to perform diverse multimodal tasks in a zero-shot manner. Large-scale web-based image-text pairs contribute fundamentally to this success, but suffer from excessive noise. Recent studies use alternative captions synthesized by captioning models and have achieved notable benchmark performance. However, our experiments reveal significant Scalability Deficiency and World Knowledge Loss issues in models trained with synthetic captions, which have been largely obscured by their initial benchmark success. Upon closer examination, we identify the root cause as the overly-simplified language structure and lack of knowledge details in existing synthetic captions. To provide higher-quality and more scalable multimodal pretraining data, we propose CapsFusion, an advanced framework that leverages large language models to consolidate and refine information from both web-based image-text pairs and synthetic captions. Extensive experiments show that CapsFusion captions exhibit remarkable all-round superiority over existing captions in terms of model performance (e.g., 18.8 and 18.3 improvements in CIDEr score on COCO and NoCaps), sample efficiency (requiring 11-16 times less computation than baselines), world knowledge depth, and scalability. These effectiveness, efficiency and scalability advantages position CapsFusion as a promising candidate for future scaling of LMM training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Zammit-Mangion, Michael D. Kaminski, Ba-Hien Tran, Maurizio Filippone, Noel Cressie</p>
<p>Abstract: interpretable, and well understood models that are routinely employed even though, as is revealed through prior and posterior predictive checks, these can poorly characterise the spatial heterogeneity in the underlying process of interest. Here, we propose a new, flexible class of spatial-process models, which we refer to as spatial Bayesian neural networks (SBNNs). An SBNN leverages the representational capacity of a Bayesian neural network; it is tailored to a spatial setting by incorporating a spatial ``embedding layer'' into the network and, possibly, spatially-varying network parameters. An SBNN is calibrated by matching its finite-dimensional distribution at locations on a fine gridding of space to that of a target process of interest. That process could be easy to simulate from or we may have many realisations from it. We propose several variants of SBNNs, most of which are able to match the finite-dimensional distribution of the target process at the selected grid better than conventional BNNs of similar complexity. We also show that an SBNN can be used to represent a variety of spatial processes often used in practice, such as Gaussian processes, lognormal processes, and max-stable processes. We briefly discuss the tools that could be used to make inference with SBNNs, and we conclude with a discussion of their advantages and limitations.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11167">Benchmarking Machine Learning Models for Quantum Error Correction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is one of the fundamental problems in quantum computer systems, which aims to detect and correct errors in the data qubits within quantum computers. Due to the presence of unreliable data qubits in existing quantum computers, implementing quantum error correction is a critical step when establishing a stable quantum computer system. Recently, machine learning (ML)-based approaches have been proposed to address this challenge. However, they lack a thorough understanding of quantum error correction. To bridge this research gap, we provide a new perspective to understand machine learning-based QEC in this paper. We find that syndromes in the ancilla qubits result from errors on connected data qubits, and distant ancilla qubits can provide auxiliary information to rule out some incorrect predictions for the data qubits. Therefore, to detect errors in data qubits, we must consider the information present in the long-range ancilla qubits. To the best of our knowledge, machine learning is less explored in the dependency relationship of QEC. To fill the blank, we curate a machine learning benchmark to assess the capacity to capture long-range dependencies for quantum error correction. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms spanning diverse neural network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and graph transformers. Our exhaustive experiments reveal an enlightening trend: By enlarging the receptive field to exploit information from distant ancilla qubits, the accuracy of QEC significantly improves. For instance, U-Net can improve CNN by a margin of about 50%. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis that could inspire future research in this field.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce pixelSplat, a feed-forward model that learns to reconstruct 3D radiance fields parameterized by 3D Gaussian primitives from pairs of images. Our model features real-time and memory-efficient rendering for scalable training as well as fast 3D reconstruction at inference time. To overcome local minima inherent to sparse and locally supported representations, we predict a dense probability distribution over 3D and sample Gaussian means from that probability distribution. We make this sampling operation differentiable via a reparameterization trick, allowing us to back-propagate gradients through the Gaussian splatting representation. We benchmark our method on wide-baseline novel view synthesis on the real-world RealEstate10k and ACID datasets, where we outperform state-of-the-art light field transformers and accelerate rendering by 2.5 orders of magnitude while reconstructing an interpretable and editable 3D radiance field.</p>

<p>Abstract: The field of natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a notable focus on improving large language models' (LLM) performance through innovative prompting techniques. Among these, prompt engineering coupled with structures has emerged as a promising paradigm, with designs such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, or Graph of Thoughts, in which the overall LLM reasoning is guided by a structure such as a graph. As illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the LLM's capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical reasoning to planning or creative writing. To facilitate the understanding of this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes. For this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying and clearly defining different concepts. We then build the first taxonomy of structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes. We focus on identifying fundamental classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others. We refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context. Our study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy, discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance and cost. We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between prompting and other parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and the associated research challenges. Our work will help to advance future prompt engineering techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marien Renaud, Jean Prost, Arthur Leclaire, Nicolas Papadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithms are a class of iterative algorithms that address image inverse problems by combining a physical model and a deep neural network for regularization. Even if they produce impressive image restoration results, these algorithms rely on a non-standard use of a denoiser on images that are less and less noisy along the iterations, which contrasts with recent algorithms based on Diffusion Models (DM), where the denoiser is applied only on re-noised images. We propose a new PnP framework, called Stochastic deNOising REgularization (SNORE), which applies the denoiser only on images with noise of the adequate level. It is based on an explicit stochastic regularization, which leads to a stochastic gradient descent algorithm to solve ill-posed inverse problems. A convergence analysis of this algorithm and its annealing extension is provided. Experimentally, we prove that SNORE is competitive with respect to state-of-the-art methods on deblurring and inpainting tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fenghua Ling, Zeyu Lu, Jing-Jia Luo, Lei Bai, Swadhin K. Behera, Dachao Jin, Baoxiang Pan, Huidong Jiang, Toshio Yamagata</p>
<p>Abstract: As our planet is entering into the "global boiling" era, understanding regional climate change becomes imperative. Effective downscaling methods that provide localized insights are crucial for this target. Traditional approaches, including computationally-demanding regional dynamical models or statistical downscaling frameworks, are often susceptible to the influence of downscaling uncertainty. Here, we address these limitations by introducing a diffusion probabilistic downscaling model (DPDM) into the meteorological field. This model can efficiently transform data from 1{\deg} to 0.1{\deg} resolution. Compared with deterministic downscaling schemes, it not only has more accurate local details, but also can generate a large number of ensemble members based on probability distribution sampling to evaluate the uncertainty of downscaling. Additionally, we apply the model to generate a 180-year dataset of monthly surface variables in East Asia, offering a more detailed perspective for understanding local scale climate change over the past centuries.</p>

In this paper, we present MWT: a Multi-Word Tokenizer that goes beyond word boundaries by representing frequent multi-word expressions as single tokens. MWTs produce a more compact and efficient tokenization that yields two benefits: (1) Increase in performance due to a greater coverage of input data given a fixed sequence length budget; (2) Faster and lighter inference due to the ability to reduce the sequence length with negligible drops in performance. Our results show that MWT is more robust across shorter sequence lengths, thus allowing for major speedups via early sequence truncation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, Muhammad Shafique</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous mobile agents (e.g., UAVs and UGVs) are typically expected to incur low power/energy consumption for solving machine learning tasks (such as object recognition), as these mobile agents are usually powered by portable batteries. These requirements can be fulfilled by Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), since their bio-inspired spike-based operations offer high accuracy and ultra low-power/energy computation. Currently, most of the SNN architectures are derived from Artificial Neural Networks whose neurons' architectures and operations are different from SNNs, or developed without considering memory budgets from the underlying processing hardware of autonomous mobile agents. These limitations hinder SNNs from reaching their full potential in accuracy and efficiency. Toward this, we propose SpikeNAS, a novel fast memory-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for SNNs that quickly finds an appropriate SNN architecture with high accuracy under the given memory budgets from autonomous mobile agents. To do this, our SpikeNAS employs several key steps: analyzing the impacts of network operations on the accuracy, enhancing the network architecture to improve the learning quality, and developing a fast memory-aware search algorithm. The experimental results show that our SpikeNAS improves the searching time and maintains high accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art while meeting the given memory budgets (e.g., 4.4x faster search with 1.3% accuracy improvement for CIFAR100, using an Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada GPU machine), thereby quickly providing the appropriate SNN architecture for the memory-constrained autonomous mobile agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasuhiro Yoshikai, Tadahaya Mizuno, Shumpei Nemoto, Hiroyuki Kusuhara</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, molecule generation using deep learning has been actively investigated in drug discovery. In this field, Transformer and VAE are widely used as powerful models, but they are rarely used in combination due to structural and performance mismatch of them. This study proposes a model that combines these two models through structural and parameter optimization in handling diverse molecules. The proposed model shows comparable performance to existing models in generating molecules, and showed by far superior performance in generating molecules with unseen structures. Another advantage of this VAE model is that it generates molecules from latent representation, and therefore properties of molecules can be easily predicted or conditioned with it, and indeed, we show that the latent representation of the model successfully predicts molecular properties. Ablation study suggested the advantage of VAE over other generative models like language model in generating novel molecules. It also indicated that the latent representation can be shortened to ~32 dimensional variables without loss of reconstruction, suggesting the possibility of a much smaller molecular descriptor or model than existing ones. This study is expected to provide a virtual chemical library containing a wide variety of compounds for virtual screening and to enable efficient screening.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikola Zubi\'c, Mathias Gehrig, Davide Scaramuzza</p>
<p>Abstract: Today, state-of-the-art deep neural networks that process event-camera data first convert a temporal window of events into dense, grid-like input representations. As such, they exhibit poor generalizability when deployed at higher inference frequencies (i.e., smaller temporal windows) than the ones they were trained on. We address this challenge by introducing state-space models (SSMs) with learnable timescale parameters to event-based vision. This design adapts to varying frequencies without the need to retrain the network at different frequencies. Additionally, we investigate two strategies to counteract aliasing effects when deploying the model at higher frequencies. We comprehensively evaluate our approach against existing methods based on RNN and Transformer architectures across various benchmarks, including Gen1 and 1 Mpx event camera datasets. Our results demonstrate that SSM-based models train 33% faster and also exhibit minimal performance degradation when tested at higher frequencies than the training input. Traditional RNN and Transformer models exhibit performance drops of more than 20 mAP, with SSMs having a drop of 3.31 mAP, highlighting the effectiveness of SSMs in event-based vision tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baran Ozaydin, Tong Zhang, Deblina Bhattacharjee, Sabine S\"usstrunk, Mathieu Salzmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation (USS) involves segmenting images without relying on predefined labels, aiming to alleviate the burden of extensive human labeling. Existing methods utilize features generated by self-supervised models and specific priors for clustering. However, their clustering objectives are not involved in the optimization of the features during training. Additionally, due to the lack of clear class definitions in USS, the resulting segments may not align well with the clustering objective. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Optimally Matched Hierarchy (OMH) to simultaneously address the above issues. The core of our method lies in imposing structured sparsity on the feature space, which allows the features to encode information with different levels of granularity. The structure of this sparsity stems from our hierarchy (OMH). To achieve this, we learn a soft but sparse hierarchy among parallel clusters through Optimal Transport. Our OMH yields better unsupervised segmentation performance compared to existing USS methods. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of OMH when utilizing our differentiable paradigm. We will make our code publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gesine Reinert, Wenkai Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating graphs that preserve characteristic structures while promoting sample diversity can be challenging, especially when the number of graph observations is small. Here, we tackle the problem of graph generation from only one observed graph. The classical approach of graph generation from parametric models relies on the estimation of parameters, which can be inconsistent or expensive to compute due to intractable normalisation constants. Generative modelling based on machine learning techniques to generate high-quality graph samples avoids parameter estimation but usually requires abundant training samples. Our proposed generating procedure, SteinGen, which is phrased in the setting of graphs as realisations of exponential random graph models, combines ideas from Stein's method and MCMC by employing Markovian dynamics which are based on a Stein operator for the target model. SteinGen uses the Glauber dynamics associated with an estimated Stein operator to generate a sample, and re-estimates the Stein operator from the sample after every sampling step. We show that on a class of exponential random graph models this novel "estimation and re-estimation" generation strategy yields high distributional similarity (high fidelity) to the original data, combined with high sample diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hu Gao, Depeng Dang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image deblurring aims to restore a high-quality image from its corresponding blurred. The emergence of CNNs and Transformers has enabled significant progress. However, these methods often face the dilemma between eliminating long-range degradation perturbations and maintaining computational efficiency. While the selective state space model (SSM) shows promise in modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, it also encounters challenges such as local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an efficient image deblurring network that leverages selective state spaces model to aggregate enriched and accurate features. Specifically, we introduce an aggregate local and global information block (ALGBlock) designed to effectively capture and integrate both local invariant properties and non-local information. The ALGBlock comprises two primary modules: a module for capturing local and global features (CLGF), and a feature aggregation module (FA). The CLGF module is composed of two branches: the global branch captures long-range dependency features via a selective state spaces model, while the local branch employs simplified channel attention to model local connectivity, thereby reducing local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy. In addition, we design a FA module to accentuate the local part by recalibrating the weight during the aggregation of the two branches for restoration. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on widely used benchmarks.</p>

On the SSA subset of the FLEURS-102 dataset, our approach based on a HuBERT$_{base}$ (0.09B) architecture shows competitive results, for ASR downstream task, compared to the w2v-bert-51 (0.6B) pre-trained model proposed in the FLEURS benchmark, while being more efficient by using 7x less data and 6x less parameters. Furthermore, in the context of a LID downstream task, our approach outperforms FLEURS baselines accuracy by over 22\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinbae Im, JeongYeon Nam, Nokyung Park, Hyungmin Lee, Seunghyun Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is a challenging task of detecting objects and predicting relationships between objects. After DETR was developed, one-stage SGG models based on a one-stage object detector have been actively studied. However, complex modeling is used to predict the relationship between objects, and the inherent relationship between object queries learned in the multi-head self-attention of the object detector has been neglected. We propose a lightweight one-stage SGG model that extracts the relation graph from the various relationships learned in the multi-head self-attention layers of the DETR decoder. By fully utilizing the self-attention by-products, the relation graph can be extracted effectively with a shallow relation extraction head. Considering the dependency of the relation extraction task on the object detection task, we propose a novel relation smoothing technique that adjusts the relation label adaptively according to the quality of the detected objects. By the relation smoothing, the model is trained according to the continuous curriculum that focuses on object detection task at the beginning of training and performs multi-task learning as the object detection performance gradually improves. Furthermore, we propose a connectivity prediction task that predicts whether a relation exists between object pairs as an auxiliary task of the relation extraction. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method for the Visual Genome and Open Image V6 datasets. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/naver-ai/egtr.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yushen Li, Jinpeng Wang, Tao Dai, Jieming Zhu, Jun Yuan, Rui Zhang, Shu-Tao Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting click-through rates (CTR) is a fundamental task for Web applications, where a key issue is to devise effective models for feature interactions. Current methodologies predominantly concentrate on modeling feature interactions within an individual sample, while overlooking the potential cross-sample relationships that can serve as a reference context to enhance the prediction. To make up for such deficiency, this paper develops a Retrieval-Augmented Transformer (RAT), aiming to acquire fine-grained feature interactions within and across samples. By retrieving similar samples, we construct augmented input for each target sample. We then build Transformer layers with cascaded attention to capture both intra- and cross-sample feature interactions, facilitating comprehensive reasoning for improved CTR prediction while retaining efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets substantiate the effectiveness of RAT and suggest its advantage in long-tail scenarios. The code has been open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/YushenLi807/WWW24-RAT}.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02456">PhonologyBench: Evaluating Phonological Skills of Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashima Suvarna, Harshita Khandelwal, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Phonology, the study of speech's structure and pronunciation rules, is a critical yet often overlooked component in Large Language Model (LLM) research. LLMs are widely used in various downstream applications that leverage phonology such as educational tools and poetry generation. Moreover, LLMs can potentially learn imperfect associations between orthographic and phonological forms from the training data. Thus, it is imperative to benchmark the phonological skills of LLMs. To this end, we present PhonologyBench, a novel benchmark consisting of three diagnostic tasks designed to explicitly test the phonological skills of LLMs in English: grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, syllable counting, and rhyme word generation. Despite having no access to speech data, LLMs showcased notable performance on the PhonologyBench tasks. However, we observe a significant gap of 17% and 45% on Rhyme Word Generation and Syllable counting, respectively, when compared to humans. Our findings underscore the importance of studying LLM performance on phonological tasks that inadvertently impact real-world applications. Furthermore, we encourage researchers to choose LLMs that perform well on the phonological task that is closely related to the downstream application since we find that no single model consistently outperforms the others on all the tasks.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03493">A Methodology to Study the Impact of Spiking Neural Network Parameters considering Event-Based Automotive Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Iqra Bano, Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, Alberto Marchisio, Muhammad Shafique</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems are considered as the future of human mobility and transportation. Solving computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection/segmentation, with high accuracy and low power/energy consumption, is highly needed to realize AD systems in real life. These requirements can potentially be satisfied by Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). However, the state-of-the-art works in SNN-based AD systems still focus on proposing network models that can achieve high accuracy, and they have not systematically studied the roles of SNN parameters when used for learning event-based automotive data. Therefore, we still lack understanding of how to effectively develop SNN models for AD systems. Toward this, we propose a novel methodology to systematically study and analyze the impact of SNN parameters considering event-based automotive data, then leverage this analysis for enhancing SNN developments. To do this, we first explore different settings of SNN parameters that directly affect the learning mechanism (i.e., batch size, learning rate, neuron threshold potential, and weight decay), then analyze the accuracy results. Afterward, we propose techniques that jointly improve SNN accuracy and reduce training time. Experimental results show that our methodology can improve the SNN models for AD systems than the state-of-the-art, as it achieves higher accuracy (i.e., 86%) for the NCARS dataset, and it can also achieve iso-accuracy (i.e., ~85% with standard deviation less than 0.5%) while speeding up the training time by 1.9x. In this manner, our research work provides a set of guidelines for SNN parameter enhancements, thereby enabling the practical developments of SNN-based AD systems.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03528">BanglaAutoKG: Automatic Bangla Knowledge Graph Construction with Semantic Neural Graph Filtering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Azmine Toushik Wasi, Taki Hasan Rafi, Raima Islam, Dong-Kyu Chae</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have proven essential in information processing and reasoning applications because they link related entities and give context-rich information, supporting efficient information retrieval and knowledge discovery; presenting information flow in a very effective manner. Despite being widely used globally, Bangla is relatively underrepresented in KGs due to a lack of comprehensive datasets, encoders, NER (named entity recognition) models, POS (part-of-speech) taggers, and lemmatizers, hindering efficient information processing and reasoning applications in the language. Addressing the KG scarcity in Bengali, we propose BanglaAutoKG, a pioneering framework that is able to automatically construct Bengali KGs from any Bangla text. We utilize multilingual LLMs to understand various languages and correlate entities and relations universally. By employing a translation dictionary to identify English equivalents and extracting word features from pre-trained BERT models, we construct the foundational KG. To reduce noise and align word embeddings with our goal, we employ graph-based polynomial filters. Lastly, we implement a GNN-based semantic filter, which elevates contextual understanding and trims unnecessary edges, culminating in the formation of the definitive KG. Empirical findings and case studies demonstrate the universal effectiveness of our model, capable of autonomously constructing semantically enriched KGs from any text.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03635">WorDepth: Variational Language Prior for Monocular Depth Estimation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyao Zeng, Daniel Wang, Fengyu Yang, Hyoungseob Park, Yangchao Wu, Stefano Soatto, Byung-Woo Hong, Dong Lao, Alex Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from a single image is an ill-posed problem with inherent ambiguities, i.e. scale. Predicting a 3D scene from text description(s) is similarly ill-posed, i.e. spatial arrangements of objects described. We investigate the question of whether two inherently ambiguous modalities can be used in conjunction to produce metric-scaled reconstructions. To test this, we focus on monocular depth estimation, the problem of predicting a dense depth map from a single image, but with an additional text caption describing the scene. To this end, we begin by encoding the text caption as a mean and standard deviation; using a variational framework, we learn the distribution of the plausible metric reconstructions of 3D scenes corresponding to the text captions as a prior. To "select" a specific reconstruction or depth map, we encode the given image through a conditional sampler that samples from the latent space of the variational text encoder, which is then decoded to the output depth map. Our approach is trained alternatingly between the text and image branches: in one optimization step, we predict the mean and standard deviation from the text description and sample from a standard Gaussian, and in the other, we sample using a (image) conditional sampler. Once trained, we directly predict depth from the encoded text using the conditional sampler. We demonstrate our approach on indoor (NYUv2) and outdoor (KITTI) scenarios, where we show that language can consistently improve performance in both.</p>
