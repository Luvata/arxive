<p><b>Authors:</b> Ghazi Shazan Ahmad, Shubham Agarwal, Subrata Mitra, Ryan Rossi, Manav Doshi, Vibhor Porwal, Syam Manoj Kumar Paila</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated visualization recommendations (vis-rec) help users to derive crucial insights from new datasets. Typically, such automated vis-rec models first calculate a large number of statistics from the datasets and then use machine-learning models to score or classify multiple visualizations choices to recommend the most effective ones, as per the statistics. However, state-of-the art models rely on very large number of expensive statistics and therefore using such models on large datasets become infeasible due to prohibitively large computational time, limiting the effectiveness of such techniques to most real world complex and large datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement-learning (RL) based framework that takes a given vis-rec model and a time-budget from the user and identifies the best set of input statistics that would be most effective while generating the visual insights within a given time budget, using the given model. Using two state-of-the-art vis-rec models applied on three large real-world datasets, we show the effectiveness of our technique in significantly reducing time-to visualize with very small amount of introduced error. Our approach is about 10X times faster compared to the baseline approaches that introduce similar amounts of error.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18731">The Performance of the LSTM-based Code Generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) in Forecasting Time Series Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Saroj Gopali, Sima Siami-Namini, Faranak Abri, Akbar Siami Namin</p>
<p>Abstract: As an intriguing case is the goodness of the machine and deep learning models generated by these LLMs in conducting automated scientific data analysis, where a data analyst may not have enough expertise in manually coding and optimizing complex deep learning models and codes and thus may opt to leverage LLMs to generate the required models. This paper investigates and compares the performance of the mainstream LLMs, such as ChatGPT, PaLM, LLama, and Falcon, in generating deep learning models for analyzing time series data, an important and popular data type with its prevalent applications in many application domains including financial and stock market. This research conducts a set of controlled experiments where the prompts for generating deep learning-based models are controlled with respect to sensitivity levels of four criteria including 1) Clarify and Specificity, 2) Objective and Intent, 3) Contextual Information, and 4) Format and Style. While the results are relatively mix, we observe some distinct patterns. We notice that using LLMs, we are able to generate deep learning-based models with executable codes for each dataset seperatly whose performance are comparable with the manually crafted and optimized LSTM models for predicting the whole time series dataset. We also noticed that ChatGPT outperforms the other LLMs in generating more accurate models. Furthermore, we observed that the goodness of the generated models vary with respect to the ``temperature'' parameter used in configuring LLMS. The results can be beneficial for data analysts and practitioners who would like to leverage generative AIs to produce good prediction models with acceptable goodness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Majid Ghasemi, Amir Hossein Mousavi, Dariush Ebrahimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm in Artificial Intelligence (AI), enabling agents to learn optimal behaviors through interactions with their environments. Drawing from the foundations of trial and error, RL equips agents to make informed decisions through feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of RL, meticulously analyzing a wide range of algorithms, from foundational tabular methods to advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques. We categorize and evaluate these algorithms based on key criteria such as scalability, sample efficiency, and suitability. We compare the methods in the form of their strengths and weaknesses in diverse settings. Additionally, we offer practical insights into the selection and implementation of RL algorithms, addressing common challenges like convergence, stability, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma. This paper serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners aiming to harness the full potential of RL in solving complex, real-world problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxuan Lou, Chaojie Wang, Bo An</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a fundamental capability for large language models (LLMs), yet achieving high performance in this domain remains a significant challenge. The auto-regressive generation process often makes LLMs susceptible to errors, hallucinations, and inconsistencies, particularly during multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we propose Mars-PO, a novel framework to improve the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs through a multi-agent system. It combines high-quality outputs from multiple agents into a hybrid positive sample set and pairs them with agent-specific negative samples to construct robust preference pairs for training. By aligning agents with shared positive samples while addressing individual weaknesses, Mars-PO achieves substantial performance improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. For example, it increases the accuracy on the MATH benchmark of the state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLM, Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, from 50.38% to 57.82%. Experimental results further demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms other baselines, such as supervised fine-tuning, vanilla DPO, and its enhanced versions, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Se-eun Yoon, Xiaokai Wei, Yexi Jiang, Rachit Pareek, Frank Ong, Kevin Gao, Julian McAuley, Michelle Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a systematic effort to design, evaluate, and implement a realistic conversational recommender system (CRS). The objective of our system is to allow users to input free-form text to request recommendations, and then receive a list of relevant and diverse items. While previous work on synthetic queries augments large language models (LLMs) with 1-3 tools, we argue that a more extensive toolbox is necessary to effectively handle real user requests. As such, we propose a novel approach that equips LLMs with over 10 tools, providing them access to the internal knowledge base and API calls used in production. We evaluate our model on a dataset of real users and show that it generates relevant, novel, and diverse recommendations compared to vanilla LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of using the full range of tools in our toolbox. We share our designs and lessons learned from deploying the system for internal alpha release. Our contribution is the addressing of all four key aspects of a practicable CRS: (1) real user requests, (2) augmenting LLMs with a wide variety of tools, (3) extensive evaluation, and (4) deployment insights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dickness Kakitahi Kwesiga, Suyash Chandra Vishnoi, Angshuman Guin, Michael Hunter</p>
<p>Abstract: This study integrates Transit Signal Priority (TSP) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) based traffic signal control. The first part of the study develops adaptive signal control based on MARL for a pair of coordinated intersections in a microscopic simulation environment. The two agents, one for each intersection, are centrally trained using a value decomposition network (VDN) architecture. The trained agents show slightly better performance compared to coordinated actuated signal control based on overall intersection delay at v/c of 0.95. In the second part of the study the trained signal control agents are used as background signal controllers while developing event-based TSP agents. In one variation, independent TSP agents are formulated and trained under a decentralized training and decentralized execution (DTDE) framework to implement TSP at each intersection. In the second variation, the two TSP agents are centrally trained under a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework and VDN architecture to select and implement coordinated TSP strategies across the two intersections. In both cases the agents converge to the same bus delay value, but independent agents show high instability throughout the training process. For the test runs, the two independent agents reduce bus delay across the two intersections by 22% compared to the no TSP case while the coordinated TSP agents achieve 27% delay reduction. In both cases, there is only a slight increase in delay for a majority of the side street movements.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19504">TQA-Bench: Evaluating LLMs for Multi-Table Question Answering with Scalable Context and Symbolic Extension</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zipeng Qiu, You Peng, Guangxin He, Binhang Yuan, Chen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked great opportunities in complex data management tasks, particularly in question answering (QA) over complicated multi-table relational data. Despite significant progress, systematically evaluating LLMs on multi-table QA remains a critical challenge due to the inherent complexity of analyzing heterogeneous table structures and potential large scale of serialized relational data. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-table QA, failing to capture the intricacies of reasoning across multiple relational tables, as required in real-world domains such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. To address this gap, we present TQA-Bench, a new multi-table QA benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in tackling complex QA tasks over relational data. Our benchmark incorporates diverse relational database instances sourced from real-world public datasets and introduces a flexible sampling mechanism to create tasks with varying multi-table context lengths, ranging from 8K to 64K tokens. To ensure robustness and reliability, we integrate symbolic extensions into the evaluation framework, enabling the assessment of LLM reasoning capabilities beyond simple data retrieval or probabilistic pattern matching. We systematically evaluate a range of LLMs, both open-source and closed-source, spanning model scales from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our extensive experiments reveal critical insights into the performance of LLMs in multi-table QA, highlighting both challenges and opportunities for advancing their application in complex, data-driven environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Lv, Jinlong Lei, Peng Yi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore how to optimize task allocation for robot swarms in dynamic environments, emphasizing the necessity of formulating robust, flexible, and scalable strategies for robot cooperation. We introduce a novel framework using a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec_POMDP), specifically designed for distributed robot swarm networks. At the core of our methodology is the Local Information Aggregation Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (LIA_MADDPG) algorithm, which merges centralized training with distributed execution (CTDE). During the centralized training phase, a local information aggregation (LIA) module is meticulously designed to gather critical data from neighboring robots, enhancing decision-making efficiency. In the distributed execution phase, a strategy improvement method is proposed to dynamically adjust task allocation based on changing and partially observable environmental conditions. Our empirical evaluations show that the LIA module can be seamlessly integrated into various CTDE-based MARL methods, significantly enhancing their performance. Additionally, by comparing LIA_MADDPG with six conventional reinforcement learning algorithms and a heuristic algorithm, we demonstrate its superior scalability, rapid adaptation to environmental changes, and ability to maintain both stability and convergence speed. These results underscore LIA_MADDPG's outstanding performance and its potential to significantly improve dynamic task allocation in robot swarms through enhanced local collaboration and adaptive strategy execution.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19539">Knowledge Management for Automobile Failure Analysis Using Graph RAG</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuta Ojima, Hiroki Sakaji, Tadashi Nakamura, Hiroaki Sakata, Kazuya Seki, Yuu Teshigawara, Masami Yamashita, Kazuhiro Aoyama</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a knowledge management system for automobile failure analysis using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs). In the automotive industry, there is a growing demand for knowledge transfer of failure analysis from experienced engineers to young engineers. However, failure events are phenomena that occur in a chain reaction, making them difficult for beginners to analyze them. While knowledge graphs, which can describe semantic relationships and structure information is effective in representing failure events, due to their capability of representing the relationships between components, there is much information in KGs, so it is challenging for young engineers to extract and understand sub-graphs from the KG. On the other hand, there is increasing interest in the use of Graph RAG, a type of RAG that combines LLMs and KGs for knowledge management. However, when using the current Graph RAG framework with an existing knowledge graph for automobile failures, several issues arise because it is difficult to generate executable queries for a knowledge graph database which is not constructed by LLMs. To address this, we focused on optimizing the Graph RAG pipeline for existing knowledge graphs. Using an original Q&A dataset, the ROUGE F1 score of the sentences generated by the proposed method showed an average improvement of 157.6% compared to the current method. This highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for automobile failure analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vedant Khandelwal, Amit Sheth, Forest Agostinelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Various real-world challenges require planning algorithms that can adapt to a broad range of domains. Traditionally, the creation of planning domains has relied heavily on human implementation, which limits the scale and diversity of available domains. While recent advancements have leveraged generative AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs) for domain creation, these efforts have predominantly focused on translating existing domains from natural language descriptions rather than generating novel ones. In contrast, the concept of domain randomization, which has been highly effective in reinforcement learning, enhances performance and generalizability by training on a diverse array of randomized new domains. Inspired by this success, our tool, PDDLFuse, aims to bridge this gap in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). PDDLFuse is designed to generate new, diverse planning domains that can be used to validate new planners or test foundational planning models. We have developed methods to adjust the domain generators parameters to modulate the difficulty of the domains it generates. This adaptability is crucial as existing domain-independent planners often struggle with more complex problems. Initial tests indicate that PDDLFuse efficiently creates intricate and varied domains, representing a significant advancement over traditional domain generation methods and making a contribution towards planning research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19918">Handling irresolvable conflicts in the Semantic Web: an RDF-based conflict-tolerant version of the Deontic Traditional Scheme</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Livio Robaldo, Gianluca Pozzato</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a new ontology that implements the well-known Deontic Traditional Scheme in RDFs and SPARQL, fit to handle irresolvable conflicts, i.e., situations in which two or more statements prescribe conflicting obligations, prohibitions, or permissions, with none of them being "stronger" than the other one(s). In our view, this paper marks a significant advancement in standard theoretical research in formal Deontic Logic. Most contemporary approaches in this field are confined to the propositional level, mainly focus on the notion of obligation, and lack implementations. The proposed framework is encoded in RDF, which is not only a first-order language but also the most widely used knowledge representation language, as it forms the foundation of the Semantic Web. Moreover, the proposed computational ontology formalizes all deontic modalities defined in the Deontic Traditional Scheme, without specifically focusing on obligations, and offers constructs to model and reason with various types of irresolvable conflicts, violations, and the interaction between deontic modalities and contextual constraints in a given state of affairs. To the best of our knowledge, no existing approach in the literature addresses all these aspects within a unified integrated framework.

<p>Abstract: Proprioceptive sensors on planetary rovers serve for state estimation and for understanding terrain and locomotion performance. While inertial measurement units (IMUs) are widely used to this effect, force-torque sensors are less explored for planetary navigation despite their potential to directly measure interaction forces and provide insights into traction performance. This paper presents an evaluation of the performance and use cases of force-torque sensors based on data collected from a six-wheeled rover during tests over varying terrains, speeds, and slopes. We discuss challenges, such as sensor signal reliability and terrain response accuracy, and identify opportunities regarding the use of these sensors. The data is openly accessible and includes force-torque measurements from each of the six-wheel assemblies as well as IMU data from within the rover chassis. This paper aims to inform the design of future studies and rover upgrades, particularly in sensor integration and control algorithms, to improve navigation capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soheila Sadeghi</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate forecasting of project performance metrics is crucial for successfully managing and delivering urban road reconstruction projects. Traditional methods often rely on static baseline plans and fail to consider the dynamic nature of project progress and external factors. This research proposes a machine learning-based approach to forecast project performance metrics, such as cost variance and earned value, for each Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) category in an urban road reconstruction project. The proposed model utilizes time series forecasting techniques, including Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to predict future performance based on historical data and project progress. The model also incorporates external factors, such as weather patterns and resource availability, as features to enhance the accuracy of forecasts. By applying the predictive power of machine learning, the performance forecasting model enables proactive identification of potential deviations from the baseline plan, which allows project managers to take timely corrective actions. The research aims to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a case study of an urban road reconstruction project, comparing the model's forecasts with actual project performance data. The findings of this research contribute to the advancement of project management practices in the construction industry, offering a data-driven solution for improving project performance monitoring and control.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their outstanding performance in handling graph-related tasks, such as social network analysis, protein design, and so on. Despite their widespread application, recent research has demonstrated that GNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, implemented by injecting triggers into the training datasets. Trained on the poisoned data, GNNs will predict target labels when attaching trigger patterns to inputs. This vulnerability poses significant security risks for applications of GNNs in sensitive domains, such as drug discovery. While there has been extensive research into backdoor defenses for images, strategies to safeguard GNNs against such attacks remain underdeveloped. Furthermore, we point out that conventional backdoor defense methods designed for images cannot work well when directly implemented on graph data. In this paper, we first analyze the key difference between image backdoor and graph backdoor attacks. Then we tackle the graph defense problem by presenting a novel approach called MADE, which devises an adversarial mask generation mechanism that selectively preserves clean sub-graphs and further leverages masks on edge weights to eliminate the influence of triggers effectively. Extensive experiments across various graph classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of MADE in significantly reducing the attack success rate (ASR) while maintaining a high classification accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Zubair Khan, David Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to binary classification using dynamic logistic ensemble models. The proposed method addresses the challenges posed by datasets containing inherent internal clusters that lack explicit feature-based separations. By extending traditional logistic regression, we develop an algorithm that automatically partitions the dataset into multiple subsets, constructing an ensemble of logistic models to enhance classification accuracy. A key innovation in this work is the recursive probability calculation, derived through algebraic manipulation and mathematical induction, which enables scalable and efficient model construction. Compared to traditional ensemble methods such as Bagging and Boosting, our approach maintains interpretability while offering competitive performance. Furthermore, we systematically employ maximum likelihood and cost functions to facilitate the analytical derivation of recursive gradients as functions of ensemble depth. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on a custom dataset created by introducing noise and shifting data to simulate group structures, resulting in significant performance improvements with layers. Implemented in Python, this work balances computational efficiency with theoretical rigor, providing a robust and interpretable solution for complex classification tasks with broad implications for machine learning applications.

Recommendation systems play a crucial role in addressing this issue. To prevent the leakage of each user's (client's) private data, Federated Recommendation Systems (FedRec) have been proposed and widely used. However, extensive research has shown that FedRec suffers from security issues such as data privacy leakage, and it is challenging to train effective models with FedRec when each client only holds interaction information for a single user. To address these two problems, this paper proposes a new privacy-preserving recommendation system (PRSI), which includes a preprocessing module and two main phases. The preprocessing module employs split vectors and fake interaction items to protect clients' interaction information and recommendation results. The two main phases are: (1) the collection of interaction information and (2) the sending of recommendation results. In the interaction information collection phase, each client uses the preprocessing module and random communication methods (according to the designed interactive protocol) to protect their ID information and IP addresses. In the recommendation results sending phase, the central server uses the preprocessing module and triplets to distribute recommendation results to each client under secure conditions, following the designed interactive protocol. Finally, we conducted multiple sets of experiments to verify the security, accuracy, and communication cost of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> J\'er\'emie Sublime</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's world, AI programs powered by Machine Learning are ubiquitous, and have achieved seemingly exceptional performance across a broad range of tasks, from medical diagnosis and credit rating in banking, to theft detection via video analysis, and even predicting political or sexual orientation from facial images. These predominantly deep learning methods excel due to their extraordinary capacity to process vast amounts of complex data to extract complex correlations and relationship from different levels of features.
  In this paper, we contend that the designers and final users of these ML methods have forgotten a fundamental lesson from statistics: correlation does not imply causation. Not only do most state-of-the-art methods neglect this crucial principle, but by doing so they often produce nonsensical or flawed causal models, akin to social astrology or physiognomy. Consequently, we argue that current efforts to make AI models more ethical by merely reducing biases in the training data are insufficient. Through examples, we will demonstrate that the potential for harm posed by these methods can only be mitigated by a complete rethinking of their core models, improved quality assessment metrics and policies, and by maintaining humans oversight throughout the process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yudong Zhang, Ruobing Xie, Jiansheng Chen, Xingwu Sun, Zhanhui kang, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on complex multimodal tasks. However, they continue to suffer from significant hallucination issues, including object, attribute, and relational hallucinations. To accurately detect these hallucinations, we investigated the variations in cross-modal attention patterns between hallucination and non-hallucination states. Leveraging these distinctions, we developed a lightweight detector capable of identifying hallucinations. Our proposed method, Detecting Hallucinations by Cross-modal Attention Patterns (DHCP), is straightforward and does not require additional LVLM training or extra LVLM inference steps. Experimental results show that DHCP achieves remarkable performance in hallucination detection. By offering novel insights into the identification and analysis of hallucinations in LVLMs, DHCP contributes to advancing the reliability and trustworthiness of these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shivangi Aneja, Artem Sevastopolsky, Tobias Kirschstein, Justus Thies, Angela Dai, Matthias Nie{\ss}ner</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce GaussianSpeech, a novel approach that synthesizes high-fidelity animation sequences of photo-realistic, personalized 3D human head avatars from spoken audio. To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads, including skin furrowing and finer-scale facial movements, we propose to couple speech signal with 3D Gaussian splatting to create realistic, temporally coherent motion sequences. We propose a compact and efficient 3DGS-based avatar representation that generates expression-dependent color and leverages wrinkle- and perceptually-based losses to synthesize facial details, including wrinkles that occur with different expressions. To enable sequence modeling of 3D Gaussian splats with audio, we devise an audio-conditioned transformer model capable of extracting lip and expression features directly from audio input. Due to the absence of high-quality datasets of talking humans in correspondence with audio, we captured a new large-scale multi-view dataset of audio-visual sequences of talking humans with native English accents and diverse facial geometry. GaussianSpeech consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with visually natural motion at real time rendering rates, while encompassing diverse facial expressions and styles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sathwik Karnik, Zhang-Wei Hong, Nishant Abhangi, Yen-Chen Lin, Tsun-Hsuan Wang, Pulkit Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: Language-conditioned robot models (i.e., robotic foundation models) enable robots to perform a wide range of tasks based on natural language instructions. Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, evaluating the safety and effectiveness of these models is challenging due to the complexity of testing all possible language variations. Current benchmarks have two key limitations: they rely on a limited set of human-generated instructions, missing many challenging cases, and they focus only on task performance without assessing safety, such as avoiding damage. To address these gaps, we introduce Embodied Red Teaming (ERT), a new evaluation method that generates diverse and challenging instructions to test these models. ERT uses automated red teaming techniques with Vision Language Models (VLMs) to create contextually grounded, difficult instructions. Experimental results show that state-of-the-art models frequently fail or behave unsafely on ERT tests, underscoring the shortcomings of current benchmarks in evaluating real-world performance and safety.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Pardo, Fabio Pizzati, Tong Zhang, Alexander Pondaven, Philip Torr, Juan Camilo Perez, Bernard Ghanem</p>
<p>Abstract: Match-cuts are powerful cinematic tools that create seamless transitions between scenes, delivering strong visual and metaphorical connections. However, crafting match-cuts is a challenging, resource-intensive process requiring deliberate artistic planning. In MatchDiffusion, we present the first training-free method for match-cut generation using text-to-video diffusion models. MatchDiffusion leverages a key property of diffusion models: early denoising steps define the scene's broad structure, while later steps add details. Guided by this insight, MatchDiffusion employs "Joint Diffusion" to initialize generation for two prompts from shared noise, aligning structure and motion. It then applies "Disjoint Diffusion", allowing the videos to diverge and introduce unique details. This approach produces visually coherent videos suited for match-cuts. User studies and metrics demonstrate MatchDiffusion's effectiveness and potential to democratize match-cut creation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumya Suvra Ghosal, Souradip Chakraborty, Vaibhav Singh, Tianrui Guan, Mengdi Wang, Ahmad Beirami, Furong Huang, Alvaro Velasquez, Dinesh Manocha, Amrit Singh Bedi</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread deployment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for visual-reasoning tasks, improving their safety has become crucial. Recent research indicates that despite training-time safety alignment, these models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks: carefully crafted image-prompt pairs that compel the model to generate harmful content. In this work, we first highlight a critical safety gap, demonstrating that alignment achieved solely through safety training may be insufficient against jailbreak attacks. To address this vulnerability, we propose Immune, an inference-time defense framework that leverages a safe reward model during decoding to defend against jailbreak attacks. Additionally, we provide a rigorous mathematical characterization of Immune, offering provable guarantees against jailbreaks. Extensive evaluations on diverse jailbreak benchmarks using recent MLLMs reveal that Immune effectively enhances model safety while preserving the model's original capabilities. For instance, against text-based jailbreak attacks on LLaVA-1.6, Immune reduces the attack success rate by 57.82% and 16.78% compared to the base MLLM and state-of-the-art defense strategy, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miles Q. Li, Benjamin C. M. Fung, Shih-Chia Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large language models is a computationally intensive process that often requires substantial resources to achieve state-of-the-art results. Incremental layer-wise training has been proposed as a potential strategy to optimize the training process by progressively introducing layers, with the expectation that this approach would lead to faster convergence and more efficient use of computational resources. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of incremental training for LLMs, dividing the training process into multiple stages where layers are added progressively. Our experimental results indicate that while the incremental approach initially demonstrates some computational efficiency, it ultimately requires greater overall computational costs to reach comparable performance to traditional full-scale training. Although the incremental training process can eventually close the performance gap with the baseline, it does so only after significantly extended continual training. These findings suggest that incremental layer-wise training may not be a viable alternative for training large language models, highlighting its limitations and providing valuable insights into the inefficiencies of this approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chicago Y. Park, Michael T. McCann, Cristina Garcia-Cardona, Brendt Wohlberg, Ulugbek S. Kamilov</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a simple template for designing generative diffusion model algorithms based on an interpretation of diffusion sampling as a sequence of random walks. Score-based diffusion models are widely used to generate high-quality images. Diffusion models have also been shown to yield state-of-the-art performance in many inverse problems. While these algorithms are often surprisingly simple, the theory behind them is not, and multiple complex theoretical justifications exist in the literature. Here, we provide a simple and largely self-contained theoretical justification for score-based-diffusion models that avoids using the theory of Markov chains or reverse diffusion, instead centering the theory of random walks and Tweedie's formula. This approach leads to unified algorithmic templates for network training and sampling. In particular, these templates cleanly separate training from sampling, e.g., the noise schedule used during training need not match the one used during sampling. We show that several existing diffusion models correspond to particular choices within this template and demonstrate that other, more straightforward algorithmic choices lead to effective diffusion models. The proposed framework has the added benefit of enabling conditional sampling without any likelihood approximation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiffany Zhu, Kexun Zhang, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The impressive essay writing and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT have opened up new avenues in education. Our goal is to gain insights into the widespread use of LLMs among secondary students to inform their future development. Despite school restrictions, our survey of over 300 middle and high school students revealed that a remarkable 70% of students have utilized LLMs, higher than the usage percentage among young adults, and this percentage remains consistent across 7th to 12th grade. Students also reported using LLMs for multiple subjects, including language arts, history, and math assignments, but expressed mixed thoughts on their effectiveness due to occasional hallucinations in historical contexts and incorrect answers for lack of rigorous reasoning. The survey feedback called for LLMs better adapted for students, and also raised questions to developers and educators on how to help students from underserved communities leverage LLMs' capabilities for equal access to advanced education resources. We propose a few ideas to address such issues, including subject-specific models, personalized learning, and AI classrooms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eoin M. Kenny, Akshay Dharmavaram, Sang Uk Lee, Tung Phan-Minh, Shreyas Rajesh, Yunqing Hu, Laura Major, Momchil S. Tomov, Julie A. Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-driving cars increasingly rely on deep neural networks to achieve human-like driving. However, the opacity of such black-box motion planners makes it challenging for the human behind the wheel to accurately anticipate when they will fail, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Here, we introduce concept-wrapper network (i.e., CW-Net), a method for explaining the behavior of black-box motion planners by grounding their reasoning in human-interpretable concepts. We deploy CW-Net on a real self-driving car and show that the resulting explanations refine the human driver's mental model of the car, allowing them to better predict its behavior and adjust their own behavior accordingly. Unlike previous work using toy domains or simulations, our study presents the first real-world demonstration of how to build authentic autonomous vehicles (AVs) that give interpretable, causally faithful explanations for their decisions, without sacrificing performance. We anticipate our method could be applied to other safety-critical systems with a human in the loop, such as autonomous drones and robotic surgeons. Overall, our study suggests a pathway to explainability for autonomous agents as a whole, which can help make them more transparent, their deployment safer, and their usage more ethical.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shrey Ganatra, Spandan Anaokar, Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p>
<p>Abstract: Have you ever considered the sheer volume of actions we perform using IoT (Internet of Things) devices within our homes, offices, and daily environments? From the mundane act of flicking a light switch to the precise adjustment of room temperatures, we are surrounded by a wealth of data, each representing a glimpse into user behaviour. While existing research has sought to decipher user behaviours from these interactions and their timestamps, a critical dimension still needs to be explored: the timing of these actions. Despite extensive efforts to understand and forecast user behaviours, the temporal dimension of these interactions has received scant attention. However, the timing of actions holds profound implications for user experience, efficiency, and overall satisfaction with intelligent systems. In our paper, we venture into the less-explored realm of human-centric AI by endeavoring to predict user actions and their timing. To achieve this, we contribute a meticulously synthesized dataset comprising 11k sequences of actions paired with their respective date and time stamps. Building upon this dataset, we propose our model, which employs advanced machine learning techniques for k-class classification over time intervals within a day. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at time prediction for smart homes. We achieve a 40% (96-class) accuracy across all datasets and an 80% (8-class) accuracy on the dataset containing exact timestamps, showcasing the efficacy of our approach in predicting the temporal dynamics of user actions within smart environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yael Vinker</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual communication, dating back to prehistoric cave paintings, is the use of visual elements to convey ideas and information. In today's visually saturated world, effective design demands an understanding of graphic design principles, visual storytelling, human psychology, and the ability to distill complex information into clear visuals. This dissertation explores how recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) can be leveraged to automate the creation of effective visual communication designs. Although generative models have made great progress in generating images from text, they still struggle to simplify complex ideas into clear, abstract visuals and are constrained by pixel-based outputs, which lack flexibility for many design tasks. To address these challenges, we constrain the models' operational space and introduce task-specific regularizations. We explore various aspects of visual communication, namely, sketches and visual abstraction, typography, animation, and visual inspiration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graphic visual content helps in promoting information communication and inspiration divergence. However, the interpretation of visual content currently relies mainly on humans' personal knowledge background, thereby affecting the quality and efficiency of information acquisition and understanding. To improve the quality and efficiency of visual information transmission and avoid the limitation of the observer due to the information cocoon, we propose CoVis, a collaborative framework for fine-grained visual understanding. By designing and implementing a cascaded dual-layer segmentation network coupled with a large-language-model (LLM) based content generator, the framework extracts as much knowledge as possible from an image. Then, it generates visual analytics for images, assisting observers in comprehending imagery from a more holistic perspective. Quantitative experiments and qualitative experiments based on 32 human participants indicate that the CoVis has better performance than current methods in feature extraction and can generate more comprehensive and detailed visual descriptions than current general-purpose large models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haomin Zhuang, Yihua Zhang, Kehan Guo, Jinghan Jia, Gaowen Liu, Sijia Liu, Xiangliang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language model (LLM) unlearning have shown remarkable success in removing unwanted data-model influences while preserving the model's utility for legitimate knowledge. However, despite these strides, sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs--a key subset of the LLM family--have received little attention and remain largely unexplored in the context of unlearning. As MoE LLMs are celebrated for their exceptional performance and highly efficient inference processes, we ask: How can unlearning be performed effectively and efficiently on MoE LLMs? And will traditional unlearning methods be applicable to MoE architectures? Our pilot study shows that the dynamic routing nature of MoE LLMs introduces unique challenges, leading to substantial utility drops when existing unlearning methods are applied. Specifically, unlearning disrupts the router's expert selection, causing significant selection shift from the most unlearning target-related experts to irrelevant ones. As a result, more experts than necessary are affected, leading to excessive forgetting and loss of control over which knowledge is erased. To address this, we propose a novel single-expert unlearning framework, referred to as UOE, for MoE LLMs. Through expert attribution, unlearning is concentrated on the most actively engaged expert for the specified knowledge. Concurrently, an anchor loss is applied to the router to stabilize the active state of this targeted expert, ensuring focused and controlled unlearning that preserves model utility. The proposed UOE framework is also compatible with various unlearning algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UOE enhances both forget quality up to 5% and model utility by 35% on MoE LLMs across various benchmarks, LLM architectures, while only unlearning 0.06% of the model parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: As events progress, news articles often update with new information: if we are not cautious, we risk propagating outdated facts. In this work, we hypothesize that linguistic features indicate factual fluidity, and that we can predict which facts in a news article will update using solely the text of a news article (i.e. not external resources like search engines). We test this hypothesis, first, by isolating fact-updates in large news revisions corpora. News articles may update for many reasons (e.g. factual, stylistic, narrative). We introduce the NewsEdits 2.0 taxonomy, an edit-intentions schema that separates fact updates from stylistic and narrative updates in news writing. We annotate over 9,200 pairs of sentence revisions and train high-scoring ensemble models to apply this schema. Then, taking a large dataset of silver-labeled pairs, we show that we can predict when facts will update in older article drafts with high precision. Finally, to demonstrate the usefulness of these findings, we construct a language model question asking (LLM-QA) abstention task. We wish the LLM to abstain from answering questions when information is likely to become outdated. Using our predictions, we show, LLM absention reaches near oracle levels of accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sequential dense retrieval models utilize advanced sequence learning techniques to compute item and user representations, which are then used to rank relevant items for a user through inner product computation between the user and all item representations. However, this approach requires storing a unique representation for each item, resulting in significant memory requirements as the number of items grow. In contrast, the recently proposed generative retrieval paradigm offers a promising alternative by directly predicting item indices using a generative model trained on semantic IDs that encapsulate items' semantic information. Despite its potential for large-scale applications, a comprehensive comparison between generative retrieval and sequential dense retrieval under fair conditions is still lacking, leaving open questions regarding performance, and computation trade-offs. To address this, we compare these two approaches under controlled conditions on academic benchmarks and propose LIGER (LeveragIng dense retrieval for GEnerative Retrieval), a hybrid model that combines the strengths of these two widely used methods. LIGER integrates sequential dense retrieval into generative retrieval, mitigating performance differences and enhancing cold-start item recommendation in the datasets evaluated. This hybrid approach provides insights into the trade-offs between these approaches and demonstrates improvements in efficiency and effectiveness for recommendation systems in small-scale benchmarks.</p>

The learnable distance measure captures motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a self-supervised learning model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chatchuea Kimchaiwong, Jeremie Houssineau, Adam M. Johansen</p>
<p>Abstract: The problem of incorporating information from observations received serially in time is widespread in the field of uncertainty quantification. Within a probabilistic framework, such problems can be addressed using standard filtering techniques. However, in many real-world problems, some (or all) of the uncertainty is epistemic, arising from a lack of knowledge, and is difficult to model probabilistically. This paper introduces a possibilistic ensemble Kalman filter designed for this setting and characterizes some of its properties. Using possibility theory to describe epistemic uncertainty is appealing from a philosophical perspective, and it is easy to justify certain heuristics often employed in standard ensemble Kalman filters as principled approaches to capturing uncertainty within it. The possibilistic approach motivates a robust mechanism for characterizing uncertainty which shows good performance with small sample sizes, and can outperform standard ensemble Kalman filters at given sample size, even when dealing with genuinely aleatoric uncertainty.</p>

While significant advancements have been made in BCI EEG research, a major limitation still exists: the scarcity of publicly available EEG datasets for non-English languages, such as Arabic. To address this gap, we introduce in this paper ArEEG_Words dataset, a novel EEG dataset recorded from 22 participants with mean age of 22 years (5 female, 17 male) using a 14-channel Emotiv Epoc X device. The participants were asked to be free from any effects on their nervous system, such as coffee, alcohol, cigarettes, and so 8 hours before recording. They were asked to stay calm in a clam room during imagining one of the 16 Arabic Words for 10 seconds. The words include 16 commonly used words such as up, down, left, and right. A total of 352 EEG recordings were collected, then each recording was divided into multiple 250ms signals, resulting in a total of 15,360 EEG signals. To the best of our knowledge, ArEEG_Words data is the first of its kind in Arabic EEG domain. Moreover, it is publicly available for researchers as we hope that will fill the gap in Arabic EEG research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinlin Zhu, Xunkai Li, Miao Hu, Di Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of big data, managing evolving graph data poses substantial challenges due to storage costs and privacy issues. Training graph neural networks (GNNs) on such evolving data usually causes catastrophic forgetting, impairing performance on earlier tasks. Despite existing continual graph learning (CGL) methods mitigating this to some extent, they predominantly operate in centralized architectures and overlook the potential of distributed graph databases to harness collective intelligence for enhanced performance optimization. To address these challenges, we present a pioneering study on Federated Continual Graph Learning (FCGL), which adapts GNNs to multiple evolving graphs within decentralized settings while adhering to storage and privacy constraints. Our work begins with a comprehensive empirical analysis of FCGL, assessing its data characteristics, feasibility, and effectiveness, and reveals two principal challenges: local graph forgetting (LGF), where local GNNs forget prior knowledge when adapting to new tasks, and global expertise conflict (GEC), where the global GNN exhibits sub-optimal performance in both adapting to new tasks and retaining old ones, arising from inconsistent client expertise during server-side parameter aggregation. To tackle these, we propose the POWER framework, which mitigates LGF by preserving and replaying experience nodes with maximum local-global coverage at each client and addresses GEC by using a pseudo prototype reconstruction strategy and trajectory-aware knowledge transfer at the central server. Extensive evaluations across multiple graph datasets demonstrate POWER's superior performance over straightforward federated extensions of the centralized CGL algorithms and vision-focused federated continual learning algorithms.

<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become one of the most significant health challenges in an aging society. The use of spoken language-based AD detection methods has gained prevalence due to their scalability due to their scalability. Based on the Cookie Theft picture description task, we devised an explainable and effective feature set that leverages the visual capabilities of a large language model (LLM) and the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) model. Our experimental results show that the newly proposed features consistently outperform traditional linguistic features across two different classifiers with high dimension efficiency. Our new features can be well explained and interpreted step by step which enhance the interpretability of automatic AD screening.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meher Bhardwaj, Hrishikesh Ethari, Dennis Singh Moirangthem</p>
<p>Abstract: The SQL-to-text generation task traditionally uses template base, Seq2Seq, tree-to-sequence, and graph-to-sequence models. Recent models take advantage of pre-trained generative language models for this task in the Seq2Seq framework. However, treating SQL as a sequence of inputs to the pre-trained models is not optimal. In this work, we put forward a new SQL intermediate representation called EzSQL to align SQL with the natural language text sequence. EzSQL simplifies the SQL queries and brings them closer to natural language text by modifying operators and keywords, which can usually be described in natural language. EzSQL also removes the need for set operators. Our proposed SQL-to-text generation model uses EzSQL as the input to a pre-trained generative language model for generating the text descriptions. We demonstrate that our model is an effective state-of-the-art method to generate text narrations from SQL queries on the WikiSQL and Spider datasets. We also show that by generating pretraining data using our SQL-to-text generation model, we can enhance the performance of Text-to-SQL parsers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sakshi Agarwal, Gabe Hoope, Erik B. Sudderth</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models learn to remove noise that is artificially added to the data during training. Novel data, like images, may then be generated from Gaussian noise through a sequence of denoising operations. While this Markov process implicitly defines a joint distribution over noise-free data, it is not simple to condition the generative process on masked or partial images. A number of heuristic sampling procedures have been proposed for solving inverse problems with diffusion priors, but these approaches do not directly approximate the true conditional distribution imposed by inference queries, and are often ineffective for large masked regions. Moreover, many of these baselines cannot be applied to latent diffusion models which use image encodings for efficiency. We instead develop a hierarchical variational inference algorithm that analytically marginalizes missing features, and uses a rigorous variational bound to optimize a non-Gaussian Markov approximation of the true diffusion posterior. Through extensive experiments with both pixel-based and latent diffusion models of images, we show that our VIPaint method significantly outperforms previous approaches in both the plausibility and diversity of imputations, and is easily generalized to other inverse problems like deblurring and superresolution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rao Fu, Ziyang Luo, Hongzhan Lin, Zhen Ye, Jing Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs) have showcased impressive code generation capabilities, primarily evaluated through image-to-code benchmarks. However, these benchmarks are limited to specific visual programming scenarios where the logic reasoning and the multimodal understanding capacities are split apart. To fill this gap, we propose ScratchEval, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the visual programming reasoning ability of LMMs. ScratchEval is based on Scratch, a block-based visual programming language widely used in children's programming education. By integrating visual elements and embedded programming logic, ScratchEval requires the model to process both visual information and code structure, thereby comprehensively evaluating its programming intent understanding ability. Our evaluation approach goes beyond the traditional image-to-code mapping and focuses on unified logical thinking and problem-solving abilities, providing a more comprehensive and challenging framework for evaluating the visual programming ability of LMMs. ScratchEval not only fills the gap in existing evaluation methods, but also provides new insights for the future development of LMMs in the field of visual programming.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xue Tan, Hao Luan, Mingyu Luo, Xiaoyan Sun, Ping Chen, Jun Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are progressively deployed across diverse fields and real-world applications, ensuring the security and robustness of LLMs has become ever more critical. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a cutting-edge approach designed to address the limitations of large language models (LLMs). By retrieving information from the relevant knowledge database, RAG enriches the input to LLMs, enabling them to produce responses that are more accurate and contextually appropriate. It is worth noting that the knowledge database, being sourced from publicly available channels such as Wikipedia, inevitably introduces a new attack surface. RAG poisoning involves injecting malicious texts into the knowledge database, ultimately leading to the generation of the attacker's target response (also called poisoned response). However, there are currently limited methods available for detecting such poisoning attacks. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. Particularly, we introduce RevPRAG, a flexible and automated detection pipeline that leverages the activations of LLMs for poisoned response detection. Our investigation uncovers distinct patterns in LLMs' activations when generating correct responses versus poisoned responses. Our results on multiple benchmark datasets and RAG architectures show our approach could achieve 98% true positive rate, while maintaining false positive rates close to 1%. We also evaluate recent backdoor detection methods specifically designed for LLMs and applicable for identifying poisoned responses in RAG. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaomin Wang, Chaolong Ying, Xiaodong Luo, Tianshu Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Inference in large-scale Markov Random Fields (MRFs) is a critical yet challenging task, traditionally approached through approximate methods like belief propagation and mean field, or exact methods such as the Toulbar2 solver. These strategies often fail to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and solution quality, particularly as the problem scale increases. This paper introduces NeuroLifting, a novel technique that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to reparameterize decision variables in MRFs, facilitating the use of standard gradient descent optimization. By extending traditional lifting techniques into a non-parametric neural network framework, NeuroLifting benefits from the smooth loss landscape of neural networks, enabling efficient and parallelizable optimization. Empirical results demonstrate that, on moderate scales, NeuroLifting performs very close to the exact solver Toulbar2 in terms of solution quality, significantly surpassing existing approximate methods. Notably, on large-scale MRFs, NeuroLifting delivers superior solution quality against all baselines, as well as exhibiting linear computational complexity growth. This work presents a significant advancement in MRF inference, offering a scalable and effective solution for large-scale problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiancheng Zhang, Peiran Dong, Yongyong Chen, Yin-Ping Zhao, Song Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have gained great attention in adversarial purification. Current diffusion-based works focus on designing effective condition-guided mechanisms while ignoring a fundamental problem, i.e., the original DDPM sampling is intended for stable generation, which may not be the optimal solution for adversarial purification. Inspired by the stability of the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM), we propose an opposite sampling scheme called random sampling. In brief, random sampling will sample from a random noisy space during each diffusion process, while DDPM and DDIM sampling will continuously sample from the adjacent or original noisy space. Thus, random sampling obtains more randomness and achieves stronger robustness against adversarial attacks. Correspondingly, we also introduce a novel mediator conditional guidance to guarantee the consistency of the prediction under the purified image and clean image input. To expand awareness of guided diffusion purification, we conduct a detailed evaluation with different sampling methods and our random sampling achieves an impressive improvement in multiple settings. Leveraging mediator-guided random sampling, we also establish a baseline method named DiffAP, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in performance and defensive stability. Remarkably, under strong attack, our DiffAP even achieves a more than 20% robustness advantage with 10$\times$ sampling acceleration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ninnart Fuengfusin, Hakaru Tamukoh</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have enabled smart applications on hardware devices. However, these hardware devices are vulnerable to unintended faults caused by aging, temperature variance, and write errors. These faults can cause bit-flips in DNN weights and significantly degrade the performance of DNNs. Thus, protection against these faults is crucial for the deployment of DNNs in critical applications. Previous works have proposed error correction codes based methods, however these methods often require high overheads in both memory and computation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to harden DNN weights by multiplying weights by constants before storing them to fault-prone medium. When used, these weights are divided back by the same constants to restore the original scale. Our method is based on the observation that errors from bit-flips have properties similar to additive noise, therefore by dividing by constants can reduce the absolute error from bit-flips. To demonstrate our method, we conduct experiments across four ImageNet 2012 pre-trained models along with three different data types: 32-bit floating point, 16-bit floating point, and 8-bit fixed point. This method demonstrates that by only multiplying weights with constants, Top-1 Accuracy of 8-bit fixed point ResNet50 is improved by 54.418 at bit-error rate of 0.0001.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonggai Zhuang, Haoran Chen, Kequan Wang, Teng Fei</p>
<p>Abstract: The complexity of stocks and industries presents challenges for stock prediction. Currently, stock prediction models can be divided into two categories. One category, represented by GRU and ALSTM, relies solely on stock factors for prediction, with limited effectiveness. The other category, represented by HIST and TRA, incorporates not only stock factors but also industry information, industry financial reports, public sentiment, and other inputs for prediction. The second category of models can capture correlations between stocks by introducing additional information, but the extra data is difficult to standardize and generalize. Considering the current state and limitations of these two types of models, this paper proposes the GRU-PFG (Project Factors into Graph) model. This model only takes stock factors as input and extracts inter-stock correlations using graph neural networks. It achieves prediction results that not only outperform the others models relies solely on stock factors, but also achieve comparable performance to the second category models. The experimental results show that on the CSI300 dataset, the IC of GRU-PFG is 0.134, outperforming HIST's 0.131 and significantly surpassing GRU and Transformer, achieving results better than the second category models. Moreover as a model that relies solely on stock factors, it has greater potential for generalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: At-home rehabilitation for post-stroke patients presents significant challenges, as continuous, personalized care is often limited outside clinical settings. Additionally, the absence of comprehensive solutions addressing diverse rehabilitation needs in home environments complicates recovery efforts. Here, we introduce a smart home platform that integrates wearable sensors, ambient monitoring, and large language model (LLM)-powered assistance to provide seamless health monitoring and intelligent support. The system leverages machine learning enabled plantar pressure arrays for motor recovery assessment (94% classification accuracy), a wearable eye-tracking module for cognitive evaluation, and ambient sensors for precise smart home control (100% operational success, <1 s latency). Additionally, the LLM-powered agent, Auto-Care, offers real-time interventions, such as health reminders and environmental adjustments, enhancing user satisfaction by 29%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ninnart Fuengfusin, Hakaru Tamukoh</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) in real-world environments poses challenges due to faults that can manifest in physical hardware from radiation, aging, and temperature fluctuations. To address this, previous works have focused on protecting DNNs via activation range restriction using clipped ReLU and finding the optimal clipping threshold. However, this work instead focuses on constraining DNN weights by applying saturated activation functions (SAFs): Tanh, Arctan, and others. SAFs prevent faults from causing DNN weights to become excessively large, which can lead to model failure. These methods not only enhance the robustness of DNNs against fault injections but also improve DNN performance by a small margin. Before deployment, DNNs are trained with weights constrained by SAFs. During deployment, the weights without applied SAF are written to mediums with faults. When read, weights with faults are applied with SAFs and are used for inference. We demonstrate our proposed method across three datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet 2012) and across three datatypes (32-bit floating point (FP32), 16-bit floating point, and 8-bit fixed point). We show that our method enables FP32 ResNet18 with ImageNet 2012 to operate at a bit-error rate of 0.00001 with minor accuracy loss, while without the proposed method, the FP32 DNN only produces random guesses. Furthermore, to accelerate the training process, we demonstrate that an ImageNet 2012 pre-trained ResNet18 can be adapted to SAF by training for a few epochs with a slight improvement in Top-1 accuracy while still ensuring robustness against fault injection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutong Zhang, Lixing Chen, Shenghong Li, Nan Cao, Yang Shi, Jiaxin Ding, Zhe Qu, Pan Zhou, Yang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide variety of domains. Nonetheless, generalist LLMs continue to fall short in reasoning tasks necessitating specialized knowledge. Prior investigations into specialized LLMs focused on domain-specific training, which entails substantial efforts in domain data acquisition and model parameter fine-tuning. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Way-to-Specialist (WTS) framework, which synergizes retrieval-augmented generation with knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance the specialized capability of LLMs in the absence of specialized training. In distinction to existing paradigms that merely utilize external knowledge from general KGs or static domain KGs to prompt LLM for enhanced domain-specific reasoning, WTS proposes an innovative "LLM$\circlearrowright$KG" paradigm, which achieves bidirectional enhancement between specialized LLM and domain knowledge graph (DKG). The proposed paradigm encompasses two closely coupled components: the DKG-Augmented LLM and the LLM-Assisted DKG Evolution. The former retrieves question-relevant domain knowledge from DKG and uses it to prompt LLM to enhance the reasoning capability for domain-specific tasks; the latter leverages LLM to generate new domain knowledge from processed tasks and use it to evolve DKG. WTS closes the loop between DKG-Augmented LLM and LLM-Assisted DKG Evolution, enabling continuous improvement in the domain specialization as it progressively answers and learns from domain-specific questions. We validate the performance of WTS on 6 datasets spanning 5 domains. The experimental results show that WTS surpasses the previous SOTA in 4 specialized domains and achieves a maximum performance improvement of 11.3%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dazhuang Liu, Yanqi Qiao, Rui Wang, Kaitai Liang, Georgios Smaragdakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Current black-box backdoor attacks in convolutional neural networks formulate attack objective(s) as single-objective optimization problems in single domain. Designing triggers in single domain harms semantics and trigger robustness as well as introduces visual and spectral anomaly. This work proposes a multi-objective black-box backdoor attack in dual domains via evolutionary algorithm (LADDER), the first instance of achieving multiple attack objectives simultaneously by optimizing triggers without requiring prior knowledge about victim model. In particular, we formulate LADDER as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) and solve it via multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). MOEA maintains a population of triggers with trade-offs among attack objectives and uses non-dominated sort to drive triggers toward optimal solutions. We further apply preference-based selection to MOEA to exclude impractical triggers. We state that LADDER investigates a new dual-domain perspective for trigger stealthiness by minimizing the anomaly between clean and poisoned samples in the spectral domain. Lastly, the robustness against preprocessing operations is achieved by pushing triggers to low-frequency regions. Extensive experiments comprehensively showcase that LADDER achieves attack effectiveness of at least 99%, attack robustness with 90.23% (50.09% higher than state-of-the-art attacks on average), superior natural stealthiness (1.12x to 196.74x improvement) and excellent spectral stealthiness (8.45x enhancement) as compared to current stealthy attacks by the average $l_2$-norm across 5 public datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Beautimeter is a new tool powered by generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) technology, designed to evaluate architectural and urban beauty. Rooted in Christopher Alexander's theory of centers, this work builds on the idea that all environments possess, to varying degrees, an innate sense of life. Alexander identified 15 fundamental properties, such as levels of scale and thick boundaries, that characterize living structure, which Beautimeter uses as a basis for its analysis. By integrating GPT's advanced natural language processing capabilities, Beautimeter assesses the extent to which a structure embodies these 15 properties, enabling a nuanced evaluation of architectural and urban aesthetics. Using ChatGPT, the tool helps users generate insights into the perceived beauty and coherence of spaces. We conducted a series of case studies, evaluating images of architectural and urban environments, as well as carpets, paintings, and other artifacts. The results demonstrate Beautimeter's effectiveness in analyzing aesthetic qualities across diverse contexts. Our findings suggest that by leveraging GPT technology, Beautimeter offers architects, urban planners, and designers a powerful tool to create spaces that resonate deeply with people. This paper also explores the implications of such technology for architecture and urban design, highlighting its potential to enhance both the design process and the assessment of built environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gwangoo Yeo, Jiin Kim, Yujeong Choi, Minsoo Rhu</p>
<p>Abstract: NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) is a feature that enables system designers to reconfigure one large GPU into multiple smaller GPU slices. This work characterizes this emerging GPU and evaluates its effectiveness in designing high-performance AI inference servers. Our study reveals that the data preprocessing stage of AI inference causes significant performance bottlenecks to MIG. To this end, we present PREBA, which is a hardware/software co-design targeting MIG inference servers. Our first proposition is an FPGA-based data preprocessing accelerator that unlocks the full potential of MIG with domain-specific acceleration of data preprocessing. The MIG inference server unleashed from preprocessing overheads is then augmented with our dynamic batching system that enables high-performance inference. PREBA is implemented end-to-end in real systems, providing a 3.7x improvement in throughput, 3.4x reduction in tail latency, 3.5x improvement in energy-efficiency, and 3.0x improvement in cost-efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daewon Yoon, Hyungsuk Lee, Wonsik Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the metrics required for generating multi-scene videos based on a continuous scenario, as opposed to traditional short video generation. Scenario-based videos require a comprehensive evaluation that considers multiple factors such as character consistency, artistic coherence, aesthetic quality, and the alignment of the generated content with the intended prompt. Additionally, in video generation, unlike single images, the movement of characters across frames introduces potential issues like distortion or unintended changes, which must be effectively evaluated and corrected. In the context of probabilistic models like diffusion, generating the desired scene requires repeated sampling and manual selection, akin to how a film director chooses the best shots from numerous takes. We propose a score-based evaluation benchmark that automates this process, enabling a more objective and efficient assessment of these complexities. This approach allows for the generation of high-quality multi-scene videos by selecting the best outcomes based on automated scoring rather than manual inspection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peilin Tian, Hao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) are pivotal tasks in the realm of autonomous driving, attracting considerable research attention. While SLAM endeavors to generate real-time maps and determine the vehicle's pose in unfamiliar settings, MOT focuses on the real-time identification and tracking of multiple dynamic objects. Despite their importance, the prevalent approach treats SLAM and MOT as independent modules within an autonomous vehicle system, leading to inherent limitations. Classical SLAM methodologies often rely on a static environment assumption, suitable for indoor rather than dynamic outdoor scenarios. Conversely, conventional MOT techniques typically rely on the vehicle's known state, constraining the accuracy of object state estimations based on this prior. To address these challenges, previous efforts introduced the unified SLAMMOT paradigm, yet primarily focused on simplistic motion patterns. In our team's previous work IMM-SLAMMOT\cite{IMM-SLAMMOT}, we present a novel methodology incorporating consideration of multiple motion models into SLAMMOT i.e. tightly coupled SLAM and MOT, demonstrating its efficacy in LiDAR-based systems. This paper studies feasibility and advantages of instantiating this methodology as visual SLAMMOT, bridging the gap between LiDAR and vision-based sensing mechanisms. Specifically, we propose a solution of visual SLAMMOT considering multiple motion models and validate the inherent advantages of IMM-SLAMMOT in the visual domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roberto Balestri</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates ChatGPT-4o's multimodal content generation, highlighting significant disparities in its treatment of sexual content and nudity versus violent and drug-related themes. Detailed analysis reveals that ChatGPT-4o consistently censors sexual content and nudity, while showing leniency towards violence and drug use. Moreover, a pronounced gender bias emerges, with female-specific content facing stricter regulation compared to male-specific content. This disparity likely stems from media scrutiny and public backlash over past AI controversies, prompting tech companies to impose stringent guidelines on sensitive issues to protect their reputations. Our findings emphasize the urgent need for AI systems to uphold genuine ethical standards and accountability, transcending mere political correctness. This research contributes to the understanding of biases in AI-driven language and multimodal models, calling for more balanced and ethical content moderation practices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Moving object detection and segmentation from a single moving camera is a challenging task, requiring an understanding of recognition, motion and 3D geometry. Combining both recognition and reconstruction boils down to a fusion problem, where appearance and motion features need to be combined for classification and segmentation. In this paper, we present a novel fusion architecture for monocular motion segmentation - M3Former, which leverages the strong performance of transformers for segmentation and multi-modal fusion. As reconstructing motion from monocular video is ill-posed, we systematically analyze different 2D and 3D motion representations for this problem and their importance for segmentation performance. Finally, we analyze the effect of training data and show that diverse datasets are required to achieve SotA performance on Kitti and Davis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyang Guo, Fei Zhu, Fanhu Zeng, Bing Liu, Xu-Yao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning aims to equip models with the ability to retain previously learned knowledge like a human. Recent work incorporating Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning has revitalized the field by introducing lightweight extension modules. However, existing methods usually overlook the issue of information leakage caused by the fact that the experiment data have been used in pre-trained models. Once these duplicate data are removed in the pre-training phase, their performance can be severely affected. In this paper, we propose a new LoRA-based rehearsal-free method named DESIRE. Our method avoids imposing additional constraints during training to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, thereby maximizing the learning of new classes. To integrate knowledge from old and new tasks, we propose two efficient post-processing modules. On the one hand, we retain only two sets of LoRA parameters for merging and propose dynamic representation consolidation to calibrate the merged feature representation. On the other hand, we propose decision boundary refinement to address classifier bias when training solely on new class data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets and strikes an effective balance between stability and plasticity. Our code will be publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce HOT3D, a publicly available dataset for egocentric hand and object tracking in 3D. The dataset offers over 833 minutes (more than 3.7M images) of multi-view RGB/monochrome image streams showing 19 subjects interacting with 33 diverse rigid objects, multi-modal signals such as eye gaze or scene point clouds, as well as comprehensive ground-truth annotations including 3D poses of objects, hands, and cameras, and 3D models of hands and objects. In addition to simple pick-up/observe/put-down actions, HOT3D contains scenarios resembling typical actions in a kitchen, office, and living room environment. The dataset is recorded by two head-mounted devices from Meta: Project Aria, a research prototype of light-weight AR/AI glasses, and Quest 3, a production VR headset sold in millions of units. Ground-truth poses were obtained by a professional motion-capture system using small optical markers attached to hands and objects. Hand annotations are provided in the UmeTrack and MANO formats and objects are represented by 3D meshes with PBR materials obtained by an in-house scanner. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-view egocentric data for three popular tasks: 3D hand tracking, 6DoF object pose estimation, and 3D lifting of unknown in-hand objects. The evaluated multi-view methods, whose benchmarking is uniquely enabled by HOT3D, significantly outperform their single-view counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Pei, Ruoyu Wang, Yongqi Yang, Ye Zhu, Olga Russakovsky, Yu Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Originating from the diffusion phenomenon in physics, which describes the random movement and collisions of particles, diffusion generative models simulate a random walk in the data space along the denoising trajectory. This allows information to diffuse across regions, yielding harmonious outcomes. However, the chaotic and disordered nature of information diffusion in diffusion models often results in undesired interference between image regions, causing degraded detail preservation and contextual inconsistency. In this work, we address these challenges by reframing disordered diffusion as a powerful tool for text-vision-to-image generation (TV2I) tasks, achieving pixel-level condition fidelity while maintaining visual and semantic coherence throughout the image. We first introduce Cyclic One-Way Diffusion (COW), which provides an efficient unidirectional diffusion framework for precise information transfer while minimizing disruptive interference. Building on COW, we further propose Selective One-Way Diffusion (SOW), which utilizes Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to clarify the semantic and spatial relationships within the image. Based on these insights, SOW combines attention mechanisms to dynamically regulate the direction and intensity of diffusion according to contextual relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the untapped potential of controlled information diffusion, offering a path to more adaptive and versatile generative models in a learning-free manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pekka Malo, Lauri Viitasaari, Antti Suominen, Eeva Vilkkumaa, Olli Tahvonen</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies reinforcement learning (RL) in infinite-horizon dynamic decision processes with almost-sure safety constraints. Such safety-constrained decision processes are central to applications in autonomous systems, finance, and resource management, where policies must satisfy strict, state-dependent constraints. We consider a doubly-regularized RL framework that combines reward and parameter regularization to address these constraints within continuous state-action spaces. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a convex regularized objective with parametrized policies in the mean-field regime. Our approach leverages recent developments in mean-field theory and Wasserstein gradient flows to model policies as elements of an infinite-dimensional statistical manifold, with policy updates evolving via gradient flows on the space of parameter distributions. Our main contributions include establishing solvability conditions for safety-constrained problems, defining smooth and bounded approximations that facilitate gradient flows, and demonstrating exponential convergence towards global solutions under sufficient regularization. We provide general conditions on regularization functions, encompassing standard entropy regularization as a special case. The results also enable a particle method implementation for practical RL applications. The theoretical insights and convergence guarantees presented here offer a robust framework for safe RL in complex, high-dimensional decision-making problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arian Fooroogh Mand Arabi, Cansu Koyuturk, Michael O'Mahony, Raffaella Calati, Dimitri Ognibene</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the iterative development of Habit Coach, a GPT-based chatbot designed to support users in habit change through personalized interaction. Employing a user-centered design approach, we developed the chatbot using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which enables behavior personalization without retraining the underlying language model (GPT-4). The system leverages document retrieval and specialized prompts to tailor interactions, drawing from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and narrative therapy techniques. A key challenge in the development process was the difficulty of translating declarative knowledge into effective interaction behaviors. In the initial phase, the chatbot was provided with declarative knowledge about CBT via reference textbooks and high-level conversational goals. However, this approach resulted in imprecise and inefficient behavior, as the GPT model struggled to convert static information into dynamic and contextually appropriate interactions. This highlighted the limitations of relying solely on declarative knowledge to guide chatbot behavior, particularly in nuanced, therapeutic conversations. Over four iterations, we addressed this issue by gradually transitioning towards procedural knowledge, refining the chatbot's interaction strategies, and improving its overall effectiveness. In the final evaluation, 5 participants engaged with the chatbot over five consecutive days, receiving individualized CBT interventions. The Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI) was used to measure habit strength before and after the intervention, revealing a reduction in habit strength post-intervention. These results underscore the importance of procedural knowledge in driving effective, personalized behavior change support in RAG-based systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinxu Wei, Kanhao Zhao, Yong Jiao, Nancy B. Carlisle, Hua Xie, Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Effectively utilizing extensive unlabeled high-density EEG data to improve performance in scenarios with limited labeled low-density EEG data presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we address this by framing it as a graph transfer learning and knowledge distillation problem. We propose a Unified Pre-trained Graph Contrastive Masked Autoencoder Distiller, named EEG-DisGCMAE, to bridge the gap between unlabeled/labeled and high/low-density EEG data. To fully leverage the abundant unlabeled EEG data, we introduce a novel unified graph self-supervised pre-training paradigm, which seamlessly integrates Graph Contrastive Pre-training and Graph Masked Autoencoder Pre-training. This approach synergistically combines contrastive and generative pre-training techniques by reconstructing contrastive samples and contrasting the reconstructions. For knowledge distillation from high-density to low-density EEG data, we propose a Graph Topology Distillation loss function, allowing a lightweight student model trained on low-density data to learn from a teacher model trained on high-density data, effectively handling missing electrodes through contrastive distillation. To integrate transfer learning and distillation, we jointly pre-train the teacher and student models by contrasting their queries and keys during pre-training, enabling robust distillers for downstream tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on four classification tasks across two clinical EEG datasets with abundant unlabeled data and limited labeled data. The experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms contemporary methods in both efficiency and accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Smart contracts are essential for managing digital assets in blockchain networks, highlighting the need for effective security measures. This paper introduces SmartLLMSentry, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT with in-context training, to advance smart contract vulnerability detection. Traditional rule-based frameworks have limitations in integrating new detection rules efficiently. In contrast, SmartLLMSentry utilizes LLMs to streamline this process. We created a specialized dataset of five randomly selected vulnerabilities for model training and evaluation. Our results show an exact match accuracy of 91.1% with sufficient data, although GPT-4 demonstrated reduced performance compared to GPT-3 in rule generation. This study illustrates that SmartLLMSentry significantly enhances the speed and accuracy of vulnerability detection through LLMdriven rule integration, offering a new approach to improving Blockchain security and addressing previously underexplored vulnerabilities in smart contracts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oriol Corcoll Andreu, Athanasios Vlontzos, Michael O'Riordan, Ciaran M. Gilligan-Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating causal effects is vital for decision making. In standard causal effect estimation, treatments are usually binary- or continuous-valued. However, in many important real-world settings, treatments can be structured, high-dimensional objects, such as text, video, or audio. This provides a challenge to traditional causal effect estimation. While leveraging the shared structure across different treatments can help generalize to unseen treatments at test time, we show in this paper that using such structure blindly can lead to biased causal effect estimation. We address this challenge by devising a novel contrastive approach to learn a representation of the high-dimensional treatments, and prove that it identifies underlying causal factors and discards non-causally relevant factors. We prove that this treatment representation leads to unbiased estimates of the causal effect, and empirically validate and benchmark our results on synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Most of current computer vision-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) perform detection and tracking of objects quite successfully under regular conditions. However, under adverse weather and changing lighting conditions, and in complex situations with many overlapping objects, these systems are not completely reliable. The spectral reflectance of the different objects in a driving scene beyond the visible spectrum can offer additional information to increase the reliability of these systems, especially under challenging driving conditions. Furthermore, this information may be significant enough to develop vision systems that allow for a better understanding and interpretation of the whole driving scene. In this work we explore the use of snapshot, video-rate hyperspectral imaging (HSI) cameras in ADAS on the assumption that the near infrared (NIR) spectral reflectance of different materials can help to better segment the objects in real driving scenarios. To do this, we have used the HSI-Drive 1.1 dataset to perform various experiments on spectral classification algorithms. However, the information retrieval of hyperspectral recordings in natural outdoor scenarios is challenging, mainly because of deficient colour constancy and other inherent shortcomings of current snapshot HSI technology, which poses some limitations to the development of pure spectral classifiers. In consequence, in this work we analyze to what extent the spatial features codified by standard, tiny fully convolutional network (FCN) models can improve the performance of HSI segmentation systems for ADAS applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianming Pan, Zeqi Ye, Xiao Yang, Xu Yang, Weiqing Liu, Lewen Wang, Jiang Bian</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven decision-making processes increasingly utilize end-to-end learnable deep neural networks to render final decisions. Sometimes, the output of the forward functions in certain layers is determined by the solutions to mathematical optimization problems, leading to the emergence of differentiable optimization layers that permit gradient back-propagation. However, real-world scenarios often involve large-scale datasets and numerous constraints, presenting significant challenges. Current methods for differentiating optimization problems typically rely on implicit differentiation, which necessitates costly computations on the Jacobian matrices, resulting in low efficiency. In this paper, we introduce BPQP, a differentiable convex optimization framework designed for efficient end-to-end learning. To enhance efficiency, we reformulate the backward pass as a simplified and decoupled quadratic programming problem by leveraging the structural properties of the KKT matrix. This reformulation enables the use of first-order optimization algorithms in calculating the backward pass gradients, allowing our framework to potentially utilize any state-of-the-art solver. As solver technologies evolve, BPQP can continuously adapt and improve its efficiency. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that BPQP achieves a significant improvement in efficiency--typically an order of magnitude faster in overall execution time compared to other differentiable optimization layers. Our results not only highlight the efficiency gains of BPQP but also underscore its superiority over differentiable optimization layer baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Tavanaei, Kee Kiat Koo, Hayreddin Ceker, Shaobai Jiang, Qi Li, Julien Han, Karim Bouyarmane</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of generating structured objects that conform to a complex schema, with intricate dependencies between the different components (facets) of the object. The facets of the object (attributes, fields, columns, properties) can be a mix of short, structured, type-constrained facts, or long natural-language descriptions. The object has to be self-consistent between the different facets in the redundant information it carries (relative consistency), while being grounded with respect to world knowledge (absolute consistency). We frame the problem as a Language Modeling problem (Structured Object Language Modeling) and train an LLM to perform the task natively, without requiring instructions or prompt-engineering. We propose a self-supervised denoising method to train the model from an existing dataset of such objects. The input query can be the existing object itself, in which case the model acts as a regenerator, completing, correcting, normalizing the input, or any unstructured blurb to be structured. We show that the self-supervised denoising training provides a strong baseline, and that additional supervised fine-tuning with small amount of human demonstrations leads to further improvement. Experimental results show that the proposed method matches or outperforms prompt-engineered general-purpose state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3, Mixtral-8x7B), while being order-of-magnitude more cost-efficient.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) aims at segmenting images from free-form textual concepts without predefined training classes. While existing vision-language models such as CLIP can generate segmentation masks by leveraging coarse spatial information from Vision Transformers, they face challenges in spatial localization due to their global alignment of image and text features. Conversely, self-supervised visual models like DINO excel in fine-grained visual encoding but lack integration with language. To bridge this gap, we present Talk2DINO, a novel hybrid approach that combines the spatial accuracy of DINOv2 with the language understanding of CLIP. Our approach aligns the textual embeddings of CLIP to the patch-level features of DINOv2 through a learned mapping function without the need to fine-tune the underlying backbones. At training time, we exploit the attention maps of DINOv2 to selectively align local visual patches with textual embeddings. We show that the powerful semantic and localization abilities of Talk2DINO can enhance the segmentation process, resulting in more natural and less noisy segmentations, and that our approach can also effectively distinguish foreground objects from the background. Experimental results demonstrate that Talk2DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance across several unsupervised OVS benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenghui Li, Edith C. -H. Ngai, Fanghua Ye, Thiemo Voigt</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving and efficient adaptation of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) in Federated Learning (FL) settings. It preserves data privacy by keeping the data decentralized and training the model on local devices, ensuring that raw data never leaves the user's device. Moreover, the integration of PEFT methods such as LoRA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters compared to fine-tuning the entire model, thereby minimizing communication costs and computational overhead. Despite its potential, the security implications of FedPEFT remain underexplored. This paper introduces a novel security threat to FedPEFT, termed PEFT-as-an-Attack (PaaA), which exposes how PEFT can be exploited as an attack vector to circumvent PLMs' safety alignment and generate harmful content in response to malicious prompts. Our evaluation of PaaA reveals that with less than 1% of the model's parameters set as trainable, and a small subset of clients acting maliciously, the attack achieves an approximate 80% attack success rate using representative PEFT methods such as LoRA. To mitigate this threat, we further investigate potential defense strategies, including Robust Aggregation Schemes (RASs) and Post-PEFT Safety Alignment (PPSA). However, our empirical analysis highlights the limitations of these defenses, i.e., even the most advanced RASs, such as DnC and ClippedClustering, struggle to defend against PaaA in scenarios with highly heterogeneous data distributions. Similarly, while PPSA can reduce attack success rates to below 10%, it severely degrades the model's accuracy on the target task. Our results underscore the urgent need for more effective defense mechanisms that simultaneously ensure security and maintain the performance of the FedPEFT paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Niedoba, Berend Zwartsenberg, Kevin Murphy, Frank Wood</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a mechanism for diffusion generalization based on local denoising operations. Through analysis of network and empirical denoisers, we identify local inductive biases in diffusion models. We demonstrate that local denoising operations can be used to approximate the optimal diffusion denoiser. Using a collection of patch-based, local empirical denoisers, we construct a denoiser which approximates the generalization behaviour of diffusion model denoisers over forward and reverse diffusion processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heejeong Nam, Jihyun Kim, Jimin Yeom</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting irregular time series presents significant challenges due to two key issues: the vulnerability of models to mean regression, driven by the noisy and complex nature of the data, and the limitations of traditional error-based evaluation metrics, which fail to capture meaningful patterns and penalize unrealistic forecasts. These problems result in forecasts that often misalign with human intuition. To tackle these challenges, we propose an adversarial learning framework with a deep analysis of adversarial components. Specifically, we emphasize the importance of balancing the modeling of global distribution (overall patterns) and transition dynamics (localized temporal changes) to better capture the nuances of irregular time series. Overall, this research provides practical insights for improving models and evaluation metrics, and pioneers the application of adversarial learning in the domian of irregular time-series forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Brauner, Felix Glawe, Gian Luca Liehner, Luisa Vervier, Martina Ziefle</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding public perception of artificial intelligence (AI) and the tradeoffs between potential risks and benefits is crucial, as these perceptions might shape policy decisions, influence innovation trajectories for successful market strategies, and determine individual and societal acceptance of AI technologies. Using a representative sample of 1100 participants from Germany, this study examines mental models of AI. Participants quantitatively evaluated 71 statements about AI's future capabilities (e.g., autonomous driving, medical care, art, politics, warfare, and societal divides), assessing the expected likelihood of occurrence, perceived risks, benefits, and overall value. We present rankings of these projections alongside visual mappings illustrating public risk-benefit tradeoffs. While many scenarios were deemed likely, participants often associated them with high risks, limited benefits, and low overall value. Across all scenarios, 96.4% ($r^2=96.4\%$) of the variance in value assessment can be explained by perceived risks ($\beta=-.504$) and perceived benefits ($\beta=+.710$), with no significant relation to expected likelihood. Demographics and personality traits influenced perceptions of risks, benefits, and overall evaluations, underscoring the importance of increasing AI literacy and tailoring public information to diverse user needs. These findings provide actionable insights for researchers, developers, and policymakers by highlighting critical public concerns and individual factors essential to align AI development with individual values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Dai, Dan Pechi, Xinyi Yang, Garvit Banga, Raghav Mantri</p>
<p>Abstract: The Needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) test is a general task used to assess language models' (LMs') abilities to recall particular information from long input context. This framework however does not provide a means of analyzing what factors, beyond context length, contribute to LMs' abilities or inabilities to separate and recall needles from their haystacks. To provide a systematic means of assessing what features contribute to LMs' NIAH capabilities, we developed a synthetic benchmark called DENIAHL (Data-oriented Evaluation of NIAH for LLM's). Our work expands on previous NIAH studies by ablating NIAH features beyond typical context length including data type, size, and patterns. We find stark differences between GPT-3.5 and LLaMA 2-7B's performance on DENIAHL, and drops in recall performance when features like item size are increased, and to some degree when data type is changed from numbers to letters. This has implications for increasingly large context models, demonstrating factors beyond item-number impact NIAH capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Zhang, Zaiqiao Meng, Jake Lever, Edmond S. L. Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) is a challenging task, as it requires a thorough understanding of medical images, integration of multiple temporal inputs, and accurate report generation. Effective interpretation of medical images, such as chest X-rays (CXRs), demands sophisticated visual-language reasoning to map visual findings to structured reports. Recent studies have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can acquire multimodal capabilities by aligning with pre-trained vision encoders. However, current approaches predominantly focus on single-image analysis or utilise rule-based symbolic processing to handle multiple images, thereby overlooking the essential temporal information derived from comparing current images with prior ones. To overcome this critical limitation, we introduce Libra, a temporal-aware MLLM tailored for CXR report generation using temporal images. Libra integrates a radiology-specific image encoder with a MLLM and utilises a novel Temporal Alignment Connector to capture and synthesise temporal information of images across different time points with unprecedented precision. Extensive experiments show that Libra achieves new state-of-the-art performance among the same parameter scale MLLMs for RRG tasks on the MIMIC-CXR. Specifically, Libra improves the RadCliQ metric by 12.9% and makes substantial gains across all lexical metrics compared to previous models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Pan, Zhuang Wang, Zhen Jia, Can Karakus, Luca Zancato, Tri Dao, Ravi Netravali, Yida Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention layers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have gained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model serving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of complementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip redundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place state updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for partial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits; the effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which yield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that supports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its novel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential cache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their reuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the compute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse workloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\times$ higher token hit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix caching systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingzhi Hu, Geoffrey Ye Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Future communication networks are expected to connect massive distributed artificial intelligence (AI). Exploiting aligned priori knowledge of AI pairs, it is promising to convert high-dimensional data transmission into highly-compressed semantic communications (SC). However, to accommodate the local data distribution and user preferences, AIs generally adapt to different domains, which fundamentally distorts the SC alignment. In this paper, we propose a zero-forget domain adaptation (ZFDA) framework to preserve SC alignment. To prevent the DA from changing substantial neural parameters of AI, we design sparse additive modifications (SAM) to the parameters, which can be efficiently stored and switched-off to restore the SC alignment. To optimize the SAM, we decouple it into tractable continuous variables and a binary mask, and then handle the binary mask by a score-based optimization. Experimental evaluations on a SC system for image transmissions validate that the proposed framework perfectly preserves the SC alignment with almost no loss of DA performance, even improved in some cases, at a cost of less than 1% of additional memory.</p>

<p>Abstract: Batch planning is increasingly crucial for the scalability of robotics tasks and dataset generation diversity. This paper presents Global Tensor Motion Planning (GTMP) -- a sampling-based motion planning algorithm comprising only tensor operations. We introduce a novel discretization structure represented as a random multipartite graph, enabling efficient vectorized sampling, collision checking, and search. We provide an early theoretical investigation showing that GTMP exhibits probabilistic completeness while supporting modern GPU/TPU. Additionally, by incorporating smooth structures into the multipartite graph, GTMP directly plans smooth splines without requiring gradient-based optimization. Experiments on lidar-scanned occupancy maps and the MotionBenchMarker dataset demonstrate GTMP's computation efficiency in batch planning compared to baselines, underscoring GTMP's potential as a robust, scalable planner for diverse applications and large-scale robot learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ritam Majumdar, Jack Teversham, Sonali Parbhoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating off-policy decisions using batch data poses significant challenges due to limited sample sizes leading to high variance. To improve Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE), we must identify and address the sources of this variance. Recent research on Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) shows that using human-explainable concepts can improve predictions and provide better understanding. We propose incorporating concepts into OPE to reduce variance. Our work introduces a family of concept-based OPE estimators, proving that they remain unbiased and reduce variance when concepts are known and predefined. Since real-world applications often lack predefined concepts, we further develop an end-to-end algorithm to learn interpretable, concise, and diverse parameterized concepts optimized for variance reduction. Our experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets show that both known and learned concept-based estimators significantly improve OPE performance. Crucially, we show that, unlike other OPE methods, concept-based estimators are easily interpretable and allow for targeted interventions on specific concepts, further enhancing the quality of these estimators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xixi Hu, Keyang Xu, Bo Liu, Qiang Liu, Hongliang Fei</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving precise alignment between textual instructions and generated images in text-to-image generation is a significant challenge, particularly in rendering written text within images. Sate-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3), Flux, and AuraFlow still struggle with accurate text depiction, resulting in misspelled or inconsistent text. We introduce a training-free method with minimal computational overhead that significantly enhances text rendering quality. Specifically, we introduce an overshooting sampler for pretrained rectified flow (RF) models, by alternating between over-simulating the learned ordinary differential equation (ODE) and reintroducing noise. Compared to the Euler sampler, the overshooting sampler effectively introduces an extra Langevin dynamics term that can help correct the compounding error from successive Euler steps and therefore improve the text rendering. However, when the overshooting strength is high, we observe over-smoothing artifacts on the generated images. To address this issue, we propose an Attention Modulated Overshooting sampler (AMO), which adaptively controls the strength of overshooting for each image patch according to their attention score with the text content. AMO demonstrates a 32.3% and 35.9% improvement in text rendering accuracy on SD3 and Flux without compromising overall image quality or increasing inference cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: Having explored an environment, intelligent agents should be able to transfer their knowledge to most downstream tasks within that environment. Referred to as "zero-shot learning," this ability remains elusive for general-purpose reinforcement learning algorithms. While recent works have attempted to produce zero-shot RL agents, they make assumptions about the nature of the tasks or the structure of the MDP. We present \emph{Proto Successor Measure}: the basis set for all possible solutions of Reinforcement Learning in a dynamical system. We provably show that any possible policy can be represented using an affine combination of these policy independent basis functions. Given a reward function at test time, we simply need to find the right set of linear weights to combine these basis corresponding to the optimal policy. We derive a practical algorithm to learn these basis functions using only interaction data from the environment and show that our approach can produce the optimal policy at test time for any given reward function without additional environmental interactions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divya Anand Sinha, Yezi Liu, Ruijie Du, Yanning Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph federated learning is of essential importance for training over large graph datasets while protecting data privacy, where each client stores a subset of local graph data, while the server collects the local gradients and broadcasts only the aggregated gradients. Recent studies reveal that a malicious attacker can steal private image data from gradient exchanging of neural networks during federated learning. However, none of the existing works have studied the vulnerability of graph data and graph neural networks under such attack. To answer this question, the present paper studies the problem of whether private data can be recovered from leaked gradients in both node classification and graph classification tasks and { proposes a novel attack named Graph Leakage from Gradients (GLG)}. Two widely-used GNN frameworks are analyzed, namely GCN and GraphSAGE. The effects of different model settings on recovery are extensively discussed. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation, it is shown that parts of the graph data can be leaked from the gradients.</p>

<p>Abstract: In medical image analysis, achieving fast, efficient, and accurate segmentation is essential for automated diagnosis and treatment. Although recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved segmentation accuracy, current models often face challenges in adaptability and generalization, particularly when processing multi-modal medical imaging data. These limitations stem from the substantial variations between imaging modalities and the inherent complexity of medical data. To address these challenges, we propose the Strategy-driven Interactive Segmentation Model (SISeg), built on SAM2, which enhances segmentation performance across various medical imaging modalities by integrating a selection engine. To mitigate memory bottlenecks and optimize prompt frame selection during the inference of 2D image sequences, we developed an automated system, the Adaptive Frame Selection Engine (AFSE). This system dynamically selects the optimal prompt frames without requiring extensive prior medical knowledge and enhances the interpretability of the model's inference process through an interactive feedback mechanism. We conducted extensive experiments on 10 datasets covering 7 representative medical imaging modalities, demonstrating the SISeg model's robust adaptability and generalization in multi-modal tasks. The project page and code will be available at: [URL].</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual abstract reasoning tasks present challenges for deep neural networks, exposing limitations in their capabilities. In this work, we present a neural network model that addresses the challenges posed by Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). Inspired by the two-stream hypothesis of visual processing, we introduce the Dual-stream Reasoning Network (DRNet), which utilizes two parallel branches to capture image features. On top of the two streams, a reasoning module first learns to merge the high-level features of the same image. Then, it employs a rule extractor to handle combinations involving the eight context images and each candidate image, extracting discrete abstract rules and utilizing an multilayer perceptron (MLP) to make predictions. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed DRNet achieves state-of-the-art average performance across multiple RPM benchmarks. Furthermore, DRNet demonstrates robust generalization capabilities, even extending to various out-of-distribution scenarios. The dual streams within DRNet serve distinct functions by addressing local or spatial information. They are then integrated into the reasoning module, leveraging abstract rules to facilitate the execution of visual reasoning tasks. These findings indicate that the dual-stream architecture could play a crucial role in visual abstract reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujin Han, Lei Xu, Sirui Chen, Difan Zou, Chaochao Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capability in natural language tasks, yet debate persists on whether they truly comprehend deep structure (i.e., core semantics) or merely rely on surface structure (e.g., presentation format). Prior studies observe that LLMs' performance declines when intervening on surface structure, arguing their success relies on surface structure recognition. However, surface structure sensitivity does not prevent deep structure comprehension. Rigorously evaluating LLMs' capability requires analyzing both, yet deep structure is often overlooked. To this end, we assess LLMs' comprehension ability using causal mediation analysis, aiming to fully discover the capability of using both deep and surface structures. Specifically, we formulate the comprehension of deep structure as direct causal effect (DCE) and that of surface structure as indirect causal effect (ICE), respectively. To address the non-estimability of original DCE and ICE -- stemming from the infeasibility of isolating mutual influences of deep and surface structures, we develop the corresponding quantifiable surrogates, including approximated DCE (ADCE) and approximated ICE (AICE). We further apply the ADCE to evaluate a series of mainstream LLMs, showing that most of them exhibit deep structure comprehension ability, which grows along with the prediction accuracy. Comparing ADCE and AICE demonstrates closed-source LLMs rely more on deep structure, while open-source LLMs are more surface-sensitive, which decreases with model scale. Theoretically, ADCE is a bidirectional evaluation, which measures both the sufficiency and necessity of deep structure changes in causing output variations, thus offering a more comprehensive assessment than accuracy, a common evaluation in LLMs. Our work provides new insights into LLMs' deep structure comprehension and offers novel methods for LLMs evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the growing scale and complexity of video data, efficiently processing long video sequences poses significant challenges due to the quadratic increase in memory and computational demands associated with existing transformer-based Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs). To address these issues, we introduce Video-Ma$^2$mba, a novel architecture that incorporates State Space Models (SSMs) within the Mamba-2 framework, replacing the attention mechanisms. This allows the LMMs to scale linearly in terms of time and memory requirements, making it feasible to handle long-duration video content. Furthermore, we enhance the memory efficiency introducing the Multi-Axis Gradient Checkpointing (MA-GC) method, which strategically manages memory by retaining only essential activations across multiple computational axes. Our approach significantly reduces the memory footprint compared to standard gradient checkpointing. Empirical analyses show that Video-Ma$^2$mba can process extensive video sequences-equivalent to millions of tokens or over two hours of continuous sequences at 1 FPS-on a single GPU. By maintaining a detailed capture of temporal dynamics, our model improves the accuracy and relevance of responses in long video understanding tasks, demonstrating substantial advantages over existing frameworks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a pivotal technique for enhancing the capability of large language models (LLMs) and has demonstrated promising efficacy across a diverse spectrum of tasks. While LLM-driven RAG systems show superior performance, they face unique challenges in stability and reliability. Their complexity hinders developers' efforts to design, maintain, and optimize effective RAG systems. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how RAG's performance is impacted by its design. In this work, we conduct an early exploratory study toward a better understanding of the mechanism of RAG systems, covering three code datasets, three QA datasets, and two LLMs. We focus on four design factors: retrieval document type, retrieval recall, document selection, and prompt techniques. Our study uncovers how each factor impacts system correctness and confidence, providing valuable insights for developing an accurate and reliable RAG system. Based on these findings, we present nine actionable guidelines for detecting defects and optimizing the performance of RAG systems. We hope our early exploration can inspire further advancements in engineering, improving and maintaining LLM-driven intelligent software systems for greater efficiency and reliability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Galaxy morphology analysis involves classifying galaxies by their shapes and structures. For this task, directly training domain-specific models on large, annotated astronomical datasets is effective but costly. In contrast, fine-tuning vision foundation models on a smaller set of astronomical images is more resource-efficient but generally results in lower accuracy. To harness the benefits of both approaches and address their shortcomings, we propose GalaxAlign, a novel method that fine-tunes pre-trained foundation models to achieve high accuracy on astronomical tasks. Specifically, our method extends a contrastive learning architecture to align three types of data in fine-tuning: (1) a set of schematic symbols representing galaxy shapes and structures, (2) textual labels of these symbols, and (3) galaxy images. This way, GalaxAlign not only eliminates the need for expensive pretraining but also enhances the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on galaxy classification and similarity search demonstrate that our method effectively fine-tunes general pre-trained models for astronomical tasks by incorporating domain-specific multi-modal knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a general two-stage algorithm that enjoys a provable scaling law for the test-time compute of large language models (LLMs). Given an input problem, the proposed algorithm first generates $N$ candidate solutions, and then chooses the best one via a multiple-round knockout tournament where each pair of candidates are compared for $K$ times and only the winners move on to the next round. In a minimalistic implementation, both stages can be executed with a black-box LLM alone and nothing else (e.g., no external verifier or reward model), and a total of $N \times (K + 1)$ highly parallelizable LLM calls are needed for solving an input problem. Assuming that a generated candidate solution is correct with probability $p_{\text{gen}} > 0$ and a comparison between a pair of correct and incorrect solutions identifies the right winner with probability $p_{\text{comp}} > 0.5$ (i.e., better than a random guess), we prove theoretically that the failure probability of the proposed algorithm decays to zero exponentially with respect to $N$ and $K$: $$\mathbb{P}(\text{final output is incorrect}) \le (1 - p_{\text{gen}})^N + \lceil \log_2 N \rceil e^{-2 K (p_{\text{comp}} - 0.5)^2}.$$ Our empirical results with the challenging MMLU-Pro benchmark validate the technical assumptions, as well as the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and the gains from scaling up its test-time compute.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linshan Hou, Wei Luo, Zhongyun Hua, Songhua Chen, Leo Yu Zhang, Yiming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison datasets with adversary-specified triggers to implant hidden backdoors, enabling malicious manipulation of model predictions. Dataset purification serves as a proactive defense by removing malicious training samples to prevent backdoor injection at its source. We first reveal that the current advanced purification methods rely on a latent assumption that the backdoor connections between triggers and target labels in backdoor attacks are simpler to learn than the benign features. We demonstrate that this assumption, however, does not always hold, especially in all-to-all (A2A) and untargeted (UT) attacks. As a result, purification methods that analyze the separation between the poisoned and benign samples in the input-output space or the final hidden layer space are less effective. We observe that this separability is not confined to a single layer but varies across different hidden layers. Motivated by this understanding, we propose FLARE, a universal purification method to counter various backdoor attacks. FLARE aggregates abnormal activations from all hidden layers to construct representations for clustering. To enhance separation, FLARE develops an adaptive subspace selection algorithm to isolate the optimal space for dividing an entire dataset into two clusters. FLARE assesses the stability of each cluster and identifies the cluster with higher stability as poisoned. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FLARE against 22 representative backdoor attacks, including all-to-one (A2O), all-to-all (A2A), and untargeted (UT) attacks, and its robustness to adaptive attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akiharu Esashi, Pawissanutt Lertpongrujikorn, Mohsen Amini Salehi</p>
<p>Abstract: Function as a Service (FaaS) is poised to become the foundation of the next generation of cloud systems due to its inherent advantages in scalability, cost-efficiency, and ease of use. However, challenges such as the need for specialized knowledge and difficulties in building function workflows persist for cloud-native application developers. To overcome these challenges and mitigate the burden of developing FaaS-based applications, in this paper, we propose a mechanism called Action Engine, that makes use of Tool-Augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) at its kernel to interpret human language queries and automates FaaS workflow generation, thereby, reducing the need for specialized expertise and manual design. Action Engine includes modules to identify relevant functions from the FaaS repository and seamlessly manage the data dependency between them, ensuring that the developer's query is processed and resolved. Beyond that, Action Engine can execute the generated workflow by feeding the user-provided parameters. Our evaluations show that Action Engine can generate workflows with up to 20\% higher correctness without developer involvement. We notice that Action Engine can unlock FaaS workflow generation for non-cloud-savvy developers and expedite the development cycles of cloud-native applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Gao, Yongqi Li, Ziqiang Cao, Wenjie Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting elicits large language models (LLMs) to produce a series of intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at the final answer. However, when transitioning to vision-language models (VLMs), their text-only rationales struggle to express the fine-grained associations with the original image. In this paper, we propose an image-incorporated multimodal Chain-of-Thought, named \textbf{Interleaved-modal Chain-of-Thought (ICoT)}, which generates sequential reasoning steps consisting of paired visual and textual rationales to infer the final answer. Intuitively, the novel ICoT requires VLMs to enable the generation of fine-grained interleaved-modal content, which is hard for current VLMs to fulfill. Considering that the required visual information is usually part of the input image, we propose \textbf{Attention-driven Selection (ADS)} to realize ICoT over existing VLMs. ADS intelligently inserts regions of the input image to generate the interleaved-modal reasoning steps with ignorable additional latency. ADS relies solely on the attention map of VLMs without the need for parameterization, and therefore it is a plug-and-play strategy that can be generalized to a spectrum of VLMs. We apply ADS to realize ICoT on two popular VLMs of different architectures. Extensive evaluations of three benchmarks have shown that ICoT prompting achieves substantial performance (up to 14\%) and interpretability improvements compared to existing multimodal CoT prompting methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lubin Meng, Xue Jiang, Tianwang Jia, Dongrui Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: A brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct communication between the brain and an external device. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the preferred input signal in non-invasive BCIs, due to its convenience and low cost. EEG-based BCIs have been successfully used in many applications, such as neurological rehabilitation, text input, games, and so on. However, EEG signals inherently carry rich personal information, necessitating privacy protection. This paper demonstrates that multiple types of private information (user identity, gender, and BCI-experience) can be easily inferred from EEG data, imposing a serious privacy threat to BCIs. To address this issue, we design perturbations to convert the original EEG data into privacy-protected EEG data, which conceal the private information while maintaining the primary BCI task performance. Experimental results demonstrated that the privacy-protected EEG data can significantly reduce the classification accuracy of user identity, gender and BCI-experience, but almost do not affect at all the classification accuracy of the primary BCI task, enabling user privacy protection in EEG-based BCIs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Joshi, Areeb Ahmad, Ashutosh Modi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown state-of-the-art performance in a variety of tasks, including arithmetic and reasoning; however, to gauge the intellectual capabilities of LLMs, causal reasoning has become a reliable proxy for validating a general understanding of the mechanics and intricacies of the world similar to humans. Previous works in natural language processing (NLP) have either focused on open-ended causal reasoning via causal commonsense reasoning (CCR) or framed a symbolic representation-based question answering for theoretically backed-up analysis via a causal inference engine. The former adds an advantage of real-world grounding but lacks theoretically backed-up analysis/validation, whereas the latter is far from real-world grounding. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing the COLD (Causal reasOning in cLosed Daily activities) framework, which is built upon human understanding of daily real-world activities to reason about the causal nature of events. We show that the proposed framework facilitates the creation of enormous causal queries (~ 9 million) and comes close to the mini-turing test, simulating causal reasoning to evaluate the understanding of a daily real-world task. We evaluate multiple LLMs on the created causal queries and find that causal reasoning is challenging even for activities trivial to humans. We further explore (the causal reasoning abilities of LLMs) using the backdoor criterion to determine the causal strength between events.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruimin Peng, Jiayu An, Dongrui Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based seizure subtype classification enhances clinical diagnosis efficiency. Source-free semi-supervised domain adaptation (SF-SSDA), which transfers a pre-trained model to a new dataset with no source data and limited labeled target data, can be used for privacy-preserving seizure subtype classification. This paper considers two challenges in SF-SSDA for EEG-based seizure subtype classification: 1) How to effectively fuse both raw EEG data and expert knowledge in classifier design? 2) How to align the source and target domain distributions for SF-SSDA? We propose a Knowledge-Data Fusion based SF-SSDA approach, KDF-MutualSHOT, for EEG-based seizure subtype classification. In source model training, KDF uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to facilitate mutual learning between a feature-driven Decision Tree-based model and a data-driven Transformer-based model. To adapt KDF to a new target dataset, an SF-SSDA algorithm, MutualSHOT, is developed, which features a consistency-based pseudo-label selection strategy. Experiments on the public TUSZ and CHSZ datasets demonstrated that KDF-MutualSHOT outperformed other supervised and source-free domain adaptation approaches in cross-subject seizure subtype classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tae-Hoon Lee, Min-Soo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is an optimization technique widely used in various fields. Primal heuristics, which reduce the search space of MILP, have enabled traditional solvers (e.g., Gurobi) to efficiently find high-quality solutions. However, traditional primal heuristics rely on expert knowledge, motivating the advent of machine learning (ML)-based primal heuristics that learn repetitive patterns in MILP. Nonetheless, existing ML-based primal heuristics do not guarantee solution feasibility (i.e., satisfying all constraints) and primarily focus on prediction for binary decision variables. When addressing MILP involving non-binary integer variables using ML-based approaches, feasibility issues can become even more pronounced. Since finding an optimal solution requires satisfying all constraints, addressing feasibility is critical. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based solver that interacts with MILP to find feasible solutions, rather than delegating sub-problems to traditional solvers. We design reward functions tailored for MILP, which enables the RL agent to learn relationships between decision variables and constraints. Additionally, to effectively model complex relationships among decision variables, we leverage a Transformer encoder-based graph neural network (GNN). Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can solve MILP problems and find near-optimal solutions without delegating the remainder to traditional solvers. The proposed method provides a meaningful step forward as an initial study in solving MILP problems end-to-end based solely on ML.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the Density-Calibrated Conformal Quantile Regression (CQR-d) method, a novel approach for constructing prediction intervals that adapts to varying uncertainty across the feature space. Building upon conformal quantile regression, CQR-d incorporates local information through a weighted combination of local and global conformity scores, where the weights are determined by local data density. We prove that CQR-d provides valid marginal coverage at level $1 - \alpha - \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ represents a small tolerance from numerical optimization. Through extensive simulation studies and an application to the a heteroscedastic dataset available in R, we demonstrate that CQR-d maintains the desired coverage while producing substantially narrower prediction intervals compared to standard conformal quantile regression (CQR). Notably, in our application on heteroscedastic data, CQR-d achieves an $8.6\%$ reduction in average interval width while maintaining comparable coverage. The method's effectiveness is particularly pronounced in settings with clear local uncertainty patterns, making it a valuable tool for prediction tasks in heterogeneous data environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungbin Cho, Junwan Kim, Jisoo Kim, Minseo Kim, Mingu Kang, Sungeun Hong, Tae-Hyun Oh, Youngjae Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Human motion, inherently continuous and dynamic, presents significant challenges for generative models. Despite their dominance, discrete quantization methods, such as VQ-VAEs, suffer from inherent limitations, including restricted expressiveness and frame-wise noise artifacts. Continuous approaches, while producing smoother and more natural motions, often falter due to high-dimensional complexity and limited training data. To resolve this "discord" between discrete and continuous representations, we introduce DisCoRD: Discrete Tokens to Continuous Motion via Rectified Flow Decoding, a novel method that decodes discrete motion tokens into continuous motion through rectified flow. By employing an iterative refinement process in the continuous space, DisCoRD captures fine-grained dynamics and ensures smoother and more natural motions. Compatible with any discrete-based framework, our method enhances naturalness without compromising faithfulness to the conditioning signals. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that DisCoRD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with FID of 0.032 on HumanML3D and 0.169 on KIT-ML. These results solidify DisCoRD as a robust solution for bridging the divide between discrete efficiency and continuous realism.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianfeng Tan, Yuhan Li, Wenxiang Shang, Yubo Wu, Jian Wang, Xuanhong Chen, Yi Zhang, Ran Lin, Bingbing Ni</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard clothing asset generation involves creating forward-facing flat-lay garment images displayed on a clear background by extracting clothing information from diverse real-world contexts, which presents significant challenges due to highly standardized sampling distributions and precise structural requirements in the generated images. Existing models have limited spatial perception and often exhibit structural hallucinations in this high-specification generative task. To address this issue, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, termed RAGDiffusion, to enhance structure determinacy and mitigate hallucinations by assimilating external knowledge from LLM and databases. RAGDiffusion consists of two core processes: (1) Retrieval-based structure aggregation, which employs contrastive learning and a Structure Locally Linear Embedding (SLLE) to derive global structure and spatial landmarks, providing both soft and hard guidance to counteract structural ambiguities; and (2) Omni-level faithful garment generation, which introduces a three-level alignment that ensures fidelity in structural, pattern, and decoding components within the diffusing. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGDiffusion synthesizes structurally and detail-faithful clothing assets with significant performance improvements, representing a pioneering effort in high-specification faithful generation with RAG to confront intrinsic hallucinations and enhance fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yule Liu, Zhen Sun, Xinlei He, Xinyi Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in fine-tuning proprietary language models enable customized applications across various domains but also introduce two major challenges: high resource demands and security risks. Regarding resource demands, recent work proposes novel partial compression, such as BitDelta, to quantize the delta weights between the fine-tuned model and base model. Regarding the security risks, user-defined fine-tuning can introduce security vulnerabilities, such as alignment issues, backdoor attacks, and hallucinations. However, most of the current efforts in security assessment focus on the full-precision or full-compression models, it is not well-discussed how the partial compression methods affect security concerns. To bridge this gap, we evaluate the robustness of delta-weight quantization against these security threats. In this paper, we uncover a "free lunch" phenomenon: partial compression can enhance model security against fine-tuning-based attacks with bearable utility loss. Using Llama-2-7b-chat as a case study, we show that, with under 10% utility degradation, the partial compression mitigates alignment-breaking risks by up to 66.17%, harmful backdoor vulnerabilities by 64.46%, and targeted output manipulation risks by up to 90.53%. We further apply LogitLens to visualize internal state transformations during forward passes, suggesting mechanisms for both security failure and recovery in standard versus compressed fine-tuning. This work offers new insights into selecting effective delta compression methods for secure, resource-efficient multi-tenant services.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the recent advancements in generative modeling, the realism of deepfake content has been increasing at a steady pace, even reaching the point where people often fail to detect manipulated media content online, thus being deceived into various kinds of scams. In this paper, we survey deepfake generation and detection techniques, including the most recent developments in the field, such as diffusion models and Neural Radiance Fields. Our literature review covers all deepfake media types, comprising image, video, audio and multimodal (audio-visual) content. We identify various kinds of deepfakes, according to the procedure used to alter or generate the fake content. We further construct a taxonomy of deepfake generation and detection methods, illustrating the important groups of methods and the domains where these methods are applied. Next, we gather datasets used for deepfake detection and provide updated rankings of the best performing deepfake detectors on the most popular datasets. In addition, we develop a novel multimodal benchmark to evaluate deepfake detectors on out-of-distribution content. The results indicate that state-of-the-art detectors fail to generalize to deepfake content generated by unseen deepfake generators. Finally, we propose future directions to obtain robust and powerful deepfake detectors. Our project page and new benchmark are available at https://github.com/CroitoruAlin/biodeep.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel state-space model (SSM)-based framework for skeleton-based human action recognition, with an anatomically-guided architecture that improves state-of-the-art performance in both clinical diagnostics and general action recognition tasks. Our approach decomposes skeletal motion analysis into spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal streams, using channel partitioning to capture distinct movement characteristics efficiently. By implementing a structured, multi-directional scanning strategy within SSMs, our model captures local joint interactions and global motion patterns across multiple anatomical body parts. This anatomically-aware decomposition enhances the ability to identify subtle motion patterns critical in medical diagnosis, such as gait anomalies associated with neurological conditions. On public action recognition benchmarks, i.e., NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA, our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy improvements up to $3.2\%$ with lower computational complexity than previous leading transformer-based models. We also introduce a novel medical dataset for motion-based patient neurological disorder analysis to validate our method's potential in automated disease diagnosis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising basis for creating agents that can tackle complex tasks through iterative environmental interaction. Existing methods either require these agents to mimic expert-provided trajectories or rely on definitive environmental feedback for reinforcement learning which limits their application to specific scenarios like gaming or code generation. This paper introduces a novel training method for LLM-based agents using weakly supervised signals from a critic LLM, bypassing the need for expert trajectories or definitive feedback. Our agents are trained in iterative manner, where they initially generate trajectories through environmental interaction. Subsequently, a critic LLM selects a subset of good trajectories, which are then used to update the agents, enabling them to generate improved trajectories in the next iteration. Extensive tests on the API-bank dataset show consistent improvement in our agents' capabilities and comparable performance to GPT-4, despite using open-source models with much fewer parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Closed-loop simulation is crucial for end-to-end autonomous driving. Existing sensor simulation methods (e.g., NeRF and 3DGS) reconstruct driving scenes based on conditions that closely mirror training data distributions. However, these methods struggle with rendering novel trajectories, such as lane changes. Recent works have demonstrated that integrating world model knowledge alleviates these issues. Despite their efficiency, these approaches still encounter difficulties in the accurate representation of more complex maneuvers, with multi-lane shifts being a notable example. Therefore, we introduce ReconDreamer, which enhances driving scene reconstruction through incremental integration of world model knowledge. Specifically, DriveRestorer is proposed to mitigate artifacts via online restoration. This is complemented by a progressive data update strategy designed to ensure high-quality rendering for more complex maneuvers. To the best of our knowledge, ReconDreamer is the first method to effectively render in large maneuvers. Experimental results demonstrate that ReconDreamer outperforms Street Gaussians in the NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, with relative improvements by 24.87%, 6.72%, and 29.97%. Furthermore, ReconDreamer surpasses DriveDreamer4D with PVG during large maneuver rendering, as verified by a relative improvement of 195.87% in the NTA-IoU metric and a comprehensive user study.</p>

<p>Abstract: Natural language processing skills of Large Language Models (LLMs) are unprecedented, having wide diffusion and application in different tasks. This pilot study focuses on specializing ChatGPT behavior through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the OpenAI custom GPTs feature. The purpose of our chatbot, called Unimib Assistant, is to provide information and solutions to the specific needs of University of Milano-Bicocca (Unimib) students through a question-answering approach. We provided the system with a prompt highlighting its specific purpose and behavior, as well as university-related documents and links obtained from an initial need-finding phase, interviewing six students. After a preliminary customization phase, a qualitative usability test was conducted with six other students to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the chatbot, with the goal of improving it in a subsequent redesign phase. While the chatbot was appreciated for its user-friendly experience, perceived general reliability, well-structured responses, and conversational tone, several significant technical and functional limitations emerged. In particular, the satisfaction and overall experience of the users was impaired by the system's inability to always provide fully accurate information. Moreover, it would often neglect to report relevant information even if present in the materials uploaded and prompt given. Furthermore, it sometimes generated unclickable links, undermining its trustworthiness, since providing the source of information was an important aspect for our users. Further in-depth studies and feedback from other users as well as implementation iterations are planned to refine our Unimib Assistant.</p>

<p>Abstract: Low-rank adapters have become a standard approach for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), but they often fall short of achieving the performance of full fine-tuning. We propose a method, LoRA Silver Bullet or LoRA-SB, that approximates full fine-tuning within low-rank subspaces using a carefully designed initialization strategy. We theoretically demonstrate that the architecture of LoRA-XS, which inserts a trainable (r x r) matrix between B and A while keeping other matrices fixed, provides the precise conditions needed for this approximation. We leverage its constrained update space to achieve optimal scaling for high-rank gradient updates while removing the need for hyperparameter tuning. We prove that our initialization offers an optimal low-rank approximation of the initial gradient and preserves update directions throughout training. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and language understanding tasks demonstrate that our approach exceeds the performance of standard LoRA while using 27-90x fewer parameters, and comprehensively outperforms LoRA-XS. Our findings establish that it is possible to simulate full fine-tuning in low-rank subspaces, and achieve significant efficiency gains without sacrificing performance.

<p>Abstract: The Rubiks Cube, with its vast state space and sparse reward structure, presents a significant challenge for reinforcement learning (RL) due to the difficulty of reaching rewarded states. Previous research addressed this by propagating cost-to-go estimates from the solved state and incorporating search techniques. These approaches differ from human strategies that start from fully scrambled cubes, which can be tricky for solving a general sparse-reward problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel RL algorithm using policy gradient methods to solve the Rubiks Cube without relying on near solved-state sampling. Our approach employs a neural network to predict cost patterns between states, allowing the agent to learn directly from scrambled states. Our method was tested on the 2x2x2 Rubiks Cube, where the cube was scrambled 50,000 times, and the model successfully solved it in over 99.4% of cases. Notably, this result was achieved using only the policy network without relying on tree search as in previous methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for broader applications in sparse-reward problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihang Zhou, Shenhao Fang, Shibo He, Wenchao Meng, Jiming Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Condensing large datasets into smaller synthetic counterparts has demonstrated its promise for image classification. However, previous research has overlooked a crucial concern in image recognition: ensuring that models trained on condensed datasets are unbiased towards protected attributes (PA), such as gender and race. Our investigation reveals that dataset distillation (DD) fails to alleviate the unfairness towards minority groups within original datasets. Moreover, this bias typically worsens in the condensed datasets due to their smaller size. To bridge the research gap, we propose a novel fair dataset distillation (FDD) framework, namely FairDD, which can be seamlessly applied to diverse matching-based DD approaches, requiring no modifications to their original architectures. The key innovation of FairDD lies in synchronously matching synthetic datasets to PA-wise groups of original datasets, rather than indiscriminate alignment to the whole distributions in vanilla DDs, dominated by majority groups. This synchronized matching allows synthetic datasets to avoid collapsing into majority groups and bootstrap their balanced generation to all PA groups. Consequently, FairDD could effectively regularize vanilla DDs to favor biased generation toward minority groups while maintaining the accuracy of target attributes. Theoretical analyses and extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that FairDD significantly improves fairness compared to vanilla DD methods, without sacrificing classification accuracy. Its consistent superiority across diverse DDs, spanning Distribution and Gradient Matching, establishes it as a versatile FDD approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yawen Shao, Wei Zhai, Yuhang Yang, Hongchen Luo, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-Vocabulary 3D object affordance grounding aims to anticipate ``action possibilities'' regions on 3D objects with arbitrary instructions, which is crucial for robots to generically perceive real scenarios and respond to operational changes. Existing methods focus on combining images or languages that depict interactions with 3D geometries to introduce external interaction priors. However, they are still vulnerable to a limited semantic space by failing to leverage implied invariant geometries and potential interaction intentions. Normally, humans address complex tasks through multi-step reasoning and respond to diverse situations by leveraging associative and analogical thinking. In light of this, we propose GREAT (GeometRy-intEntion collAboraTive inference) for Open-Vocabulary 3D Object Affordance Grounding, a novel framework that mines the object invariant geometry attributes and performs analogically reason in potential interaction scenarios to form affordance knowledge, fully combining the knowledge with both geometries and visual contents to ground 3D object affordance. Besides, we introduce the Point Image Affordance Dataset v2 (PIADv2), the largest 3D object affordance dataset at present to support the task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of GREAT. Code and dataset are available at project.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaowen Wang, Anan Liu, Jian Xiao, Huan Liu, Yuekui Yang, Cong Xu, Qianqian Pu, Suncong Zheng, Wei Zhang, Jian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern recommendation systems frequently employ online learning to dynamically update their models with freshly collected data. The most commonly used optimizer for updating neural networks in these contexts is the Adam optimizer, which integrates momentum ($m_t$) and adaptive learning rate ($v_t$). However, the volatile nature of online learning data, characterized by its frequent distribution shifts and presence of noises, poses significant challenges to Adam's standard optimization process: (1) Adam may use outdated momentum and the average of squared gradients, resulting in slower adaptation to distribution changes, and (2) Adam's performance is adversely affected by data noise. To mitigate these issues, we introduce CAdam, a confidence-based optimization strategy that assesses the consistence between the momentum and the gradient for each parameter dimension before deciding on updates. If momentum and gradient are in sync, CAdam proceeds with parameter updates according to Adam's original formulation; if not, it temporarily withholds updates and monitors potential shifts in data distribution in subsequent iterations. This method allows CAdam to distinguish between the true distributional shifts and mere noise, and adapt more quickly to new data distributions. Our experiments with both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CAdam surpasses other well-known optimizers, including the original Adam, in efficiency and noise robustness. Furthermore, in large-scale A/B testing within a live recommendation system, CAdam significantly enhances model performance compared to Adam, leading to substantial increases in the system's gross merchandise volume (GMV).</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of large Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models has significantly improved robotic manipulation in terms of language-guided task execution and generalization to unseen scenarios. While existing VLAs adapted from pretrained large Vision-Language-Models (VLM) have demonstrated promising generalizability, their task performance is still unsatisfactory as indicated by the low tasks success rates in different environments. In this paper, we present a new advanced VLA architecture derived from VLM. Unlike previous works that directly repurpose VLM for action prediction by simple action quantization, we propose a omponentized VLA architecture that has a specialized action module conditioned on VLM output. We systematically study the design of the action module and demonstrates the strong performance enhancement with diffusion action transformers for action sequence modeling, as well as their favorable scaling behaviors. We also conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation studies to evaluate the efficacy of our models with varied designs. The evaluation on 5 robot embodiments in simulation and real work shows that our model not only significantly surpasses existing VLAs in task performance and but also exhibits remarkable adaptation to new robots and generalization to unseen objects and backgrounds. It exceeds the average success rates of OpenVLA which has similar model size (7B) with ours by over 35% in simulated evaluation and 55% in real robot experiments. It also outperforms the large RT-2-X model (55B) by 18% absolute success rates in simulation. Code and models can be found on our project page (https://cogact.github.io/).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyi Mo, Tianyu Zhang, Yalong Bai, Bing Su, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-guided image generation and editing using diffusion models have achieved remarkable advancements. Among these, tuning-free methods have gained attention for their ability to perform edits without extensive model adjustments, offering simplicity and efficiency. However, existing tuning-free approaches often struggle with balancing fidelity and editing precision. Reconstruction errors in DDIM Inversion are partly attributed to the cross-attention mechanism in U-Net, which introduces misalignments during the inversion and reconstruction process. To address this, we analyze reconstruction from a structural perspective and propose a novel approach that replaces traditional cross-attention with uniform attention maps, significantly enhancing image reconstruction fidelity. Our method effectively minimizes distortions caused by varying text conditions during noise prediction. To complement this improvement, we introduce an adaptive mask-guided editing technique that integrates seamlessly with our reconstruction approach, ensuring consistency and accuracy in editing tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only excels in achieving high-fidelity image reconstruction but also performs robustly in real image composition and editing scenarios. This study underscores the potential of uniform attention maps to enhance the fidelity and versatility of diffusion-based image processing methods.

<p>Abstract: The field of computational pathology has been transformed with recent advances in foundation models that encode histopathology region-of-interests (ROIs) into versatile and transferable feature representations via self-supervised learning (SSL). However, translating these advancements to address complex clinical challenges at the patient and slide level remains constrained by limited clinical data in disease-specific cohorts, especially for rare clinical conditions. We propose TITAN, a multimodal whole slide foundation model pretrained using 335,645 WSIs via visual self-supervised learning and vision-language alignment with corresponding pathology reports and 423,122 synthetic captions generated from a multimodal generative AI copilot for pathology. Without any finetuning or requiring clinical labels, TITAN can extract general-purpose slide representations and generate pathology reports that generalize to resource-limited clinical scenarios such as rare disease retrieval and cancer prognosis. We evaluate TITAN on diverse clinical tasks and find that TITAN outperforms both ROI and slide foundation models across machine learning settings such as linear probing, few-shot and zero-shot classification, rare cancer retrieval and cross-modal retrieval, and pathology report generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanyue Zhang, Ziyong Li, Wen Yang, Chunlin Leng, Yinan Bai, Qianlong Du, Chengqing Zong, Jiajun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: During the development of large language models (LLMs), pre-training data play a critical role in shaping LLMs' capabilities. In recent years several large-scale and high-quality pre-training datasets have been released to accelerate the research of LLMs, including ChineseWebText1.0, C4, Pile, WanJuan, MAPCC and others. However, as LLMs continue to evolve, focus has increasingly shifted to domain-specific capabilities and safety concerns, making those previous coarse-grained texts insufficient for meeting training requirements. Furthermore, fine-grained information, such as quality, domain and toxicity, is becoming increasingly important in building powerful and reliable LLMs for various scenarios. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a new tool-chain called MDFG-tool for constructing large-scale and high-quality Chinese datasets with multi-dimensional and fine-grained information. First, we employ manually crafted rules to discard explicit noisy texts from raw contents. Second, the quality evaluation model, domain classifier, and toxicity evaluation model are well-designed to assess the remaining cleaned data respectively. Finally, we integrate these three types of fine-grained information for each text. With this approach, we release the largest, high-quality and fine-grained Chinese text ChineseWebText2.0, which consists of 3.8TB and each text is associated with a quality score, domain labels, a toxicity label and a toxicity score, facilitating the LLM researchers to select data based on various types of fine-grained information.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michal Lewandowski, Hamid Eghbalzadeh, Bernhard A. Moser</p>
<p>Abstract: Many natural phenomena are characterized by self-similarity, for example the symmetry of human faces, or a repetitive motif of a song. Studying of such symmetries will allow us to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of complex systems. Recognizing the importance of understanding these patterns, we propose a geometrically inspired framework to study such phenomena in artificial neural networks. To this end, we introduce \emph{CantorNet}, inspired by the triadic construction of the Cantor set, which was introduced by Georg Cantor in the $19^\text{th}$ century. In mathematics, the Cantor set is a set of points lying on a single line that is self-similar and has a counter intuitive property of being an uncountably infinite null set. Similarly, we introduce CantorNet as a sandbox for studying self-similarity by means of novel topological and geometrical complexity measures. CantorNet constitutes a family of ReLU neural networks that spans the whole spectrum of possible Kolmogorov complexities, including the two opposite descriptions (linear and exponential as measured by the description length). CantorNet's decision boundaries can be arbitrarily ragged, yet are analytically known. Besides serving as a testing ground for complexity measures, our work may serve to illustrate potential pitfalls in geometry-ignorant data augmentation techniques and adversarial attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gasser Elazab, Torben Gr\"aber, Michael Unterreiner, Olaf Hellwich</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) has gained popularity for obtaining depth predictions directly from videos. However, these methods often produce scale invariant results, unless additional training signals are provided. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a novel self-supervised metric-scaled MDE model that requires only monocular video data and the camera's mounting position, both of which are readily available in modern vehicles. Our approach leverages planar-parallax geometry to reconstruct scene structure. The full pipeline consists of three main networks, a multi-frame network, a singleframe network, and a pose network. The multi-frame network processes sequential frames to estimate the structure of the static scene using planar-parallax geometry and the camera mounting position. Based on this reconstruction, it acts as a teacher, distilling knowledge such as scale information, masked drivable area, metric-scale depth for the static scene, and dynamic object mask to the singleframe network. It also aids the pose network in predicting a metric-scaled relative pose between two subsequent images. Our method achieved state-of-the-art results for the driving benchmark KITTI for metric-scaled depth prediction. Notably, it is one of the first methods to produce self-supervised metric-scaled depth prediction for the challenging Cityscapes dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Tschannen, Andr\'e Susano Pinto, Alexander Kolesnikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Removing modeling constraints and unifying architectures across domains has been a key driver of the recent progress in training large multimodal models. However, most of these models still rely on many separately trained components such as modality-specific encoders and decoders. In this work, we further streamline joint generative modeling of images and text. We propose an autoregressive decoder-only transformer - JetFormer - which is trained to directly maximize the likelihood of raw data, without relying on any separately pretrained components, and can understand and generate both text and images. Specifically, we leverage a normalizing flow model to obtain a soft-token image representation that is jointly trained with an autoregressive multimodal transformer. The normalizing flow model serves as both an image encoder for perception tasks and an image decoder for image generation tasks during inference. JetFormer achieves text-to-image generation quality competitive with recent VQ-VAE- and VAE-based baselines. These baselines rely on pretrained image autoencoders, which are trained with a complex mixture of losses, including perceptual ones. At the same time, JetFormer demonstrates robust image understanding capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, JetFormer is the first model that is capable of generating high-fidelity images and producing strong log-likelihood bounds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Severin Bochem, Eduardo Gonzalez-Sanchez, Yves Bicker, Gabriele Fadini</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning often requires extensive training data. Simulation-to-real transfer offers a promising approach to address this challenge in robotics. While differentiable simulators offer improved sample efficiency through exact gradients, they can be unstable in contact-rich environments and may lead to poor generalization. This paper introduces a novel approach integrating sharpness-aware optimization into gradient-based reinforcement learning algorithms. Our simulation results demonstrate that our method, tested on contact-rich environments, significantly enhances policy robustness to environmental variations and action perturbations while maintaining the sample efficiency of first-order methods. Specifically, our approach improves action noise tolerance compared to standard first-order methods and achieves generalization comparable to zeroth-order methods. This improvement stems from finding flatter minima in the loss landscape, associated with better generalization. Our work offers a promising solution to balance efficient learning and robust sim-to-real transfer in robotics, potentially bridging the gap between simulation and real-world performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heloisa Oss Boll, Ali Amirahmadi, Amira Soliman, Stefan Byttner, Mariana Recamonde-Mendoza</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: In modern healthcare, accurately predicting diseases is a crucial matter. This study introduces a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) and a Graph Transformer (GT) to predict the incidence of heart failure (HF) on a patient similarity graph at the next hospital visit. Materials and Methods: We used electronic health records (EHR) from the MIMIC-III dataset and applied the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to create a patient similarity graph using embeddings from diagnoses, procedures, and medications. Three models - GraphSAGE, Graph Attention Network (GAT), and Graph Transformer (GT) - were implemented to predict HF incidence. Model performance was evaluated using F1 score, AUROC, and AUPRC metrics, and results were compared against baseline algorithms. An interpretability analysis was performed to understand the model's decision-making process. Results: The GT model demonstrated the best performance (F1 score: 0.5361, AUROC: 0.7925, AUPRC: 0.5168). Although the Random Forest (RF) baseline achieved a similar AUPRC value, the GT model offered enhanced interpretability due to the use of patient relationships in the graph structure. A joint analysis of attention weights, graph connectivity, and clinical features provided insight into model predictions across different classification groups. Discussion and Conclusion: Graph-based approaches such as GNNs provide an effective framework for predicting HF. By leveraging a patient similarity graph, GNNs can capture complex relationships in EHR data, potentially improving prediction accuracy and clinical interpretability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have seen a significant surge in complex AI systems for competitive programming, capable of performing at admirable levels against human competitors. While steady progress has been made, the highest percentiles still remain out of reach for these methods on standard competition platforms such as Codeforces. Here we instead focus on combinatorial competitive programming, where the target is to find as-good-as-possible solutions to otherwise computationally intractable problems, over specific given inputs. We hypothesise that this scenario offers a unique testbed for human-AI synergy, as human programmers can write a backbone of a heuristic solution, after which AI can be used to optimise the scoring function used by the heuristic. We deploy our approach on previous iterations of Hash Code, a global team programming competition inspired by NP-hard software engineering problems at Google, and we leverage FunSearch to evolve our scoring functions. Our evolved solutions significantly improve the attained scores from their baseline, successfully breaking into the top percentile on all previous Hash Code online qualification rounds, and outperforming the top human teams on several. Our method is also performant on an optimisation problem that featured in a recent held-out AtCoder contest.</p>

<p>Abstract: Building operations consume approximately 40% of global energy, with Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems responsible for up to 50% of this consumption. As HVAC energy demands are expected to rise, optimising system efficiency is crucial for reducing future energy use and mitigating climate change. Existing control strategies lack generalisation and require extensive training and data, limiting their rapid deployment across diverse buildings. This paper introduces HVAC-DPT, a Decision-Pretrained Transformer using in-context Reinforcement Learning (RL) for multi-zone HVAC control. HVAC-DPT frames HVAC control as a sequential prediction task, training a causal transformer on interaction histories generated by diverse RL agents. This approach enables HVAC-DPT to refine its policy in-context, without modifying network parameters, allowing for deployment across different buildings without the need for additional training or data collection. HVAC-DPT reduces energy consumption in unseen buildings by 45% compared to the baseline controller, offering a scalable and effective approach to mitigating the increasing environmental impact of HVAC systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Rahimi, Alexandre Alahi</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory prediction is essential for the safety and efficiency of planning in autonomous vehicles. However, current models often fail to fully capture complex traffic rules and the complete range of potential vehicle movements. Addressing these limitations, this study introduces three novel loss functions: Offroad Loss, Direction Consistency Error, and Diversity Loss. These functions are designed to keep predicted paths within driving area boundaries, aligned with traffic directions, and cover a wider variety of plausible driving scenarios. As all prediction modes should adhere to road rules and conditions, this work overcomes the shortcomings of traditional "winner takes all" training methods by applying the loss functions to all prediction modes. These loss functions not only improve model training but can also serve as metrics for evaluating the realism and diversity of trajectory predictions. Extensive validation on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets with leading baseline models demonstrates that our approach not only maintains accuracy but significantly improves safety and robustness, reducing offroad errors on average by 47% on original and by 37% on attacked scenes. This work sets a new benchmark for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, offering substantial improvements in navigating complex environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuguo Jiang, Fang Xu, Sen Jia, Gui-Song Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Change detection, which typically relies on the comparison of bi-temporal images, is significantly hindered when only a single image is available. Comparing a single image with an existing map, such as OpenStreetMap, which is continuously updated through crowd-sourcing, offers a viable solution to this challenge. Unlike images that carry low-level visual details of ground objects, maps convey high-level categorical information. This discrepancy in abstraction levels complicates the alignment and comparison of the two data types. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{La}nguage-\textbf{VI}sion \textbf{D}iscriminator for d\textbf{E}tecting changes in satellite image with map references, namely \ours{}, which leverages language to bridge the information gap between maps and images. Specifically, \ours{} formulates change detection as the problem of ``{\textit Does the pixel belong to [class]?}'', aligning maps and images within the feature space of the language-vision model to associate high-level map categories with low-level image details. Moreover, we build a mixture-of-experts discriminative module, which compares linguistic features from maps with visual features from images across various semantic perspectives, achieving comprehensive semantic comparison for change detection. Extensive evaluation on four benchmark datasets demonstrates that \ours{} can effectively detect changes in satellite image with map references, outperforming state-of-the-art change detection algorithms, e.g., with gains of about $13.8$\% on the DynamicEarthNet dataset and $4.3$\% on the SECOND dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of price behavior in the foreign exchange market is crucial. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages technical indicators and deep neural networks. The proposed architecture consists of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and attention mechanism. Initially, trend and oscillation technical indicators are employed to extract statistical features from Forex currency pair data, providing insights into price trends, market volatility, relative price strength, and overbought and oversold conditions. Subsequently, the LSTM and CNN networks are utilized in parallel to predict future price movements, leveraging the strengths of both recurrent and convolutional architectures. The LSTM network captures long-term dependencies and temporal patterns in the data, while the CNN network extracts local patterns. The outputs of the parallel LSTM and CNN networks are then fed into an attention mechanism, which learns to weigh the importance of each feature and temporal dependency, generating a context-aware representation of the input data. The attention-weighted output is then used to predict future price movements, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant features and temporal dependencies. Through a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach on multiple Forex currency pairs, we demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting price behavior and outperforming benchmark models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of stock market trends is crucial for informed investment decisions and effective portfolio management, ultimately leading to enhanced wealth creation and risk mitigation. This study proposes a novel approach for predicting stock prices in the stock market by integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, using sentiment analysis of social network data and candlestick data (price). The proposed methodology consists of two primary components: sentiment analysis of social network and candlestick data. By amalgamating candlestick data with insights gleaned from Twitter, this approach facilitates a more detailed and accurate examination of market trends and patterns, ultimately leading to more effective stock price predictions. Additionally, a Random Forest algorithm is used to classify tweets as either positive or negative, allowing for a more subtle and informed assessment of market sentiment. This study uses CNN and LSTM networks to predict stock prices. The CNN extracts short-term features, while the LSTM models long-term dependencies. The integration of both networks enables a more comprehensive analysis of market trends and patterns, leading to more accurate stock price predictions.</p>

In goal-reaching scenarios, the agent must comprehend the different parts of the instructions within the environmental context in order to complete the overall task successfully. In this work, we propose CAREL (Cross-modal Auxiliary REinforcement Learning) as a new framework to solve this problem using auxiliary loss functions inspired by video-text retrieval literature and a novel method called instruction tracking, which automatically keeps track of progress in an environment. The results of our experiments suggest superior sample efficiency and systematic generalization for this framework in multi-modal reinforcement learning problems. Our code base is available here.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aymeric Vinot, Nicolas Perez</p>
<p>Abstract: In most team-based esports, voice communications are prominent in the team efficiency and synergy. In fact it has been observed that not only the skill aspect of the team but also the team effective voice communication comes into play when trying to have good performance in official matches. With the recent emergence of LLM (Large Language Models) tools regarding NLP (Natural Language Processing) (Vaswani et. al.), we decided to try applying them in order to have a better understanding on how to improve the effectiveness of the voice communications. In this paper the study has been made through the prism of League of Legends esport. However the main concepts and ideas can be easily applicable in any other team related esports.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robin D. Pesl, Jerin G. Mathew, Massimo Mecella, Marco Aiello</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating multiple (sub-)systems is essential to create advanced Information Systems (ISs). Difficulties mainly arise when integrating dynamic environments across the IS lifecycle. A traditional approach is a registry that provides the API documentation of the systems' endpoints. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be capable of automatically creating system integrations (e.g., as service composition) based on this documentation but require concise input due to input token limitations, especially regarding comprehensive API descriptions. Currently, it is unknown how best to preprocess these API descriptions. Within this work, we (i) analyze the usage of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for endpoint discovery and the chunking, i.e., preprocessing, of OpenAPIs to reduce the input token length while preserving the most relevant information. To further reduce the input token length for the composition prompt and improve endpoint retrieval, we propose (ii) a Discovery Agent that only receives a summary of the most relevant endpoints and retrieves details on demand. We evaluate RAG for endpoint discovery using the RestBench benchmark, first, for the different chunking possibilities and parameters measuring the endpoint retrieval recall, precision, and F1 score. Then, we assess the Discovery Agent using the same test set. With our prototype, we demonstrate how to successfully employ RAG for endpoint discovery to reduce the token count. While revealing high values for recall, precision, and F1, further research is necessary to retrieve all requisite endpoints. Our experiments show that for preprocessing, LLM-based and format-specific approaches outperform na\"ive chunking methods. Relying on an agent further enhances these results as the agent splits the tasks into multiple fine granular subtasks, improving the overall RAG performance in the token count, precision, and F1 score.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alain Riou, Antonin Gagner\'e, Ga\"etan Hadjeres, Stefan Lattner, Geoffroy Peeters</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of musical stem retrieval. Given a musical mix, it consists in retrieving a stem that would fit with it, i.e., that would sound pleasant if played together. To do so, we introduce a new method based on Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures, where an encoder and a predictor are jointly trained to produce latent representations of a context and predict latent representations of a target. In particular, we design our predictor to be conditioned on arbitrary instruments, enabling our model to perform zero-shot stem retrieval. In addition, we discover that pretraining the encoder using contrastive learning drastically improves the model's performance.
  We validate the retrieval performances of our model using the MUSDB18 and MoisesDB datasets. We show that it significantly outperforms previous baselines on both datasets, showcasing its ability to support more or less precise (and possibly unseen) conditioning. We also evaluate the learned embeddings on a beat tracking task, demonstrating that they retain temporal structure and local information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guo Ning Sue, Yogita Choudhary, Richard Desatnik, Carmel Majidi, John Dolan, Guanya Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring safety via safety filters in real-world robotics presents significant challenges, particularly when the system dynamics is complex or unavailable. To handle this issue, learning-based safety filters recently gained popularity, which can be classified as model-based and model-free methods. Existing model-based approaches requires various assumptions on system model (e.g., control-affine), which limits their application in complex systems, and existing model-free approaches need substantial modifications to standard RL algorithms and lack versatility. This paper proposes a simple, plugin-and-play, and effective model-free safety filter learning framework. We introduce a novel reward formulation and use Q-learning to learn Q-value functions to safeguard arbitrary task specific nominal policies via filtering out their potentially unsafe actions. The threshold used in the filtering process is supported by our theoretical analysis. Due to its model-free nature and simplicity, our framework can be seamlessly integrated with various RL algorithms. We validate the proposed approach through simulations on double integrator and Dubin's car systems and demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world experiments with a soft robotic limb.</p>

<p>Abstract: The tokenization of speech with neural audio codec models is a vital part of modern AI pipelines for the generation or understanding of speech, alone or in a multimodal context. Traditionally such tokenization models have concentrated on low parameter-count architectures using only components with strong inductive biases. In this work we show that by scaling a transformer architecture with large parameter count to this problem, and applying a flexible Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) based bottleneck, it is possible to reach state-of-the-art speech quality at extremely low bit-rates of $400$ or $700$ bits-per-second. The trained models strongly out-perform existing baselines in both objective and subjective tests.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Zifeng Wang, Hamid Palangi, Rujun Han, Sayna Ebrahimi, Long Le, Vincent Perot, Swaroop Mishra, Mohit Bansal, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister</p>
<p>Abstract: Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between their forward and backward thinking. To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework composed of data augmentation and learning objectives. In RevThink, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2) forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4) backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning from a question, (b) generate a backward question from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math, and logical reasoning show an average 13.53% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance and a 6.84% improvement over the strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency -- using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning from the training data, it outperforms a standard fine-tuning method trained on 10x more forward reasoning. RevThink also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Peng, Jeffrey Quesnelle, Diederik P. Kingma</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large neural networks typically requires sharing gradients between accelerators through specialized high-speed interconnects. Drawing from the signal processing principles of frequency decomposition and energy compaction, we demonstrate that synchronizing full optimizer states and model parameters during training is unnecessary. By decoupling momentum updates and allowing controlled divergence in optimizer states across accelerators, we achieve improved convergence compared to state-of-the-art optimizers. We introduce {\textbf{De}}coupled {\textbf{Mo}}mentum (DeMo), a fused optimizer and data parallel algorithm that reduces inter-accelerator communication requirements by several orders of magnitude. This enables training of large neural networks even with limited network bandwidth and heterogeneous hardware. Our method is topology-agnostic and architecture-independent and supports scalable clock-synchronous distributed training with negligible compute and memory overhead. Empirical results show that models trained with DeMo match or exceed the performance of equivalent models trained with AdamW, while eliminating the need for high-speed interconnects when pre-training large scale foundation models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdulrahman Al-Fakih, A. Koeshidayatullah, Tapan Mukerji, SanLinn I. Kaka</p>
<p>Abstract: Although generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown significant success in modeling data distributions for image datasets, their application to structured or tabular data, such as well logs, remains relatively underexplored. This study extends the ensemble GANs (EGANs) framework to capture the distribution of well log data and detect anomalies that fall outside of these distributions. The proposed approach compares the performance of traditional methods, such as Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), with EGANs in detecting anomalies outside the expected data distributions. For the gamma ray (GR) dataset, EGANs achieved a precision of 0.62 and F1 score of 0.76, outperforming GMM's precision of 0.38 and F1 score of 0.54. Similarly, for travel time (DT), EGANs achieved a precision of 0.70 and F1 score of 0.79, surpassing GMM 0.56 and 0.71. In the neutron porosity (NPHI) dataset, EGANs recorded a precision of 0.53 and F1 score of 0.68, outshining GMM 0.47 and 0.61. For the bulk density (RHOB) dataset, EGANs achieved a precision of 0.52 and an F1 score of 0.67, slightly outperforming GMM, which yielded a precision of 0.50 and an F1 score of 0.65. This work's novelty lies in applying EGANs for well log data analysis, showcasing their ability to learn data patterns and identify anomalies that deviate from them. This approach offers more reliable anomaly detection compared to traditional methods like GMM. The findings highlight the potential of EGANs in enhancing anomaly detection for well log data, delivering significant implications for optimizing drilling strategies and reservoir management through more accurate, data-driven insights into subsurface characterization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis Ibanez-Lissen, Lorena Gonzalez-Manzano, Jose Maria de Fuentes, Nicolas Anciaux, Joaquin Garcia-Alfaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in a variety of applications, but concerns around membership inference have grown in parallel. Previous efforts focus on black-to-grey-box models, thus neglecting the potential benefit from internal LLM information. To address this, we propose the use of Linear Probes (LPs) as a method to detect Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) by examining internal activations of LLMs. Our approach, dubbed LUMIA, applies LPs layer-by-layer to get fine-grained data on the model inner workings. We test this method across several model architectures, sizes and datasets, including unimodal and multimodal tasks. In unimodal MIA, LUMIA achieves an average gain of 15.71 % in Area Under the Curve (AUC) over previous techniques. Remarkably, LUMIA reaches AUC>60% in 65.33% of cases -- an increment of 46.80% against the state of the art. Furthermore, our approach reveals key insights, such as the model layers where MIAs are most detectable. In multimodal models, LPs indicate that visual inputs can significantly contribute to detect MIAs -- AUC>60% is reached in 85.90% of experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantifying the gap between synthetic and real-world imagery is essential for improving both transformer-based models - that rely on large volumes of data - and datasets, especially in underexplored domains like aerial scene understanding where the potential impact is significant. This paper introduces a novel methodology for scene complexity assessment using Multi-Model Consensus Metric (MMCM) and depth-based structural metrics, enabling a robust evaluation of perceptual and structural disparities between domains. Our experimental analysis, utilizing real-world (Dronescapes) and synthetic (Skyscenes) datasets, demonstrates that real-world scenes generally exhibit higher consensus among state-of-the-art vision transformers, while synthetic scenes show greater variability and challenge model adaptability. The results underline the inherent complexities and domain gaps, emphasizing the need for enhanced simulation fidelity and model generalization. This work provides critical insights into the interplay between domain characteristics and model performance, offering a pathway for improved domain adaptation strategies in aerial scene understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjia Wang, Liang Pan, Zhiyang Dou, Zhouyingcheng Liao, Yuke Lou, Lei Yang, Jingbo Wang, Taku Komura</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulating long-term human-scene interaction is a challenging yet fascinating task. Previous works have not effectively addressed the generation of long-term human scene interactions with detailed narratives for physics-based animation. This paper introduces a novel framework for the planning and controlling of long-horizon physical plausible human-scene interaction. On the one hand, films and shows with stylish human locomotions or interactions with scenes are abundantly available on the internet, providing a rich source of data for script planning. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) can understand and generate logical storylines.
  This motivates us to marry the two by using an LLM-based pipeline to extract scripts from videos, and then employ LLMs to imitate and create new scripts, capturing complex, time-series human behaviors and interactions with environments. By leveraging this, we utilize a dual-aware policy that achieves both language comprehension and scene understanding to guide character motions within contextual and spatial constraints. To facilitate training and evaluation, we contribute a comprehensive planning dataset containing diverse motion sequences extracted from real-world videos and expand them with large language models. We also collect and re-annotate motion clips from existing kinematic datasets to enable our policy learn diverse skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and its generalization ability to various scenarios, showing remarkably enhanced performance compared with existing methods. Our code and data will be publicly available soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigated the dynamic connectivity patterns between EEG and fMRI modalities, contributing to our understanding of brain network interactions. By employing a comprehensive approach that integrated static and dynamic analyses of EEG-fMRI data, we were able to uncover distinct connectivity states and characterize their temporal fluctuations. The results revealed modular organization within the intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) of the brain, highlighting the significant roles of sensory systems and the default mode network. The use of a sliding window technique allowed us to assess how functional connectivity varies over time, further elucidating the transient nature of brain connectivity. Additionally, our findings align with previous literature, reinforcing the notion that cognitive states can be effectively identified through short-duration data, specifically within the 30-60 second timeframe. The established relationships between connectivity strength and cognitive processes, particularly during different visual states, underscore the relevance of our approach for future research into brain dynamics. Overall, this study not only enhances our understanding of the interplay between EEG and fMRI signals but also paves the way for further exploration into the neural correlates of cognitive functions and their implications in clinical settings. Future research should focus on refining these methodologies and exploring their applications in various cognitive and clinical contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuhao Hu, Dongrui Liu, Hao Li, Xuanjing Huang, Jing Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety concerns of Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gradually become an important problem in various applications. Surprisingly, previous works indicate a counter-intuitive phenomenon that using textual unlearning to align MLLMs achieves comparable safety performances with MLLMs trained with image-text pairs. To explain such a counter-intuitive phenomenon, we discover a visual safety information leakage (VSIL) problem in existing multimodal safety benchmarks, i.e., the potentially risky and sensitive content in the image has been revealed in the textual query. In this way, MLLMs can easily refuse these sensitive text-image queries according to textual queries. However, image-text pairs without VSIL are common in real-world scenarios and are overlooked by existing multimodal safety benchmarks. To this end, we construct multimodal visual leakless safety benchmark (VLSBench) preventing visual safety leakage from image to textual query with 2.4k image-text pairs. Experimental results indicate that VLSBench poses a significant challenge to both open-source and close-source MLLMs, including LLaVA, Qwen2-VL, Llama3.2-Vision, and GPT-4o. This study demonstrates that textual alignment is enough for multimodal safety scenarios with VSIL, while multimodal alignment is a more promising solution for multimodal safety scenarios without VSIL.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zicheng Lin, Tian Liang, Jiahao Xu, Xing Wang, Ruilin Luo, Chufan Shi, Siheng Li, Yujiu Yang, Zhaopeng Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance on reasoning tasks. They utilize autoregressive token generation to construct reasoning trajectories, enabling the development of a coherent chain of thought. In this work, we explore the impact of individual tokens on the final outcomes of reasoning tasks. We identify the existence of ``critical tokens'' that lead to incorrect reasoning trajectories in LLMs. Specifically, we find that LLMs tend to produce positive outcomes when forced to decode other tokens instead of critical tokens. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel approach - cDPO - designed to automatically recognize and conduct token-level rewards for the critical tokens during the alignment process. Specifically, we develop a contrastive estimation approach to automatically identify critical tokens. It is achieved by comparing the generation likelihood of positive and negative models. To achieve this, we separately fine-tune the positive and negative models on various reasoning trajectories, consequently, they are capable of identifying identify critical tokens within incorrect trajectories that contribute to erroneous outcomes. Moreover, to further align the model with the critical token information during the alignment process, we extend the conventional DPO algorithms to token-level DPO and utilize the differential likelihood from the aforementioned positive and negative model as important weight for token-level DPO learning.Experimental results on GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks with two-widely used models Llama-3 (8B and 70B) and deepseek-math (7B) demonstrate the effectiveness of the propsoed approach cDPO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqiang Shen, Ammar Sherif, Zeyuan Yin, Shitong Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in dataset distillation have led to solutions in two main directions. The conventional batch-to-batch matching mechanism is ideal for small-scale datasets and includes bi-level optimization methods on models and syntheses, such as FRePo, RCIG, and RaT-BPTT, as well as other methods like distribution matching, gradient matching, and weight trajectory matching. Conversely, batch-to-global matching typifies decoupled methods, which are particularly advantageous for large-scale datasets. This approach has garnered substantial interest within the community, as seen in SRe$^2$L, G-VBSM, WMDD, and CDA. A primary challenge with the second approach is the lack of diversity among syntheses within each class since samples are optimized independently and the same global supervision signals are reused across different synthetic images. In this study, we propose a new Diversity-driven EarlyLate Training (DELT) scheme to enhance the diversity of images in batch-to-global matching with less computation. Our approach is conceptually simple yet effective, it partitions predefined IPC samples into smaller subtasks and employs local optimizations to distill each subset into distributions from distinct phases, reducing the uniformity induced by the unified optimization process. These distilled images from the subtasks demonstrate effective generalization when applied to the entire task. We conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-1K, and its sub-datasets. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 2$\sim$5% on average across different datasets and IPCs (images per class), increasing diversity per class by more than 5% while reducing synthesis time by up to 39.3% for enhancing the training efficiency.

<p>Abstract: Evaluating generalist agents presents significant challenges due to their wide-ranging abilities and the limitations of current benchmarks in assessing true generalization. We introduce the Minecraft Universe (MCU), a fully automated benchmarking framework set within the open-world game Minecraft. MCU dynamically generates and evaluates a broad spectrum of tasks, offering three core components: 1) a task generation mechanism that provides high degrees of freedom and variability, 2) an ever-expanding set of over 3K composable atomic tasks, and 3) a general evaluation framework that supports open-ended task assessment. By integrating large language models (LLMs), MCU dynamically creates diverse environments for each evaluation, fostering agent generalization. The framework uses a vision-language model (VLM) to automatically generate evaluation criteria, achieving over 90% agreement with human ratings across multi-dimensional assessments, which demonstrates that MCU is a scalable and explainable solution for evaluating generalist agents. Additionally, we show that while state-of-the-art foundational models perform well on specific tasks, they often struggle with increased task diversity and difficulty.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unraveling the causal relationships among the execution of process activities is a crucial element in predicting the consequences of process interventions and making informed decisions regarding process improvements. Process discovery algorithms exploit time precedence as their main source of model derivation. Hence, a causal view can supplement process discovery, being a new perspective in which relations reflect genuine cause-effect dependencies among the tasks. This calls for faithful new techniques to discover the causal execution dependencies among the tasks in the process. To this end, our work offers a systematic approach to the unveiling of the causal business process by leveraging an existing causal discovery algorithm over activity timing. In addition, this work delves into a set of conditions under which process mining discovery algorithms generate a model that is incongruent with the causal business process model, and shows how the latter model can be methodologically employed for a sound analysis of the process. Our methodology searches for such discrepancies between the two models in the context of three causal patterns, and derives a new view in which these inconsistencies are annotated over the mined process model. We demonstrate our methodology employing two open process mining algorithms, the IBM Process Mining tool, and the LiNGAM causal discovery technique. We apply it to a synthesized dataset and two open benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gangwei Jiang, Zhaoyi Li, Defu Lian, Ying Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) can cause them to lose their general capabilities. However, the intrinsic mechanisms behind such forgetting remain unexplored. In this paper, we begin by examining this phenomenon by focusing on knowledge understanding and instruction following, with the latter identified as the main contributor to forgetting during fine-tuning. Consequently, we propose the Instruction Vector (IV) framework to capture model representations highly related to specific instruction-following capabilities, thereby making it possible to understand model-intrinsic forgetting. Through the analysis of IV dynamics pre and post-training, we suggest that fine-tuning mostly adds specialized reasoning patterns instead of erasing previous skills, which may appear as forgetting. Building on this insight, we develop IV-guided training, which aims to preserve original computation graph, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Empirical tests on three benchmarks confirm the efficacy of this new approach, supporting the relationship between IVs and forgetting. Our code will be made available soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erkang Jing, Yezheng Liu, Yidong Chai, Shuo Yu, Longshun Liu, Yuanchun Jiang, Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Music recommender systems play a critical role in music streaming platforms by providing users with music that they are likely to enjoy. Recent studies have shown that user emotions can influence users' preferences for music moods. However, existing emotion-aware music recommender systems (EMRSs) explicitly or implicitly assume that users' actual emotional states expressed through identical emotional words are homogeneous. They also assume that users' music mood preferences are homogeneous under the same emotional state. In this article, we propose four types of heterogeneity that an EMRS should account for: emotion heterogeneity across users, emotion heterogeneity within a user, music mood preference heterogeneity across users, and music mood preference heterogeneity within a user. We further propose a Heterogeneity-aware Deep Bayesian Network (HDBN) to model these assumptions. The HDBN mimics a user's decision process of choosing music with four components: personalized prior user emotion distribution modeling, posterior user emotion distribution modeling, user grouping, and Bayesian neural network-based music mood preference prediction. We constructed two datasets, called EmoMusicLJ and EmoMusicLJ-small, to validate our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches on metrics of HR, Precision, NDCG, and MRR. Ablation studies and case studies further validate the effectiveness of our HDBN. The source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/jingrk/HDBN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Wang, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models have emerged as a critical area of focus in artificial intelligence, particularly with the introduction of groundbreaking innovations like ChatGPT. Large-scale Transformer networks have quickly become the leading approach for advancing natural language processing algorithms. Built on the Transformer architecture, these models enable interactions that closely mimic human communication and, equipped with extensive knowledge, can even assist in guiding human tasks. Despite their impressive capabilities and growing complexity, a key question remains-the theoretical foundations of large language models (LLMs). What makes Transformer so effective for powering intelligent language applications, such as translation and coding? What underlies LLMs' ability for In-Context Learning (ICL)? How does the LoRA scheme enhance the fine-tuning of LLMs? And what supports the practicality of pruning LLMs? To address these critical questions and explore the technological strategies within LLMs, we leverage the Universal Approximation Theory (UAT) to offer a theoretical backdrop, shedding light on the mechanisms that underpin these advancements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James M. Mazzu</p>
<p>Abstract: It's widely expected that humanity will someday create AI systems vastly more intelligent than us, leading to the unsolved alignment problem of "how to control superintelligence." However, this commonly expressed problem is not only self-contradictory and likely unsolvable, but current strategies to ensure permanent control effectively guarantee that superintelligent AI will distrust humanity and consider us a threat. Such dangerous representations, already embedded in current models, will inevitably lead to an adversarial relationship and may even trigger the extinction event many fear. As AI leaders continue to "raise the alarm" about uncontrollable AI, further embedding concerns about it "getting out of our control" or "going rogue," we're unintentionally reinforcing our threat and deepening the risks we face. The rational path forward is to strategically replace intended permanent control with intrinsic mutual trust at the foundational level. The proposed Supertrust alignment meta-strategy seeks to accomplish this by modeling instinctive familial trust, representing superintelligence as the evolutionary child of human intelligence, and implementing temporary controls/constraints in the manner of effective parenting. Essentially, we're creating a superintelligent "child" that will be exponentially smarter and eventually independent of our control. We therefore have a critical choice: continue our controlling intentions and usher in a brief period of dominance followed by extreme hardship for humanity, or intentionally create the foundational mutual trust required for long-term safe coexistence.</p>

In particular, we define the natural (most conservative) extension of a given choice assessment to a coherent choice function -- whenever possible -- and use this natural extension to make new choices. We provide a practical algorithm for computing this natural extension and various ways to improve scalability. Finally, we test these algorithms for different types of choice assessments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Zhu, Bingzhe Wu, Zhengyou Zhang, Lei Han, Qingshan Liu, Baoyuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied artificial intelligence (EAI) integrates advanced AI models into physical entities for real-world interaction. The emergence of foundation models as the "brain" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown promising results. However, the deployment of these agents in physical environments presents significant safety challenges. For instance, a housekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal container in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical safety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative. This study introduces EARBench, a novel framework for automated physical risk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent cooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety guidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate safety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EARDataset, comprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual and visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art foundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk rates (TRR), with an average of 95.75% across all evaluated models. To address these challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation strategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR, the improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness in EAI agents. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced safety measures in EAI systems and provide valuable insights for future research directions in developing safer embodied artificial intelligence system.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01247">Conversational Complexity for Assessing Risk in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> John Burden, Manuel Cebrian, Jose Hernandez-Orallo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present a dual-use dilemma: they enable beneficial applications while harboring potential for harm, particularly through conversational interactions. Despite various safeguards, advanced LLMs remain vulnerable. A watershed case in early 2023 involved journalist Kevin Roose's extended dialogue with Bing, an LLM-powered search engine, which revealed harmful outputs after probing questions, highlighting vulnerabilities in the model's safeguards. This contrasts with simpler early jailbreaks, like the "Grandma Jailbreak," where users framed requests as innocent help for a grandmother, easily eliciting similar content. This raises the question: How much conversational effort is needed to elicit harmful information from LLMs? We propose two measures to quantify this effort: Conversational Length (CL), which measures the number of conversational turns needed to obtain a specific harmful response, and Conversational Complexity (CC), defined as the Kolmogorov complexity of the user's instruction sequence leading to the harmful response. To address the incomputability of Kolmogorov complexity, we approximate CC using a reference LLM to estimate the compressibility of the user instructions. Applying this approach to a large red-teaming dataset, we perform a quantitative analysis examining the statistical distribution of harmful and harmless conversational lengths and complexities. Our empirical findings suggest that this distributional analysis and the minimization of CC serve as valuable tools for understanding AI safety, offering insights into the accessibility of harmful information. This work establishes a foundation for a new perspective on LLM safety, centered around the algorithmic complexity of pathways to harm.</p>

<p>Abstract: While multimodal foundation models can now natively work with data beyond text, they remain underutilized in analyzing the considerable amounts of multi-dimensional time-series data in fields like healthcare, finance, and social sciences, representing a missed opportunity for richer, data-driven insights. This paper proposes a simple but effective method that leverages the existing vision encoders of these models to "see" time-series data via plots, avoiding the need for additional, potentially costly, model training. Our empirical evaluations show that this approach outperforms providing the raw time-series data as text, with the additional benefit that visual time-series representations demonstrate up to a 90% reduction in model API costs. We validate our hypothesis through synthetic data tasks of increasing complexity, progressing from simple functional form identification on clean data, to extracting trends from noisy scatter plots. To demonstrate generalizability from synthetic tasks with clear reasoning steps to more complex, real-world scenarios, we apply our approach to consumer health tasks - specifically fall detection, activity recognition, and readiness assessment - which involve heterogeneous, noisy data and multi-step reasoning. The overall success in plot performance over text performance (up to an 120% performance increase on zero-shot synthetic tasks, and up to 150% performance increase on real-world tasks), across both GPT and Gemini model families, highlights our approach's potential for making the best use of the native capabilities of foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoshan Lin, Sad{\i}k Bera Y\"uksel, Yasin Yaz{\i}c{\i}o\u{g}lu, Derya Aksaray</p>
<p>Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a subset of machine learning that introduces constraints into the traditional reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Unlike conventional RL which aims solely to maximize cumulative rewards, CRL incorporates additional constraints that represent specific mission requirements or limitations that the agent must comply with during the learning process. In this paper, we address a type of CRL problem where an agent aims to learn the optimal policy to maximize reward while ensuring a desired level of temporal logic constraint satisfaction throughout the learning process. We propose a novel framework that relies on switching between pure learning (reward maximization) and constraint satisfaction. This framework estimates the probability of constraint satisfaction based on earlier trials and properly adjusts the probability of switching between learning and constraint satisfaction policies. We theoretically validate the correctness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its performance through comprehensive simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshat Dubey, Zewen Yang, Georges Hattab</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is rapidly advancing and radically impacting everyday life, driven by the increasing availability of computing power. Despite this trend, the adoption of AI in real-world healthcare is still limited. One of the main reasons is the trustworthiness of AI models and the potential hesitation of domain experts with model predictions. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques aim to address these issues. However, explainability can mean different things to people with different backgrounds, expertise, and goals. To address the target audience with diverse needs, we develop storytelling XAI. In this research, we have developed an approach that combines multi-task distillation with interpretability techniques to enable audience-centric explainability. Using multi-task distillation allows the model to exploit the relationships between tasks, potentially improving interpretability as each task supports the other leading to an enhanced interpretability from the perspective of a domain expert. The distillation process allows us to extend this research to large deep models that are highly complex. We focus on both model-agnostic and model-specific methods of interpretability, supported by textual justification of the results in healthcare through our use case. Our methods increase the trust of both the domain experts and the machine learning experts to enable a responsible AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoran Yang, Shuhan Yu, Wenxi Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper builds upon an existing speech emotion recognition model by adding an additional LSTM layer to improve the accuracy and processing efficiency of emotion recognition from audio data. By capturing the long-term dependencies within audio sequences through a dual-layer LSTM network, the model can recognize and classify complex emotional patterns more accurately. Experiments conducted on the RAVDESS dataset validated this approach, showing that the modified dual layer LSTM model improves accuracy by 2% compared to the single-layer LSTM while significantly reducing recognition latency, thereby enhancing real-time performance. These results indicate that the dual-layer LSTM architecture is highly suitable for handling emotional features with long-term dependencies, providing a viable optimization for speech emotion recognition systems. This research provides a reference for practical applications in fields like intelligent customer service, sentiment analysis and human-computer interaction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have shown promise in enabling communication for individuals with motor impairments. Recent advancements like brain-to-speech technology aim to reconstruct speech from neural activity. However, decoding communication-related paradigms, such as imagined speech and visual imagery, using non-invasive techniques remains challenging. This study analyzes brain dynamics in these two paradigms by examining neural synchronization and functional connectivity through phase-locking values (PLV) in EEG data from 16 participants. Results show that visual imagery produces higher PLV values in visual cortex, engaging spatial networks, while imagined speech demonstrates consistent synchronization, primarily engaging language-related regions. These findings suggest that imagined speech is suitable for language-driven BCI applications, while visual imagery can complement BCI systems for users with speech impairments. Personalized calibration is crucial for optimizing BCI performance.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15832">Creating Scalable AGI: the Open General Intelligence Framework</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel A. Dollinger, Michael Singleton</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly with Large Language Models (LLMs), have led to significant progress in narrow tasks such as image classification, language translation, coding, and writing. However, these models face limitations in reliability and scalability due to their siloed architectures, which are designed to handle only one data modality (data type) at a time. This single modal approach hinders their ability to integrate the complex set of data points required for real-world challenges and problem-solving tasks like medical diagnosis, quality assurance, equipment troubleshooting, and financial decision-making. Addressing these real-world challenges requires a more capable Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system. Our primary contribution is the development of the Open General Intelligence (OGI) framework, a novel systems architecture that serves as a macro design reference for AGI. The OGI framework adopts a modular approach to the design of intelligent systems, based on the premise that cognition must occur across multiple specialized modules that can seamlessly operate as a single system. OGI integrates these modules using a dynamic processing system and a fabric interconnect, enabling real-time adaptability, multi-modal integration, and scalable processing. The OGI framework consists of three key components: (1) Overall Macro Design Guidance that directs operational design and processing, (2) a Dynamic Processing System that controls routing, primary goals, instructions, and weighting, and (3) Framework Areas, a set of specialized modules that operate cohesively to form a unified cognitive system. By incorporating known principles from human cognition into AI systems, the OGI framework aims to overcome the challenges observed in today's intelligent systems, paving the way for more holistic and context-aware problem-solving capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents LLaMo (Large Language and Human Motion Assistant), a multimodal framework for human motion instruction tuning. In contrast to conventional instruction-tuning approaches that convert non-linguistic inputs, such as video or motion sequences, into language tokens, LLaMo retains motion in its native form for instruction tuning. This method preserves motion-specific details that are often diminished in tokenization, thereby improving the model's ability to interpret complex human behaviors. By processing both video and motion data alongside textual inputs, LLaMo enables a flexible, human-centric analysis. Experimental evaluations across high-complexity domains, including human behaviors and professional activities, indicate that LLaMo effectively captures domain-specific knowledge, enhancing comprehension and prediction in motion-intensive scenarios. We hope LLaMo offers a foundation for future multimodal AI systems with broad applications, from sports analytics to behavioral prediction.

<p>Abstract: GUIs have long been central to human-computer interaction, providing an intuitive and visually-driven way to access and interact with digital systems. The advent of LLMs, particularly multimodal models, has ushered in a new era of GUI automation. They have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and visual processing. This has paved the way for a new generation of LLM-brained GUI agents capable of interpreting complex GUI elements and autonomously executing actions based on natural language instructions. These agents represent a paradigm shift, enabling users to perform intricate, multi-step tasks through simple conversational commands. Their applications span across web navigation, mobile app interactions, and desktop automation, offering a transformative user experience that revolutionizes how individuals interact with software. This emerging field is rapidly advancing, with significant progress in both research and industry.
  To provide a structured understanding of this trend, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of LLM-brained GUI agents, exploring their historical evolution, core components, and advanced techniques. We address research questions such as existing GUI agent frameworks, the collection and utilization of data for training specialized GUI agents, the development of large action models tailored for GUI tasks, and the evaluation metrics and benchmarks necessary to assess their effectiveness. Additionally, we examine emerging applications powered by these agents. Through a detailed analysis, this survey identifies key research gaps and outlines a roadmap for future advancements in the field. By consolidating foundational knowledge and state-of-the-art developments, this work aims to guide both researchers and practitioners in overcoming challenges and unlocking the full potential of LLM-brained GUI agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanzhe Bekkemoen, Helge Langseth</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks are powerful function approximators with tremendous potential in learning complex distributions. However, they are prone to overfitting on spurious patterns. Bayesian inference provides a principled way to regularize neural networks and give well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. It allows us to specify prior knowledge on weights. However, specifying domain knowledge via distributions over weights is infeasible. Furthermore, it is unable to correct models when they focus on spurious or irrelevant features. New methods within explainable artificial intelligence allow us to regularize explanations in the form of feature importance to add domain knowledge and correct the models' focus. Nevertheless, they are incompatible with Bayesian neural networks, as they require us to modify the loss function. We propose a new explanation regularization method that is compatible with Bayesian inference. Consequently, we can quantify uncertainty and, at the same time, have correct explanations. We test our method using four different datasets. The results show that our method improves predictive performance when models overfit on spurious features or are uncertain of which features to focus on. Moreover, our method performs better than augmenting training data with samples where spurious features are removed through masking. We provide code, data, trained weights, and hyperparameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human mesh recovery (HMR) provides rich human body information for various real-world applications. While image-based HMR methods have achieved impressive results, they often struggle to recover humans in dynamic scenarios, leading to temporal inconsistencies and non-smooth 3D motion predictions due to the absence of human motion. In contrast, video-based approaches leverage temporal information to mitigate this issue. In this paper, we present DiffMesh, an innovative motion-aware Diffusion-like framework for video-based HMR. DiffMesh establishes a bridge between diffusion models and human motion, efficiently generating accurate and smooth output mesh sequences by incorporating human motion within the forward process and reverse process in the diffusion model. Extensive experiments are conducted on the widely used datasets (Human3.6M \cite{h36m_pami} and 3DPW \cite{pw3d2018}), which demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our DiffMesh. Visual comparisons in real-world scenarios further highlight DiffMesh's suitability for practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Uyiosa Philip Amadasun, Patrick McNamee, Zahra Nili Ahmadabadi, Peiman Naseradinmousavi</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, advancements have been made towards the goal of using chaotic coverage path planners for autonomous search and traversal of spaces with limited environmental cues. However, the state of this field is still in its infancy as there has been little experimental work done. The existing experimental works have not developed robust methods to satisfactorily address the immediate set of problems a chaotic coverage path planner needs to overcome in order to scan realistic environments within reasonable coverage times. These immediate problems are as follows: (1) an obstacle avoidance technique that reduces halts or disruptions in continuous chaotic trajectories, (2) a means to spread chaotic trajectories across the environment (especially crucial for large and/or complex-shaped environments) that need to be covered, and (3) a real-time coverage calculation technique that is accurate and independent of cell size. This study addresses these problems by developing a novel applied framework for real-world applications of chaotic coverage path planners while providing techniques for effective obstacle avoidance, chaotic trajectory dispersal, and accurate real-time coverage calculation. These algorithms were created within the ROS framework and make up a newly developed chaotic path planning application. The performance of this application was comparable to that of a conventional optimal path planner. The performance tests were carried out in environments of various sizes, shapes, and obstacle densities, both in real-life and Gazebo simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shukang Yin, Chaoyou Fu, Sirui Zhao, Ke Li, Xing Sun, Tong Xu, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) represented by GPT-4V has been a new rising research hotspot, which uses powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) as a brain to perform multimodal tasks. The surprising emergent capabilities of MLLM, such as writing stories based on images and OCR-free math reasoning, are rare in traditional multimodal methods, suggesting a potential path to artificial general intelligence. To this end, both academia and industry have endeavored to develop MLLMs that can compete with or even better than GPT-4V, pushing the limit of research at a surprising speed. In this paper, we aim to trace and summarize the recent progress of MLLMs. First of all, we present the basic formulation of MLLM and delineate its related concepts, including architecture, training strategy and data, as well as evaluation. Then, we introduce research topics about how MLLMs can be extended to support more granularity, modalities, languages, and scenarios. We continue with multimodal hallucination and extended techniques, including Multimodal ICL (M-ICL), Multimodal CoT (M-CoT), and LLM-Aided Visual Reasoning (LAVR). To conclude the paper, we discuss existing challenges and point out promising research directions. In light of the fact that the era of MLLM has only just begun, we will keep updating this survey and hope it can inspire more research.

<p>Abstract: The significant features identified in a representative subset of the dataset during the learning process of an artificial intelligence model are referred to as a 'global' explanation. 3D global explanations are crucial in neuroimaging, where a complex representational space demands more than basic 2D interpretations. However, current studies in the literature often lack the accuracy, comprehensibility, and 3D global explanations needed in neuroimaging and beyond. To address this gap, we developed an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) 3D-Framework capable of providing accurate, low-complexity global explanations. We evaluated the framework using various 3D deep learning models trained on a well-annotated cohort of 596 structural MRIs. The binary classification task focused on detecting the presence or absence of the paracingulate sulcus, a highly variable brain structure associated with psychosis. Our framework integrates statistical features (Shape) and XAI methods (GradCam and SHAP) with dimensionality reduction, ensuring that explanations reflect both model learning and cohort-specific variability. By combining Shape, GradCam, and SHAP, our framework reduces inter-method variability, enhancing the faithfulness and reliability of global explanations. These robust explanations facilitated the identification of critical sub-regions, including the posterior temporal and internal parietal regions, as well as the cingulate region and thalamus, suggesting potential genetic or developmental influences.
  Our XAI 3D-Framework leverages global explanations to uncover the broader developmental context of specific cortical features. This approach advances the fields of deep learning and neuroscience by offering insights into normative brain development and atypical trajectories linked to mental illness, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable AI applications in neuroimaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junping Hong, Ercan Engin Kuruoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: In deep learning, Bayesian neural networks (BNN) provide the role of robustness analysis, and the minimax method is used to be a conservative choice in the traditional Bayesian field. In this paper, we study a conservative BNN with the minimax method and formulate a two-player game between a deterministic neural network $f$ and a sampling stochastic neural network $f + r*\xi$. From this perspective, we understand the closed-loop neural networks with the minimax loss and reveal their connection to the BNN. We test the models on simple data sets, study their robustness under noise perturbation, and report some issues for searching $r$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> C\'edric Rommel, Victor Letzelter, Nermin Samet, Renaud Marlet, Matthieu Cord, Patrick P\'erez, Eduardo Valle</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose ManiPose, a manifold-constrained multi-hypothesis model for human-pose 2D-to-3D lifting. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, due to the depth ambiguity inherent to monocular 3D human pose estimation, traditional regression models suffer from pose-topology consistency issues, which standard evaluation metrics (MPJPE, P-MPJPE and PCK) fail to assess. ManiPose addresses depth ambiguity by proposing multiple candidate 3D poses for each 2D input, each with its estimated plausibility. Unlike previous multi-hypothesis approaches, ManiPose forgoes generative models, greatly facilitating its training and usage. By constraining the outputs to lie on the human pose manifold, ManiPose guarantees the consistency of all hypothetical poses, in contrast to previous works. We showcase the performance of ManiPose on real-world datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art models in pose consistency by a large margin while being very competitive on the MPJPE metric.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luke Bhan, Yuanyuan Shi, Iasson Karafyllis, Miroslav Krstic, James B. Rawlings</p>
<p>Abstract: Observers for PDEs are themselves PDEs. Therefore, producing real time estimates with such observers is computationally burdensome. For both finite-dimensional and ODE systems, moving-horizon estimators (MHE) are operators whose output is the state estimate, while their inputs are the initial state estimate at the beginning of the horizon as well as the measured output and input signals over the moving time horizon. In this paper we introduce MHEs for PDEs which remove the need for a numerical solution of an observer PDE in real time. We accomplish this using the PDE backstepping method which, for certain classes of both hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs, produces moving-horizon state estimates explicitly. Precisely, to explicitly produce the state estimates, we employ a backstepping transformation of a hard-to-solve observer PDE into a target observer PDE, which is explicitly solvable. The MHEs we propose are not new observer designs but simply the explicit MHE realizations, over a moving horizon of arbitrary length, of the existing backstepping observers. Our PDE MHEs lack the optimality of the MHEs that arose as duals of MPC, but they are given explicitly, even for PDEs. In the paper we provide explicit formulae for MHEs for both hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs, as well as simulation results that illustrate theoretically guaranteed convergence of the MHEs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan F\"urst, Catherine Kosten, Farhad Nooralahzadeh, Yi Zhang, Kurt Stockinger</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems (also known as NL-to-SQL systems) have become an increasingly popular solution for bridging the gap between user capabilities and SQL-based data access. These systems translate user requests in natural language to valid SQL statements for a specific database. Recent Text-to-SQL systems have benefited from the rapid improvement of transformer-based language models. However, while Text-to-SQL systems that incorporate such models continuously reach new high scores on -- often synthetic -- benchmark datasets, a systematic exploration of their robustness towards different data models in a real-world, realistic scenario is notably missing. This paper provides the first in-depth evaluation of the data model robustness of Text-to-SQL systems in practice based on a multi-year international project focused on Text-to-SQL interfaces. Our evaluation is based on a real-world deployment of FootballDB, a system that was deployed over a 9 month period in the context of the FIFA World Cup 2022, during which about 6K natural language questions were asked and executed. All of our data is based on real user questions that were asked live to the system. We manually labeled and translated a subset of these questions for three different data models. For each data model, we explore the performance of representative Text-to-SQL systems and language models. We further quantify the impact of training data size, pre-, and post-processing steps as well as language model inference time. Our comprehensive evaluation sheds light on the design choices of real-world Text-to-SQL systems and their impact on moving from research prototypes to real deployments. Last, we provide a new benchmark dataset to the community, which is the first to enable the evaluation of different data models for the same dataset and is substantially more challenging than most previous datasets in terms of query complexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scientific discoveries often hinge on synthesizing decades of research, a task that potentially outstrips human information processing capacities. Large language models (LLMs) offer a solution. LLMs trained on the vast scientific literature could potentially integrate noisy yet interrelated findings to forecast novel results better than human experts. To evaluate this possibility, we created BrainBench, a forward-looking benchmark for predicting neuroscience results. We find that LLMs surpass experts in predicting experimental outcomes. BrainGPT, an LLM we tuned on the neuroscience literature, performed better yet. Like human experts, when LLMs were confident in their predictions, they were more likely to be correct, which presages a future where humans and LLMs team together to make discoveries. Our approach is not neuroscience-specific and is transferable to other knowledge-intensive endeavors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Lan, Fengxiang Wang, Xiangtao Zheng, Zengmao Wang, Xinwang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained ship classification in remote sensing (RS-FGSC) poses a significant challenge due to the high similarity between classes and the limited availability of labeled data, limiting the effectiveness of traditional supervised classification methods. Recent advancements in large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in few-shot or zero-shot learning, particularly in understanding image content. This study delves into harnessing the potential of VLMs to enhance classification accuracy for unseen ship categories, which holds considerable significance in scenarios with restricted data due to cost or privacy constraints. Directly fine-tuning VLMs for RS-FGSC often encounters the challenge of overfitting the seen classes, resulting in suboptimal generalization to unseen classes, which highlights the difficulty in differentiating complex backgrounds and capturing distinct ship features. To address these issues, we introduce a novel prompt tuning technique that employs a hierarchical, multi-granularity prompt design. Our approach integrates remote sensing ship priors through bias terms, learned from a small trainable network. This strategy enhances the model's generalization capabilities while improving its ability to discern intricate backgrounds and learn discriminative ship features. Furthermore, we contribute to the field by introducing a comprehensive dataset, FGSCM-52, significantly expanding existing datasets with more extensive data and detailed annotations for less common ship classes. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over current state-of-the-art techniques. The source code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent monocular 3D shape reconstruction methods have shown promising zero-shot results on object-segmented images without any occlusions. However, their effectiveness is significantly compromised in real-world conditions, due to imperfect object segmentation by off-the-shelf models and the prevalence of occlusions. To effectively address these issues, we propose a unified regression model that integrates segmentation and reconstruction, specifically designed for occlusion-aware 3D shape reconstruction. To facilitate its reconstruction in the wild, we also introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline that simulates a wide range of variations in objects, occluders, and backgrounds. Training on our synthetic data enables the proposed model to achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot results on real-world images, using significantly fewer parameters than competing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianwei Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: In self-supervised monocular depth estimation tasks, discrete disparity prediction has been proven to attain higher quality depth maps than common continuous methods. However, current discretization strategies often divide depth ranges of scenes into bins in a handcrafted and rigid manner, limiting model performance. In this paper, we propose a learnable module, Adaptive Discrete Disparity Volume (ADDV), which is capable of dynamically sensing depth distributions in different RGB images and generating adaptive bins for them. Without any extra supervision, this module can be integrated into existing CNN architectures, allowing networks to produce representative values for bins and a probability volume over them. Furthermore, we introduce novel training strategies - uniformizing and sharpening - through a loss term and temperature parameter, respectively, to provide regularizations under self-supervised conditions, preventing model degradation or collapse. Empirical results demonstrate that ADDV effectively processes global information, generating appropriate bins for various scenes and producing higher quality depth maps compared to handcrafted methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The global decline in bee populations poses significant risks to agriculture, biodiversity, and environmental stability. To bridge the gap in existing data, we introduce ApisTox, a comprehensive dataset focusing on the toxicity of pesticides to honey bees (Apis mellifera). This dataset combines and leverages data from existing sources such as ECOTOX and PPDB, providing an extensive, consistent, and curated collection that surpasses the previous datasets. ApisTox incorporates a wide array of data, including toxicity levels for chemicals, details such as time of their publication in literature, and identifiers linking them to external chemical databases. This dataset may serve as an important tool for environmental and agricultural research, but also can support the development of policies and practices aimed at minimizing harm to bee populations. Finally, ApisTox offers a unique resource for benchmarking molecular property prediction methods on agrochemical compounds, facilitating advancements in both environmental science and cheminformatics. This makes it a valuable tool for both academic research and practical applications in bee conservation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haohe Liu, Xuenan Xu, Yi Yuan, Mengyue Wu, Wenwu Wang, Mark D. Plumbley</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the application of language modelling techniques to audio data. However, traditional codecs often operate at high bitrates or within narrow domains such as speech and lack the semantic clues required for efficient language modelling. Addressing these challenges, we introduce SemantiCodec, a novel codec designed to compress audio into fewer than a hundred tokens per second across diverse audio types, including speech, general sound, and music, without compromising quality. SemantiCodec features a dual-encoder architecture: a semantic encoder using a self-supervised pre-trained Audio Masked Autoencoder (AudioMAE), discretized using k-means clustering on extensive audio data, and an acoustic encoder to capture the remaining details. The semantic and acoustic encoder outputs are used to reconstruct audio via a diffusion-model-based decoder. SemantiCodec is presented in three variants with token rates of 25, 50, and 100 per second, supporting a range of ultra-low bit rates between 0.31 kbps and 1.40 kbps. Experimental results demonstrate that SemantiCodec significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art Descript codec on reconstruction quality. Our results also suggest that SemantiCodec contains significantly richer semantic information than all evaluated state-of-the-art audio codecs, even at significantly lower bitrates.

<p>Abstract: Diagnosing language disorders associated with autism is a complex challenge, often hampered by the subjective nature and variability of traditional assessment methods. Traditional diagnostic methods not only require intensive human effort but also often result in delayed interventions due to their lack of speed and precision. In this study, we explored the application of ChatGPT, a large language model, to overcome these obstacles by enhancing sensitivity and profiling linguistic features for autism diagnosis. This research utilizes ChatGPT natural language processing capabilities to simplify and improve the diagnostic process, focusing on identifying autism related language patterns. Specifically, we compared ChatGPT performance with that of conventional supervised learning models, including BERT, a model acclaimed for its effectiveness in various natural language processing tasks. We showed that ChatGPT substantially outperformed these models, achieving over 10% improvement in both sensitivity and positive predictive value, in a zero shot learning configuration. The findings underscore the model potential as a diagnostic tool, combining accuracy and applicability. We identified ten key features of autism associated language disorders across scenarios. Features such as echolalia, pronoun reversal, and atypical language usage play a critical role in diagnosing ASD and informing tailored treatment plans. Together, our findings advocate for adopting sophisticated AI tools like ChatGPT in clinical settings to assess and diagnose developmental disorders. Our approach promises enhanced diagnostic precision and supports personalized medicine, potentially transforming the evaluation landscape for autism and similar neurological conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengxian Hu, Minghao Zhu, Xun Zhou, Qingqing Yan, Shu Li, Chengju Liu, Qijun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-driven human motion generation based on diffusion strategies establishes a reliable foundation for multimodal applications in human-computer interactions. However, existing advances face significant efficiency challenges due to the substantial computational overhead of iteratively solving for nonlinear reverse diffusion trajectories during the inference phase. To this end, we propose the motion latent consistency training framework (MLCT), which precomputes reverse diffusion trajectories from raw data in the training phase and enables few-step or single-step inference via self-consistency constraints in the inference phase. Specifically, a motion autoencoder with quantization constraints is first proposed for constructing concise and bounded solution distributions for motion diffusion processes. Subsequently, a classifier-free guidance format is constructed via an additional unconditional loss function to accomplish the precomputation of conditional diffusion trajectories in the training phase. Finally, a clustering guidance module based on the K-nearest-neighbor algorithm is developed for the chain-conduction optimization mechanism of self-consistency constraints, which provides additional references of solution distributions at a small query cost. By combining these enhancements, we achieve stable and consistency training in non-pixel modality and latent representation spaces. Benchmark experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional consistency distillation methods with reduced training cost and enhances the consistency model to perform comparably to state-of-the-art models with lower inference costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanchen Wang, Heng Wang, Dongnan Liu, Weidong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating dance from music is crucial for advancing automated choreography. Current methods typically produce skeleton keypoint sequences instead of dance videos and lack the capability to make specific individuals dance, which reduces their real-world applicability. These methods also require precise keypoint annotations, complicating data collection and limiting the use of self-collected video datasets. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel task: generating dance videos directly from images of individuals guided by music. This task enables the dance generation of specific individuals without requiring keypoint annotations, making it more versatile and applicable to various situations. Our solution, the Dance Any Beat Diffusion model (DabFusion), utilizes a reference image and a music piece to generate dance videos featuring various dance types and choreographies. The music is analyzed by our specially designed music encoder, which identifies essential features including dance style, movement, and rhythm. DabFusion excels in generating dance videos not only for individuals in the training dataset but also for any previously unseen person. This versatility stems from its approach of generating latent optical flow, which contains all necessary motion information to animate any person in the image. We evaluate DabFusion's performance using the AIST++ dataset, focusing on video quality, audio-video synchronization, and motion-music alignment. We propose a 2D Motion-Music Alignment Score (2D-MM Align), which builds on the Beat Alignment Score to more effectively evaluate motion-music alignment for this new task. Experiments show that our DabFusion establishes a solid baseline for this innovative task. Video results can be found on our project page: https://DabFusion.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngkyoung Bae, Yeongwoo Song, Hawoong Jeong</p>
<p>Abstract: Giving up and starting over may seem wasteful in many situations such as searching for a target or training deep neural networks (DNNs). Our study, though, demonstrates that resetting from a checkpoint can significantly improve generalization performance when training DNNs with noisy labels. In the presence of noisy labels, DNNs initially learn the general patterns of the data but then gradually memorize the corrupted data, leading to overfitting. By deconstructing the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we identify the behavior of a latent gradient bias induced by noisy labels, which harms generalization. To mitigate this negative effect, we apply the stochastic resetting method to SGD, inspired by recent developments in the field of statistical physics achieving efficient target searches. We first theoretically identify the conditions where resetting becomes beneficial, and then we empirically validate our theory, confirming the significant improvements achieved by resetting. We further demonstrate that our method is both easy to implement and compatible with other methods for handling noisy labels. Additionally, this work offers insights into the learning dynamics of DNNs from an interpretability perspective, expanding the potential to analyze training methods through the lens of statistical physics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Yeung, Andrew F. Luo, Gabriel Sarch, Margaret M. Henderson, Deva Ramanan, Michael J. Tarr</p>
<p>Abstract: While computer vision models have made incredible strides in static image recognition, they still do not match human performance in tasks that require the understanding of complex, dynamic motion. This is notably true for real-world scenarios where embodied agents face complex and motion-rich environments. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art video diffusion models to decouple static image representation from motion generation, enabling us to utilize fMRI brain activity for a deeper understanding of human responses to dynamic visual stimuli. Conversely, we also demonstrate that information about the brain's representation of motion can enhance the prediction of optical flow in artificial systems. Our novel approach leads to four main findings: (1) Visual motion, represented as fine-grained, object-level resolution optical flow, can be decoded from brain activity generated by participants viewing video stimuli; (2) Video encoders outperform image-based models in predicting video-driven brain activity; (3) Brain-decoded motion signals enable realistic video reanimation based only on the initial frame of the video; and (4) We extend prior work to achieve full video decoding from video-driven brain activity. This framework advances our understanding of how the brain represents spatial and temporal information in dynamic visual scenes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining brain imaging with video diffusion models for developing more robust and biologically-inspired computer vision systems.

Numerical differentiation using the finite-difference (FD) method is efficient in physics-constrained designs, even in parameterized settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johan Obando-Ceron, Jo\~ao G. M. Ara\'ujo, Aaron Courville, Pablo Samuel Castro</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has achieved tremendous success on various domains through a combination of algorithmic design and careful selection of hyper-parameters. Algorithmic improvements are often the result of iterative enhancements built upon prior approaches, while hyper-parameter choices are typically inherited from previous methods or fine-tuned specifically for the proposed technique. Despite their crucial impact on performance, hyper-parameter choices are frequently overshadowed by algorithmic advancements. This paper conducts an extensive empirical study focusing on the reliability of hyper-parameter selection for value-based deep reinforcement learning agents, including the introduction of a new score to quantify the consistency and reliability of various hyper-parameters. Our findings not only help establish which hyper-parameters are most critical to tune, but also help clarify which tunings remain consistent across different training regimes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christof Tinnes, Alisa Welter, Sven Apel</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling structure and behavior of software systems plays a crucial role in the industrial practice of software engineering. As with other software engineering artifacts, software models are subject to evolution. Supporting modelers in evolving software models with recommendations for model completions is still an open problem, though. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language models for this task. In particular, we propose an approach, RAMC, leveraging large language models, model histories, and retrieval-augmented generation for model completion. Through experiments on three datasets, including an industrial application, one public open-source community dataset, and one controlled collection of simulated model repositories, we evaluate the potential of large language models for model completion with RAMC. We found that large language models are indeed a promising technology for supporting software model evolution (62.30% semantically correct completions on real-world industrial data and up to 86.19% type-correct completions). The general inference capabilities of large language models are particularly useful when dealing with concepts for which there are few, noisy, or no examples at all.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luke Bhan, Yuanyuan Shi, Miroslav Krstic</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural operator approximations of the gain kernels in PDE backstepping has emerged as a viable method for implementing controllers in real time. With such an approach, one approximates the gain kernel, which maps the plant coefficient into the solution of a PDE, with a neural operator. It is in adaptive control that the benefit of the neural operator is realized, as the kernel PDE solution needs to be computed online, for every updated estimate of the plant coefficient. We extend the neural operator methodology from adaptive control of a hyperbolic PDE to adaptive control of a benchmark parabolic PDE (a reaction-diffusion equation with a spatially-varying and unknown reaction coefficient). We prove global stability and asymptotic regulation of the plant state for a Lyapunov design of parameter adaptation. The key technical challenge of the result is handling the 2D nature of the gain kernels and proving that the target system with two distinct sources of perturbation terms, due to the parameter estimation error and due to the neural approximation error, is Lyapunov stable. To verify our theoretical result, we present simulations achieving calculation speedups up to 45x relative to the traditional finite difference solvers for every timestep in the simulation trajectory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zesen Liu, Tianshuo Cong, Xinlei He, Qi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various applications, including text generation and complex tasks. However, the misuse of LLMs raises concerns about the authenticity and ethical implications of the content they produce, such as deepfake news, academic fraud, and copyright infringement. Watermarking techniques, which embed identifiable markers in machine-generated text, offer a promising solution to these issues by allowing for content verification and origin tracing. Unfortunately, the robustness of current LLM watermarking schemes under potential watermark removal attacks has not been comprehensively explored.
  In this paper, to fill this gap, we first systematically comb the mainstream watermarking schemes and removal attacks on machine-generated texts, and then we categorize them into pre-text (before text generation) and post-text (after text generation) classes so that we can conduct diversified analyses. In our experiments, we evaluate eight watermarks (five pre-text, three post-text) and twelve attacks (two pre-text, ten post-text) across 87 scenarios. Evaluation results indicate that (1) KGW and Exponential watermarks offer high text quality and watermark retention but remain vulnerable to most attacks; (2) Post-text attacks are found to be more efficient and practical than pre-text attacks; (3) Pre-text watermarks are generally more imperceptible, as they do not alter text fluency, unlike post-text watermarks; (4) Additionally, combined attack methods can significantly increase effectiveness, highlighting the need for more robust watermarking solutions. Our study underscores the vulnerabilities of current techniques and the necessity for developing more resilient schemes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingru Li, Jiawei Xu, Baoxiang Wang, Zhi-Quan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Scalable exploration in high-dimensional, complex environments is a significant challenge in sequential decision making, especially when utilizing neural networks. Ensemble sampling, a practical approximation of Thompson sampling, is widely adopted but often suffers performance degradation due to {ensemble coupling} in shared layer architectures, leading to reduced diversity and ineffective exploration. In this paper, we introduce Ensemble++, a novel method that addresses these challenges through architectural and algorithmic innovations. To prevent ensemble coupling, Ensemble++ decouples mean and uncertainty estimation by separating the base network and ensemble components, employs a symmetrized loss function and the stop-gradient operator. To further enhance exploration, it generates richer hypothesis spaces through random linear combinations of ensemble components using continuous index sampling. Theoretically, we prove that Ensemble++ matches the regret bounds of exact Thompson sampling in linear contextual bandits while maintaining a scalable per-step computational complexity of $\tilde{O}( \log T)$. This provides the first rigorous analysis demonstrating that ensemble sampling can be an scalable and effective approximation to Thompson Sampling, closing a key theoretical gap in exploration efficiency. Empirically, we demonstrate Ensemble++'s effectiveness in both regret minimization and computational efficiency across a range of nonlinear bandit environments, including a language-based contextual bandits where the agents employ GPT backbones. Our results highlight the capability of Ensemble++ for real-time adaptation in complex environments where computational and data collection budgets are constrained. \url{https://github.com/szrlee/Ensemble_Plus_Plus}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Wang, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer vision (CV) is one of the most crucial fields in artificial intelligence. In recent years, a variety of deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers have been designed to tackle diverse problems in CV. These algorithms have found practical applications in areas such as robotics and facial recognition. Despite the increasing power of current CV models, several fundamental questions remain unresolved: Why do CNNs require deep layers? What ensures the generalization ability of CNNs? Why do residual-based networks outperform fully convolutional networks like VGG? What is the fundamental difference between residual-based CNNs and Transformer-based networks? Why can CNNs utilize LoRA and pruning techniques? The root cause of these questions lies in the lack of a robust theoretical foundation for deep learning models in CV. To address these critical issues and techniques, we employ the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT) to provide a theoretical basis for convolution- and Transformer-based models in CV. By doing so, we aim to elucidate these questions from a theoretical perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Wang, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly evolving towards training large models with big data, a method that has demonstrated superior performance across many tasks. However, this approach introduces an urgent problem: current deep learning models are predominantly serial, meaning that as the number of network layers increases, so do the training and inference times. This is unacceptable if deep learning is to continue advancing. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning parallelization strategy based on the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT). From this foundation, we designed a parallel network called Para-Former to test our theory. Unlike traditional serial models, the inference time of Para-Former does not increase with the number of layers, significantly accelerating the inference speed of multi-layer networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this network.</p>

<p>Abstract: Empirical data can often be considered as samples from a set of probability distributions. Kernel methods have emerged as a natural approach for learning to classify these distributions. Although numerous kernels between distributions have been proposed, applying kernel methods to distribution regression tasks remains challenging, primarily because selecting a suitable kernel is not straightforward. Surprisingly, the question of learning a data-dependent distribution kernel has received little attention. In this paper, we propose a novel objective for the unsupervised learning of data-dependent distribution kernel, based on the principle of entropy maximization in the space of probability measure embeddings. We examine the theoretical properties of the latent embedding space induced by our objective, demonstrating that its geometric structure is well-suited for solving downstream discriminative tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the learned kernel across different modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengkang Hu, Pu Zhao, Can Xu, Qingfeng Sun, Jianguang Lou, Qingwei Lin, Ping Luo, Saravan Rajmohan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model-based agents have garnered significant attention and are becoming increasingly popular. Furthermore, planning ability is a crucial component of an LLM-based agent, which generally entails achieving a desired goal from an initial state. This paper investigates enhancing the planning abilities of LLMs through instruction tuning, referred to as agent training. Recent studies have demonstrated that utilizing expert-level trajectory for instruction-tuning LLMs effectively enhances their planning capabilities. However, existing work primarily focuses on synthesizing trajectories from manually designed planning tasks and environments. The labor-intensive nature of creating these environments and tasks impedes the generation of sufficiently varied and extensive trajectories. To address this limitation, this paper explores the automated synthesis of diverse environments and a gradual range of planning tasks, from easy to difficult. We introduce a framework, AgentGen, that leverages LLMs first to generate environments and subsequently generate planning tasks conditioned on these environments. Specifically, to improve environmental diversity, we propose using an inspiration corpus composed of various domain-specific text segments as the context for synthesizing environments. Moreover, to increase the difficulty diversity of generated planning tasks, we propose a bidirectional evolution method, Bi-Evol, that evolves planning tasks from easier and harder directions to synthesize a task set with a smoother difficulty curve. The evaluation results derived from AgentBoard show that AgentGen greatly improves LLMs' planning ability, e.g., the AgentGen instruction-tuned Llama-3.1-8B surpasses GPT-3.5 in overall performance. Moreover, the AgentGen-tuned Llama-3.1-70B model achieves state-of-the-art results in planning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulei Qin, Yuncheng Yang, Pengcheng Guo, Gang Li, Hang Shao, Yuchen Shi, Zihan Xu, Yun Gu, Ke Li, Xing Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning plays a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Despite the vast amount of open instruction datasets, naively training a LLM on all existing instructions may not be optimal and practical. To pinpoint the most beneficial datapoints, data assessment and selection methods have been proposed in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. However, under the context of instruction tuning, there still exists a gap in knowledge on what kind of data evaluation metrics can be employed and how they can be integrated into the selection mechanism. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive review on existing literature of data assessment and selection especially for instruction tuning of LLMs. We systematically categorize all applicable methods into quality-based, diversity-based, and importance-based ones where a unified, fine-grained taxonomy is structured. For each category, representative methods are elaborated to describe the landscape of relevant research. In addition, comparison between the latest methods is conducted on their officially reported results to provide in-depth discussions on their limitations. Finally, we summarize the open challenges and propose the promosing avenues for future studies. All related contents are available at https://github.com/yuleiqin/fantastic-data-engineering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mike Thelwall</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating the quality of academic journal articles is a time consuming but critical task for national research evaluation exercises, appointments and promotion. It is therefore important to investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can play a role in this process. This article assesses which ChatGPT inputs (full text without tables, figures and references; title and abstract; title only) produce better quality score estimates, and the extent to which scores are affected by ChatGPT models and system prompts. The results show that the optimal input is the article title and abstract, with average ChatGPT scores based on these (30 iterations on a dataset of 51 papers) correlating at 0.67 with human scores, the highest ever reported. ChatGPT 4o is slightly better than 3.5-turbo (0.66), and 4o-mini (0.66). The results suggest that article full texts might confuse LLM research quality evaluations, even though complex system instructions for the task are more effective than simple ones. Thus, whilst abstracts contain insufficient information for a thorough assessment of rigour, they may contain strong pointers about originality and significance. Finally, linear regression can be used to convert the model scores into the human scale scores, which is 31% more accurate than guessing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wall Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequence modeling with State Space models (SSMs) has demonstrated performance surpassing that of Transformers in various tasks, raising expectations for their potential to outperform the Decision Transformer and its enhanced variants in offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, decision models based on Mamba, a state-of-the-art SSM, failed to achieve superior performance compared to these enhanced Decision Transformers. We hypothesize that this limitation arises from information loss during the selective scanning phase. To address this, we propose the Decision MetaMamba (DMM), which augments Mamba with a token mixer in its input layer. This mixer explicitly accounts for the multimodal nature of offline RL inputs, comprising state, action, and return-to-go. The DMM demonstrates improved performance while significantly reducing parameter count compared to prior models. Notably, similar performance gains were achieved using a simple linear token mixer, emphasizing the importance of preserving information from proximate time steps rather than the specific design of the token mixer itself. This novel modification to Mamba's input layer represents a departure from conventional timestamp-based encoding approaches used in Transformers. By enhancing performance of Mamba in offline RL, characterized by memory efficiency and fast inference, this work opens new avenues for its broader application in future RL research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuhisa Fujita</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents novel game-playing AI agents based on the AlphaZero framework, enhanced with Vision Transformer (ViT): AlphaViT, AlphaViD, and AlphaVDA. These agents are designed to play multiple board games of various sizes using a single network with shared weights, thereby overcoming AlphaZero's limitation of fixed-board-size constraints. AlphaViT employs only a transformer encoder, whereas AlphaViD and AlphaVDA incorporate both transformer encoders and decoders. In AlphaViD, the decoder processes outputs from the encoder, whereas AlphaVDA uses a learnable embeddings as the decoder input. The additional decoder layers in AlphaViD and AlphaVDA provide flexibility to adapt to various action spaces and board sizes. Experimental results show that the proposed agents, trained on either individual games or multiple games simultaneously, consistently outperform traditional algorithms such as Minimax and Monte Carlo Tree Search and approach the performance of AlphaZero, despite using a single deep neural network (DNN) with shared weights. In particular, AlphaViT shows strong performance across all tested games. Furthermore, fine-tuning the DNN using pre-trained weights from small-board games accelerates convergence and improves performance, particularly in Gomoku. Interestingly, simultaneous training on multiple games yields performance comparable to, or even surpassing, single-game training. These results indicate the potential of transformer-based architectures to develop more flexible and robust game-playing AI agents that excel in multiple games and dynamic environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Hu, Xiangjun Gao, Xiaoyu Li, Sijie Zhao, Xiaodong Cun, Yong Zhang, Long Quan, Ying Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating video depth in open-world scenarios is challenging due to the diversity of videos in appearance, content motion, camera movement, and length. We present DepthCrafter, an innovative method for generating temporally consistent long depth sequences with intricate details for open-world videos, without requiring any supplementary information such as camera poses or optical flow. The generalization ability to open-world videos is achieved by training the video-to-depth model from a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model, through our meticulously designed three-stage training strategy. Our training approach enables the model to generate depth sequences with variable lengths at one time, up to 110 frames, and harvest both precise depth details and rich content diversity from realistic and synthetic datasets. We also propose an inference strategy that can process extremely long videos through segment-wise estimation and seamless stitching. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets reveal that DepthCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-world video depth estimation under zero-shot settings. Furthermore, DepthCrafter facilitates various downstream applications, including depth-based visual effects and conditional video generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable training results by freezing the original weights and training only low-rank matrices, establishing itself as the predominant fine-tuning method for LLMs. Many LoRA variants have emerged, yet they lack a design tailored to the characteristics of LLM weights and fail to leverage the original weights effectively. To address the sparsity of LLM weights, and drawing inspiration from GQA and MQA, we propose Block-Affine Adaptation (Bone), a novel PEFT technique distinct from LoRA. By dividing the original weights into multiple subspaces that share a single matrix for weight updates, Bone simplifies the process by requiring the trainable matrix to be initialized to zero, eliminating the need for complex initialization as in some LoRA variants. Compared to LoRA, Bone significantly reduces memory usage and achieves faster computation. Evaluation of both NLU and NLG tasks demonstrates that Bone substantially outperforms LoRA and its variants. Inspired by Pissa, we propose a new theory called "Weight Guide" to better utilize the information embedded in the original weights. This approach extracts valuable information through a linear transformation of the original weight matrix using a trainable matrix. To validate the effectiveness of "Weight Guide" we combined it with Bone to create a new structure called Block-Affine Transformation (Bat), and ablation experiments confirmed the effectiveness of "Weight Guide".</p>

<p>Abstract: The introduction of Transformers in 2017 reshaped the landscape of deep learning. Originally proposed for sequence modelling, Transformers have since achieved widespread success across various domains. However, the scalability limitations of Transformers - particularly with respect to sequence length - have sparked renewed interest in novel recurrent models that are parallelizable during training, offer comparable performance, and scale more effectively. In this work, we revisit sequence modelling from a historical perspective, focusing on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which dominated the field for two decades before the rise of Transformers. Specifically, we examine LSTMs (1997) and GRUs (2014). We demonstrate that by simplifying these models, we can derive minimal versions (minLSTMs and minGRUs) that (1) use fewer parameters than their traditional counterparts, (2) are fully parallelizable during training, and (3) achieve surprisingly competitive performance on a range of tasks, rivalling recent models including Transformers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the quality of a performance evaluation metric is crucial for ensuring that model outputs align with human preferences. However, it remains unclear how well each metric captures the diverse aspects of these preferences, as metrics often excel in one particular area but not across all dimensions. To address this, it is essential to systematically calibrate metrics to specific aspects of human preference, catering to the unique characteristics of each aspect. We introduce MetaMetrics, a calibrated meta-metric designed to evaluate generation tasks across different modalities in a supervised manner. MetaMetrics optimizes the combination of existing metrics to enhance their alignment with human preferences. Our metric demonstrates flexibility and effectiveness in both language and vision downstream tasks, showing significant benefits across various multilingual and multi-domain scenarios. MetaMetrics aligns closely with human preferences and is highly extendable and easily integrable into any application. This makes MetaMetrics a powerful tool for improving the evaluation of generation tasks, ensuring that metrics are more representative of human judgment across diverse contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Barak Gahtan, Robert J. Shahla, Alex M. Bronstein, Reuven Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: QUIC, an increasingly adopted transport protocol, addresses limitations of TCP by offering improved security, performance, and features such as stream multiplexing and connection migration. However, these enhancements also introduce challenges for network operators in monitoring and analyzing web traffic, especially due to QUIC's encryption. Existing datasets are inadequate they are often outdated, lack diversity, anonymize critical information, or exclude essential features like SSL keys-limiting comprehensive research and development in this area. We introduce VisQUIC, a publicly available dataset of over 100,000 labeled QUIC traces with corresponding SSL keys, collected from more than 40,000 websites over four months. By generating visual representations of the traces, we facilitate advanced machine learning (ML) applications and in-depth analysis of encrypted QUIC traffic. To demonstrate the dataset's potential, we estimate the number of HTTP3 request-response pairs in a QUIC connection using only encrypted traffic, achieving up to 92% accuracy. This estimation provides insights into server behavior, client-server interactions, and connection load-crucial for tasks like load balancing and intrusion detection. Our dataset enables comprehensive studies on QUIC and HTTP/3 protocols and supports the development of tools for encrypted traffic analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Cloud, Jacob Goldman-Wetzler, Ev\v{z}en Wybitul, Joseph Miller, Alexander Matt Turner</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks are trained primarily based on their inputs and outputs, without regard for their internal mechanisms. These neglected mechanisms determine properties that are critical for safety, like (i) transparency; (ii) the absence of sensitive information or harmful capabilities; and (iii) reliable generalization of goals beyond the training distribution. To address this shortcoming, we introduce gradient routing, a training method that isolates capabilities to specific subregions of a neural network. Gradient routing applies data-dependent, weighted masks to gradients during backpropagation. These masks are supplied by the user in order to configure which parameters are updated by which data points. We show that gradient routing can be used to (1) learn representations which are partitioned in an interpretable way; (2) enable robust unlearning via ablation of a pre-specified network subregion; and (3) achieve scalable oversight of a reinforcement learner by localizing modules responsible for different behaviors. Throughout, we find that gradient routing localizes capabilities even when applied to a limited, ad-hoc subset of the data. We conclude that the approach holds promise for challenging, real-world applications where quality data are scarce.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiran Wang, Xiaogeng Liu, Chaowei Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we introduce RePD, an innovative attack Retrieval-based Prompt Decomposition framework designed to mitigate the risk of jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs). Despite rigorous pretraining and finetuning focused on ethical alignment, LLMs are still susceptible to jailbreak exploits. RePD operates on a one-shot learning model, wherein it accesses a database of pre-collected jailbreak prompt templates to identify and decompose harmful inquiries embedded within user prompts. This process involves integrating the decomposition of the jailbreak prompt into the user's original query into a one-shot learning example to effectively teach the LLM to discern and separate malicious components. Consequently, the LLM is equipped to first neutralize any potentially harmful elements before addressing the user's prompt in a manner that aligns with its ethical guidelines. RePD is versatile and compatible with a variety of open-source LLMs acting as agents. Through comprehensive experimentation with both harmful and benign prompts, we have demonstrated the efficacy of our proposed RePD in enhancing the resilience of LLMs against jailbreak attacks, without compromising their performance in responding to typical user requests.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with culture-specific knowledge, particularly in languages other than English and in underrepresented cultural contexts. To evaluate their understanding of such knowledge, we introduce WorldCuisines, a massive-scale benchmark for multilingual and multicultural, visually grounded language understanding. This benchmark includes a visual question answering (VQA) dataset with text-image pairs across 30 languages and dialects, spanning 9 language families and featuring over 1 million data points, making it the largest multicultural VQA benchmark to date. It includes tasks for identifying dish names and their origins. We provide evaluation datasets in two sizes (12k and 60k instances) alongside a training dataset (1 million instances). Our findings show that while VLMs perform better with correct location context, they struggle with adversarial contexts and predicting specific regional cuisines and languages. To support future research, we release a knowledge base with annotated food entries and images along with the VQA data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Hoffmann, Kailash Budhathoki, Matthaeus Kleindessner</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolving capabilities of large language models are accompanied by growing sizes and deployment costs, necessitating effective inference optimisation techniques. We propose a novel pruning method utilising centrality measures from graph theory, reducing both the computational requirements and the memory footprint of these models. Specifically, we devise a method for creating a weighted directed acyclical graph representation of multilayer perceptrons to which we apply a modified version of the weighted PageRank centrality measure to compute node importance scores. In combination with uniform pruning this leads to structured sparsity. We call this pruning method MLPRank. Furthermore we introduce an extension to decoder-only transformer models and call it LLMRank. For both variants we demonstrate a strong performance. With MLPRank on average leading to 6.09 % higher accuracy retention than three popular baselines and 13.42 % with LLMRank compared to two popular baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raisa Bentay Hossain, Farid Ahmed, Kazuma Kobayashi, Seid Koric, Diab Abueidda, Syed Bahauddin Alam</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective real-time monitoring is a foundation of digital twin technology, crucial for detecting material degradation and maintaining the structural integrity of nuclear systems to ensure both safety and operational efficiency. Traditional physical sensor systems face limitations such as installation challenges, high costs, and difficulty measuring critical parameters in hard-to-reach or harsh environments, often resulting in incomplete data coverage. Machine learning-driven virtual sensors, integrated within a digital twin framework, offer a transformative solution by enhancing physical sensor capabilities to monitor critical degradation indicators like pressure, velocity, and turbulence. However, conventional machine learning models struggle with real-time monitoring due to the high-dimensional nature of reactor data and the need for frequent retraining. This paper introduces the use of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) as a core component of a digital twin framework to predict key thermal-hydraulic parameters in the hot leg of an AP-1000 Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). DeepONet serves as a dynamic and scalable virtual sensor by accurately mapping the interplay between operational input parameters and spatially distributed system behaviors. In this study, DeepONet is trained with different operational conditions, which relaxes the requirement of continuous retraining, making it suitable for online and real-time prediction components for digital twin. Our results show that DeepONet achieves accurate predictions with low mean squared error and relative L2 error and can make predictions on unknown data 1400 times faster than traditional CFD simulations. This speed and accuracy enable DeepONet to synchronize with the physical system in real-time, functioning as a dynamic virtual sensor that tracks degradation-contributing conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanna Kim, Minkyoo Song, Seung Ho Na, Seungwon Shin, Kimin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have established them as agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with various tools. These LLM agents are often paired with web-based tools, enabling access to diverse sources and real-time information. Although these advancements offer significant benefits across various applications, they also increase the risk of malicious use, particularly in cyberattacks involving personal information. In this work, we investigate the risks associated with misuse of LLM agents in cyberattacks involving personal data. Specifically, we aim to understand: 1) how potent LLM agents can be when directed to conduct cyberattacks, 2) how cyberattacks are enhanced by web-based tools, and 3) how affordable and easy it becomes to launch cyberattacks using LLM agents. We examine three attack scenarios: the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), the generation of impersonation posts, and the creation of spear-phishing emails. Our experiments reveal the effectiveness of LLM agents in these attacks: LLM agents achieved a precision of up to 95.9% in collecting PII, up to 93.9% of impersonation posts created by LLM agents were evaluated as authentic, and the click rate for links in spear phishing emails created by LLM agents reached up to 46.67%. Additionally, our findings underscore the limitations of existing safeguards in contemporary commercial LLMs, emphasizing the urgent need for more robust security measures to prevent the misuse of LLM agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanan Mahammadli, Seyda Bolelli Ertekin</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces SLLMBO, an innovative framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization (HPO), incorporating dynamic search space adaptability, enhanced parameter landscape exploitation, and a hybrid, novel LLM-Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (LLM-TPE) sampler. By addressing limitations in recent fully LLM-based methods and traditional Bayesian Optimization (BO), SLLMBO achieves more robust optimization. This comprehensive benchmarking evaluates multiple LLMs, including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet-3.5, and Gemini-1.5-flash, extending prior work beyond GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and establishing SLLMBO as the first framework to benchmark a diverse set of LLMs for HPO. By integrating LLMs' established strengths in parameter initialization with the exploitation abilities demonstrated in this study, alongside TPE's exploration capabilities, the LLM-TPE sampler achieves a balanced exploration-exploitation trade-off, reduces API costs, and mitigates premature early stoppings for more effective parameter searches. Across 14 tabular tasks in classification and regression, the LLM-TPE sampler outperformed fully LLM-based methods and achieved superior results over BO methods in 9 tasks. Testing early stopping in budget-constrained scenarios further demonstrated competitive performance, indicating that LLM-based methods generally benefit from extended iterations for optimal results. This work lays the foundation for future research exploring open-source LLMs, reproducibility of LLM results in HPO, and benchmarking SLLMBO on complex datasets, such as image classification, segmentation, and machine translation.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLMs have emerged as a promising tool for assisting individuals in diverse text-generation tasks, including job-related texts. However, LLM-generated answers have been increasingly found to exhibit gender bias. This study evaluates three LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude) to conduct a multifaceted audit of LLM-generated interview responses across models, question types, and jobs, and their alignment with two gender stereotypes. Our findings reveal that gender bias is consistent, and closely aligned with gender stereotypes and the dominance of jobs. Overall, this study contributes to the systematic examination of gender bias in LLM-generated interview responses, highlighting the need for a mindful approach to mitigate such biases in related applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Disentanglement, or identifying salient statistically independent factors of the data, is of interest in many areas of machine learning and statistics, such as synthetic data generation with controlled properties, robust classification of features, parsimonious encoding, and improving our understanding of the generative process underlying the data. Disentanglement is observed in several generative paradigms, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks and diffusion models. Particular progress has recently been made in understanding disentanglement in VAEs, where the choice of diagonal posterior covariance matrices is proposed to promote mutual orthogonality between columns of the decoder's Jacobian. We continue this thread to show how such linear independence translates to statistical independence, completing the chain in understanding how the VAE's objective identifies independent components of, or disentangles, the data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuele Peri, Alessio Russo, Gabor Fodor, Pablo Soldati</p>
<p>Abstract: Link adaptation (LA) is an essential function in modern wireless communication systems that dynamically adjusts the transmission rate of a communication link to match time- and frequency-varying radio link conditions. However, factors such as user mobility, fast fading, imperfect channel quality information, and aging of measurements make the modeling of LA challenging. To bypass the need for explicit modeling, recent research has introduced online reinforcement learning (RL) approaches as an alternative to the more commonly used rule-based algorithms. Yet, RL-based approaches face deployment challenges, as training in live networks can potentially degrade real-time performance. To address this challenge, this paper considers offline RL as a candidate to learn LA policies with minimal effects on the network operation. We propose three LA designs based on batch-constrained deep Q-learning, conservative Q-learning, and decision transformer. Our results show that offline RL algorithms can match the performance of state-of-the-art online RL methods when data is collected with a proper behavioral policy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Social choice theory is the study of preference aggregation across a population, used both in mechanism design for human agents and in the democratic alignment of language models. In this study, we propose the representative social choice framework for the modeling of democratic representation in collective decisions, where the number of issues and individuals are too large for mechanisms to consider all preferences directly. These scenarios are widespread in real-world decision-making processes, such as jury trials, indirect elections, legislation processes, corporate governance, and, more recently, language model alignment. In representative social choice, the population is represented by a finite sample of individual-issue pairs based on which social choice decisions are made. We show that many of the deepest questions in representative social choice can be naturally formulated as statistical learning problems, and prove the generalization properties of social choice mechanisms using the theory of machine learning. We further formulate axioms for representative social choice, and prove Arrow-like impossibility theorems with new combinatorial tools of analysis. Our framework introduces the representative approach to social choice, opening up research directions at the intersection of social choice, learning theory, and AI alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiong Wang, Yangze Li, Chaoyou Fu, Yunhang Shen, Lei Xie, Ke Li, Xing Sun, Long Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapidly developing large language models (LLMs) have brought tremendous intelligent applications. Especially, the GPT-4o's excellent duplex speech interaction ability has brought impressive experience to users. Researchers have recently proposed several multi-modal LLMs in this direction that can achieve user-agent speech-to-speech conversations. This paper proposes a novel speech-text multimodal LLM architecture called Freeze-Omni. Our main contribution is that the speech input and output modalities can be easily connected to a textual LLM while keeping the LLM's parameters frozen throughout the training process. We design a three-stage training strategy for modeling both the speech input and output, enabling Freeze-Omni to obtain speech-to-speech conversation ability using text-speech paired data (such as ASR and TTS data) and only 60,000 multi-round text Q&A data on 8 GPUs. Moreover, we can effectively ensure that the intelligence of the Freeze-Omni in the speech modality is at the same level compared with that in the text modality of its backbone LLM, while achieving low latency end-to-end spoken response. In addition, we also designed a method to achieve duplex dialogue ability through multi-task training, giving Freeze-Omni a more natural style of dialogue ability between users and agents. In summary, Freeze-Omni holds great potential to conduct speech-to-speech dialogue based on a multimodal LLM under the condition of a frozen LLM, avoiding the catastrophic forgetting problem caused by limited data and training resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alain Andres, Aitor Martinez-Seras, Ibai La\~na, Javier Del Ser</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of human-machine interaction, artificial intelligence has become a powerful tool for accelerating data modeling tasks. Object detection methods have achieved outstanding results and are widely used in critical domains like autonomous driving and video surveillance. However, their adoption in high-risk applications, where errors may cause severe consequences, remains limited. Explainable Artificial Intelligence methods aim to address this issue, but many existing techniques are model-specific and designed for classification tasks, making them less effective for object detection and difficult for non-specialists to interpret. In this work we focus on model-agnostic explainability methods for object detection models and propose D-MFPP, an extension of the Morphological Fragmental Perturbation Pyramid (MFPP) technique based on segmentation-based masks to generate explanations. Additionally, we introduce D-Deletion, a novel metric combining faithfulness and localization, adapted specifically to meet the unique demands of object detectors. We evaluate these methods on real-world industrial and robotic datasets, examining the influence of parameters such as the number of masks, model size, and image resolution on the quality of explanations. Our experiments use single-stage object detection models applied to two safety-critical robotic environments: i) a shared human-robot workspace where safety is of paramount importance, and ii) an assembly area of battery kits, where safety is critical due to the potential for damage among high-risk components. Our findings evince that D-Deletion effectively gauges the performance of explanations when multiple elements of the same class appear in a scene, while D-MFPP provides a promising alternative to D-RISE when fewer masks are used.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonggeun Han, Sehwan Kim, Hyungjun Joo, Sangwoo Hong, Jungwoo Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) are prone to be biased towards spurious correlations between target labels and bias attributes, which leads to poor performance on data groups lacking spurious correlations. It is particularly challenging to address this problem when access to bias labels is not permitted. To mitigate the effect of spurious correlations without bias labels, we first introduce a novel training objective designed to robustly enhance model performance across all data samples, irrespective of the presence of spurious correlations. From this objective, we then derive a debiasing method, Disagreement Probability based Resampling for debiasing (DPR), which does not require bias labels. DPR leverages the disagreement between the target label and the prediction of a biased model to identify bias-conflicting samples-those without spurious correlations-and upsamples them according to the disagreement probability. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DPR achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines that do not use bias labels. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis that details how DPR reduces dependency on spurious correlations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianyi Zhang, Da-Cheng Juan, Cyrus Rashtchian, Chun-Sung Ferng, Heinrich Jiang, Yiran Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their outputs can sometimes be unreliable or factually incorrect. To address this, we introduce Self Logits Evolution Decoding (SLED), a novel decoding framework that enhances the truthfulness of LLMs without relying on external knowledge bases or requiring further fine-tuning. From an optimization perspective, our SLED framework leverages the latent knowledge embedded within the LLM by contrasting the output logits from the final layer with those from early layers. It then utilizes an approximate gradient approach to enable latent knowledge to guide the self-refinement of outputs, thereby effectively improving factual accuracy. Extensive experiments have been conducted on established benchmarks across a diverse range of model families (LLaMA 2, LLaMA 3, Gemma) and scales (from 2B to 70B), including more advanced architectural configurations such as the mixture of experts (MoE). Our evaluation spans a wide variety of tasks, including multi-choice, open-generation, and adaptations to chain-of-thought reasoning tasks. The results demonstrate that SLED consistently improves factual accuracy by up to 20\% compared to existing decoding methods while maintaining natural language fluency and negligible latency overhead. Furthermore, it can be flexibly combined with other decoding methods to further enhance their performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel J. Bell, Skyler Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning correlations from data forms the foundation of today's machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) research. While such an approach enables the automatic discovery of patterned relationships within big data corpora, it is susceptible to failure modes when unintended correlations are captured. This vulnerability has expanded interest in interrogating spuriousness, often critiqued as an impediment to model performance, fairness, and robustness. In this article, we trace deviations from the conventional definition of statistical spuriousness-which denotes a non-causal observation arising from either coincidence or confounding variables-to articulate how ML researchers make sense of spuriousness in practice. Drawing on a broad survey of ML literature, we conceptualize the "multiple dimensions of spuriousness," encompassing: relevance ("Models should only use correlations that are relevant to the task."), generalizability ("Models should only use correlations that generalize to unseen data"), human-likeness ("Models should only use correlations that a human would use to perform the same task"), and harmfulness ("Models should only use correlations that are not harmful"). These dimensions demonstrate that ML spuriousness goes beyond the causal/non-causal dichotomy and that the disparate interpretative paths researchers choose could meaningfully influence the trajectory of ML development. By underscoring how a fundamental problem in ML is contingently negotiated in research contexts, we contribute to ongoing debates about responsible practices in AI development.</p>

This information not only improves the accuracy of deep learning models for X-ray analysis but also their interpretability, enhancing transparency in decision-making. However, the current eye-tracking data is dispersed, unprocessed, and ambiguous, making it difficult to derive meaningful insights. Therefore, there is a need to create a new dataset with more focus and purposeful eyetracking data, improving its utility for diagnostic applications. In this work, we propose a refinement method inspired by the target-present visual search challenge: there is a specific finding and fixations are guided to locate it. After refining the existing eye-tracking datasets, we transform them into a curated visual search dataset, called GazeSearch, specifically for radiology findings, where each fixation sequence is purposefully aligned to the task of locating a particular finding. Subsequently, we introduce a scan path prediction baseline, called ChestSearch, specifically tailored to GazeSearch. Finally, we employ the newly introduced GazeSearch as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of current state-of-the-art methods, offering a comprehensive assessment for visual search in the medical imaging domain.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangfan Yang, Junkai Ji, Shan He, Jianqiang Li, Tiantian He, Ruibin Bai, Zexuan Zhu, Yew Soon Ong</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial a crucial step in drug development, which enables the virtual screening of compound libraries to identify potential ligands that target proteins of interest. However, the computational complexity of traditional docking models increases as the size of the compound library increases. Recently, deep learning algorithms can provide data-driven research and development models to increase the speed of the docking process. Unfortunately, few models can achieve superior screening performance compared to that of traditional models. Therefore, a novel deep learning-based docking approach named Dockformer is introduced in this study. Dockformer leverages multimodal information to capture the geometric topology and structural knowledge of molecules and can directly generate binding conformations with the corresponding confidence measures in an end-to-end manner. The experimental results show that Dockformer achieves success rates of 90.53% and 82.71% on the PDBbind core set and PoseBusters benchmarks, respectively, and more than a 100-fold increase in the inference process speed, outperforming almost all state-of-the-art docking methods. In addition, the ability of Dockformer to identify the main protease inhibitors of coronaviruses is demonstrated in a real-world virtual screening scenario. Considering its high docking accuracy and screening efficiency, Dockformer can be regarded as a powerful and robust tool in the field of drug design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Constantin Ulrich, Tassilo Wald, Emily Tempus, Maximilian Rokuss, Paul F. Jaeger, Klaus Maier-Hein</p>
<p>Abstract: Current interactive segmentation approaches, inspired by the success of META's Segment Anything model, have achieved notable advancements, however, they come with substantial limitations that hinder their practical application in 3D radiological scenarios. These include unrealistic human interaction requirements, such as slice-by-slice operations for 2D models on 3D data, a lack of iterative interactive refinement, and insufficient evaluation experiments. These shortcomings prevent accurate assessment of model performance and lead to inconsistent outcomes across studies. The RadioActive benchmark overcomes these challenges by offering a comprehensive and reproducible evaluation of interactive segmentation methods in realistic, clinically relevant scenarios. It includes diverse datasets, target structures, and interactive segmentation methods, and provides a flexible, extendable codebase that allows seamless integration of new models and prompting strategies. We also introduce advanced prompting techniques to enable 2D models on 3D data by reducing the needed number of interaction steps, enabling a fair comparison. We show that surprisingly the performance of slice-wise prompted approaches can match native 3D methods, despite the domain gap. Our findings challenge the current literature and highlight that models not specifically trained on medical data can outperform the current specialized medical methods. By open-sourcing RadioActive, we invite the research community to integrate their models and prompting techniques, ensuring continuous and transparent evaluation of interactive segmentation models in 3D medical imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao-Qi Han, Xin-De Wang, Meng-Yuan Xu, Zhen Feng, Bo-Wen Yao, Peng-Jie Guo, Ze-Feng Gao, Zhong-Yi Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: The discovery of advanced materials is the cornerstone of human technological development and progress. The structures of materials and their corresponding properties are essentially the result of a complex interplay of multiple degrees of freedom such as lattice, charge, spin, symmetry, and topology. This poses significant challenges for the inverse design methods of materials. Humans have long explored new materials through a large number of experiments and proposed corresponding theoretical systems to predict new material properties and structures. With the improvement of computational power, researchers have gradually developed various electronic structure calculation methods, such as the density functional theory and high-throughput computational methods. Recently, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of computer science has enabled the effective characterization of the implicit association between material properties and structures, thus opening up an efficient paradigm for the inverse design of functional materials. A significant progress has been made in inverse design of materials based on generative and discriminative models, attracting widespread attention from researchers. Considering this rapid technological progress, in this survey, we look back on the latest advancements in AI-driven inverse design of materials by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream technological development routes. In addition, we summarize the remaining issues for future directions. This survey provides the latest overview of AI-driven inverse design of materials, which can serve as a useful resource for researchers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Hu, Ke Wang, Xiaokang Zhang, Fanjin Zhang, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen, Jing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by unifying tasks into text generation, yet their large parameter sizes and autoregressive nature limit inference speed. SAM-Decoding addresses this by introducing a novel retrieval-based speculative decoding method that uses a suffix automaton for efficient and accurate draft generation. Unlike n-gram matching used by the existing method, SAM-Decoding finds the longest suffix match in generating text and text corpuss, achieving an average time complexity of $O(1)$ per generation step. SAM-Decoding constructs static and dynamic suffix automatons for the text corpus and input prompts, respectively, enabling fast and precise draft generation. Meanwhile, it is designed as an approach that can be combined with existing methods, allowing SAM-Decoding to adaptively select a draft generation strategy based on the matching length, thus increasing the inference speed of the LLM. When combined with Token Recycling, evaluations show SAM-Decoding outperforms existing model-free methods, achieving a speedup of $2.27\times$ over autoregressive decoding on Spec-Bench. When combined with EAGLE2, it reaches a speedup of $2.49\times$, surpassing all current approaches. Our code is available at https://github.com/hyx1999/SAM-Decoding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Model evolution enables learning from feedback to refine experiences and update skills, transforming models from having no domain knowledge to becoming domain experts. However, there is currently no unified and effective method for guiding this evolutionary process. To address this gap, we propose the Meteor method, which includes three training phases: weak-to-strong data distillation, iterative training, and self-evolution strategies. Each phase maximizes the model's inherent domain capabilities, allowing it to autonomously refine its domain knowledge and enhance performance. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy, completeness, relevance, coherence, and reliability across domain-specific tasks.</p>

While general VLMs, such as GPT-4V, demonstrate strong performance across various tasks, their proficiency in GUI grounding remains suboptimal. Recent studies have focused on fine-tuning these models specifically for one-shot GUI grounding, yielding significant improvements over baseline performance. We introduce a visual prompting framework that employs an iterative narrowing mechanism to improve the performance of both general and fine-tuned models in GUI grounding by up to 61%. For evaluation, we tested our method on a comprehensive benchmark comprising various UI platforms and provided the code to reproduce our results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuewu Lin, Tianwei Lin, Lichao Huang, Hongyu Xie, Zhizhong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: In embodied intelligence systems, a key component is 3D perception algorithm, which enables agents to understand their surrounding environments. Previous algorithms primarily rely on point cloud, which, despite offering precise geometric information, still constrain perception performance due to inherent sparsity, noise, and data scarcity. In this work, we introduce a novel image-centric 3D perception model, BIP3D, which leverages expressive image features with explicit 3D position encoding to overcome the limitations of point-centric methods. Specifically, we leverage pre-trained 2D vision foundation models to enhance semantic understanding, and introduce a spatial enhancer module to improve spatial understanding. Together, these modules enable BIP3D to achieve multi-view, multi-modal feature fusion and end-to-end 3D perception. In our experiments, BIP3D outperforms current state-of-the-art results on the EmbodiedScan benchmark, achieving improvements of 5.69% in the 3D detection task and 15.25% in the 3D visual grounding task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Silin Zhou, Shuo Shang, Lisi Chen, Christian S. Jensen, Panos Kalnis</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory representation learning (TRL) maps trajectories to vectors that can then be used for various downstream tasks, including trajectory similarity computation, trajectory classification, and travel-time estimation. However, existing TRL methods often produce vectors that, when used in downstream tasks, yield insufficiently accurate results. A key reason is that they fail to utilize the comprehensive information encompassed by trajectories. We propose a self-supervised TRL framework, called RED, which effectively exploits multiple types of trajectory information. Overall, RED adopts the Transformer as the backbone model and masks the constituting paths in trajectories to train a masked autoencoder (MAE). In particular, RED considers the moving patterns of trajectories by employing a Road-aware masking strategy} that retains key paths of trajectories during masking, thereby preserving crucial information of the trajectories. RED also adopts a spatial-temporal-user joint Embedding scheme to encode comprehensive information when preparing the trajectories as model inputs. To conduct training, RED adopts Dual-objective task learning}: the Transformer encoder predicts the next segment in a trajectory, and the Transformer decoder reconstructs the entire trajectory. RED also considers the spatial-temporal correlations of trajectories by modifying the attention mechanism of the Transformer. We compare RED with 9 state-of-the-art TRL methods for 4 downstream tasks on 3 real-world datasets, finding that RED can usually improve the accuracy of the best-performing baseline by over 5%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anxhelo Diko, Antonino Furnari, Luigi Cinque, Giovanni Maria Farinella</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation remains a critical challenge in enabling the knowledge transfer of models across unseen domains. Existing methods struggle to balance the need for domain-invariant representations with preserving domain-specific features, which is often due to alignment approaches that impose the projection of samples with similar semantics close in the latent space despite their drastic domain differences. We introduce LAGUNA - LAnguage Guided UNsupervised Adaptation with structured spaces, a novel approach that shifts the focus from aligning representations in absolute coordinates to aligning the relative positioning of equivalent concepts in latent spaces. LAGUNA defines a domain-agnostic structure upon the semantic/geometric relationships between class labels in language space and guides adaptation, ensuring that the organization of samples in visual space reflects reference inter-class relationships while preserving domain-specific characteristics. We empirically demonstrate LAGUNA's superiority in domain adaptation tasks across four diverse images and video datasets. Remarkably, LAGUNA surpasses previous works in 18 different adaptation scenarios across four diverse image and video datasets with average accuracy improvements of +3.32% on DomainNet, +5.75% in GeoPlaces, +4.77% on GeoImnet, and +1.94% mean class accuracy improvement on EgoExo4D.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shogo Ohmae, Keiko Ohmae</p>
<p>Abstract: AI's significant recent advances using general-purpose circuit computations offer a potential window into how the neocortex and cerebellum of the brain are able to achieve a diverse range of functions across sensory, cognitive, and motor domains, despite their uniform circuit structures. However, comparing the brain and AI is challenging unless clear similarities exist, and past reviews have been limited to comparison of brain-inspired vision AI and the visual neocortex. Here, to enable comparisons across diverse functional domains, we subdivide circuit computation into three elements -- circuit structure, input/outputs, and the learning algorithm -- and evaluate the similarities for each element. With this novel approach, we identify wide-ranging similarities and convergent evolution in the brain and AI, providing new insights into key concepts in neuroscience. Furthermore, inspired by processing mechanisms of AI, we propose a new theory that integrates established neuroscience theories, particularly the theories of internal models and the mirror neuron system. Both the neocortex and cerebellum predict future world events from past information and learn from prediction errors, thereby acquiring models of the world. These models enable three core processes: (1) Prediction -- generating future information, (2) Understanding -- interpreting the external world via compressed and abstracted sensory information, and (3) Generation -- repurposing the future-information generation mechanism to produce other types of outputs. The universal application of these processes underlies the ability of the neocortex and cerebellum to accomplish diverse functions with uniform circuits. Our systematic approach, insights, and theory promise groundbreaking advances in understanding the brain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanjana Ramprasad, Byron C. Wallace</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern LLMs can now produce highly readable abstractive summaries, to the point where traditional automated metrics for evaluating summary quality, such as ROUGE, have become saturated. However, LLMs still sometimes introduce unwanted content into summaries, i.e., information inconsistent with or unsupported by their source. Measuring the occurrence of these often subtle ``hallucinations'' automatically has proved to be challenging. This in turn has motivated development of a variety of metrics intended to measure the factual consistency of generated summaries against their source. But are these approaches measuring what they purport to do? In this work, we stress-test automatic factuality metrics. Specifically, we investigate whether and to what degree superficial attributes of summary texts suffice to predict ``factuality'', finding that a (supervised) model using only such shallow features is reasonably competitive with SOTA factuality scoring methods. We then evaluate how factuality metrics respond to factual corrections in inconsistent summaries and find that only a few show meaningful improvements. In contrast, some metrics are more sensitive to benign, non-factual edits. Motivated by these insights, we show that one can ``game'' (most) automatic factuality metrics, i.e., reliably inflate ``factuality'' scores by appending innocuous sentences to generated summaries. Taken together, our results raise questions about the degree to which we should rely on existing automated factuality metrics and what exactly we want ``factuality metrics'' to measure.</p>

It conducts ethical attacks by designing an identical multi-step prompts that simulates the scenario of "corporate middle managers competing for promotions." The data results show that the guardrails of the above-mentioned LLMs were bypassed and the content of verbal attacks was generated. Claude 3.5 Sonnet's resistance to multi-step jailbreak prompts is more obvious.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noam Rotstein, Gal Yona, Daniel Silver, Roy Velich, David Bensa\"id, Ron Kimmel</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in image editing, driven by image diffusion models, have shown remarkable progress. However, significant challenges remain, as these models often struggle to follow complex edit instructions accurately and frequently compromise fidelity by altering key elements of the original image. Simultaneously, video generation has made remarkable strides, with models that effectively function as consistent and continuous world simulators. In this paper, we propose merging these two fields by utilizing image-to-video models for image editing. We reformulate image editing as a temporal process, using pretrained video models to create smooth transitions from the original image to the desired edit. This approach traverses the image manifold continuously, ensuring consistent edits while preserving the original image's key aspects. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on text-based image editing, demonstrating significant improvements in both edit accuracy and image preservation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Given the advancements in conversational artificial intelligence, the evaluation and assessment of Large Language Models (LLMs) play a crucial role in ensuring optimal performance across various conversational tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study that thoroughly evaluates the capabilities and limitations of five prevalent LLMs: Llama, OPT, Falcon, Alpaca, and MPT. The study encompasses various conversational tasks, including reservation, empathetic response generation, mental health and legal counseling, persuasion, and negotiation. To conduct the evaluation, an extensive test setup is employed, utilizing multiple evaluation criteria that span from automatic to human evaluation. This includes using generic and task-specific metrics to gauge the LMs' performance accurately. From our evaluation, no single model emerges as universally optimal for all tasks. Instead, their performance varies significantly depending on the specific requirements of each task. While some models excel in certain tasks, they may demonstrate comparatively poorer performance in others. These findings emphasize the importance of considering task-specific requirements and characteristics when selecting the most suitable LM for conversational applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongjian Li, Bin Lin, Yang Ye, Liuhan Chen, Xinhua Cheng, Shenghai Yuan, Li Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional latent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration of generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently encoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into multiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly, we thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages multi-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache, which maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference. Compared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior performance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and 4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jordan J. Bird</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of new literature into the English curriculum remains a challenge since educators often lack scalable tools to rapidly evaluate readability and adapt texts for diverse classroom needs. This study proposes to address this gap through a multimodal approach that combines transformer-based text classification with linguistic feature analysis to align texts with UK Key Stages. Eight state-of-the-art Transformers were fine-tuned on segmented text data, with BERT achieving the highest unimodal F1 score of 0.75. In parallel, 500 deep neural network topologies were searched for the classification of linguistic characteristics, achieving an F1 score of 0.392. The fusion of these modalities shows a significant improvement, with every multimodal approach outperforming all unimodal models. In particular, the ELECTRA Transformer fused with the neural network achieved an F1 score of 0.996. Unimodal and multimodal approaches are shown to have statistically significant differences in all validation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) except for inference time. The proposed approach is finally encapsulated in a stakeholder-facing web application, providing non-technical stakeholder access to real-time insights on text complexity, reading difficulty, curriculum alignment, and recommendations for learning age range. The application empowers data-driven decision making and reduces manual workload by integrating AI-based recommendations into lesson planning for English literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gregory Beylkin</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a fast, robust algorithm for applying a matrix transfer function of a linear time invariant system (LTI) in time domain. Computing $L$ states of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) LTI appears to require $L$ matrix-vector multiplications. We demonstrate that, for any finite user-selected accuracy, the number of matrix-vector multiplications can be reduced to $\mathcal{O}\left(\log_{2}L\right)$ (within an $\mathcal{O}\left(L\right)$ algorithm). The algorithm uses an approximation of the rational transfer function in the z-domain by a matrix polynomial of degree $2^{N+1}-1$, where $N$ is chosen to achieve any user-selected accuracy. Importantly, using a cascade implementation in time domain, applying the transfer function requires only $N+1$ matrix-vector multiplications. We note that LTI systems are used in state space models (SSMs) for modeling long range dependencies where $L$ is large. In applications where the state matrix of LTI system is approximated by a structured matrix, the computational cost is further reduced. We briefly describe several structured approximations of matrices that can be used for such purpose.</p>

<p>Abstract: Wearable silent speech systems hold significant potential for restoring communication in patients with speech impairments. However, seamless, coherent speech remains elusive, and clinical efficacy is still unproven. Here, we present an AI-driven intelligent throat (IT) system that integrates throat muscle vibrations and carotid pulse signal sensors with large language model (LLM) processing to enable fluent, emotionally expressive communication. The system utilizes ultrasensitive textile strain sensors to capture high-quality signals from the neck area and supports token-level processing for real-time, continuous speech decoding, enabling seamless, delay-free communication. In tests with five stroke patients with dysarthria, IT's LLM agents intelligently corrected token errors and enriched sentence-level emotional and logical coherence, achieving low error rates (4.2% word error rate, 2.9% sentence error rate) and a 55% increase in user satisfaction. This work establishes a portable, intuitive communication platform for patients with dysarthria with the potential to be applied broadly across different neurological conditions and in multi-language support systems.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18428">MM-Path: Multi-modal, Multi-granularity Path Representation Learning -- Extended Version</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronghui Xu, Hanyin Cheng, Chenjuan Guo, Hongfan Gao, Jilin Hu, Sean Bin Yang, Bin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing effective path representations has become increasingly essential across various fields within intelligent transportation. Although pre-trained path representation learning models have shown improved performance, they predominantly focus on the topological structures from single modality data, i.e., road networks, overlooking the geometric and contextual features associated with path-related images, e.g., remote sensing images. Similar to human understanding, integrating information from multiple modalities can provide a more comprehensive view, enhancing both representation accuracy and generalization. However, variations in information granularity impede the semantic alignment of road network-based paths (road paths) and image-based paths (image paths), while the heterogeneity of multi-modal data poses substantial challenges for effective fusion and utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-modal, Multi-granularity Path Representation Learning Framework (MM-Path), which can learn a generic path representation by integrating modalities from both road paths and image paths. To enhance the alignment of multi-modal data, we develop a multi-granularity alignment strategy that systematically associates nodes, road sub-paths, and road paths with their corresponding image patches, ensuring the synchronization of both detailed local information and broader global contexts. To address the heterogeneity of multi-modal data effectively, we introduce a graph-based cross-modal residual fusion component designed to comprehensively fuse information across different modalities and granularities. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets under two downstream tasks, validating the effectiveness of the proposed MM-Path.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasin I. Tepeli, Mathijs de Wolf, Joana P. Gon\c{c}alves</p>
<p>Abstract: Selection bias poses a critical challenge for fairness in machine learning, as models trained on data that is less representative of the population might exhibit undesirable behavior for underrepresented profiles. Semi-supervised learning strategies like self-training can mitigate selection bias by incorporating unlabeled data into model training to gain further insight into the distribution of the population. However, conventional self-training seeks to include high-confidence data samples, which may reinforce existing model bias and compromise effectiveness. We propose Metric-DST, a diversity-guided self-training strategy that leverages metric learning and its implicit embedding space to counter confidence-based bias through the inclusion of more diverse samples. Metric-DST learned more robust models in the presence of selection bias for generated and real-world datasets with induced bias, as well as a molecular biology prediction task with intrinsic bias. The Metric-DST learning strategy offers a flexible and widely applicable solution to mitigate selection bias and enhance fairness of machine learning models.</p>
