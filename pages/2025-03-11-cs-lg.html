<p>Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of telemedicine and patient messaging through electronic medical portals (patient medical advice requests, or PMARs). While these platforms enhance patient access to healthcare, they have also increased the burden on healthcare providers due to the surge in PMARs. This study seeks to develop an efficient tool for message triaging to reduce physician workload and improve patient-provider communication. We developed OPTIC (Optimizing Patient-Provider Triaging & Improving Communications in Clinical Operations), a powerful message triaging tool that utilizes GPT-4 for data labeling and BERT for model distillation. The study used a dataset of 405,487 patient messaging encounters from Johns Hopkins Medicine between January and June 2020. High-quality labeled data was generated through GPT-4-based prompt engineering, which was then used to train a BERT model to classify messages as "Admin" or "Clinical." The BERT model achieved 88.85% accuracy on the test set validated by GPT-4 labeling, with a sensitivity of 88.29%, specificity of 89.38%, and an F1 score of 0.8842. BERTopic analysis identified 81 distinct topics within the test data, with over 80% accuracy in classifying 58 topics. The system was successfully deployed through Epic's Nebula Cloud Platform, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in healthcare settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Code generation and understanding are critical capabilities for large language models (LLMs). Thus, most LLMs are pretrained and fine-tuned on code data. However, these datasets typically treat code as static strings and rarely exploit the dynamic information about their execution. Building upon previous work on trace modeling, we study Execution Tuning (E.T.), a training procedure in which we explicitly model real-world program execution traces without requiring manual test annotations. We train and evaluate models on different execution trace granularities (line and instruction-level) and strategies on the task of output prediction, obtaining around 80% accuracy on CruxEval and MBPP, and showing the advantages of dynamic scratchpads (i.e., self-contained intermediate computations updated by the model rather than accumulated as a history of past computations) on long executions (up to 14k steps). Finally, we discuss E.T.'s practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prasenjit Dey, Srujana Merugu, Sivaramakrishnan Kaveri</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate and generate non-factual outputs which can undermine user trust. Traditional methods to directly mitigate hallucinations, such as representation editing and contrastive decoding, often require additional training data and involve high implementation complexity. While ensemble-based approaches harness multiple LLMs to tap into the "wisdom of crowds", these methods overlook uncertainties in individual model responses. Recent studies reveal that uncertainty estimation can enable LLMs to self-assess the likelihood of generating hallucinations. In this work, we focus on factoid question answering (QA) and observe that LLMs accuracy and self-assessment capabilities vary widely with different models excelling in different scenarios. Leveraging this insight, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Fusion (UAF), an ensemble framework to reduces hallucinations by strategically combining multiple LLM based on their accuracy and self-assessment abilities. Empirical results on several public benchmark datasets show that UAF outperforms state-of-the-art hallucination mitigation methods by $8\%$ in factual accuracy, while either narrowing or surpassing the performance gap with GPT-4.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05761">Geometric Properties and Graph-Based Optimization of Neural Networks: Addressing Non-Linearity, Dimensionality, and Scalability</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Wienczkowski, Addisu Desta, Paschal Ugochukwu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models are often considered black boxes due to their complex hierarchical transformations. Identifying suitable architectures is crucial for maximizing predictive performance with limited data. Understanding the geometric properties of neural networks involves analyzing their structure, activation functions, and the transformations they perform in high-dimensional space. These properties influence learning, representation, and decision-making. This research explores neural networks through geometric metrics and graph structures, building upon foundational work in arXiv:2007.06559. It addresses the limited understanding of geometric structures governing neural networks, particularly the data manifolds they operate on, which impact classification, optimization, and representation. We identify three key challenges: (1) overcoming linear separability limitations, (2) managing the dimensionality-complexity trade-off, and (3) improving scalability through graph representations. To address these, we propose leveraging non-linear activation functions, optimizing network complexity via pruning and transfer learning, and developing efficient graph-based models. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of neural network geometry, supporting the development of more robust, scalable, and interpretable models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Materials foundation models can predict energy, force, and stress of materials and enable a wide range of downstream discovery tasks. A key design choice involves the trade-off between invariant and equivariant architectures. Invariant models offer computational efficiency but may not perform well when predicting high-order outputs. In contrast, equivariant models can capture high-order symmetries, but are computationally expensive. In this work, we propose HIENet, a hybrid invariant-equivariant foundation model that integrates both invariant and equivariant message passing layers. HIENet is designed to achieve superior performance with considerable computational speedups over prior models. Experimental results on both common benchmarks and downstream materials discovery tasks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of HIENet.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05772">Complex Networks for Pattern-Based Data Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Josimar Chire, Khalid Mahmood, Zhao Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data classification techniques partition the data or feature space into smaller sub-spaces, each corresponding to a specific class. To classify into subspaces, physical features e.g., distance and distributions are utilized. This approach is challenging for the characterization of complex patterns that are embedded in the dataset. However, complex networks remain a powerful technique for capturing internal relationships and class structures, enabling High-Level Classification. Although several complex network-based classification techniques have been proposed, high-level classification by leveraging pattern formation to classify data has not been utilized. In this work, we present two network-based classification techniques utilizing unique measures derived from the Minimum Spanning Tree and Single Source Shortest Path. These network measures are evaluated from the data patterns represented by the inherent network constructed from each class. We have applied our proposed techniques to several data classification scenarios including synthetic and real-world datasets. Compared to the existing classic high-level and machine-learning classification techniques, we have observed promising numerical results for our proposed approaches. Furthermore, the proposed models demonstrate the following distinguished features in comparison to the previous high-level classification techniques: (1) A single network measure is introduced to characterize the data pattern, eliminating the need to determine weight parameters among network measures. Therefore, the model is largely simplified, while obtaining better classification results. (2) The metrics proposed are sensitive and used for classification with competitive results.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05774">GeoJEPA: Towards Eliminating Augmentation- and Sampling Bias in Multimodal Geospatial Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Theodor Lundqvist, Ludvig Delvret</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing methods for self-supervised representation learning of geospatial regions and map entities rely extensively on the design of pretext tasks, often involving augmentations or heuristic sampling of positive and negative pairs based on spatial proximity. This reliance introduces biases and limits the representations' expressiveness and generalisability. Consequently, the literature has expressed a pressing need to explore different methods for modelling geospatial data. To address the key difficulties of such methods, namely multimodality, heterogeneity, and the choice of pretext tasks, we present GeoJEPA, a versatile multimodal fusion model for geospatial data built on the self-supervised Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture. With GeoJEPA, we aim to eliminate the widely accepted augmentation- and sampling biases found in self-supervised geospatial representation learning. GeoJEPA uses self-supervised pretraining on a large dataset of OpenStreetMap attributes, geometries and aerial images. The results are multimodal semantic representations of urban regions and map entities that we evaluate both quantitatively and qualitatively. Through this work, we uncover several key insights into JEPA's ability to handle multimodal data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rania Farjallah, Bassant Selim, Brigitte Jaumard, Samr Ali, Georges Kaddoum</p>
<p>Abstract: The challenge of handling missing data in time series is critical for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of machine learning (ML) models in applications like fifth generation mobile communication (5G) network management. Traditional methods for validating imputation rely on ground truth data, which is inherently unavailable. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing two statistical metrics, the wasserstein distance (WD) and jensen-shannon divergence (JSD), to evaluate imputation quality without requiring ground truth. These metrics assess the alignment between the distributions of imputed and original data, providing a robust method for evaluating imputation performance based on internal structure and data consistency. We apply and test these metrics across several imputation techniques. Results demonstrate that WD and JSD are effective metrics for assessing the quality of missing data imputation, particularly in scenarios where ground truth data is unavailable.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05776">FAA-CLIP: Federated Adversarial Adaptation of CLIP</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihang Wu, Ahmad Chaddad, Christian Desrosiers, Tareef Daqqaq, Reem Kateb</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of vision language models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP), the large size of these models is a considerable obstacle to their use in federated learning (FL) systems where the parameters of local client models need to be transferred to a global server for aggregation. Another challenge in FL is the heterogeneity of data from different clients, which affects the generalization performance of the solution. In addition, natural pre-trained VLMs exhibit poor generalization ability in the medical datasets, suggests there exists a domain gap. To solve these issues, we introduce a novel method for the Federated Adversarial Adaptation (FAA) of CLIP. Our method, named FAA-CLIP, handles the large communication costs of CLIP using a light-weight feature adaptation module (FAM) for aggregation, effectively adapting this VLM to each client's data while greatly reducing the number of parameters to transfer. By keeping CLIP frozen and only updating the FAM parameters, our method is also computationally efficient. Unlike existing approaches, our FAA-CLIP method directly addresses the problem of domain shifts across clients via a domain adaptation (DA) module. This module employs a domain classifier to predict if a given sample is from the local client or the global server, allowing the model to learn domain-invariant representations. Extensive experiments on six different datasets containing both natural and medical images demonstrate that FAA-CLIP can generalize well on both natural and medical datasets compared to recent FL approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tapasvi Panchagnula</p>
<p>Abstract: Dream narratives provide a unique window into human cognition and emotion, yet their systematic analysis using artificial intelligence has been underexplored. We introduce DreamNet, a novel deep learning framework that decodes semantic themes and emotional states from textual dream reports, optionally enhanced with REM-stage EEG data. Leveraging a transformer-based architecture with multimodal attention, DreamNet achieves 92.1% accuracy and 88.4% F1-score in text-only mode (DNet-T) on a curated dataset of 1,500 anonymized dream narratives, improving to 99.0% accuracy and 95.2% F1-score with EEG integration (DNet-M). Strong dream-emotion correlations (e.g., falling-anxiety, r = 0.91, p < 0.01) highlight its potential for mental health diagnostics, cognitive science, and personalized therapy. This work provides a scalable tool, a publicly available enriched dataset, and a rigorous methodology, bridging AI and psychological research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05788">Emergent Abilities in Large Language Models: A Survey</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Berti, Flavio Giorgi, Gjergji Kasneci</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are leading a new technological revolution as one of the most promising research streams toward artificial general intelligence. The scaling of these models, accomplished by increasing the number of parameters and the magnitude of the training datasets, has been linked to various so-called emergent abilities that were previously unobserved. These emergent abilities, ranging from advanced reasoning and in-context learning to coding and problem-solving, have sparked an intense scientific debate: Are they truly emergent, or do they simply depend on external factors, such as training dynamics, the type of problems, or the chosen metric? What underlying mechanism causes them? Despite their transformative potential, emergent abilities remain poorly understood, leading to misconceptions about their definition, nature, predictability, and implications. In this work, we shed light on emergent abilities by conducting a comprehensive review of the phenomenon, addressing both its scientific underpinnings and real-world consequences. We first critically analyze existing definitions, exposing inconsistencies in conceptualizing emergent abilities. We then explore the conditions under which these abilities appear, evaluating the role of scaling laws, task complexity, pre-training loss, quantization, and prompting strategies. Our review extends beyond traditional LLMs and includes Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which leverage reinforcement learning and inference-time search to amplify reasoning and self-reflection. However, emergence is not inherently positive. As AI systems gain autonomous reasoning capabilities, they also develop harmful behaviors, including deception, manipulation, and reward hacking. We highlight growing concerns about safety and governance, emphasizing the need for better evaluation frameworks and regulatory oversight.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zuzanna B\k{a}czek, Micha{\l} Bizo\'n, Aneta Pawelec, Piotr Sankowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Algorithmic solutions have significant potential to improve decision-making across various domains, from healthcare to e-commerce. However, the widespread adoption of these solutions is hindered by a critical challenge: the lack of human-interpretable explanations. Current approaches to Explainable AI (XAI) predominantly focus on complex machine learning models, often producing brittle and non-intuitive explanations. This project proposes a novel approach to developing explainable algorithms by starting with optimization problems, specifically the assignment problem. The developed software library enriches basic algorithms with human-understandable explanations through four key methodologies: generating meaningful alternative solutions, creating robust solutions through input perturbation, generating concise decision trees and providing reports with comprehensive explanation of the results. Currently developed tools are often designed with specific clustering algorithms in mind, which limits their adaptability and flexibility to incorporate alternative techniques. Additionally, many of these tools fail to integrate expert knowledge, which could enhance the clustering process by providing valuable insights and context. This lack of adaptability and integration can hinder the effectiveness and robustness of the clustering outcomes in various applications. The represents a step towards making algorithmic solutions more transparent, trustworthy, and accessible. By collaborating with industry partners in sectors such as sales, we demonstrate the practical relevance and transformative potential of our approach.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05800">How Do Consumers Really Choose: Exposing Hidden Preferences with the Mixture of Experts Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Diego Vallarino</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding consumer choice is fundamental to marketing and management research, as firms increasingly seek to personalize offerings and optimize customer engagement. Traditional choice modeling frameworks, such as multinomial logit (MNL) and mixed logit models, impose rigid parametric assumptions that limit their ability to capture the complexity of consumer decision-making. This study introduces the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework as a machine learning-driven alternative that dynamically segments consumers based on latent behavioral patterns. By leveraging probabilistic gating functions and specialized expert networks, MoE provides a flexible, nonparametric approach to modeling heterogeneous preferences.
  Empirical validation using large-scale retail data demonstrates that MoE significantly enhances predictive accuracy over traditional econometric models, capturing nonlinear consumer responses to price variations, brand preferences, and product attributes. The findings underscore MoEs potential to improve demand forecasting, optimize targeted marketing strategies, and refine segmentation practices. By offering a more granular and adaptive framework, this study bridges the gap between data-driven machine learning approaches and marketing theory, advocating for the integration of AI techniques in managerial decision-making and strategic consumer insights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yash Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning often relies on sharing full or partial model weights, which can burden network bandwidth and raise privacy risks. We present a loss-based alternative using distributed mutual learning. Instead of transmitting weights, clients periodically share their loss predictions on a public test set. Each client then refines its model by combining its local loss with the average Kullback-Leibler divergence over losses from other clients. This collaborative approach both reduces transmission overhead and preserves data privacy. Experiments on a face mask detection task demonstrate that our method outperforms weight-sharing baselines, achieving higher accuracy on unseen data while providing stronger generalization and privacy benefits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dom Huh, Prasant Mohapatra</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a diffusion-based auto-bidding framework that leverages graph representations to model large-scale auction environments. In such settings, agents must dynamically optimize bidding strategies under constraints defined by key performance indicator (KPI) metrics, all while operating in competitive environments characterized by uncertain, sparse, and stochastic variables. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach combining learnable graph-based embeddings with a planning-based latent diffusion model (LDM). By capturing patterns and nuances underlying the interdependence of impression opportunities and the multi-agent dynamics of the auction environment, the graph representation enable expressive computations regarding auto-bidding outcomes. With reward alignment techniques, the LDM's posterior is fine-tuned to generate auto-bidding trajectories that maximize KPI metrics while satisfying constraint thresholds. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and synthetic auction environments demonstrate significant improvements in auto-bidding performance across multiple common KPI metrics, as well as accuracy in forecasting auction outcomes.</p>

To address these limitations, this work proposes the Broad Reaction Set (BRS), a dataset featuring 20 generic reaction templates that allow for the efficient exploration of the chemical space. Additionally, ProPreT5 is introduced, a T5 model tailored to chemistry that achieves a balance between rigid templates and template-free methods. ProPreT5 demonstrates its capability to generate accurate, valid, and realistic reaction products, making it a promising solution that goes beyond the current state-of-the-art on the complex reaction product prediction task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bassel El Mabsout, Abdelrahman AbdelGawad, Renato Mancuso</p>
<p>Abstract: Practitioners designing reinforcement learning policies face a fundamental challenge: translating intended behavioral objectives into representative reward functions. This challenge stems from behavioral intent requiring simultaneous achievement of multiple competing objectives, typically addressed through labor-intensive linear reward composition that yields brittle results. Consider the ubiquitous robotics scenario where performance maximization directly conflicts with energy conservation. Such competitive dynamics are resistant to simple linear reward combinations. In this paper, we present the concept of objective fulfillment upon which we build Fulfillment Priority Logic (FPL). FPL allows practitioners to define logical formula representing their intentions and priorities within multi-objective reinforcement learning. Our novel Balanced Policy Gradient algorithm leverages FPL specifications to achieve up to 500\% better sample efficiency compared to Soft Actor Critic. Notably, this work constitutes the first implementation of non-linear utility scalarization design, specifically for continuous control problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, the random vector functional link (RVFL) network has gained significant popularity in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification due to its simplicity, speed, and strong generalization performance. However, despite these advantages, RVFL models face several limitations, particularly in handling non-linear relationships and complex data structures. The random initialization of input-to-hidden weights can lead to instability, and the model struggles with determining the optimal number of hidden nodes, affecting its performance on more challenging datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel randomized based restricted kernel machine ($R^2KM$) model that combines the strehyperngths of RVFL and restricted kernel machines (RKM). $R^2KM$ introduces a layered structure that represents kernel methods using both visible and hidden variables, analogous to the energy function in restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM). This structure enables $R^2KM$ to capture complex data interactions and non-linear relationships more effectively, improving both interpretability and model robustness. A key contribution of $R^2KM$ is the introduction of a novel conjugate feature duality based on the Fenchel-Young inequality, which expresses the problem in terms of conjugate dual variables and provides an upper bound on the objective function. This duality enhances the model's flexibility and scalability, offering a more efficient and flexible solution for complex data analysis tasks. Extensive experiments on hyperspectral image datasets and real-world data from the UCI and KEEL repositories show that $R^2KM$ outperforms baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in classification and regression tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nils Graef, Andrew Wasielewski</p>
<p>Abstract: Slim attention shrinks the context memory size by 2x for transformer models with MHA (multi-head attention), which can speed up inference by up to 2x for large context windows. Slim attention is an exact, mathematically identical implementation of the standard attention mechanism and therefore does not compromise model accuracy. In other words, slim attention losslessly compresses the context memory by a factor of 2.
  For encoder-decoder transformers, the context memory size can be reduced even further: For the Whisper models for example, slim attention reduces the context memory by 8x, which can speed up token generation by 5x for batch size 64 for example.
  And for rare cases where the MHA projection dimension is larger than the embedding dimension, the memory can be reduced by a factor of 32 for the T5-11B model for example.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Jorgensen, Arthur Y. Lin, Rose K. Cersonsky</p>
<p>Abstract: How do classification models "see" our data? Based on their success in delineating behaviors, there must be some lens through which it is easy to see the boundary between classes; however, our current set of visualization techniques makes this prospect difficult. In this work, we propose a hybrid supervised-unsupervised technique distinctly suited to visualizing the decision boundaries determined by classification problems. This method provides a human-interpretable map that can be analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, which we demonstrate through visualizing and interpreting a decision boundary for chemical neurotoxicity. While we discuss this method in the context of chemistry-driven problems, its application can be generalized across subfields for "unboxing" the operations of machine-learning classification models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ekaterina Redekop, Zichen Wang, Rushikesh Kulkarni, Mara Pleasure, Aaron Chin, Hamid Reza Hassanzadeh, Brian L. Hill, Melika Emami, William Speier, Corey W. Arnold</p>
<p>Abstract: Longitudinal data in electronic health records (EHRs) represent an individual`s clinical history through a sequence of codified concepts, including diagnoses, procedures, medications, and laboratory tests. Foundational models, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPT), can leverage this data to predict future events. While fine-tuning of these models enhances task-specific performance, it is costly, complex, and unsustainable for every target. We show that a foundation model trained on EHRs can perform predictive tasks in a zero-shot manner, eliminating the need for fine-tuning.
  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of zero-shot forecasting with GPT-based foundational models in EHRs, introducing a novel pipeline that formulates medical concept prediction as a generative modeling task. Unlike supervised approaches requiring extensive labeled data, our method enables the model to forecast a next medical event purely from a pretraining knowledge. We evaluate performance across multiple time horizons and clinical categories, demonstrating model`s ability to capture latent temporal dependencies and complex patient trajectories without task supervision.
  Model performance for predicting the next medical concept was evaluated using precision and recall metrics, achieving an average top1 precision of 0.614 and recall of 0.524. For 12 major diagnostic conditions, the model demonstrated strong zero-shot performance, achieving high true positive rates while maintaining low false positives.
  We demonstrate the power of a foundational EHR GPT model in capturing diverse phenotypes and enabling robust, zero-shot forecasting of clinical outcomes. This capability enhances the versatility of predictive healthcare models and reduces the need for task-specific training, enabling more scalable applications in clinical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasir Zubayr Barlas, Kizito Salako</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments in sequential experimental design look to construct a policy that can efficiently navigate the design space, in a way that maximises the expected information gain. Whilst there is work on achieving tractable policies for experimental design problems, there is significantly less work on obtaining policies that are able to generalise well - i.e. able to give good performance despite a change in the underlying statistical properties of the experiments. Conducting experiments sequentially has recently brought about the use of reinforcement learning, where an agent is trained to navigate the design space to select the most informative designs for experimentation. However, there is still a lack of understanding about the benefits and drawbacks of using certain reinforcement learning algorithms to train these agents. In our work, we investigate several reinforcement learning algorithms and their efficacy in producing agents that take maximally informative design decisions in sequential experimental design scenarios. We find that agent performance is impacted depending on the algorithm used for training, and that particular algorithms, using dropout or ensemble approaches, empirically showcase attractive generalisation properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Greg d'Eon, Hala Murad, Kevin Leyton-Brown, James R. Wright</p>
<p>Abstract: Models of human behavior in game-theoretic settings often distinguish between strategic behavior, in which a player both reasons about how others will act and best responds to these beliefs, and "level-0" non-strategic behavior, in which they do not respond to explicit beliefs about others. The state of the art for predicting human behavior on unrepeated simultaneous-move games is GameNet, a neural network that learns extremely complex level-0 specifications from data. The current paper makes three contributions. First, it shows that GameNet's level-0 specifications are too powerful, because they are capable of strategic reasoning. Second, it introduces a novel neural network architecture (dubbed ElementaryNet) and proves that it is only capable of nonstrategic behavior. Third, it describes an extensive experimental evaluation of ElementaryNet. Our overall findings are that (1) ElementaryNet dramatically underperforms GameNet when neither model is allowed to explicitly model higher level agents who best-respond to the model's predictions, indicating that good performance on our dataset requires a model capable of strategic reasoning; (2) that the two models achieve statistically indistinguishable performance when such higher-level agents are introduced, meaning that ElementaryNet's restriction to a non-strategic level-0 specification does not degrade model performance; and (3) that this continues to hold even when ElementaryNet is restricted to a set of level-0 building blocks previously introduced in the literature, with only the functional form being learned by the neural network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ibrahim Elsharkawy, Yonatan Kahn, Benjamin Hooberman</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty from machine learning analyses is critical to their use in the physical sciences. In this work we focus on uncertainty inherited from the initialization distribution of neural networks. We compute the mean $\mu_{\mathcal{L}}$ and variance $\sigma_{\mathcal{L}}^2$ of the test loss $\mathcal{L}$ for an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with neural tangent kernel (NTK) initialization in the infinite-width limit, and compare empirically to the results from finite-width networks for three example tasks: MNIST classification, CIFAR classification and calorimeter energy regression. We observe scaling laws as a function of training set size $N_\mathcal{D}$ for both $\mu_{\mathcal{L}}$ and $\sigma_{\mathcal{L}}$, but find that the coefficient of variation $\epsilon_{\mathcal{L}} \equiv \sigma_{\mathcal{L}}/\mu_{\mathcal{L}}$ becomes independent of $N_\mathcal{D}$ at both infinite and finite width for sufficiently large $N_\mathcal{D}$. This implies that the coefficient of variation of a finite-width network may be approximated by its infinite-width value, and may in principle be calculable using finite-width perturbation theory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mihaela C\u{a}t\u{a}lina Stoian, Eleonora Giunchiglia, Thomas Lukasiewicz</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative modelling has become the standard approach for synthesising tabular data. However, different use cases demand synthetic data to comply with different requirements to be useful in practice. In this survey, we review deep generative modelling approaches for tabular data from the perspective of four types of requirements: utility of the synthetic data, alignment of the synthetic data with domain-specific knowledge, statistical fidelity of the synthetic data distribution compared to the real data distribution, and privacy-preserving capabilities. We group the approaches along two levels of granularity: (i) based on the primary type of requirements they address and (ii) according to the underlying model they utilise. Additionally, we summarise the appropriate evaluation methods for each requirement and the specific characteristics of each model type. Finally, we discuss future directions for the field, along with opportunities to improve the current evaluation methods. Overall, this survey can be seen as a user guide to tabular data generation: helping readers navigate available models and evaluation methods to find those best suited to their needs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luke Guerdan, Solon Barocas, Kenneth Holstein, Hanna Wallach, Zhiwei Steven Wu, Alexandra Chouldechova</p>
<p>Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm, in which a judge LLM system replaces human raters in rating the outputs of other generative AI (GenAI) systems, has come to play a critical role in scaling and standardizing GenAI evaluations. To validate judge systems, evaluators collect multiple human ratings for each item in a validation corpus, and then aggregate the ratings into a single, per-item gold label rating. High agreement rates between these gold labels and judge system ratings are then taken as a sign of good judge system performance. In many cases, however, items or rating criteria may be ambiguous, or there may be principled disagreement among human raters. In such settings, gold labels may not exist for many of the items. In this paper, we introduce a framework for LLM-as-a-judge validation in the absence of gold labels. We present a theoretical analysis drawing connections between different measures of judge system performance under different rating elicitation and aggregation schemes. We also demonstrate empirically that existing validation approaches can select judge systems that are highly suboptimal, performing as much as 34% worse than the systems selected by alternative approaches that we describe. Based on our findings, we provide concrete recommendations for developing more reliable approaches to LLM-as-a-judge validation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beyza Kalkanli, Tales Imbiriba, Stratis Ioannidis, Deniz Erdogmus, Jennifer Dy</p>
<p>Abstract: Active learning aims to efficiently build a labeled training set by strategically selecting samples to query labels from annotators. In this sequential process, each sample acquisition influences subsequent selections, causing dependencies among samples in the labeled set. However, these dependencies are overlooked during the model parameter estimation stage when updating the model using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), a conventional method that assumes independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data. We propose Dependency-aware MLE (DMLE), which corrects MLE within the active learning framework by addressing sample dependencies typically neglected due to the i.i.d. assumption, ensuring consistency with active learning principles in the model parameter estimation process. This improved method achieves superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets, reaching higher performance in earlier cycles compared to conventional MLE. Specifically, we observe average accuracy improvements of 6\%, 8.6\%, and 10.5\% for $k=1$, $k=5$, and $k=10$ respectively, after collecting the first 100 samples, where entropy is the acquisition function and $k$ is the query batch size acquired at every active learning cycle.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Talha Bozkus, Urbashi Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Q-learning is a widely used reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for optimizing wireless networks, but faces challenges with large state-spaces. Recently proposed multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ) algorithm addresses these challenges by employing multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple synthetically generated, distinct but structurally related environments, so-called digital cousins. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ (M-MEMQ) for cooperative decentralized wireless networks with multiple networked transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs). TXs do not have access to global information (joint state and actions). The new concept of coordinated and uncoordinated states is introduced. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs and update local Q-functions. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state and update the joint Q-functions. The cost of information-sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. Several theoretical guarantees, including deterministic and probabilistic convergence, bounds on estimation error variance, and the probability of misdetecting the joint states, are given. Numerical simulations show that M-MEMQ outperforms several decentralized and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms by achieving 55% lower average policy error (APE), 35% faster convergence, 50% reduced runtime complexity, and 45% less sample complexity. Furthermore, M-MEMQ achieves comparable APE with significantly lower complexity than centralized methods. Simulations validate the theoretical analyses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qijun Chen, Shaofan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to climate change, the extreme wildfire has become one of the most dangerous natural hazards to human civilization. Even though, some wildfires may be initially caused by human activity, but the spread of wildfires is mainly determined by environmental factors, for examples, (1) weather conditions such as temperature, wind direction and intensity, and moisture levels; (2) the amount and types of dry vegetation in a local area, and (3) topographic or local terrian conditions, which affects how much rain an area gets and how fire dynamics will be constrained or faciliated. Thus, to accurately forecast wildfire occurrence has become one of most urgent and taunting environmental challenges in global scale. In this work, we developed a real-time Multimodal Transformer Neural Network Machine Learning model that combines several advanced artificial intelligence techniques and statistical methods to practically forecast the occurrence of wildfire at the precise location in real time, which not only utilizes large scale data information such as hourly weather forecasting data, but also takes into account small scale topographical data such as local terrain condition and local vegetation conditions collecting from Google Earth images to determine the probabilities of wildfire occurrence location at small scale as well as their timing synchronized with weather forecast information. By using the wildfire data in the United States from 1992 to 2015 to train the multimodal transformer neural network, it can predict the probabilities of wildfire occurrence according to the real-time weather forecast and the synchronized Google Earth image data to provide the wildfire occurrence probability in any small location ($100m^2$) within 24 hours ahead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Wang, Jiaxin Shi, Nicolas Heess, Arthur Gretton, Michalis K. Titsias</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have become the workhorse for sequence generation tasks, since many problems can be modeled as next-token prediction. While there appears to be a natural ordering for text (i.e., left-to-right), for many data types, such as graphs, the canonical ordering is less obvious. To address this problem, we introduce a variant of ARM that generates high-dimensional data using a probabilistic ordering that is sequentially inferred from data. This model incorporates a trainable probability distribution, referred to as an \emph{order-policy}, that dynamically decides the autoregressive order in a state-dependent manner. To train the model, we introduce a variational lower bound on the exact log-likelihood, which we optimize with stochastic gradient estimation. We demonstrate experimentally that our method can learn meaningful autoregressive orderings in image and graph generation. On the challenging domain of molecular graph generation, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k benchmarks, evaluated using the Fr\'{e}chet ChemNet Distance (FCD).</p>

<p>Abstract: We address the problem of active logistic regression in the realizable setting. It is well known that active learning can require exponentially fewer label queries compared to passive learning, in some cases using $\log \frac{1}{\eps}$ rather than $\poly(1/\eps)$ labels to get error $\eps$ larger than the optimum.
  We present the first algorithm that is polynomially competitive with the optimal algorithm on every input instance, up to factors polylogarithmic in the error and domain size. In particular, if any algorithm achieves label complexity polylogarithmic in $\eps$, so does ours. Our algorithm is based on efficient sampling and can be extended to learn more general class of functions. We further support our theoretical results with experiments demonstrating performance gains for logistic regression compared to existing active learning algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Causal inference and the estimation of causal effects plays a central role in decision-making across many areas, including healthcare and economics. Estimating causal effects typically requires an estimator that is tailored to each problem of interest. But developing estimators can take significant effort for even a single causal inference setting. For example, algorithms for regression-based estimators, propensity score methods, and doubly robust methods were designed across several decades to handle causal estimation with observed confounders. Similarly, several estimators have been developed to exploit instrumental variables (IVs), including two-stage least-squares (TSLS), control functions, and the method-of-moments. In this work, we instead frame causal inference as a dataset-level prediction problem, offloading algorithm design to the learning process. The approach we introduce, called black box causal inference (BBCI), builds estimators in a black-box manner by learning to predict causal effects from sampled dataset-effect pairs. We demonstrate accurate estimation of average treatment effects (ATEs) and conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) with BBCI across several causal inference problems with known identification, including problems with less developed estimators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Calarina Muslimani, Kerrick Johnstonbaugh, Suyog Chandramouli, Serena Booth, W. Bradley Knox, Matthew E. Taylor</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents are fundamentally limited by the quality of the reward functions they learn from, yet reward design is often overlooked under the assumption that a well-defined reward is readily available. However, in practice, designing rewards is difficult, and even when specified, evaluating their correctness is equally problematic: how do we know if a reward function is correctly specified? In our work, we address these challenges by focusing on reward alignment -- assessing whether a reward function accurately encodes the preferences of a human stakeholder. As a concrete measure of reward alignment, we introduce the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient to quantify the similarity between a human stakeholder's ranking of trajectory distributions and those induced by a given reward function. We show that the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient exhibits desirable properties, such as not requiring access to a ground truth reward, invariance to potential-based reward shaping, and applicability to online RL. Additionally, in an 11 -- person user study of RL practitioners, we found that access to the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient during reward selection led to statistically significant improvements. Compared to relying only on reward functions, our metric reduced cognitive workload by 1.5x, was preferred by 82% of users and increased the success rate of selecting reward functions that produced performant policies by 41%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Ding, Mingxi Lei, Shaowei Wang, Tianhang Zheng, Di Wang, Jinhui Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate one of the most fundamental nonconvex learning problems, ReLU regression, in the Differential Privacy (DP) model. Previous studies on private ReLU regression heavily rely on stringent assumptions, such as constant bounded norms for feature vectors and labels. We relax these assumptions to a more standard setting, where data can be i.i.d. sampled from $O(1)$-sub-Gaussian distributions. We first show that when $\varepsilon = \tilde{O}(\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}})$ and there is some public data, it is possible to achieve an upper bound of $\Tilde{O}(\frac{d^2}{N^2 \varepsilon^2})$ for the excess population risk in $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP, where $d$ is the dimension and $N$ is the number of data samples. Moreover, we relax the requirement of $\epsilon$ and public data by proposing and analyzing a one-pass mini-batch Generalized Linear Model Perceptron algorithm (DP-MBGLMtron). Additionally, using the tracing attack argument technique, we demonstrate that the minimax rate of the estimation error for $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithms is lower bounded by $\Omega(\frac{d^2}{N^2 \varepsilon^2})$. This shows that DP-MBGLMtron achieves the optimal utility bound up to logarithmic factors. Experiments further support our theoretical results.</p>

To address this issue, we propose Federated Error Minimization (FedEM), a novel algorithm that incorporates controlled perturbations through adaptive noise injection. This mechanism effectively mitigates gradient leakage attacks while maintaining model performance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedEM significantly reduces privacy risks and preserves model accuracy, achieving a robust balance between privacy protection and utility preservation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinge Ma, Jin Wang, Xuejie Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a global model under the orchestration of a central server without exposing their individual data. However, the iterative exchange of model parameters between the server and clients imposes heavy communication burdens, risks potential privacy leakage, and even precludes collaboration among heterogeneous clients. Distillation-based FL tackles these challenges by exchanging low-dimensional model outputs rather than model parameters, yet it highly relies on a task-relevant auxiliary dataset that is often not available in practice. Data-free FL attempts to overcome this limitation by training a server-side generator to directly synthesize task-specific data samples for knowledge transfer. However, the update rule of the generator requires clients to share on-device models for white-box access, which greatly compromises the advantages of distillation-based FL. This motivates us to explore a data-free and black-box FL framework via Zeroth-order Gradient Estimation (FedZGE), which estimates the gradients after flowing through on-device models in a black-box optimization manner to complete the training of the generator in terms of fidelity, transferability, diversity, and equilibrium, without involving any auxiliary data or sharing any model parameters, thus combining the advantages of both distillation-based FL and data-free FL. Experiments on large-scale image classification datasets and network architectures demonstrate the superiority of FedZGE in terms of data heterogeneity, model heterogeneity, communication efficiency, and privacy protection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthetic lethality (SL) is a promising gene interaction for cancer therapy. Recent SL prediction methods integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) into graph neural networks (GNNs) and employ attention mechanisms to extract local subgraphs as explanations for target gene pairs. However, attention mechanisms often lack fidelity, typically generate a single explanation per gene pair, and fail to ensure trustworthy high-order structures in their explanations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Diverse Graph Information Bottleneck for Synthetic Lethality (DGIB4SL), a KG-based GNN that generates multiple faithful explanations for the same gene pair and effectively encodes high-order structures. Specifically, we introduce a novel DGIB objective, integrating a Determinant Point Process (DPP) constraint into the standard IB objective, and employ 13 motif-based adjacency matrices to capture high-order structures in gene representations. Experimental results show that DGIB4SL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and provides multiple explanations for SL prediction, revealing diverse biological mechanisms underlying SL inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Murong Yang, Shihui Ying, Xin-Jian Xu, Yue Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-based multi-view spectral clustering methods have achieved notable progress recently, yet they often fall short in either oversimplifying pairwise relationships or struggling with inefficient spectral decompositions in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that begins to generate hypergraphs by leveraging sparse representation learning from data points. Based on the generated hypergraph, we propose an optimization function with orthogonality constraints for multi-view hypergraph spectral clustering, which incorporates spectral clustering for each view and ensures consistency across different views. In Euclidean space, solving the orthogonality-constrained optimization problem may yield local maxima and approximation errors. Innovately, we transform this problem into an unconstrained form on the Grassmannian manifold. Finally, we devise an alternating iterative Riemannian optimization algorithm to solve the problem. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we test it on four real-world multi-view datasets and compare its performance with seven state-of-the-art multi-view clustering algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines in terms of clustering performance due to its superior low-dimensional and resilient feature representation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar, Nicol\`o Michelusi</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework for distributed learning, enabling collaborative model training without sharing private data. Existing wireless FL works primarily adopt two communication strategies: (1) over-the-air (OTA) computation, which exploits wireless signal superposition for simultaneous gradient aggregation, and (2) digital communication, which allocates orthogonal resources for gradient uploads. Prior works on both schemes typically assume \emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) to enforce zero-bias updates or permit uncontrolled bias, resulting in suboptimal performance and high-variance model updates in \emph{heterogeneous} environments, where devices with poor channel conditions slow down convergence. This paper addresses FL over heterogeneous wireless networks by proposing novel OTA and digital FL updates that allow a structured, time-invariant model bias, thereby reducing variance in FL updates. We analyze their convergence under a unified framework and derive an upper bound on the model ``optimality error", which explicitly quantifies the effect of bias and variance in terms of design parameters. Next, to optimize this trade-off, we study a non-convex optimization problem and develop a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based framework to jointly optimize the design parameters. We perform extensive numerical evaluations with several related design variants and state-of-the-art OTA and digital FL schemes. Our results confirm that minimizing the bias-variance trade-off while allowing a structured bias provides better FL convergence performance than existing schemes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khoa Nguyen, Viet Huynh, Binh Tran, Tri Pham, Tin Huynh, Thin Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a well-established method for addressing black-box optimization problems. In many real-world scenarios, optimization often involves multiple functions, emphasizing the importance of leveraging data and learned functions from prior tasks to enhance efficiency in the current task. To expedite convergence to the global optimum, recent studies have introduced meta-learning strategies, collectively referred to as meta-BO, to incorporate knowledge from historical tasks. However, in practical settings, the underlying functions are often heterogeneous, which can adversely affect optimization performance for the current task. Additionally, when the number of historical tasks is large, meta-BO methods face significant scalability challenges. In this work, we propose a scalable and robust meta-BO method designed to address key challenges in heterogeneous and large-scale meta-tasks. Our approach (1) effectively partitions transferred meta-functions into highly homogeneous clusters, (2) learns the geometry-based surrogate prototype that capture the structural patterns within each cluster, and (3) adaptively synthesizes meta-priors during the online phase using statistical distance-based weighting policies. Experimental results on real-world hyperparameter optimization (HPO) tasks, combined with theoretical guarantees, demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our method in overcoming these challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas I-Hsien Kuo, Blanca Gallego, Louisa Jorm</p>
<p>Abstract: Access to real-world healthcare data is limited by stringent privacy regulations and data imbalances, hindering advancements in research and clinical applications. Synthetic data presents a promising solution, yet existing methods often fail to ensure the realism, utility, and calibration essential for robust survival analysis. Here, we introduce Masked Clinical Modelling (MCM), an attention-based framework capable of generating high-fidelity synthetic datasets that preserve critical clinical insights, such as hazard ratios, while enhancing survival model calibration. Unlike traditional statistical methods like SMOTE and machine learning models such as VAEs, MCM supports both standalone dataset synthesis for reproducibility and conditional simulation for targeted augmentation, addressing diverse research needs. Validated on a chronic kidney disease electronic health records dataset, MCM reduced the general calibration loss over the entire dataset by 15%; and MCM reduced a mean calibration loss by 9% across 10 clinically stratified subgroups, outperforming 15 alternative methods. By bridging data accessibility with translational utility, MCM advances the precision of healthcare models, promoting more efficient use of scarce healthcare resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingqi Yuan, Bo Li, Xin Jin, Wenjun Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a billion-dollar problem in machine learning, which significantly impacts the training efficiency and model performance. However, achieving efficient and robust HPO in deep reinforcement learning (RL) is consistently challenging due to its high non-stationarity and computational cost. To tackle this problem, existing approaches attempt to adapt common HPO techniques (e.g., population-based training or Bayesian optimization) to the RL scenario. However, they remain sample-inefficient and computationally expensive, which cannot facilitate a wide range of applications. In this paper, we propose ULTHO, an ultra-lightweight yet powerful framework for fast HPO in deep RL within single runs. Specifically, we formulate the HPO process as a multi-armed bandit with clustered arms (MABC) and link it directly to long-term return optimization. ULTHO also provides a quantified and statistical perspective to filter the HPs efficiently. We test ULTHO on benchmarks including ALE, Procgen, MiniGrid, and PyBullet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the ULTHO can achieve superior performance with simple architecture, contributing to the development of advanced and automated RL systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hoang-Thang Ta, Anh Tran</p>
<p>Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have inspired numerous works exploring their applications across a wide range of scientific problems, with the potential to replace Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). While many KANs are designed using basis and polynomial functions, such as B-splines, ReLU-KAN utilizes a combination of ReLU functions to mimic the structure of B-splines and take advantage of ReLU's speed. However, ReLU-KAN is not built for multiple inputs, and its limitations stem from ReLU's handling of negative values, which can restrict feature extraction. To address these issues, we introduce Activation Function-Based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (AF-KAN), expanding ReLU-KAN with various activations and their function combinations. This novel KAN also incorporates parameter reduction methods, primarily attention mechanisms and data normalization, to enhance performance on image classification datasets. We explore different activation functions, function combinations, grid sizes, and spline orders to validate the effectiveness of AF-KAN and determine its optimal configuration. In the experiments, AF-KAN significantly outperforms MLP, ReLU-KAN, and other KANs with the same parameter count. It also remains competitive even when using fewer than 6 to 10 times the parameters while maintaining the same network structure. However, AF-KAN requires a longer training time and consumes more FLOPs. The repository for this work is available at https://github.com/hoangthangta/All-KAN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shinichi Tanaka, Zhao Wang, Yoichi Kato, Jun Ohya</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unified framework that leverages a single pretrained LLM for Motion-related Multimodal Generation, referred to as MoMug. MoMug integrates diffusion-based continuous motion generation with the model's inherent autoregressive discrete text prediction capabilities by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM. This enables seamless switching between continuous motion output and discrete text token prediction within a single model architecture, effectively combining the strengths of both diffusion- and LLM-based approaches. Experimental results show that, compared to the most recent LLM-based baseline, MoMug improves FID by 38% and mean accuracy across seven metrics by 16.61% on the text-to-motion task. Additionally, it improves mean accuracy across eight metrics by 8.44% on the text-to-motion task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to integrate diffusion- and LLM-based generation within a single model for motion-related multimodal tasks while maintaining low training costs. This establishes a foundation for future advancements in motion-related generation, paving the way for high-quality yet cost-efficient motion synthesis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series models face significant challenges in scaling to handle large and complex datasets, akin to the scaling achieved by large language models (LLMs). The unique characteristics of time series data and the computational demands of model scaling necessitate innovative approaches. While researchers have explored various architectures such as Transformers, LSTMs, and GRUs to address these challenges, we propose a novel solution using RWKV-7, which incorporates meta-learning into its state update mechanism. By integrating RWKV-7's time mix and channel mix components into the transformer-based time series model Timer, we achieve a substantial performance improvement of approximately 1.13 to 43.3x and a 4.5x reduction in training time with 1/23 parameters, all while utilizing fewer parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohong Yang, Minghui Liwang, Liqun Fu, Yuhan Su, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, Xianbin Wang, Yiguang Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) introduces intermediate aggregation layers, addressing the limitations of conventional Federated Learning (FL) in geographically dispersed environments with limited communication infrastructure. An application of HFL is in smart IoT systems, such as remote monitoring, disaster response, and battlefield operations, where cellular connectivity is often unreliable or unavailable. In these scenarios, UAVs serve as mobile aggregators, providing connectivity to the terrestrial IoT devices. This paper studies an HFL architecture for energy-constrained UAVs in smart IoT systems, pioneering a solution to minimize global training cost increased caused by UAV disconnection. In light of this, we formulate a joint optimization problem involving learning configuration, bandwidth allocation, and device-to-UAV association, and perform global aggregation in time before UAV drops disconnect and redeployment of UAVs. The problem explicitly accounts for the dynamic nature of IoT devices and their interruptible communications and is unveiled to be NP-hard. To address this, we decompose it into three subproblems. First, we optimize the learning configuration and bandwidth allocation using an augmented Lagrangian function to reduce training costs. Second, we propose a device fitness score, integrating data heterogeneity (via Kullback-Leibler divergence), device-to-UAV distances, and IoT device resources, and develop a twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3)-based algorithm for dynamic device-to-UAV assignment. Third, We introduce a low-complexity two-stage greedy strategy for finding the location of UAVs redeployment and selecting the appropriate global aggregator UAV. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate significant cost reductions and robust performance under communication interruptions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huan Tian, Guangsheng Zhang, Bo Liu, Tianqing Zhu, Ming Ding, Wanlei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: While in-processing fairness approaches show promise in mitigating biased predictions, their potential impact on privacy leakage remains under-explored. We aim to address this gap by assessing the privacy risks of fairness-enhanced binary classifiers via membership inference attacks (MIAs) and attribute inference attacks (AIAs). Surprisingly, our results reveal that enhancing fairness does not necessarily lead to privacy compromises. For example, these fairness interventions exhibit increased resilience against MIAs and AIAs. This is because fairness interventions tend to remove sensitive information among extracted features and reduce confidence scores for the majority of training data for fairer predictions. However, during the evaluations, we uncover a potential threat mechanism that exploits prediction discrepancies between fair and biased models, leading to advanced attack results for both MIAs and AIAs. This mechanism reveals potent vulnerabilities of fair models and poses significant privacy risks of current fairness methods. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, attack methods, and representative fairness approaches confirm our findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the uncovered mechanism. Our study exposes the under-explored privacy threats in fairness studies, advocating for thorough evaluations of potential security vulnerabilities before model deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziruo Hao, Zhenhua Cui, Tao Yang, Bo Hu, Xiaofeng Wu, Hui Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has become a crucial solution for distributed learning in edge intelligence, addressing communication constraints and privacy protection. However, challenges such as heterogeneous and asynchronous clients significantly impact model performance. This paper analyzes the harm of abnormal clients through parameter orthogonal decomposition innovatively and shows that the exit of abnormal clients can guarantee the effect of the model in most clients. To ensure the models' performance on exited abnormal clients and those who lack training resources, we also introduce a Federated Learning with Invariant Penalty for Generalization (FedIPG). With the assistance of the invariant penalty term, the model can achieve robust generalization capability. This approach indirectly mitigates the effects of data heterogeneity and asynchrony without additional communication overhead, making it ideal for edge intelligence systems. Our theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that FedIPG, combined with an exit strategy, enhances both in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution generalization capabilities while maintaining model convergence. This approach provides a robust framework for federated learning in resource-constrained environments while offering preliminary causal insights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shivanshu Shekhar, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling in continuous domains like image, audio, and video synthesis. However, their iterative sampling process leads to slow generation and inefficient training, challenges that are further exacerbated when incorporating Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) due to sparse rewards and long time horizons. Consistency models address these issues by enabling single-step or efficient multi-step generation, significantly reducing computational costs.
  In this work, we propose a direct reward optimization framework for applying RLHF to consistency models, incorporating distributional regularization to enhance training stability and prevent reward hacking. We investigate various $f$-divergences as regularization strategies, striking a balance between reward maximization and model consistency. Unlike policy gradient methods, our approach leverages first-order gradients, making it more efficient and less sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. Empirical results show that our method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to policy gradient based RLHF methods, across various automatic metrics and human evaluation. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates the impact of different regularization techniques in improving model generalization and preventing overfitting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah M. Zyarah, Dhireesha Kudithipudi</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing demand for continual learning in sequential data processing has led to progressively complex training methodologies and larger recurrent network architectures. Consequently, this has widened the knowledge gap between continual learning with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their ability to operate on devices with limited memory and compute. To address this challenge, we investigate the effectiveness of simplifying RNN architectures, particularly gated recurrent unit (GRU), and its impact on both single-task and multitask sequential learning. We propose a new variant of GRU, namely the minion recurrent unit (MiRU). MiRU replaces conventional gating mechanisms with scaling coefficients to regulate dynamic updates of hidden states and historical context, reducing computational costs and memory requirements. Despite its simplified architecture, MiRU maintains performance comparable to the standard GRU while achieving 2.90x faster training and reducing parameter usage by 2.88x, as demonstrated through evaluations on sequential image classification and natural language processing benchmarks. The impact of model simplification on its learning capacity is also investigated by performing continual learning tasks with a rehearsal-based strategy and global inhibition. We find that MiRU demonstrates stable performance in multitask learning even when using only rehearsal, unlike the standard GRU and its variants. These features position MiRU as a promising candidate for edge-device applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Devon Jarvis, Richard Klein, Benjamin Rosman, Andrew M. Saxe</p>
<p>Abstract: In spite of finite dimension ReLU neural networks being a consistent factor behind recent deep learning successes, a theory of feature learning in these models remains elusive. Currently, insightful theories still rely on assumptions including the linearity of the network computations, unstructured input data and architectural constraints such as infinite width or a single hidden layer. To begin to address this gap we establish an equivalence between ReLU networks and Gated Deep Linear Networks, and use their greater tractability to derive dynamics of learning. We then consider multiple variants of a core task reminiscent of multi-task learning or contextual control which requires both feature learning and nonlinearity. We make explicit that, for these tasks, the ReLU networks possess an inductive bias towards latent representations which are not strictly modular or disentangled but are still highly structured and reusable between contexts. This effect is amplified with the addition of more contexts and hidden layers. Thus, we take a step towards a theory of feature learning in finite ReLU networks and shed light on how structured mixed-selective latent representations can emerge due to a bias for node-reuse and learning speed.</p>

Then, we implement a lightweight Instruction-Set Architecture (ISA) extension to accelerate the indirect load and non-zero indices decompression operations required by our kernels, obtaining up to 1.9x extra speedup, at the cost of a 5% area overhead. Lastly, we extend an open-source DNN compiler to utilize our sparse kernels for complete networks, showing speedups of 3.21x and 1.81x on a ResNet18 and a Vision Transformer (ViT), with less than 1.5% accuracy drop compared to a dense baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daryna Oliynyk, Rudolf Mayer, Andreas Rauber</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models were shown to be vulnerable to model stealing attacks, which lead to intellectual property infringement. Among other methods, substitute model training is an all-encompassing attack applicable to any machine learning model whose behaviour can be approximated from input-output queries. Whereas prior works mainly focused on improving the performance of substitute models by, e.g. developing a new substitute training method, there have been only limited ablation studies on the impact the attacker's strength has on the substitute model's performance. As a result, different authors came to diverse, sometimes contradicting, conclusions. In this work, we exhaustively examine the ambivalent influence of different factors resulting from varying the attacker's capabilities and knowledge on a substitute training attack. Our findings suggest that some of the factors that have been considered important in the past are, in fact, not that influential; instead, we discover new correlations between attack conditions and success rate. In particular, we demonstrate that better-performing target models enable higher-fidelity attacks and explain the intuition behind this phenomenon. Further, we propose to shift the focus from the complexity of target models toward the complexity of their learning tasks. Therefore, for the substitute model, rather than aiming for a higher architecture complexity, we suggest focusing on getting data of higher complexity and an appropriate architecture. Finally, we demonstrate that even in the most limited data-free scenario, there is no need to overcompensate weak knowledge with millions of queries. Our results often exceed or match the performance of previous attacks that assume a stronger attacker, suggesting that these stronger attacks are likely endangering a model owner's intellectual property to a significantly higher degree than shown until now.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have delivered remarkable results in various fields. However, the rapid increase in the scale of graph data has introduced significant performance bottlenecks for GNN inference. Both computational complexity and memory usage have risen dramatically, with memory becoming a critical limitation. Although graph sampling-based subgraph learning methods can help mitigate computational and memory demands, they come with drawbacks such as information loss and high redundant computation among subgraphs. This paper introduces an innovative processing paradgim for distributed graph learning that abstracts GNNs with a new set of programming interfaces and leverages Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation technology to its full potential. This paradigm enables GNNs to highly exploit the computational resources of distributed clusters by eliminating the drawbacks of subgraph learning methods, leading to a more efficient inference process. Our experimental results demonstrate that on industry-scale graphs of up to \textbf{500 million nodes and 22.4 billion edges}, our method can produce a performance boost of up to \textbf{27.4 times}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph-based computations are crucial in a wide range of applications, where graphs can scale to trillions of edges. To enable efficient training on such large graphs, mini-batch subgraph sampling is commonly used, which allows training without loading the entire graph into memory. However, existing solutions face significant trade-offs: online subgraph generation, as seen in frameworks like DGL and PyG, is limited to a single machine, resulting in severe performance bottlenecks, while offline precomputed subgraphs, as in GraphGen, improve sampling efficiency but introduce large storage overhead and high I/O costs during training. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GraphGen+}, an integrated framework that synchronizes distributed subgraph generation with in-memory graph learning, eliminating the need for external storage while significantly improving efficiency. GraphGen+ achieves a \textbf{27$\times$} speedup in subgraph generation compared to conventional SQL-like methods and a \textbf{1.3$\times$} speedup over GraphGen, supporting training on 1 million nodes per iteration and removing the overhead associated with precomputed subgraphs, making it a scalable and practical solution for industry-scale graph learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiyu Wang, Sen Wang, Xinxin Zuo, Qiang Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Lifelong learning (LL) aims to continuously acquire new knowledge while retaining previously learned knowledge. A central challenge in LL is the stability-plasticity dilemma, which requires models to balance the preservation of previous knowledge (stability) with the ability to learn new tasks (plasticity). While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has been widely adopted in large language models, its application to lifelong learning remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes AdaLL, an adapter-based framework designed to address the dilemma through a simple, universal, and effective strategy. AdaLL co-trains the backbone network and adapters under regularization constraints, enabling the backbone to capture task-invariant features while allowing the adapters to specialize in task-specific information. Unlike methods that freeze the backbone network, AdaLL incrementally enhances the backbone's capabilities across tasks while minimizing interference through backbone regularization. This architectural design significantly improves both stability and plasticity, effectively eliminating the stability-plasticity dilemma. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdaLL consistently outperforms existing methods across various configurations, including dataset choices, task sequences, and task scales.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06231">WaveStitch: Flexible and Fast Conditional Time Series Generation with Diffusion Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Shankar, Lydia Y. Chen, Arie van Deursen, Rihan Hai</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating temporal data under constraints is critical for forecasting, imputation, and synthesis. These datasets often include auxiliary conditions that influence the values within the time series signal. Existing methods face three key challenges: (1) they fail to adapt to conditions at inference time; (2) they rely on sequential generation, which slows the generation speed; and (3) they inefficiently encode categorical features, leading to increased sparsity and input sizes. We propose WaveStitch, a novel method that addresses these challenges by leveraging denoising diffusion probabilistic models to efficiently generate accurate temporal data under given auxiliary constraints. WaveStitch overcomes these limitations by: (1) modeling interactions between constraints and signals to generalize to new, unseen conditions; (2) enabling the parallel synthesis of sequential segments with a novel "stitching" mechanism to enforce coherence across segments; and (3) encoding categorical features as compact periodic signals while preserving temporal patterns. Extensive evaluations across diverse datasets highlight WaveStitch's ability to generalize to unseen conditions during inference, achieving up to a 10x lower mean-squared-error compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, WaveStitch generates data up to 460x faster than autoregressive methods while maintaining comparable accuracy. By efficiently encoding categorical features, WaveStitch provides a robust and efficient solution for temporal data generation. Our code is open-sourced: https://github.com/adis98/HierarchicalTS</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Schoepf, Muhammad Zaid Hameed, Ambrish Rawat, Kieran Fraser, Giulio Zizzo, Giandomenico Cornacchia, Mark Purcell</p>
<p>Abstract: With LLM usage rapidly increasing, their vulnerability to jailbreaks that create harmful outputs are a major security risk. As new jailbreaking strategies emerge and models are changed by fine-tuning, continuous testing for security vulnerabilities is necessary. Existing Red Teaming methods fall short in cost efficiency, attack success rate, attack diversity, or extensibility as new attack types emerge. We address these challenges with Modular And Diverse Malicious Attack MiXtures (MAD-MAX) for Automated LLM Red Teaming. MAD-MAX uses automatic assignment of attack strategies into relevant attack clusters, chooses the most relevant clusters for a malicious goal, and then combines strategies from the selected clusters to achieve diverse novel attacks with high attack success rates. MAD-MAX further merges promising attacks together at each iteration of Red Teaming to boost performance and introduces a similarity filter to prune out similar attacks for increased cost efficiency. The MAD-MAX approach is designed to be easily extensible with newly discovered attack strategies and outperforms the prominent Red Teaming method Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP) significantly in terms of Attack Success Rate (ASR) and queries needed to achieve jailbreaks. MAD-MAX jailbreaks 97% of malicious goals in our benchmarks on GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro compared to TAP with 66%. MAD-MAX does so with only 10.9 average queries to the target LLM compared to TAP with 23.3.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06269">Using Mechanistic Interpretability to Craft Adversarial Attacks against Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Winninger, Boussad Addad, Katarzyna Kapusta</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional white-box methods for creating adversarial perturbations against LLMs typically rely only on gradient computation from the targeted model, ignoring the internal mechanisms responsible for attack success or failure. Conversely, interpretability studies that analyze these internal mechanisms lack practical applications beyond runtime interventions. We bridge this gap by introducing a novel white-box approach that leverages mechanistic interpretability techniques to craft practical adversarial inputs. Specifically, we first identify acceptance subspaces - sets of feature vectors that do not trigger the model's refusal mechanisms - then use gradient-based optimization to reroute embeddings from refusal subspaces to acceptance subspaces, effectively achieving jailbreaks. This targeted approach significantly reduces computation cost, achieving attack success rates of 80-95\% on state-of-the-art models including Gemma2, Llama3.2, and Qwen2.5 within minutes or even seconds, compared to existing techniques that often fail or require hours of computation. We believe this approach opens a new direction for both attack research and defense development. Furthermore, it showcases a practical application of mechanistic interpretability where other methods are less efficient, which highlights its utility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bojan Luki\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper gives an overview on how to develop a dense and deep neural network for making a time series prediction. First, the history and cornerstones in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning will be presented. After a short introduction to the theory of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, the paper will go deeper into the techniques for conducting a time series prediction with different models of neural networks. For this project, Python's development environment Jupyter, extended with the TensorFlow package and deep-learning application Keras is used. The system setup and project framework are explained in more detail before discussing the time series prediction. The main part shows an applied example of time series prediction with weather data. For this work, a deep recurrent neural network with Long Short-Term Memory cells is used to conduct the time series prediction. The results and evaluation of the work show that a weather prediction with deep neural networks can be successful for a short time period. However, there are some drawbacks and limitations with time series prediction, which will be discussed towards the end of the paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Yan, Marzi Heidari, Yuhong Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to train models that can generalize to unseen testing domains by leveraging data from multiple training domains. However, traditional DG methods rely on the availability of multiple diverse training domains, limiting their applicability in data-constrained scenarios. Single Domain Generalization (SDG) addresses the more realistic and challenging setting by restricting the training data to a single domain distribution. The main challenges in SDG stem from the limited diversity of training data and the inaccessibility of unseen testing data distributions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a single domain generalization method that leverages an adversarial memory bank to augment training features. Our memory-based feature augmentation network maps both training and testing features into an invariant subspace spanned by diverse memory features, implicitly aligning the training and testing domains in the projected space. To maintain a diverse and representative feature memory bank, we introduce an adversarial feature generation method that creates features extending beyond the training domain distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard single domain generalization benchmarks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06320">Learning and discovering multiple solutions using physics-informed neural networks with random initialization and deep ensemble</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongren Zou, Zhicheng Wang, George Em Karniadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the capability of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to discover multiple solutions. Many real-world phenomena governed by nonlinear differential equations (DEs), such as fluid flow, exhibit multiple solutions under the same conditions, yet capturing this solution multiplicity remains a significant challenge. A key difficulty is giving appropriate initial conditions or initial guesses, to which the widely used time-marching schemes and Newton's iteration method are very sensitive in finding solutions for complex computational problems. While machine learning models, particularly PINNs, have shown promise in solving DEs, their ability to capture multiple solutions remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a simple and practical approach using PINNs to learn and discover multiple solutions. We first reveal that PINNs, when combined with random initialization and deep ensemble method -- originally developed for uncertainty quantification -- can effectively uncover multiple solutions to nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs). Our approach highlights the critical role of initialization in shaping solution diversity, addressing an often-overlooked aspect of machine learning for scientific computing. Furthermore, we propose utilizing PINN-generated solutions as initial conditions or initial guesses for conventional numerical solvers to enhance accuracy and efficiency in capturing multiple solutions. Extensive numerical experiments, including the Allen-Cahn equation and cavity flow, where our approach successfully identifies both stable and unstable solutions, validate the effectiveness of our method. These findings establish a general and efficient framework for addressing solution multiplicity in nonlinear differential equations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vijayamanikandan Vijayarangan, Harshavardhana A. Uranakara, Francisco E. Hern\'andez-P\'erez, Hong G. Im</p>
<p>Abstract: Using the information theory, this study provides insights into how the construction of latent space of autoencoder (AE) using deep neural network (DNN) training finds a smooth low-dimensional manifold in the stiff dynamical system. Our recent study [1] reported that an autoencoder (AE) combined with neural ODE (NODE) as a surrogate reduced order model (ROM) for the integration of stiff chemically reacting systems led to a significant reduction in the temporal stiffness, and the behavior was attributed to the identification of a slow invariant manifold by the nonlinear projection of the AE. The present work offers fundamental understanding of the mechanism by employing concepts from information theory and better mixing. The learning mechanism of both the encoder and decoder are explained by plotting the evolution of mutual information and identifying two different phases. Subsequently, the density distribution is plotted for the physical and latent variables, which shows the transformation of the \emph{rare event} in the physical space to a \emph{highly likely} (more probable) event in the latent space provided by the nonlinear autoencoder. Finally, the nonlinear transformation leading to density redistribution is explained using concepts from information theory and probability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohit Pandey, Gopeshh Subbaraj, Artem Cherkasov, Emmanuel Bengio</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have recently emerged as a suitable framework for generating diverse and high-quality molecular structures by learning from rewards treated as unnormalized distributions. Previous works in this framework often restrict exploration by using predefined molecular fragments as building blocks, limiting the chemical space that can be accessed. In this work, we introduce Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. We propose an unsupervised pre-training approach using drug-like molecule datasets, which teaches A-GFNs about inexpensive yet informative molecular descriptors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. We further implement a goal-conditioned finetuning process, which adapts A-GFNs to optimize for specific target properties. In this work, we pretrain A-GFN on a subset of ZINC dataset, and by employing robust evaluation metrics we show the effectiveness of our approach when compared to other relevant baseline methods for a wide range of drug design tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaurav Patel, Qiang Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Unlearning has recently garnered significant attention, aiming to selectively remove knowledge associated with specific data while preserving the model's performance on the remaining data. A fundamental challenge in this process is balancing effective unlearning with knowledge retention, as naive optimization of these competing objectives can lead to conflicting gradients, hindering convergence and degrading overall performance. To address this issue, we propose Learning to Unlearn while Retaining, aimed to mitigate gradient conflicts between unlearning and retention objectives. Our approach strategically avoids conflicts through an implicit gradient regularization mechanism that emerges naturally within the proposed framework. This prevents conflicting gradients between unlearning and retention, leading to effective unlearning while preserving the model's utility. We validate our approach across both discriminative and generative tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving unlearning without compromising performance on remaining data. Our results highlight the advantages of avoiding such gradient conflicts, outperforming existing methods that fail to account for these interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Garcin, Trevor McInroe, Pablo Samuel Castro, Prakash Panangaden, Christopher G. Lucas, David Abel, Stefano V. Albrecht</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting relevant information from a stream of high-dimensional observations is a central challenge for deep reinforcement learning agents. Actor-critic algorithms add further complexity to this challenge, as it is often unclear whether the same information will be relevant to both the actor and the critic. To this end, we here explore the principles that underlie effective representations for the actor and for the critic in on-policy algorithms. We focus our study on understanding whether the actor and critic will benefit from separate, rather than shared, representations. Our primary finding is that when separated, the representations for the actor and critic systematically specialise in extracting different types of information from the environment -- the actor's representation tends to focus on action-relevant information, while the critic's representation specialises in encoding value and dynamics information. We conduct a rigourous empirical study to understand how different representation learning approaches affect the actor and critic's specialisations and their downstream performance, in terms of sample efficiency and generation capabilities. Finally, we discover that a separated critic plays an important role in exploration and data collection during training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vikas Dwivedi, Bruno Sixou, Monica Sigovan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents two novel, physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM)-based algorithms for solving steady and unsteady nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) related to fluid flow. Although single-hidden-layer PIELMs outperform deep physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in speed and accuracy for linear and quasilinear PDEs, their extension to nonlinear problems remains challenging. To address this, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy that reformulates nonlinear PDEs as a sequence of increasingly complex quasilinear PDEs. Additionally, our approach enables a physically interpretable initialization of network parameters by leveraging Radial Basis Functions (RBFs). The performance of the proposed algorithms is validated on two benchmark incompressible flow problems: the viscous Burgers equation and lid-driven cavity flow. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to extend PIELM to solving Burgers' shock solution as well as lid-driven cavity flow up to a Reynolds number of 100. As a practical application, we employ PIELM to predict blood flow in a stenotic vessel. The results confirm that PIELM efficiently handles nonlinear PDEs, positioning it as a promising alternative to PINNs for both linear and nonlinear PDEs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Yue, Guangzhi Qu, Lige Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: One significant challenge of exploiting Graph neural networks (GNNs) in real-life scenarios is that they are always treated as black boxes, therefore leading to the requirement of interpretability. Model-level interpretations explain what patterns maximize probability of predicting to a certain class. However, existing model-level interpretation methods pose several limitations such as generating invalid explanation graphs and requiring extreme fine-tuning on hyperparameters manually. In this paper, we propose a new Generative Interpretation Network for Model-Level Explanation of Graph Neural Networks (GIN-Graph), to generate reliable model-level explanation graphs. The implicit and likelihood-free generative adversarial networks are exploited to construct explanation graphs similar to original graphs, meanwhile maximizing the prediction probability for a certain class by adopting a novel objective function. Experimental results indicate that GIN-Graph can be easily applied to GNN models trained on a variety of graph datasets to create meaningful explanation graphs without requiring extensive fine-tuning on hyperparameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are optimized for human-aligned responses using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, existing RLHF approaches assume a universal preference model and fail to account for individual user preferences, limiting their effectiveness in personalized applications. We introduce a framework that extends RLHF to enable user personalization by leveraging the assumption that user preferences lie in a low-dimensional space. Instead of training a separate model per user, we represent user-specific rewards as a linear combination of base reward functions. Using only ~10 user responses, our method can infer user-specific rewards and align LLM outputs accordingly. We validate our approach through experiments with both synthetic and real users, demonstrating significant personalization achieved by our method. In human evaluations, our method achieves a 67% win rate over default GPT-4o responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Herman Chau, Helen Jenne, Davis Brown, Jesse He, Mark Raugas, Sara Billey, Henry Kvinge</p>
<p>Abstract: With recent dramatic increases in AI system capabilities, there has been growing interest in utilizing machine learning for reasoning-heavy, quantitative tasks, particularly mathematics. While there are many resources capturing mathematics at the high-school, undergraduate, and graduate level, there are far fewer resources available that align with the level of difficulty and open endedness encountered by professional mathematicians working on open problems. To address this, we introduce a new collection of datasets, the Algebraic Combinatorics Dataset Repository (ACD Repo), representing either foundational results or open problems in algebraic combinatorics, a subfield of mathematics that studies discrete structures arising from abstract algebra. Further differentiating our dataset collection is the fact that it aims at the conjecturing process. Each dataset includes an open-ended research-level question and a large collection of examples (up to 10M in some cases) from which conjectures should be generated. We describe all nine datasets, the different ways machine learning models can be applied to them (e.g., training with narrow models followed by interpretability analysis or program synthesis with LLMs), and discuss some of the challenges involved in designing datasets like these.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Yousuf Harun, Christopher Kanan</p>
<p>Abstract: To adapt to real-world data streams, continual learning (CL) systems must rapidly learn new concepts while preserving and utilizing prior knowledge. When it comes to adding new information to continually-trained deep neural networks (DNNs), classifier weights for newly encountered categories are typically initialized randomly, leading to high initial training loss (spikes) and instability. Consequently, achieving optimal convergence and accuracy requires prolonged training, increasing computational costs. Inspired by Neural Collapse (NC), we propose a weight initialization strategy to improve learning efficiency in CL. In DNNs trained with mean-squared-error, NC gives rise to a Least-Square (LS) classifier in the last layer, whose weights can be analytically derived from learned features. We leverage this LS formulation to initialize classifier weights in a data-driven manner, aligning them with the feature distribution rather than using random initialization. Our method mitigates initial loss spikes and accelerates adaptation to new tasks. We evaluate our approach in large-scale CL settings, demonstrating faster adaptation and improved CL performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Feng, Yunke Zhang, Huandong Wang, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: User consumption behavior data, which records individuals' online spending history at various types of stores, has been widely used in various applications, such as store recommendation, site selection, and sale forecasting. However, its high worth is limited due to deficiencies in data comprehensiveness and changes of application scenarios. Thus, generating high-quality sequential consumption data by simulating complex user consumption behaviors is of great importance to real-world applications. Two branches of existing sequence generation methods are both limited in quality. Model-based methods with simplified assumptions fail to model the complex decision process of user consumption, while data-driven methods that emulate real-world data are prone to noises, unobserved behaviors, and dynamic decision space. In this work, we propose to enhance the fidelity and trustworthiness of the data-driven Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) method by blending it with the Exploration and Preferential Return EPR model . The core idea of our EPR-GAIL framework is to model user consumption behaviors as a complex EPR decision process, which consists of purchase, exploration, and preference decisions. Specifically, we design the hierarchical policy function in the generator as a realization of the EPR decision process and employ the probability distributions of the EPR model to guide the reward function in the discriminator. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets of user consumption behaviors on an online platform demonstrate that the EPR-GAIL framework outperforms the best state-of-the-art baseline by over 19\% in terms of data fidelity. Furthermore, the generated consumption behavior data can improve the performance of sale prediction and location recommendation by up to 35.29% and 11.19%, respectively, validating its advantage for practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Feng, Yunke Zhang, Huandong Wang, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate origin-destination (OD) flow prediction is of great importance to developing cities, as it can contribute to optimize urban structures and layouts. However, with the common issues of missing regional features and lacking OD flow data, it is quite daunting to predict OD flow in developing cities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Causality-Enhanced OD Flow Prediction (CE-OFP), a unified framework that aims to transfer urban knowledge between cities and achieve accuracy improvements in OD flow predictions across data-scarce cities. In specific, we propose a novel reinforcement learning model to discover universal causalities among urban features in data-rich cities and build corresponding causal graphs. Then, we further build Causality-Enhanced Variational Auto-Encoder (CE-VAE) to incorporate causal graphs for effective feature reconstruction in data-scarce cities. Finally, with the reconstructed features, we devise a knowledge distillation method with a graph attention network to migrate the OD prediction model from data-rich cities to data-scare cities. Extensive experiments on two pairs of real-world datasets validate that the proposed CE-OFP remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, which can reduce the RMSE of OD flow prediction for data-scarce cities by up to 11%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Peng, Xijun Wang, Shengbo Chen, Hong Rao, Cong Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful generative models that can produce highly realistic samples for various tasks. Typically, these models are constructed using centralized, independently and identically distributed (IID) training data. However, in practical scenarios, data is often distributed across multiple clients and frequently manifests non-IID characteristics. Federated Learning (FL) can leverage this distributed data to train diffusion models, but the performance of existing FL methods is unsatisfactory in non-IID scenarios. To address this, we propose FedDDPM-Federated Learning with Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, which leverages the data generative capability of diffusion models to facilitate model training. In particular, the server uses well-trained local diffusion models uploaded by each client before FL training to generate auxiliary data that can approximately represent the global data distribution. Following each round of model aggregation, the server further optimizes the global model using the auxiliary dataset to alleviate the impact of heterogeneous data on model performance. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis of FedDDPM and propose an enhanced algorithm, FedDDPM+, to reduce training overheads. FedDDPM+ detects instances of slow model learning and performs a one-shot correction using the auxiliary dataset. Experimental results validate that our proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art FL algorithms on the MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Jin, Jingming Liu, Zhexu Luo, Yifei Peng, Ziang Qin, Wang-Zhou Dai, Yao-Xiang Ding, Kun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual generative abductive learning studies jointly training symbol-grounded neural visual generator and inducing logic rules from data, such that after learning, the visual generation process is guided by the induced logic rules. A major challenge for this task is to reduce the time cost of logic abduction during learning, an essential step when the logic symbol set is large and the logic rule to induce is complicated. To address this challenge, we propose a pre-training method for obtaining meta-rule selection policy for the recently proposed visual generative learning approach AbdGen [Peng et al., 2023], aiming at significantly reducing the candidate meta-rule set and pruning the search space. The selection model is built based on the embedding representation of both symbol grounding of cases and meta-rules, which can be effectively integrated with both neural model and logic reasoning system. The pre-training process is done on pure symbol data, not involving symbol grounding learning of raw visual inputs, making the entire learning process low-cost. An additional interesting observation is that the selection policy can rectify symbol grounding errors unseen during pre-training, which is resulted from the memorization ability of attention mechanism and the relative stability of symbolic patterns. Experimental results show that our method is able to effectively address the meta-rule selection problem for visual abduction, boosting the efficiency of visual generative abductive learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianshu Huang, Arjun Ramesh, Emily Ruppel, Nuno Pereira, Anthony Rowe, Carlee Joe-Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately estimating workload runtime is a longstanding goal in computer systems, and plays a key role in efficient resource provisioning, latency minimization, and various other system management tasks. Runtime prediction is particularly important for managing increasingly complex distributed systems in which more sophisticated processing is pushed to the edge in search of better latency. Previous approaches for runtime prediction in edge systems suffer from poor data efficiency or require intensive instrumentation; these challenges are compounded in heterogeneous edge computing environments, where historical runtime data may be sparsely available and instrumentation is often challenging. Moreover, edge computing environments often feature multi-tenancy due to limited resources at the network edge, potentially leading to interference between workloads and further complicating the runtime prediction problem. Drawing from insights across machine learning and computer systems, we design a matrix factorization-inspired method that generates accurate interference-aware predictions with tight provably-guaranteed uncertainty bounds. We validate our method on a novel WebAssembly runtime dataset collected from 24 unique devices, achieving a prediction error of 5.2% -- 2x better than a naive application of existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nuoa Lei, Arman Shehabi, Jun Lu, Zhi Cao, Jonathan Koomey, Sarah Smith, Eric Masanet</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving digital era, comprehending the intricate dynamics influencing server power consumption, efficiency, and performance is crucial for sustainable data center operations. However, existing models lack the ability to provide a detailed and reliable understanding of these intricate relationships. This study employs a machine learning-based approach, using the SPECPower_ssj2008 database, to facilitate user-friendly and generalizable server modeling. The resulting models demonstrate high accuracy, with errors falling within approximately 10% on the testing dataset, showcasing their practical utility and generalizability. Through meticulous analysis, predictive features related to hardware availability date, server workload level, and specifications are identified, providing insights into optimizing energy conservation, efficiency, and performance in server deployment and operation. By systematically measuring biases and uncertainties, the study underscores the need for caution when employing historical data for prospective server modeling, considering the dynamic nature of technology landscapes. Collectively, this work offers valuable insights into the sustainable deployment and operation of servers in data centers, paving the way for enhanced resource use efficiency and more environmentally conscious practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zuqing Li, Jianzhong Qi, Junhao Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based tabular data synthesis models have yielded promising results. However, we observe that when the data dimensionality increases, existing models tend to degenerate and may perform even worse than simpler, non-diffusion-based models. This is because limited training samples in high-dimensional space often hinder generative models from capturing the distribution accurately. To address this issue, we propose CtrTab-a condition controlled diffusion model for tabular data synthesis-to improve the performance of diffusion-based generative models in high-dimensional, low-data scenarios. Through CtrTab, we inject samples with added Laplace noise as control signals to improve data diversity and show its resemblance to L2 regularization, which enhances model robustness. Experimental results across multiple datasets show that CtrTab outperforms state-of-the-art models, with performance gap in accuracy over 80% on average. Our source code will be released upon paper publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunfeng Li, Xiaolin Li Zhitao Li, Gangqiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the booming development of prosumers, there is an urgent need for a prosumer energy management system to take full advantage of the flexibility of prosumers and take into account the interests of other parties. However, building such a system will undoubtedly reveal users' privacy. In this paper, by solving the non-independent and identical distribution of data (Non-IID) problem in federated learning with federated cluster average(FedClusAvg) algorithm, prosumers' information can efficiently participate in the intelligent decision making of the system without revealing privacy. In the proposed FedClusAvg algorithm, each client performs cluster stratified sampling and multiple iterations. Then, the average weight of the parameters of the sub-server is determined according to the degree of deviation of the parameter from the average parameter. Finally, the sub-server multiple local iterations and updates, and then upload to the main server. The advantages of FedClusAvg algorithm are the following two parts. First, the accuracy of the model in the case of Non-IID is improved through the method of clustering and parameter weighted average. Second, local multiple iterations and three-tier framework can effectively reduce communication rounds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiting Zheng, Bohan Lin, Jinqian Chen, Jihua Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Most current federated learning frameworks are modeled as static processes, ignoring the dynamic characteristics of the learning system. Under the limited communication budget of the central server, the flexible model architecture of a large number of clients participating in knowledge transfer requires a lower participation rate, active clients have uneven contributions, and the client scale seriously hinders the performance of FL. We consider a more general and practical federation scenario and propose a system heterogeneous federation method based on data-free knowledge distillation and two-way contrast (HFedCKD). We apply the Inverse Probability Weighted Distillation (IPWD) strategy to the data-free knowledge transfer framework. The generator completes the data features of the nonparticipating clients. IPWD implements a dynamic evaluation of the prediction contribution of each client under different data distributions. Based on the antibiased weighting of its prediction loss, the weight distribution of each client is effectively adjusted to fairly integrate the knowledge of participating clients. At the same time, the local model is split into a feature extractor and a classifier. Through differential contrast learning, the feature extractor is aligned with the global model in the feature space, while the classifier maintains personalized decision-making capabilities. HFedCKD effectively alleviates the knowledge offset caused by a low participation rate under data-free knowledge distillation and improves the performance and stability of the model. We conduct extensive experiments on image and IoT datasets to comprehensively evaluate and verify the generalization and robustness of the proposed HFedCKD framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Zhang, Yanbin Liu, Weihua Li, Jie Lv, Xiaodan Wang, Quan Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision and Language Models have exhibited remarkable human-like intelligence in tasks such as natural language comprehension, problem-solving, logical reasoning, and knowledge retrieval. However, training and serving these models require substantial computational resources, posing a significant barrier to their widespread application and further research. To mitigate this challenge, various model compression techniques have been developed to reduce computational requirements. Nevertheless, existing methods often employ uniform quantization configurations, failing to account for the varying difficulties across different layers in quantizing large neural network models. This paper tackles this issue by leveraging layer-sensitivity features, such as activation sensitivity and weight distribution Kurtosis, to identify layers that are challenging to quantize accurately and allocate additional memory budget. The proposed methods, named SensiBoost and KurtBoost, respectively, demonstrate notable improvement in quantization accuracy, achieving up to 9% lower perplexity with only a 2% increase in memory budget on LLama models compared to the baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian Baule</p>
<p>Abstract: Score-based diffusion models generate samples from an unknown target distribution using a time-reversed diffusion process. While such models represent state-of-the-art approaches in industrial applications such as artificial image generation, it has recently been noted that their performance can be further improved by considering injection noise with heavy tailed characteristics. Here, I present a generalization of generative diffusion processes to a wide class of non-Gaussian noise processes. I consider forward processes driven by standard Gaussian noise with super-imposed Poisson jumps representing a finite activity Levy process. The generative process is shown to be governed by a generalized score function that depends on the jump amplitude distribution. Both probability flow ODE and SDE formulations are derived using basic technical effort, and are implemented for jump amplitudes drawn from a multivariate Laplace distribution. Remarkably, for the problem of capturing a heavy-tailed target distribution, the jump-diffusion Laplace model outperforms models driven by alpha-stable noise despite not containing any heavy-tailed characteristics. The framework can be readily applied to other jump statistics that could further improve on the performance of standard diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Cheng, Yibo Zhao, Jiapeng Zhu, Yao Liu, Xing Sun, Xiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential across various domains, yet they face significant challenges in knowledge integration and complex problem reasoning, often leading to hallucinations and unreliable outputs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance LLMs accuracy by incorporating external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems struggle with processing complex relational information and multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in advanced problem-solving tasks. To address these limitations, we propose CogGRAG, a cognition inspired graph-based RAG framework, designed to improve LLMs performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Inspired by the human cognitive process of decomposing complex problems and performing self-verification, our framework introduces a three-stage methodology: decomposition, retrieval, and reasoning with self-verification. By integrating these components, CogGRAG enhances the accuracy of LLMs in complex problem solving. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on four benchmark datasets, where CogGRAG outperforms the baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan-May Le, Ling Luo, Uwe Aickelin, Minh-Tuan Tran, David Berlowitz, Mark Howard</p>
<p>Abstract: Patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) is a common and critical issue during mechanical ventilation, affecting up to 85% of patients. PVA can result in clinical complications such as discomfort, sleep disruption, and potentially more severe conditions like ventilator-induced lung injury and diaphragm dysfunction. Traditional PVA management, which relies on manual adjustments by healthcare providers, is often inadequate due to delays and errors. While various computational methods, including rule-based, statistical, and deep learning approaches, have been developed to detect PVA events, they face challenges related to dataset imbalances and lack of interpretability. In this work, we propose a shapelet-based approach SHIP for PVA detection, utilizing shapelets - discriminative subsequences in time-series data - to enhance detection accuracy and interpretability. Our method addresses dataset imbalances through shapelet-based data augmentation and constructs a shapelet pool to transform the dataset for more effective classification. The combined shapelet and statistical features are then used in a classifier to identify PVA events. Experimental results on medical datasets show that SHIP significantly improves PVA detection while providing interpretable insights into model decisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Banglong Liu, Niuniu Qi, Xia Zeng, Lydia Dehbi, Zhengfeng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Polynomial inequality proving is fundamental to many mathematical disciplines and finds wide applications in diverse fields. Current traditional algebraic methods are based on searching for a polynomial positive definite representation over a set of basis. However, these methods are limited by truncation degree. To address this issue, this paper proposes an approach based on reinforcement learning to find a {Krivine-basis} representation for proving polynomial inequalities. Specifically, we formulate the inequality proving problem as a linear programming (LP) problem and encode it as a basis selection problem using reinforcement learning (RL), achieving a non-negative {Krivine basis}. Moreover, a fast multivariate polynomial multiplication method based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is employed to enhance the efficiency of action space search. Furthermore, we have implemented a tool called {APPIRL} (Automated Proof of Polynomial Inequalities via Reinforcement Learning). Experimental evaluation on benchmark problems demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. In addition, {APPIRL} has been successfully applied to solve the maximum stable set problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranoy Panda, Siddharth Tandon, Vineeth N Balasubramanian</p>
<p>Abstract: Fair credit assignment is essential in various machine learning (ML) applications, and Shapley values have emerged as a valuable tool for this purpose. However, in critical ML applications such as data valuation and feature attribution, the uniform weighting of Shapley values across subset cardinalities leads to unintuitive credit assignments. To address this, weighted Shapley values were proposed as a generalization, allowing different weights for subsets with different cardinalities. Despite their advantages, similar to Shapley values, Weighted Shapley values suffer from exponential compute costs, making them impractical for high-dimensional datasets. To tackle this issue, we present two key contributions. Firstly, we provide a weighted least squares characterization of weighted Shapley values. Next, using this characterization, we propose Fast Weighted Shapley (FW-Shapley), an amortized framework for efficiently computing weighted Shapley values using a learned estimator. We further show that our estimator's training procedure is theoretically valid even though we do not use ground truth Weighted Shapley values during training. On the feature attribution task, we outperform the learned estimator FastSHAP by $27\%$ (on average) in terms of Inclusion AUC. For data valuation, we are much faster (14 times) while being comparable to the state-of-the-art KNN Shapley.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranoy Panda, Kancheti Sai Srinivas, Vineeth N Balasubramanian, Gaurav Sinha</p>
<p>Abstract: Data in the real world often has an evolving distribution. Thus, machine learning models trained on such data get outdated over time. This phenomenon is called model drift. Knowledge of this drift serves two purposes: (i) Retain an accurate model and (ii) Discovery of knowledge or insights about change in the relationship between input features and output variable w.r.t. the model. Most existing works focus only on detecting model drift but offer no interpretability. In this work, we take a principled approach to study the problem of interpretable model drift detection from a risk perspective using a feature-interaction aware hypothesis testing framework, which enjoys guarantees on test power. The proposed framework is generic, i.e., it can be adapted to both classification and regression tasks. Experiments on several standard drift detection datasets show that our method is superior to existing interpretable methods (especially on real-world datasets) and on par with state-of-the-art black-box drift detection methods. We also quantitatively and qualitatively study the interpretability aspect including a case study on USENET2 dataset. We find our method focuses on model and drift sensitive features compared to baseline interpretable drift detectors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandra E. Ballentine, Raghvendra V. Cowlagi</p>
<p>Abstract: Performance and reliability analyses of autonomous vehicles (AVs) can benefit from tools that ``amplify'' small datasets to synthesize larger volumes of plausible samples of the AV's behavior. We consider a specific instance of this data synthesis problem that addresses minimizing the AV's exposure to adverse environmental conditions during travel to a fixed goal location. The environment is characterized by a threat field, which is a strictly positive scalar field with higher intensities corresponding to hazardous and unfavorable conditions for the AV. We address the problem of synthesizing datasets of minimum exposure paths that resemble a training dataset of such paths. The main contribution of this paper is an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) model to solve this problem. We consider time-invariant (static) as well as time-varying (dynamic) threat fields. We find that the proposed IRL model provides excellent performance in synthesizing paths from initial conditions not seen in the training dataset, when the threat field is the same as that used for training. Furthermore, we evaluate model performance on unseen threat fields and find low error in that case as well. Finally, we demonstrate the model's ability to synthesize distinct datasets when trained on different datasets with distinct characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Zeng, Xin Lin, Jingyi Gao, Yang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated the strong performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in node classification. However, most existing GNNs adopt a node-centric perspective and rely on global message passing, leading to high computational and memory costs that hinder scalability. To mitigate these challenges, subgraph-based methods have been introduced, leveraging local subgraphs as approximations of full computational trees. While this approach improves efficiency, it often suffers from performance degradation due to the loss of global contextual information, limiting its effectiveness compared to global GNNs. To address this trade-off between scalability and classification accuracy, we reformulate the node classification task as a subgraph classification problem and propose SubGND (Subgraph GNN for NoDe). This framework introduces a differentiated zero-padding strategy and an Ego-Alter subgraph representation method to resolve label conflicts while incorporating an Adaptive Feature Scaling Mechanism to dynamically adjust feature contributions based on dataset-specific dependencies. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that SubGND achieves performance comparable to or surpassing global message-passing GNNs, particularly in heterophilic settings, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability as a promising solution for node classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nachiket U. Bapat, Randy C. Paffenroth, Raghvendra V. Cowlagi</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of synthetic generation of samples of environmental features for autonomous vehicle navigation. These features are described by a spatiotemporally varying scalar field that we refer to as a threat field. The threat field is known to have some underlying dynamics subject to process noise. Some "real-world" data of observations of various threat fields are also available. The assumption is that the volume of ``real-world'' data is relatively small. The objective is to synthesize samples that are statistically similar to the data. The proposed solution is a generative artificial intelligence model that we refer to as a split variational recurrent neural network (S-VRNN). The S-VRNN merges the capabilities of a variational autoencoder, which is a widely used generative model, and a recurrent neural network, which is used to learn temporal dependencies in data. The main innovation in this work is that we split the latent space of the S-VRNN into two subspaces. The latent variables in one subspace are learned using the ``real-world'' data, whereas those in the other subspace are learned using the data as well as the known underlying system dynamics. Through numerical experiments we demonstrate that the proposed S-VRNN can synthesize data that are statistically similar to the training data even in the case of very small volume of ``real-world'' training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Online grooming is a severe social threat where sexual predators gradually entrap child victims with subtle and gradual manipulation. Therefore, timely intervention for online grooming is critical for proactive protection. However, previous methods fail to determine the optimal intervention points (i.e., jump to conclusions) as they rely on chat-level risk labels by causing weak supervision of risky utterances. For timely detection, we propose speed control reinforcement learning (SCoRL) (The code and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/jinmyeongAN/SCoRL), incorporating a practical strategy derived from luring communication theory (LCT). To capture the predator's turn-level entrapment, we use a turn-level risk label based on the LCT. Then, we design a novel speed control reward function that balances the trade-off between speed and accuracy based on turn-level risk label; thus, SCoRL can identify the optimal intervention moment. In addition, we introduce a turn-level metric for precise evaluation, identifying limitations in previously used chat-level metrics. Experimental results show that SCoRL effectively preempted online grooming, offering a more proactive and timely solution. Further analysis reveals that our method enhances performance while intuitively identifying optimal early intervention points.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the quantities of data recorded by embedded edge sensors grow, so too does the need for intelligent local processing. Such data often comes in the form of time-series signals, based on which real-time predictions can be made locally using an AI model. However, a hardware-software approach capable of making low-latency predictions with low power consumption is required. In this paper, we present a hardware implementation of an event-graph neural network for time-series classification. We leverage an artificial cochlea model to convert the input time-series signals into a sparse event-data format that allows the event-graph to drastically reduce the number of calculations relative to other AI methods. We implemented the design on a SoC FPGA and applied it to the real-time processing of the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset to benchmark our approach against competitive solutions. Our method achieves a floating-point accuracy of 92.7% on the SHD dataset for the base model, which is only 2.4% and 2% less than the state-of-the-art models with over 10% and 67% fewer model parameters, respectively. It also outperforms FPGA-based spiking neural network implementations by 19.3% and 4.5%, achieving 92.3% accuracy for the quantised model while using fewer computational resources and reducing latency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zhou, Bingyan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively develop a global model while maintaining data privacy. However, online FL deployment faces challenges due to distribution shifts and evolving test samples. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) tailors the global model to individual client distributions, but struggles with Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples during testing, leading to performance degradation. In real-world scenarios, balancing personalization and generalization during online testing is crucial and existing methods primarily focus on training-phase generalization. To address the test-time trade-off, we introduce a new scenario: Test-time Generalization for Internal and External Distributions in Federated Learning (TGFL), which evaluates adaptability under Internal Distribution (IND) and External Distribution (EXD). We propose BTFL, a Bayesian-based test-time generalization method for TGFL, which balances generalization and personalization at the sample level during testing. BTFL employs a two-head architecture to store local and global knowledge, interpolating predictions via a dual-Bayesian framework that considers both historical test data and current sample characteristics with theoretical guarantee and faster speed. Our experiments demonstrate that BTFL achieves improved performance across various datasets and models with less time cost.

We attribute two main reasons for such issue: (i) the inductive bias of GNN models: GNNs tend to generate similar representations for proximal nodes. Since graphs often contain a non-negligible amount of inter-cluster links, the bias results in error message passing and leads to biased clustering; (ii) the clustering guided loss function: most traditional approaches strive to make all samples closer to pre-learned cluster centers, which cause a degenerate solution assigning all data points to a single label thus make all samples and less discriminative. To address these challenges, we investigate graph clustering from a graph cut perspective and propose an innovative and non-GNN-based Deep Cut-informed Graph embedding and Clustering framework, namely DCGC. This framework includes two modules: (i) cut-informed graph encoding; (ii) self-supervised graph clustering via optimal transport. For the encoding module, we derive a cut-informed graph embedding objective to fuse graph structure and attributes by minimizing their joint normalized cut. For the clustering module, we utilize the optimal transport theory to obtain the clustering assignments, which can balance the guidance of proximity to the pre-learned cluster center. With the above two tailored designs, DCGC is more suitable for the graph clustering task, which can effectively alleviate the problem of representation collapse and achieve better performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method is simple but effective compared with benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youssef Mroueh</p>
<p>Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was introduced and used successfully to train DeepSeek R1 models for promoting reasoning capabilities of LLMs using verifiable or binary rewards. We show in this paper that GRPO with verifiable rewards can be written as a Kullback Leibler ($\mathsf{KL}$) regularized contrastive loss, where the contrastive samples are synthetic data sampled from the old policy. The optimal GRPO policy $\pi_{n}$ can be expressed explicitly in terms of the binary reward, as well as the first and second order statistics of the old policy ($\pi_{n-1}$) and the reference policy $\pi_0$. Iterating this scheme, we obtain a sequence of policies $\pi_{n}$ for which we can quantify the probability of success $p_n$. We show that the probability of success of the policy satisfies a recurrence that converges to a fixed point of a function that depends on the initial probability of success $p_0$ and the regularization parameter $\beta$ of the $\mathsf{KL}$ regularizer. We show that the fixed point $p^*$ is guaranteed to be larger than $p_0$, thereby demonstrating that GRPO effectively amplifies the probability of success of the policy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tommaso Bendinelli, Artur Dox, Christian Holz</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality, error-free datasets are a key ingredient in building reliable, accurate, and unbiased machine learning (ML) models. However, real world datasets often suffer from errors due to sensor malfunctions, data entry mistakes, or improper data integration across multiple sources that can severely degrade model performance. Detecting and correcting these issues typically require tailor-made solutions and demand extensive domain expertise. Consequently, automation is challenging, rendering the process labor-intensive and tedious. In this study, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can help alleviate the burden of manual data cleaning. We set up an experiment in which an LLM, paired with Python, is tasked with cleaning the training dataset to improve the performance of a learning algorithm without having the ability to modify the training pipeline or perform any feature engineering. We run this experiment on multiple Kaggle datasets that have been intentionally corrupted with errors. Our results show that LLMs can identify and correct erroneous entries, such as illogical values or outlier, by leveraging contextual information from other features within the same row, as well as feedback from previous iterations. However, they struggle to detect more complex errors that require understanding data distribution across multiple rows, such as trends and biases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unified generation of sequence and structure for scientific data (e.g., materials, molecules, proteins) is a critical task. Existing approaches primarily rely on either autoregressive sequence models or diffusion models, each offering distinct advantages and facing notable limitations. Autoregressive models, such as GPT, Llama, and Phi-4, have demonstrated remarkable success in natural language generation and have been extended to multimodal tasks (e.g., image, video, and audio) using advanced encoders like VQ-VAE to represent complex modalities as discrete sequences. However, their direct application to scientific domains is challenging due to the high precision requirements and the diverse nature of scientific data. On the other hand, diffusion models excel at generating high-dimensional scientific data, such as protein, molecule, and material structures, with remarkable accuracy. Yet, their inability to effectively model sequences limits their potential as general-purpose multimodal foundation models. To address these challenges, we propose UniGenX, a unified framework that combines autoregressive next-token prediction with conditional diffusion models. This integration leverages the strengths of autoregressive models to ease the training of conditional diffusion models, while diffusion-based generative heads enhance the precision of autoregressive predictions. We validate the effectiveness of UniGenX on material and small molecule generation tasks, achieving a significant leap in state-of-the-art performance for material crystal structure prediction and establishing new state-of-the-art results for small molecule structure prediction, de novo design, and conditional generation. Notably, UniGenX demonstrates significant improvements, especially in handling long sequences for complex structures, showcasing its efficacy as a versatile tool for scientific data generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Animesh Kumar Paul, Russell Greiner</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) provide a systematic approach for making sequential treatment decisions that adapt to individual patient characteristics, particularly in clinical contexts where survival outcomes are of interest. Censoring-Aware Tree-Based Reinforcement Learning (CA-TRL) is a novel framework to address the complexities associated with censored data when estimating optimal DTRs. We explore ways to learn effective DTRs, from observational data. By enhancing traditional tree-based reinforcement learning methods with augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) and censoring-aware modifications, CA-TRL delivers robust and interpretable treatment strategies. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive simulations and real-world applications using the SANAD epilepsy dataset, where it outperformed the recently proposed ASCL method in key metrics such as restricted mean survival time (RMST) and decision-making accuracy. This work represents a step forward in advancing personalized and data-driven treatment strategies across diverse healthcare settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xavier Thomas, Deepti Ghadiyaram</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Generalization aims to develop models that can generalize to novel and unseen data distributions. In this work, we study how model architectures and pre-training objectives impact feature richness and propose a method to effectively leverage them for domain generalization. Specifically, given a pre-trained feature space, we first discover latent domain structures, referred to as pseudo-domains, that capture domain-specific variations in an unsupervised manner. Next, we augment existing classifiers with these complementary pseudo-domain representations making them more amenable to diverse unseen test domains. We analyze how different pre-training feature spaces differ in the domain-specific variances they capture. Our empirical studies reveal that features from diffusion models excel at separating domains in the absence of explicit domain labels and capture nuanced domain-specific information. On 5 datasets, we show that our very simple framework improves generalization to unseen domains by a maximum test accuracy improvement of over 4% compared to the standard baseline Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). Crucially, our method outperforms most algorithms that access domain labels during training.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study presents a novel integration of unsupervised learning and decision-making strategies for the advanced analysis of 4D-STEM datasets, with a focus on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as the primary clustering method. Our approach introduces a systematic framework to determine the optimal number of components (k) required for robust and interpretable orientation mapping. By leveraging the K-Component Loss method and Image Quality Assessment (IQA) metrics, we effectively balance reconstruction fidelity and model complexity. Additionally, we highlight the critical role of dataset preprocessing in improving clustering stability and accuracy. Furthermore, our spatial weight matrix analysis provides insights into overlapping regions within the dataset by employing threshold-based visualization, facilitating a detailed understanding of cluster interactions. The results demonstrate the potential of combining NMF with advanced IQA metrics and preprocessing techniques for reliable orientation mapping and structural analysis in 4D-STEM datasets, paving the way for future applications in multi-dimensional material characterization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Shen, Aliyah Hsu, Abhineet Agarwal, Bin Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept bottleneck models~(CBM) aim to improve model interpretability by predicting human level ``concepts" in a bottleneck within a deep learning model architecture. However, how the predicted concepts are used in predicting the target still either remains black-box or is simplified to maintain interpretability at the cost of prediction performance. We propose to use Fast Interpretable Greedy Sum-Trees~(FIGS) to obtain Binary Distillation~(BD). This new method, called FIGS-BD, distills a binary-augmented concept-to-target portion of the CBM into an interpretable tree-based model, while mimicking the competitive prediction performance of the CBM teacher. FIGS-BD can be used in downstream tasks to explain and decompose CBM predictions into interpretable binary-concept-interaction attributions and guide adaptive test-time intervention. Across $4$ datasets, we demonstrate that adaptive test-time intervention identifies key concepts that significantly improve performance for realistic human-in-the-loop settings that allow for limited concept interventions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Private machine learning introduces a trade-off between the privacy budget and training performance. Training convergence is substantially slower and extensive hyper parameter tuning is required. Consequently, efficient methods to conduct private training of models is thoroughly investigated in the literature. To this end, we investigate the strength of the data efficient model training methods in the private training setting. We adapt GLISTER (Killamsetty et al., 2021b) to the private setting and extensively assess its performance. We empirically find that practical choices of privacy budgets are too restrictive for data efficient training in the private setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of solving Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) with $d > 1$ constraints when the transition dynamics are unknown, but samples can be drawn from a generative model. We propose a model-based algorithm for infinite horizon CMDPs with multiple constraints in the tabular setting, aiming to derive and prove sample complexity bounds for learning near-optimal policies. Our approach tackles both the relaxed and strict feasibility settings, where relaxed feasibility allows some constraint violations, and strict feasibility requires adherence to all constraints. The main contributions include the development of the algorithm and the derivation of sample complexity bounds for both settings. For the relaxed feasibility setting we show that our algorithm requires $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( \frac{d |\mathcal{S}| |\mathcal{A}| \log(1/\delta)}{(1-\gamma)^3\epsilon^2} \right)$ samples to return $\epsilon$-optimal policy, while in the strict feasibility setting it requires $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( \frac{d^3 |\mathcal{S}| |\mathcal{A}| \log(1/\delta)}{(1-\gamma)^5\epsilon^2{\zeta_{\mathbf{c}}^*}^2} \right)$ samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher S. Yang, Sylvester J. Gates III, Dulara De Zoysa, Jaehoon Choe, Wolfgang Losert, Corey B. Hart</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional artificial neural networks take inspiration from biological networks, using layers of neuron-like nodes to pass information for processing. More realistic models include spiking in the neural network, capturing the electrical characteristics more closely. However, a large proportion of brain cells are of the glial cell type, in particular astrocytes which have been suggested to play a role in performing computations. Here, we introduce a modified spiking neural network model with added astrocyte-like units in a neural network and asses their impact on learning. We implement the network as a liquid state machine and task the network with performing a chaotic time-series prediction task. We varied the number and ratio of neuron-like and astrocyte-like units in the network to examine the latter units effect on learning. We show that the combination of neurons and astrocytes together, as opposed to neural- and astrocyte-only networks, are critical for driving learning. Interestingly, we found that the highest learning rate was achieved when the ratio between astrocyte-like and neuron-like units was roughly 2 to 1, mirroring some estimates of the ratio of biological astrocytes to neurons. Our results demonstrate that incorporating astrocyte-like units which represent information across longer timescales can alter the learning rates of neural networks, and the proportion of astrocytes to neurons should be tuned appropriately to a given task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhawal Gupta, Adam Fisch, Christoph Dann, Alekh Agarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: This work tackles the problem of overoptimization in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), a prevalent technique for aligning models with human preferences. RLHF relies on reward or preference models trained on \emph{fixed preference datasets}, and these models are unreliable when evaluated outside the support of this preference data, leading to the common reward or preference hacking phenomenon. We propose novel, pessimistic objectives for RLHF which are provably robust to overoptimization through the use of pessimism in the face of uncertainty, and design practical algorithms, P3O and PRPO, to optimize these objectives. Our approach is derived for the general preference optimization setting, but can be used with reward models as well. We evaluate P3O and PRPO on the tasks of fine-tuning language models for document summarization and creating helpful assistants, demonstrating remarkable resilience to overoptimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suraiya Tairin, Shohaib Mahmud, Haiying Shen, Anand Iyer</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as an effective approach for enhancing the capacity of deep neural network (DNN) with sub-linear computational costs. However, storing all experts on GPUs incurs significant memory overhead, increasing the monetary cost of MoE-based inference. To address this, we propose eMoE, a memory efficient inference system for MoE-based large language models (LLMs) by leveraging our observations from experiment measurements. eMoE reduces memory usage by predicting and loading only the required experts based on recurrent patterns in expert routing. To reduce loading latency while maintaining accuracy, as we found using the same experts for subsequent prompts has minimal impact on perplexity, eMoE invokes the expert predictor every few prompts rather than for each prompt. In addition, it skips predictions for tasks less sensitive to routing accuracy. Finally, it has task-aware scheduling to minimize inference latency by considering Service Level Objectives (SLOs), task-specific output lengths, and expert loading latencies. Experimental results show that compared to existing systems, eMoE reduces memory consumption by up to 80% while maintaining accuracy and reduces inference latency by up to 17%. It also enables processing prompts 40x longer, batches 4.5x larger, and achieves 1.5x higher throughput.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer, the backbone architecture of multiple phenomenal language models, leverages sparsity by activating only a fraction of model parameters for each input token. The sparse structure, while allowing constant time costs, results in space inefficiency: we still need to load all the model parameters during inference. We introduce ResMoE, an innovative MoE approximation framework that utilizes Wasserstein barycenter to extract a common expert (barycenter expert) and approximate the residuals between this barycenter expert and the original ones. ResMoE enhances the space efficiency for inference of large-scale MoE Transformers in a one-shot and data-agnostic manner without retraining while maintaining minimal accuracy loss, thereby paving the way for broader accessibility to large language models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ResMoE through extensive experiments on Switch Transformer, Mixtral, and DeepSeekMoE models. The results show that ResMoE can reduce the number of parameters in an expert by up to 75% while maintaining comparable performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenghai Xue, Lang Feng, Jiacheng Xu, Kang Kang, Xiang Wen, Bo An, Shuicheng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: To learn from data collected in diverse dynamics, Imitation from Observation (IfO) methods leverage expert state trajectories based on the premise that recovering expert state distributions in other dynamics facilitates policy learning in the current one. However, Imitation Learning inherently imposes a performance upper bound of learned policies. Additionally, as the environment dynamics change, certain expert states may become inaccessible, rendering their distributions less valuable for imitation. To address this, we propose a novel framework that integrates reward maximization with IfO, employing F-distance regularized policy optimization. This framework enforces constraints on globally accessible states--those with nonzero visitation frequency across all considered dynamics--mitigating the challenge posed by inaccessible states. By instantiating F-distance in different ways, we derive two theoretical analysis and develop a practical algorithm called Accessible State Oriented Policy Regularization (ASOR). ASOR serves as a general add-on module that can be incorporated into various RL approaches, including offline RL and off-policy RL. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate ASOR's effectiveness in enhancing state-of-the-art cross-domain policy transfer algorithms, significantly improving their performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanshan Yan, Zexi Li, Chao Wu, Meng Pang, Yang Lu, Yan Yan, Hanzi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data heterogeneity, stemming from local non-IID data and global long-tailed distributions, is a major challenge in federated learning (FL), leading to significant performance gaps compared to centralized learning. Previous research found that poor representations and biased classifiers are the main problems and proposed neural-collapse-inspired synthetic simplex ETF to help representations be closer to neural collapse optima. However, we find that the neural-collapse-inspired methods are not strong enough to reach neural collapse and still have huge gaps to centralized training. In this paper, we rethink this issue from a self-bootstrap perspective and propose FedYoYo (You Are Your Own Best Teacher), introducing Augmented Self-bootstrap Distillation (ASD) to improve representation learning by distilling knowledge between weakly and strongly augmented local samples, without needing extra datasets or models. We further introduce Distribution-aware Logit Adjustment (DLA) to balance the self-bootstrap process and correct biased feature representations. FedYoYo nearly eliminates the performance gap, achieving centralized-level performance even under mixed heterogeneity. It enhances local representation learning, reducing model drift and improving convergence, with feature prototypes closer to neural collapse optimality. Extensive experiments show FedYoYo achieves state-of-the-art results, even surpassing centralized logit adjustment methods by 5.4\% under global long-tailed settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a novel way to integrate flexible, context-dependent constraints into combinatorial optimization by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside traditional algorithms. Although LLMs excel at interpreting nuanced, locally specified requirements, they struggle with enforcing global combinatorial feasibility. To bridge this gap, we propose an iterated fine-tuning framework where algorithmic feedback progressively refines the LLM's output distribution. Interpreting this as simulated annealing, we introduce a formal model based on a "coarse learnability" assumption, providing sample complexity bounds for convergence. Empirical evaluations on scheduling, graph connectivity, and clustering tasks demonstrate that our framework balances the flexibility of locally expressed constraints with rigorous global optimization more effectively compared to baseline sampling methods. Our results highlight a promising direction for hybrid AI-driven combinatorial reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngeun Kim, Seunghwan Lee, Aecheon Jung, Bogon Ryu, Sungeun Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging enables efficient multi-task models by combining task-specific fine-tuned checkpoints. However, storing multiple task-specific checkpoints requires significant memory, limiting scalability and restricting model merging to larger models and diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose quantizing task vectors (i.e., the difference between pre-trained and fine-tuned checkpoints) instead of quantizing fine-tuned checkpoints. We observe that task vectors exhibit a narrow weight range, enabling low precision quantization (up to 4 bit) within existing task vector merging frameworks. To further mitigate quantization errors within ultra-low bit precision (e.g., 2 bit), we introduce Residual Task Vector Quantization, which decomposes the task vector into a base vector and offset component. We allocate bits based on quantization sensitivity, ensuring precision while minimizing error within a memory budget. Experiments on image classification and dense prediction show our method maintains or improves model merging performance while using only 8% of the memory required for full-precision checkpoints.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the growing attention to time series forecasting in recent years, many studies have proposed various solutions to address the challenges encountered in time series prediction, aiming to improve forecasting performance. However, effectively applying these time series forecasting models to the field of financial asset pricing remains a challenging issue. There is still a need for a bridge to connect cutting-edge time series forecasting models with financial asset pricing. To bridge this gap, we have undertaken the following efforts: 1) We constructed three datasets from the financial domain; 2) We selected over ten time series forecasting models from recent studies and validated their performance in financial time series; 3) We developed new metrics, msIC and msIR, in addition to MSE and MAE, to showcase the time series correlation captured by the models; 4) We designed financial-specific tasks for these three datasets and assessed the practical performance and application potential of these forecasting models in important financial problems. We hope the developed new evaluation suite, FinTSBridge, can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and robustness of advanced forecasting models in finanical domains.</p>

One-shot FL has become a compelling learning paradigm to overcome above drawbacks by enabling the training of a global server model via a single communication round. However, existing one-shot FL methods suffer from expensive computation cost on the server or clients and cannot deal with non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data stably and effectively. To address these challenges, this paper proposes FedCGS, a novel Federated learning algorithm that Capture Global feature Statistics leveraging pre-trained models. With global feature statistics, we achieve training-free and heterogeneity-resistant one-shot FL. Furthermore, we extend its application to personalization scenario, where clients only need execute one extra communication round with server to download global statistics. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across diverse data heterogeneity settings. Code is available at https://github.com/Yuqin-G/FedCGS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqing Xu, Hancheng Min, Lachlan Ewen MacDonald, Jinqi Luo, Salma Tarmoun, Enrique Mallada, Rene Vidal</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the empirical success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in fine-tuning pre-trained models, there is little theoretical understanding of how first-order methods with carefully crafted initialization adapt models to new tasks. In this work, we take the first step towards bridging this gap by theoretically analyzing the learning dynamics of LoRA for matrix factorization (MF) under gradient flow (GF), emphasizing the crucial role of initialization. For small initialization, we theoretically show that GF converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution, with smaller initialization leading to lower final error. Our analysis shows that the final error is affected by the misalignment between the singular spaces of the pre-trained model and the target matrix, and reducing the initialization scale improves alignment. To address this misalignment, we propose a spectral initialization for LoRA in MF and theoretically prove that GF with small spectral initialization converges to the fine-tuning task with arbitrary precision. Numerical experiments from MF and image classification validate our findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Mahfoud, Ghait Boukachab, Micha{\l} Koziarski, Alex Hernandez-Garcia, Stefan Bauer, Yoshua Bengio, Nikolay Malkin</p>
<p>Abstract: Building predictive models for tabular data presents fundamental challenges, notably in scaling consistently, i.e., more resources translating to better performance, and generalizing systematically beyond the training data distribution. Designing decision tree models remains especially challenging given the intractably large search space, and most existing methods rely on greedy heuristics, while deep learning inductive biases expect a temporal or spatial structure not naturally present in tabular data. We propose a hybrid amortized structure inference approach to learn predictive decision tree ensembles given data, formulating decision tree construction as a sequential planning problem. We train a deep reinforcement learning (GFlowNet) policy to solve this problem, yielding a generative model that samples decision trees from the Bayesian posterior. We show that our approach, DT-GFN, outperforms state-of-the-art decision tree and deep learning methods on standard classification benchmarks derived from real-world data, robustness to distribution shifts, and anomaly detection, all while yielding interpretable models with shorter description lengths. Samples from the trained DT-GFN model can be ensembled to construct a random forest, and we further show that the performance of scales consistently in ensemble size, yielding ensembles of predictors that continue to generalize systematically.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonsoo Jo, Jongha Lee, Fanchen Bu, Kijung Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Time-evolving graphs, such as social and citation networks, often contain noise that distorts structural and temporal patterns, adversely affecting downstream tasks, such as node classification. Existing purification methods focus on static graphs, limiting their ability to account for critical temporal dependencies in dynamic graphs. In this work, we propose TiGer (Time-evolving Graph purifier), a self-supervised method explicitly designed for time-evolving graphs. TiGer assigns two different sub-scores to edges using (1) self-attention for capturing long-term contextual patterns shaped by both adjacent and distant past events of varying significance and (2) statistical distance measures for detecting inconsistency over a short-term period. These sub-scores are used to identify and filter out suspicious (i.e., noise-like) edges through an ensemble strategy, ensuring robustness without requiring noise labels. Our experiments on five real-world datasets show TiGer filters out noise with up to 10.2% higher accuracy and improves node classification performance by up to 5.3%, compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06991">Are We Truly Forgetting? A Critical Re-examination of Machine Unlearning Evaluation Protocols</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongwoo Kim, Sungmin Cha, Donghyun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning is a process to remove specific data points from a trained model while maintaining the performance on retain data, addressing privacy or legal requirements. Despite its importance, existing unlearning evaluations tend to focus on logit-based metrics (i.e., accuracy) under small-scale scenarios. We observe that this could lead to a false sense of security in unlearning approaches under real-world scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a new comprehensive evaluation that employs representation-based evaluations of the unlearned model under large-scale scenarios to verify whether the unlearning approaches genuinely eliminate the targeted forget data from the model's representation perspective. Our analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art unlearning approaches either completely degrade the representational quality of the unlearned model or merely modify the classifier (i.e., the last layer), thereby achieving superior logit-based evaluation metrics while maintaining significant representational similarity to the original model. Furthermore, we introduce a novel unlearning evaluation setup from a transfer learning perspective, in which the forget set classes exhibit semantic similarity to downstream task classes, necessitating that feature representations diverge significantly from those of the original model. Our comprehensive benchmark not only addresses a critical gap between theoretical machine unlearning and practical scenarios, but also establishes a foundation to inspire future research directions in developing genuinely effective unlearning methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihao Hou, Xinyi Shang, Shreyank N Gowda, Yang Lu, Chao Wu, Yan Yan, Hanzi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Effectively handling the co-occurrence of non-IID data and long-tailed distributions remains a critical challenge in federated learning. While fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP has shown to be promising in addressing non-IID data challenges, this approach leads to severe degradation of tail classes in federated long-tailed scenarios. Under the composite effects of strong non-IID data distribution and long-tailed class imbalances, VLM fine-tuning may even fail to yield any improvement. To address this issue, we propose Class-Aware Prompt Learning for Federated Long-tailed Learning (CAPT), a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained VLM to effectively handle both data heterogeneity and long-tailed distributions. CAPT introduces a dual-prompt mechanism that synergizes general and class-aware prompts, enabling the framework to capture global trends while preserving class-specific knowledge. To better aggregate and share knowledge across clients, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware client clustering strategy that groups clients based on their data distributions, enabling efficient collaboration and knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments on various long-tailed datasets with different levels of data heterogeneity demonstrate that CAPT significantly improves tail class performance without compromising overall accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in federated long-tailed learning scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Liu, Lan Wang, Bing Yang, Hao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Water quality data can supply a substantial decision support for water resources utilization and pollution prevention. However, there are numerous missing values in water quality data due to inescapable factors like sensor failure, thereby leading to biased result for hydrological analysis and failing to support environmental governance decision accurately. A Latent Factorization of Tensors (LFT) with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) proves to be an efficient imputation method. However, a standard SGD-based LFT model commonly surfers from the slow convergence that impairs its efficiency. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a Fast Latent Factorization of Tensors (FLFT) model. It constructs an adjusted instance error into SGD via leveraging a nonlinear PID controller to incorporates the past, current and future information of prediction error for improving convergence rate. Comparing with state-of-art models in real world datasets, the results of experiment indicate that the FLFT model achieves a better convergence rate and higher accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Senetaire, Paul Jeha, Pierre-Alexandre Mattei, Jes Frellsen</p>
<p>Abstract: Training an energy-based model (EBM) with maximum likelihood is challenging due to the intractable normalisation constant. Traditional methods rely on expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to estimate the gradient of logartihm of the normalisation constant. We propose a novel objective called self-normalised log-likelihood (SNL) that introduces a single additional learnable parameter representing the normalisation constant compared to the regular log-likelihood. SNL is a lower bound of the log-likelihood, and its optimum corresponds to both the maximum likelihood estimate of the model parameters and the normalisation constant. We show that the SNL objective is concave in the model parameters for exponential family distributions. Unlike the regular log-likelihood, the SNL can be directly optimised using stochastic gradient techniques by sampling from a crude proposal distribution. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed method on various density estimation tasks as well as EBMs for regression. Our results show that the proposed method, while simpler to implement and tune, outperforms existing techniques.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07056">Generative method for aerodynamic optimization based on classifier-free guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shisong Deng, Qiang Zhang, Zhengyang Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverse design approach, which directly generates optimal aerodynamic shape with neural network models to meet designated performance targets, has drawn enormous attention. However, the current state-of-the-art inverse design approach for airfoils, which is based on generative adversarial network, demonstrates insufficient precision in its generating and training processes and struggles to reveal the coupling relationship among specified performance indicators. To address these issues, the airfoil inverse design framework based on the classifier-free guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (CDDPM) is proposed innovatively in this paper. First, the CDDPM can effectively capture the correlations among specific performance indicators and, by adjusting the classifier-free guide coefficient, generate corresponding upper and lower surface pressure coefficient distributions based on designated pressure features. These distributions are then accurately translated into airfoil geometries through a mapping model. Experimental results using classical transonic airfoils as examples show that the inverse design based on CDDPM can generate a variety of pressure coefficient distributions, which enriches the diversity of design results. Compared with current state-of-the-art Wasserstein generative adversarial network methods, CDDPM achieves a 33.6% precision improvement in airfoil generating tasks. Moreover, a practical method to readjust each performance indicator value is proposed based on global optimization algorithm in conjunction with active learning strategy, aiming to provide rational value combination of performance indicators for the inverse design framework. This work is not only suitable for the airfoils design, but also has the capability to apply to optimization process of general product parts targeting selected performance indicators.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07066">You Only Debias Once: Towards Flexible Accuracy-Fairness Trade-offs at Inference Time</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaotian Han, Tianlong Chen, Kaixiong Zhou, Zhimeng Jiang, Zhangyang Wang, Xia Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks are prone to various bias issues, jeopardizing their applications for high-stake decision-making. Existing fairness methods typically offer a fixed accuracy-fairness trade-off, since the weight of the well-trained model is a fixed point (fairness-optimum) in the weight space. Nevertheless, more flexible accuracy-fairness trade-offs at inference time are practically desired since: 1) stakes of the same downstream task can vary for different individuals, and 2) different regions have diverse laws or regularization for fairness. If using the previous fairness methods, we have to train multiple models, each offering a specific level of accuracy-fairness trade-off. This is often computationally expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to deploy, making it less practical for real-world applications. To address this problem, we propose You Only Debias Once (YODO) to achieve in-situ flexible accuracy-fairness trade-offs at inference time, using a single model that trained only once. Instead of pursuing one individual fixed point (fairness-optimum) in the weight space, we aim to find a "line" in the weight space that connects the accuracy-optimum and fairness-optimum points using a single model. Points (models) on this line implement varying levels of accuracy-fairness trade-offs. At inference time, by manually selecting the specific position of the learned "line", our proposed method can achieve arbitrary accuracy-fairness trade-offs for different end-users and scenarios. Experimental results on tabular and image datasets show that YODO achieves flexible trade-offs between model accuracy and fairness, at ultra-low overheads. For example, if we need $100$ levels of trade-off on the \acse dataset, YODO takes $3.53$ seconds while training $100$ fixed models consumes $425$ seconds.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Apivich Hemachandra, Gregory Kang Ruey Lau, See-Kiong Ng, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</p>
<p>Abstract: In many science and engineering settings, system dynamics are characterized by governing PDEs, and a major challenge is to solve inverse problems (IPs) where unknown PDE parameters are inferred based on observational data gathered under limited budget. Due to the high costs of setting up and running experiments, experimental design (ED) is often done with the help of PDE simulations to optimize for the most informative design parameters to solve such IPs, prior to actual data collection. This process of optimizing design parameters is especially critical when the budget and other practical constraints make it infeasible to adjust the design parameters between trials during the experiments. However, existing experimental design (ED) methods tend to require sequential and frequent design parameter adjustments between trials. Furthermore, they also have significant computational bottlenecks due to the need for complex numerical simulations for PDEs, and do not exploit the advantages provided by physics informed neural networks (PINNs), such as its meshless solutions, differentiability, and amortized training. This work presents PIED, the first ED framework that makes use of PINNs in a fully differentiable architecture to perform continuous optimization of design parameters for IPs for one-shot deployments. PIED overcomes existing methods' computational bottlenecks through parallelized computation and meta-learning of PINN parameter initialization, and proposes novel methods to effectively take into account PINN training dynamics in optimizing the ED parameters. Through experiments based on noisy simulated data and even real world experimental data, we empirically show that given limited observation budget, PIED significantly outperforms existing ED methods in solving IPs, including challenging settings where the inverse parameters are unknown functions rather than just finite-dimensional.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanis Basso-Bert, Anca Molnos, Romain Lemaire, William Guicquero, Antoine Dupret</p>
<p>Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) are a promising approach to enable Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implementation on ultra-low power edge devices. Such devices may compute data in highly dynamic environments, in which the classes targeted for inference can evolve or even novel classes may arise, requiring continual learning. Class Incremental Learning (CIL) is a common type of continual learning for classification problems, that has been scarcely addressed in the context of BNNs. Furthermore, most of existing BNNs models are not fully binary, as they require several real-valued network layers, at the input, the output, and for batch normalization. This paper goes a step further, enabling class incremental learning in Fully-Binarized NNs (FBNNs) through four main contributions. We firstly revisit the FBNN design and its training procedure that is suitable to CIL. Secondly, we explore loss balancing, a method to trade-off the performance of past and current classes. Thirdly, we propose a semi-supervised method to pre-train the feature extractor of the FBNN for transferable representations. Fourthly, two conventional CIL methods, \ie, Latent and Native replay, are thoroughly compared. These contributions are exemplified first on the CIFAR100 dataset, before being scaled up to address the CORE50 continual learning benchmark. The final results based on our 3Mb FBNN on CORE50 exhibit at par and better performance than conventional real-valued larger NN models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Continual learning is learning from a sequence of tasks with the aim of learning new tasks without forgetting old tasks. Sequential function-space variational inference (SFSVI) is a continual learning method based on variational inference which uses a Gaussian variational distribution to approximate the distribution of the outputs of a finite number of selected inducing points. Since the posterior distribution of a neural network is multi-modal, a Gaussian distribution could only match one mode of the posterior distribution, and a Gaussian mixture distribution could be used to better approximate the posterior distribution. We propose an SFSVI method which uses a Gaussian mixture variational distribution. We also compare different types of variational inference methods with and without a fixed pre-trained feature extractor. We find that in terms of final average accuracy, Gaussian mixture methods perform better than Gaussian methods and likelihood-focused methods perform better than prior-focused methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: A key challenge in tuning Model Predictive Control (MPC) cost function parameters is to ensure that the system performance stays consistently above a certain threshold. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method, COAT-MPC, Constrained Optimal Auto-Tuner for MPC. With every tuning iteration, COAT-MPC gathers performance data and learns by updating its posterior belief. It explores the tuning parameters' domain towards optimistic parameters in a goal-directed fashion, which is key to its sample efficiency. We theoretically analyze COAT-MPC, showing that it satisfies performance constraints with arbitrarily high probability at all times and provably converges to the optimum performance within finite time. Through comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses with a hardware platform, we demonstrate the effectiveness of COAT-MPC in comparison to classical Bayesian Optimization (BO) and other state-of-the-art methods. When applied to autonomous racing, our approach outperforms baselines in terms of constraint violations and cumulative regret over time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved astonishing successes in many domains, especially with the recent breakthroughs in the development of foundational large models. These large models, leveraging their extensive training data, provide versatile solutions for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, as modern datasets become increasingly diverse and complex, the development of large AI models faces two major challenges: (1) the enormous consumption of computational resources and deployment difficulties, and (2) the difficulty in fitting heterogeneous and complex data, which limits the usability of the models. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models has recently attracted much attention in addressing these challenges, by dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant sub-models to process input data. It has been shown that MoEs can significantly improve model performance and efficiency with fewer resources, particularly excelling in handling large-scale, multimodal data. Given the tremendous potential MoE has demonstrated across various domains, it is urgent to provide a comprehensive summary of recent advancements of MoEs in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE have their limitations, e.g., being outdated or lacking discussion on certain key areas, and we aim to address these gaps. In this paper, we first introduce the basic design of MoE, including gating functions, expert networks, routing mechanisms, training strategies, and system design. We then explore the algorithm design of MoE in important machine learning paradigms such as continual learning, meta-learning, multi-task learning, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, we summarize theoretical studies aimed at understanding MoE and review its applications in computer vision and natural language processing. Finally, we discuss promising future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanlong Wu, Mingxing Nie, Tao Zhu, Liming Chen, Huansheng Ning, Yaping Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) for time series data faces critical challenges in balancing stability against catastrophic forgetting and plasticity for new knowledge acquisition, particularly under real-world constraints where historical data access is restricted. While pre-trained models (PTMs) have shown promise in CIL for vision and NLP domains, their potential in time series class-incremental learning (TSCIL) remains underexplored due to the scarcity of large-scale time series pre-trained models. Prompted by the recent emergence of large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) for time series data, we present the first exploration of PTM-based Time Series Class-Incremental Learning (TSCIL). Our approach leverages frozen PTM backbones coupled with incrementally tuning the shared adapter, preserving generalization capabilities while mitigating feature drift through knowledge distillation. Furthermore, we introduce a Feature Drift Compensation Network (DCN), designed with a novel two-stage training strategy to precisely model feature space transformations across incremental tasks. This allows for accurate projection of old class prototypes into the new feature space. By employing DCN-corrected prototypes, we effectively enhance the unified classifier retraining, mitigating model feature drift and alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with our method yielding final accuracy gains of 1.4%-6.1% across all datasets compared to existing PTM-based approaches. Our work establishes a new paradigm for TSCIL, providing insights into stability-plasticity optimization for continual learning systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in foundation models through generative pre-training, yet algorithmic innovation in this space has largely stagnated around autoregressive models for discrete signals and diffusion models for continuous signals. This stagnation creates a bottleneck that prevents us from fully unlocking the potential of rich multi-modal data, which in turn limits the progress on multimodal intelligence. We argue that an inference-first perspective, which prioritizes scaling efficiency during inference time across sequence length and refinement steps, can inspire novel generative pre-training algorithms. Using Inductive Moment Matching (IMM) as a concrete example, we demonstrate how addressing limitations in diffusion models' inference process through targeted modifications yields a stable, single-stage algorithm that achieves superior sample quality with over an order of magnitude greater inference efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent methods for auditing the privacy of machine learning algorithms have improved computational efficiency by simultaneously intervening on multiple training examples in a single training run. Steinke et al. (2024) prove that one-run auditing indeed lower bounds the true privacy parameter of the audited algorithm, and give impressive empirical results. Their work leaves open the question of how precisely one-run auditing can uncover the true privacy parameter of an algorithm, and how that precision depends on the audited algorithm. In this work, we characterize the maximum achievable efficacy of one-run auditing and show that one-run auditing can only perfectly uncover the true privacy parameters of algorithms whose structure allows the effects of individual data elements to be isolated. Our characterization helps reveal how and when one-run auditing is still a promising technique for auditing real machine learning algorithms, despite these fundamental gaps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangwoo Park, Seanie Lee, Byungjoo Kim, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widely used framework for training models in a decentralized manner, ensuring that the central server does not have direct access to data from local clients. However, this approach may still fail to fully preserve data privacy, as models from local clients are exposed to the central server during the aggregation process. This issue becomes even more critical when training vision-language models (VLMs) with FL, as VLMs can easily memorize training data instances, making them vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs). To address this challenge, we propose the FedRand framework, which avoids disclosing the full set of client parameters. In this framework, each client randomly selects subparameters of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) from the server and keeps the remaining counterparts of the LoRA weights as private parameters. After training both parameters on the client's private dataset, only the non-private client parameters are sent back to the server for aggregation. This approach mitigates the risk of exposing client-side VLM parameters, thereby enhancing data privacy. We empirically validate that FedRand improves robustness against MIAs compared to relevant baselines while achieving accuracy comparable to methods that communicate full LoRA parameters across several benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Jourdan, Gregory Schwartzman, Peter Macgregor, He Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Coresets have become an invaluable tool for solving $k$-means and kernel $k$-means clustering problems on large datasets with small numbers of clusters. On the other hand, spectral clustering works well on sparse graphs and has recently been extended to scale efficiently to large numbers of clusters. We exploit the connection between kernel $k$-means and the normalised cut problem to combine the benefits of both. Our main result is a coreset spectral clustering algorithm for graphs that clusters a coreset graph to infer a good labelling of the original graph. We prove that an $\alpha$-approximation for the normalised cut problem on the coreset graph is an $O(\alpha)$-approximation on the original. We also improve the running time of the state-of-the-art coreset algorithm for kernel $k$-means on sparse kernels, from $\tilde{O}(nk)$ to $\tilde{O}(n\cdot \min \{k, d_{avg}\})$, where $d_{avg}$ is the average number of non-zero entries in each row of the $n\times n$ kernel matrix. Our experiments confirm our coreset algorithm is asymptotically faster on large real-world graphs with many clusters, and show that our clustering algorithm overcomes the main challenge faced by coreset kernel $k$-means on sparse kernels which is getting stuck in local optima.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shan He, Ruiyang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of seismic responses and quantification of structural damage are critical in civil engineering. Traditional approaches such as finite element analysis could lack computational efficiency, especially for complex structural systems under extreme hazards. Recently, artificial intelligence has provided an alternative to efficiently model highly nonlinear behaviors. However, existing models face challenges in generalizing across diverse structural systems. This paper proposes a novel multi-channel gated recurrent unit (MC-GRU) network aimed at achieving generalized nonlinear structural response prediction for varying structures. The key concept lies in the integration of a multi-channel input mechanism to GRU with an extra input of structural information to the candidate hidden state, which enables the network to learn the dynamic characteristics of diverse structures and thus empower the generalizability and adaptiveness to unseen structures. The performance of the proposed MC-GRU is validated through a series of case studies, including a single-degree-of-freedom linear system, a hysteretic Bouc-Wen system, and a nonlinear reinforced concrete column from experimental testing. Results indicate that the proposed MC-GRU overcomes the major generalizability issues of existing methods, with capability of accurately inferring seismic responses of varying structures. Additionally, it demonstrates enhanced capabilities in representing nonlinear structural dynamics compared to traditional models such as GRU and LSTM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amin Farajzadeh, Animesh Yadav, Halim Yanikomeroglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are emerging as a core component of future 6G communication systems, providing global connectivity and supporting data-intensive applications. In this paper, we propose a distributed hierarchical federated learning (HFL) framework within the NTN architecture, leveraging a high altitude platform station (HAPS) constellation as intermediate distributed FL servers. Our framework integrates both low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and ground clients in the FL training process while utilizing geostationary orbit (GEO) and medium-Earth orbit (MEO) satellites as relays to exchange FL global models across other HAPS constellations worldwide, enabling seamless, global-scale learning. The proposed framework offers several key benefits: (i) enhanced privacy through the decentralization of the FL mechanism by leveraging the HAPS constellation, (ii) improved model accuracy and reduced training loss while balancing latency, (iii) increased scalability of FL systems through ubiquitous connectivity by utilizing MEO and GEO satellites, and (iv) the ability to use FL data, such as resource utilization metrics, to further optimize the NTN architecture from a network management perspective. A numerical study demonstrates the proposed framework's effectiveness, with improved model accuracy, reduced training loss, and efficient latency management. The article also includes a brief review of FL in NTNs and highlights key challenges and future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cristian Perez Jensen, Seyedmorteza Sadat</p>
<p>Abstract: While classifier-free guidance (CFG) is essential for conditional diffusion models, it doubles the number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) per inference step. To mitigate this inefficiency, we introduce adapter guidance distillation (AGD), a novel approach that simulates CFG in a single forward pass. AGD leverages lightweight adapters to approximate CFG, effectively doubling the sampling speed while maintaining or even improving sample quality. Unlike prior guidance distillation methods that tune the entire model, AGD keeps the base model frozen and only trains minimal additional parameters ($\sim$2%) to significantly reduce the resource requirement of the distillation phase. Additionally, this approach preserves the original model weights and enables the adapters to be seamlessly combined with other checkpoints derived from the same base model. We also address a key mismatch between training and inference in existing guidance distillation methods by training on CFG-guided trajectories instead of standard diffusion trajectories. Through extensive experiments, we show that AGD achieves comparable or superior FID to CFG across multiple architectures with only half the NFEs. Notably, our method enables the distillation of large models ($\sim$2.6B parameters) on a single consumer GPU with 24 GB of VRAM, making it more accessible than previous approaches that require multiple high-end GPUs. We will publicly release the implementation of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyue Dai, Ignavier Ng, Jianle Sun, Zeyu Tang, Gongxu Luo, Xinshuai Dong, Peter Spirtes, Kun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the common yet often-overlooked selection bias in interventional studies, where subjects are selectively enrolled into experiments. For instance, participants in a drug trial are usually patients of the relevant disease; A/B tests on mobile applications target existing users only, and gene perturbation studies typically focus on specific cell types, such as cancer cells. Ignoring this bias leads to incorrect causal discovery results. Even when recognized, the existing paradigm for interventional causal discovery still fails to address it. This is because subtle differences in when and where interventions happen can lead to significantly different statistical patterns. We capture this dynamic by introducing a graphical model that explicitly accounts for both the observed world (where interventions are applied) and the counterfactual world (where selection occurs while interventions have not been applied). We characterize the Markov property of the model, and propose a provably sound algorithm to identify causal relations as well as selection mechanisms up to the equivalence class, from data with soft interventions and unknown targets. Through synthetic and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm effectively identifies true causal relations despite the presence of selection bias.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Qiao, Zhaoxuan Wu, Jingtan Wang, Pang Wei Koh, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models often have uneven performance among subpopulations (a.k.a., groups) in the data distributions. This poses a significant challenge for the models to generalize when the proportions of the groups shift during deployment. To improve robustness to such shifts, existing approaches have developed strategies that train models or perform hyperparameter tuning using the group-labeled data to minimize the worst-case loss over groups. However, a non-trivial amount of high-quality labels is often required to obtain noticeable improvements. Given the costliness of the labels, we propose to adopt a different paradigm to enhance group label efficiency: utilizing the group-labeled data as a target set to optimize the weights of other group-unlabeled data. We introduce Group-robust Sample Reweighting (GSR), a two-stage approach that first learns the representations from group-unlabeled data, and then tinkers the model by iteratively retraining its last layer on the reweighted data using influence functions. Our GSR is theoretically sound, practically lightweight, and effective in improving the robustness to subpopulation shifts. In particular, GSR outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches that require the same amount or even more group labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khoat Than, Dat Phan</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural network (NN) with millions or billions of parameters can perform really well on unseen data, after being trained from a finite training set. Various prior theories have been developed to explain such excellent ability of NNs, but do not provide a meaningful bound on the test error. Some recent theories, based on PAC-Bayes and mutual information, are non-vacuous and hence show a great potential to explain the excellent performance of NNs. However, they often require a stringent assumption and extensive modification (e.g. compression, quantization) to the trained model of interest. Therefore, those prior theories provide a guarantee for the modified versions only. In this paper, we propose two novel bounds on the test error of a model. Our bounds uses the training set only and require no modification to the model. Those bounds are verified on a large class of modern NNs, pretrained by Pytorch on the ImageNet dataset, and are non-vacuous. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first non-vacuous bounds at this large scale, without any modification to the pretrained models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kha Vo, Chin-Teng Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by a graph-based technique for predicting molecular properties in quantum chemistry -- atoms' position within molecules in three-dimensional space -- we present Q-MARL, a completely decentralised learning architecture that supports very large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios without the need for strong assumptions like common rewards or agent order. The key is to treat each agent as relative to its surrounding agents in an environment that is presumed to change dynamically. Hence, in each time step, an agent is the centre of its own neighbourhood and also a neighbour to many other agents. Each role is formulated as a sub-graph, and each sub-graph is used as a training sample. A message-passing neural network supports full-scale vertex and edge interaction within a local neighbourhood, while a parameter governing the depth of the sub-graphs eases the training burden. During testing, an agent's actions are locally ensembled across all the sub-graphs that contain it, resulting in robust decisions. Where other approaches struggle to manage 50 agents, Q-MARL can easily marshal thousands. A detailed theoretical analysis proves improvement and convergence, and simulations with the typical collaborative and competitive scenarios show dramatically faster training speeds and reduced training losses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangdi Liu, Ling An, Mengke Song, Zhuohang Yu, Shan Wang, Kezhen Qi, Zhenyu Zhang, Chichun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The design of inorganic catalysts and the prediction of their catalytic efficiency are fundamental challenges in chemistry and materials science. Traditional catalyst evaluation methods primarily rely on machine learning techniques; however, these methods often struggle to process multi-source heterogeneous data, limiting both predictive accuracy and generalization. To address these limitations, this study introduces the Embedding-Attention-Permutated CNN-Residual (EAPCR) deep learning model. EAPCR constructs a feature association matrix using embedding and attention mechanisms and enhances predictive performance through permutated CNN architectures and residual connections. This approach enables the model to accurately capture complex feature interactions across various catalytic conditions, leading to precise efficiency predictions. EAPCR serves as a powerful tool for computational researchers while also assisting domain experts in optimizing catalyst design, effectively bridging the gap between data-driven modeling and experimental applications. We evaluate EAPCR on datasets from TiO2 photocatalysis, thermal catalysis, and electrocatalysis, demonstrating its superiority over traditional machine learning methods (e.g., linear regression, random forest) as well as conventional deep learning models (e.g., ANN, NNs). Across multiple evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R2, and RMSE), EAPCR consistently outperforms existing approaches. These findings highlight the strong potential of EAPCR in inorganic catalytic efficiency prediction. As a versatile deep learning framework, EAPCR not only improves predictive accuracy but also establishes a solid foundation for future large-scale model development in inorganic catalysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is critical for real-world deployment, yet existing methods like RLHF face computational and stability challenges. While DPO establishes an offline paradigm with single hyperparameter $\beta$, subsequent methods like SimPO reintroduce complexity through dual parameters ($\beta$, $\gamma$). We propose {ReLU-based Preference Optimization (RePO)}, a streamlined algorithm that eliminates $\beta$ via two advances: (1) retaining SimPO's reference-free margins but removing $\beta$ through gradient analysis, and (2) adopting a ReLU-based max-margin loss that naturally filters trivial pairs. Theoretically, RePO is characterized as SimPO's limiting case ($\beta \to \infty$), where the logistic weighting collapses to binary thresholding, forming a convex envelope of the 0-1 loss. Empirical results on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard show that RePO outperforms DPO and SimPO across multiple base models, requiring only one hyperparameter to tune.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07453">Is a Good Foundation Necessary for Efficient Reinforcement Learning? The Computational Role of the Base Model in Exploration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan J. Foster, Zakaria Mhammedi, Dhruv Rohatgi</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model alignment (or, reinforcement learning) techniques that leverage active exploration -- deliberately encouraging the model to produce diverse, informative responses -- offer the promise of super-human capabilities. However, current understanding of algorithm design primitives for computationally efficient exploration with language models is limited. To better understand how to leverage access to powerful pre-trained generative models to improve the efficiency of exploration, we introduce a new computational framework for RL with language models, in which the learner interacts with the model through a sampling oracle. Focusing on the linear softmax model parameterization, we provide new results that reveal the computational-statistical tradeoffs of efficient exploration:
  1. Necessity of coverage: Coverage refers to the extent to which the pre-trained model covers near-optimal responses -- a form of hidden knowledge. We show that coverage, while not necessary for data efficiency, lower bounds the runtime of any algorithm in our framework.
  2. Inference-time exploration: We introduce a new algorithm, SpannerSampling, which obtains optimal data efficiency and is computationally efficient whenever the pre-trained model enjoys sufficient coverage, matching our lower bound. SpannerSampling leverages inference-time computation with the pre-trained model to reduce the effective search space for exploration.
  3. Insufficiency of training-time interventions: We contrast the result above by showing that training-time interventions that produce proper policies cannot achieve similar guarantees in polynomial time.
  4. Computational benefits of multi-turn exploration: Finally, we show that under additional representational assumptions, one can achieve improved runtime (replacing sequence-level coverage with token-level coverage) through multi-turn exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jimmy Gammell, Anand Raghunathan, Abolfazl Hashemi, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: While cryptographic algorithms such as the ubiquitous Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are secure, *physical implementations* of these algorithms in hardware inevitably 'leak' sensitive data such as cryptographic keys. A particularly insidious form of leakage arises from the fact that hardware consumes power and emits radiation in a manner that is statistically associated with the data it processes and the instructions it executes. Supervised deep learning has emerged as a state-of-the-art tool for carrying out *side-channel attacks*, which exploit this leakage by learning to map power/radiation measurements throughout encryption to the sensitive data operated on during that encryption. In this work we develop a principled deep learning framework for determining the relative leakage due to measurements recorded at different points in time, in order to inform *defense* against such attacks. This information is invaluable to cryptographic hardware designers for understanding *why* their hardware leaks and how they can mitigate it (e.g. by indicating the particular sections of code or electronic components which are responsible). Our framework is based on an adversarial game between a family of classifiers trained to estimate the conditional distributions of sensitive data given subsets of measurements, and a budget-constrained noise distribution which probabilistically erases individual measurements to maximize the loss of these classifiers. We demonstrate our method's efficacy and ability to overcome limitations of prior work through extensive experimental comparison with 8 baseline methods using 3 evaluation metrics and 6 publicly-available power/EM trace datasets from AES, ECC and RSA implementations. We provide an open-source PyTorch implementation of these experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the problem of closeness testing for continuous distributions and its implications for causal discovery. Specifically, we analyze the sample complexity of distinguishing whether two multidimensional continuous distributions are identical or differ by at least $\epsilon$ in terms of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence under non-parametric assumptions. To this end, we propose an estimator of KL divergence which is based on the von Mises expansion. Our closeness test attains optimal parametric rates under smoothness assumptions. Equipped with this test, which serves as a building block of our causal discovery algorithm to identify the causal structure between two multidimensional random variables, we establish sample complexity guarantees for our causal discovery method. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first work that provides sample complexity guarantees for distinguishing cause and effect in multidimensional non-linear models with non-Gaussian continuous variables in the presence of unobserved confounding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to estimate whether a specific data point was used in the training of a given model. Previous attacks often utilize multiple reference models to approximate the conditional score distribution, leading to significant computational overhead. While recent work leverages quantile regression to estimate conditional thresholds, it fails to capture epistemic uncertainty, resulting in bias in low-density regions. In this work, we propose a novel approach - Bayesian Membership Inference Attack (BMIA), which performs conditional attack through Bayesian inference. In particular, we transform a trained reference model into Bayesian neural networks by Laplace approximation, enabling the direct estimation of the conditional score distribution by probabilistic model parameters. Our method addresses both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty with only a reference model, enabling efficient and powerful MIA. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of BMIA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiongxiu Li, Xiaoyu Luo, Yiyi Chen, Johannes Bjerva</p>
<p>Abstract: The role of memorization in machine learning (ML) has garnered significant attention, particularly as modern models are empirically observed to memorize fragments of training data. Previous theoretical analyses, such as Feldman's seminal work, attribute memorization to the prevalence of long-tail distributions in training data, proving it unavoidable for samples that lie in the tail of the distribution. However, the intersection of memorization and trustworthy ML research reveals critical gaps. While prior research in memorization in trustworthy ML has solely focused on class imbalance, recent work starts to differentiate class-level rarity from atypical samples, which are valid and rare intra-class instances. However, a critical research gap remains: current frameworks conflate atypical samples with noisy and erroneous data, neglecting their divergent impacts on fairness, robustness, and privacy. In this work, we conduct a thorough survey of existing research and their findings on trustworthy ML and the role of memorization. More and beyond, we identify and highlight uncharted gaps and propose new revenues in this research direction. Since existing theoretical and empirical analyses lack the nuances to disentangle memorization's duality as both a necessity and a liability, we formalize three-level long-tail granularity - class imbalance, atypicality, and noise - to reveal how current frameworks misapply these levels, perpetuating flawed solutions. By systematizing this granularity, we draw a roadmap for future research. Trustworthy ML must reconcile the nuanced trade-offs between memorizing atypicality for fairness assurance and suppressing noise for robustness and privacy guarantee. Redefining memorization via this granularity reshapes the theoretical foundation for trustworthy ML, and further affords an empirical prerequisite for models that align performance with societal trust.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiongxiu Li, Wenrui Yu, Yufei Xia, Jun Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative learning without directly sharing individual's raw data. FL can be implemented in either a centralized (server-based) or decentralized (peer-to-peer) manner. In this survey, we present a novel perspective: the fundamental difference between centralized FL (CFL) and decentralized FL (DFL) is not merely the network topology, but the underlying training protocol: separate aggregation vs. joint optimization. We argue that this distinction in protocol leads to significant differences in model utility, privacy preservation, and robustness to attacks. We systematically review and categorize existing works in both CFL and DFL according to the type of protocol they employ. This taxonomy provides deeper insights into prior research and clarifies how various approaches relate or differ. Through our analysis, we identify key gaps in the literature. In particular, we observe a surprising lack of exploration of DFL approaches based on distributed optimization methods, despite their potential advantages. We highlight this under-explored direction and call for more research on leveraging distributed optimization for federated learning. Overall, this work offers a comprehensive overview from centralized to decentralized FL, sheds new light on the core distinctions between approaches, and outlines open challenges and future directions for the field.</p>

<p>Abstract: Active learning aims to select optimal samples for labeling, minimizing annotation costs. This paper introduces a unified representation learning framework tailored for active learning with task awareness. It integrates diverse sources, comprising reconstruction, adversarial, self-supervised, knowledge-distillation, and classification losses into a unified VAE-based ADROIT approach. The proposed approach comprises three key components - a unified representation generator (VAE), a state discriminator, and a (proxy) task-learner or classifier. ADROIT learns a latent code using both labeled and unlabeled data, incorporating task-awareness by leveraging labeled data with the proxy classifier. Unlike previous approaches, the proxy classifier additionally employs a self-supervised loss on unlabeled data and utilizes knowledge distillation to align with the target task-learner. The state discriminator distinguishes between labeled and unlabeled data, facilitating the selection of informative unlabeled samples. The dynamic interaction between VAE and the state discriminator creates a competitive environment, with the VAE attempting to deceive the discriminator, while the state discriminator learns to differentiate between labeled and unlabeled inputs. Extensive evaluations on diverse datasets and ablation analysis affirm the effectiveness of the proposed model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative learning across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, FL faces significant challenges when dealing with heterogeneous data distributions, which can lead to suboptimal global models that fail to generalize across diverse clients. In this work, we propose a novel framework designed to tackle these challenges by introducing a dual-adapter approach. The method utilizes a larger local adapter for client-specific personalization and a smaller global adapter to facilitate efficient knowledge sharing across clients. Additionally, we incorporate a pruning mechanism to reduce communication overhead by selectively removing less impactful parameters from the local adapter. Through extensive experiments on a range of vision and language tasks, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches. It achieves higher test accuracy, lower performance variance among clients, and improved worst-case performance, all while significantly reducing communication and computation costs. Overall, the proposed method addresses the critical trade-off between model personalization and generalization, offering a scalable solution for real-world FL applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> C\'eline Hocquette, Andrew Cropper</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent inductive logic programming (ILP) approaches learn optimal hypotheses. An optimal hypothesis minimises a given cost function on the training data. There are many cost functions, such as minimising training error, textual complexity, or the description length of hypotheses. However, selecting an appropriate cost function remains a key question. To address this gap, we extend a constraint-based ILP system to learn optimal hypotheses for seven standard cost functions. We then empirically compare the generalisation error of optimal hypotheses induced under these standard cost functions. Our results on over 20 domains and 1000 tasks, including game playing, program synthesis, and image reasoning, show that, while no cost function consistently outperforms the others, minimising training error or description length has the best overall performance. Notably, our results indicate that minimising the size of hypotheses does not always reduce generalisation error.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fateme Jamshidi, Mohammad Shahverdikondori, Negar Kiyavash</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-armed bandits (MABs) are frequently used for online sequential decision-making in applications ranging from recommending personalized content to assigning treatments to patients. A recurring challenge in the applicability of the classic MAB framework to real-world settings is ignoring \textit{interference}, where a unit's outcome depends on treatment assigned to others. This leads to an exponentially growing action space, rendering standard approaches computationally impractical. We study the MAB problem under network interference, where each unit's reward depends on its own treatment and those of its neighbors in a given interference graph. We propose a novel algorithm that uses the local structure of the interference graph to minimize regret. We derive a graph-dependent upper bound on cumulative regret showing that it improves over prior work. Additionally, we provide the first lower bounds for bandits with arbitrary network interference, where each bound involves a distinct structural property of the interference graph. These bounds demonstrate that when the graph is either dense or sparse, our algorithm is nearly optimal, with upper and lower bounds that match up to logarithmic factors. We complement our theoretical results with numerical experiments, which show that our approach outperforms baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linqi Zhou, Stefano Ermon, Jiaming Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models and Flow Matching generate high-quality samples but are slow at inference, and distilling them into few-step models often leads to instability and extensive tuning. To resolve these trade-offs, we propose Inductive Moment Matching (IMM), a new class of generative models for one- or few-step sampling with a single-stage training procedure. Unlike distillation, IMM does not require pre-training initialization and optimization of two networks; and unlike Consistency Models, IMM guarantees distribution-level convergence and remains stable under various hyperparameters and standard model architectures. IMM surpasses diffusion models on ImageNet-256x256 with 1.99 FID using only 8 inference steps and achieves state-of-the-art 2-step FID of 1.98 on CIFAR-10 for a model trained from scratch.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07572">Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiao Qu, Matthew Y. R. Yang, Amrith Setlur, Lewis Tunstall, Edward Emanuel Beeching, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Aviral Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Training models to effectively use test-time compute is crucial for improving the reasoning performance of LLMs. Current methods mostly do so via fine-tuning on search traces or running RL with 0/1 outcome reward, but do these approaches efficiently utilize test-time compute? Would these approaches continue to scale as the budget improves? In this paper, we try to answer these questions. We formalize the problem of optimizing test-time compute as a meta-reinforcement learning (RL) problem, which provides a principled perspective on spending test-time compute. This perspective enables us to view the long output stream from the LLM as consisting of several episodes run at test time and leads us to use a notion of cumulative regret over output tokens as a way to measure the efficacy of test-time compute. Akin to how RL algorithms can best tradeoff exploration and exploitation over training, minimizing cumulative regret would also provide the best balance between exploration and exploitation in the token stream. While we show that state-of-the-art models do not minimize regret, one can do so by maximizing a dense reward bonus in conjunction with the outcome 0/1 reward RL. This bonus is the ''progress'' made by each subsequent block in the output stream, quantified by the change in the likelihood of eventual success. Using these insights, we develop Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, or MRT, a new class of fine-tuning methods for optimizing test-time compute. MRT leads to a 2-3x relative gain in performance and roughly a 1.5x gain in token efficiency for math reasoning compared to outcome-reward RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Chen, Yasi Zhang, Zhendong Wang, Ying Nian Wu, Oscar Leong, Mingyuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-resolution, realistic images across diverse natural distributions. However, their performance heavily relies on high-quality training data, making it challenging to learn meaningful distributions from corrupted samples. This limitation restricts their applicability in scientific domains where clean data is scarce or costly to obtain. In this work, we introduce denoising score distillation (DSD), a surprisingly effective and novel approach for training high-quality generative models from low-quality data. DSD first pretrains a diffusion model exclusively on noisy, corrupted samples and then distills it into a one-step generator capable of producing refined, clean outputs. While score distillation is traditionally viewed as a method to accelerate diffusion models, we show that it can also significantly enhance sample quality, particularly when starting from a degraded teacher model. Across varying noise levels and datasets, DSD consistently improves generative performancewe summarize our empirical evidence in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights showing that, in a linear model setting, DSD identifies the eigenspace of the clean data distributions covariance matrix, implicitly regularizing the generator. This perspective reframes score distillation as not only a tool for efficiency but also a mechanism for improving generative models, particularly in low-quality data settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijun Liao, Jinbiao Chen, Debing Wang, Zizhen Zhang, Jiahai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has emerged as a promising approach for NP-hard problems. However, prevailing RL-based methods suffer from low sample efficiency due to sparse rewards and underused solutions. We propose Preference Optimization for Combinatorial Optimization (POCO), a training paradigm that leverages solution preferences via objective values. It introduces: (1) an efficient preference pair construction for better explore and exploit solutions, and (2) a novel loss function that adaptively scales gradients via objective differences, removing reliance on reward models or reference policies. Experiments on Job-Shop Scheduling (JSP), Traveling Salesman (TSP), and Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (FJSP) show POCO outperforms state-of-the-art neural methods, reducing optimality gaps impressively with efficient inference. POCO is architecture-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with existing NCO models, and establishes preference optimization as a principled framework for combinatorial optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Congyue Deng, Brandon Y. Feng, Cecilia Garraffo, Alan Garbarz, Robin Walters, William T. Freeman, Leonidas Guibas, Kaiming He</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning frameworks for physical problems must capture and enforce physical constraints that preserve the structure of dynamical systems. Many existing approaches achieve this by integrating physical operators into neural networks. While these methods offer theoretical guarantees, they face two key limitations: (i) they primarily model local relations between adjacent time steps, overlooking longer-range or higher-level physical interactions, and (ii) they focus on forward simulation while neglecting broader physical reasoning tasks. We propose the Denoising Hamiltonian Network (DHN), a novel framework that generalizes Hamiltonian mechanics operators into more flexible neural operators. DHN captures non-local temporal relationships and mitigates numerical integration errors through a denoising mechanism. DHN also supports multi-system modeling with a global conditioning mechanism. We demonstrate its effectiveness and flexibility across three diverse physical reasoning tasks with distinct inputs and outputs.</p>

It optimizes two objectives: a GS preservation objective that preserves an approximation of Pearson and Spearman correlations between high- and low-dimensional distances, and an LS preservation objective that ensures clusters in the high-dimensional data are separable in the low-dimensional data. PCC has a state-of-the-art ability to preserve the GS while having competitive LS preservation. In addition, we show the correlation objective can be combined with UMAP to significantly improve its GS preservation with minimal degradation of the LS. We quantitatively benchmark PCC against existing methods and demonstrate its utility in medical imaging, and show PCC is a competitive DR technique that demonstrates superior GS preservation in our benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranshav Gajjar, Vijay K. Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) across critical domains such as healthcare, customer service, and business marketing, their integration into Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) remains limited. This gap is primarily due to the absence of domain-specific foundational models, with existing solutions often relying on general-purpose LLMs that fail to address the unique challenges and technical intricacies of O-RAN. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORANSight-2.0 (O-RAN Insights), a pioneering initiative aimed at developing specialized foundational LLMs tailored for O-RAN. Built on 18 LLMs spanning five open-source LLM frameworks, ORANSight-2.0 fine-tunes models ranging from 1 to 70B parameters, significantly reducing reliance on proprietary, closed-source models while enhancing performance for O-RAN. At the core of ORANSight-2.0 is RANSTRUCT, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based instruction-tuning framework that employs two LLM agents to create high-quality instruction-tuning datasets. The generated dataset is then used to fine-tune the 18 pre-trained open-source LLMs via QLoRA. To evaluate ORANSight-2.0, we introduce srsRANBench, a novel benchmark designed for code generation and codebase understanding in the context of srsRAN, a widely used 5G O-RAN stack. We also leverage ORANBench13K, an existing benchmark for assessing O-RAN-specific knowledge. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ORANSight-2.0 models outperform general-purpose and closed-source models, such as ChatGPT-4o and Gemini, by 5.421% on ORANBench and 18.465% on srsRANBench, achieving superior performance while maintaining lower computational and energy costs. We also experiment with RAG-augmented variants of ORANSight-2.0 LLMs and thoroughly evaluate their energy characteristics, demonstrating costs for training, standard inference, and RAG-augmented inference.</p>

Traditional methods of disinformation detection, often relying on manual verification or rule-based systems, are increasingly inadequate in the face of rapidly evolving propaganda tactics and the massive volume of data generated daily. To address these challenges, the proposed system employs deep learning algorithms, including LLM models, which are fine-tuned on a custom dataset encompassing verified disinformation and legitimate content. The paper's findings indicate that this approach significantly outperforms traditional machine learning techniques, offering enhanced contextual understanding and adaptability to emerging disinformation strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly used in scientific research, but evaluating AI-generated scientific work remains challenging. While expert reviews are costly, large language models (LLMs) as proxy reviewers have proven to be unreliable. To address this, we investigate two automatic evaluation metrics, specifically citation count prediction and review score prediction. We parse all papers of OpenReview and augment each submission with its citation count, reference, and research hypothesis. Our findings reveal that citation count prediction is more viable than review score prediction, and predicting scores is more difficult purely from the research hypothesis than from the full paper. Furthermore, we show that a simple prediction model based solely on title and abstract outperforms LLM-based reviewers, though it still falls short of human-level consistency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern society functions on trust. The onchain economy, however, is built on the founding principles of trustless peer-to-peer interactions in an adversarial environment without a centralised body of trust and needs a verifiable system to quantify credibility to minimise bad economic activity. We provide a robust framework titled zScore, a core primitive for reputation derived from a wallet's onchain behaviour using state-of-the-art AI neural network models combined with real-world credentials ported onchain through zkTLS. The initial results tested on retroactive data from lending protocols establish a strong correlation between a good zScore and healthy borrowing and repayment behaviour, making it a robust and decentralised alibi for creditworthiness; we highlight significant improvements from previous attempts by protocols like Cred showcasing its robustness. We also present a list of possible applications of our system in Section 5, thereby establishing its utility in rewarding actual value creation while filtering noise and suspicious activity and flagging malicious behaviour by bad actors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruying Liu, Bur\c{c}in Becerik-Gerber, Gale M. Lucas</p>
<p>Abstract: This study bridges the knowledge gap on how personal factors affect building occupants' responses in active shooter situations by applying interpretable machine learning methods to data from 107 participants. The personal factors studied are training methods, prior training experience, sense of direction, and gender. The response performance measurements consist of decisions (run, hide, multiple), vulnerability (corresponding to the time a participant is visible to a shooter), and pre-evacuation time. The results indicate that the propensity to run significantly determines overall response strategies, overshadowing vulnerability, and pre-evacuation time. The training method is a critical factor where VR-based training leads to better responses than video-based training. A better sense of direction and previous training experience are correlated with a greater propensity to run and less vulnerability. Gender slightly influences decisions and vulnerability but significantly impacts pre-evacuation time, with females evacuating slower, potentially due to higher risk perception. This study underscores the importance of personal factors in shaping responses to active shooter incidents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Blanca Mellor-Marsa, Alfredo Guitian, Andrew Coney, Berta Padilla, Alberto Nogales</p>
<p>Abstract: At the end of 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus was reported in China, leading to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Spain, the first cases were detected in late January 2020, and by mid-March, infections had surpassed 5,000. On March the Spanish government started a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. While isolation measures were necessary, they posed significant psychological and socioeconomic challenges, particularly for vulnerable populations. Understanding the psychological impact of lockdown and the factors influencing mental health is crucial for informing future public health policies. This study analyzes the influence of personal, socioeconomic, general health and living condition factors on psychological states during lockdown using AI techniques. A dataset collected through an online questionnaire was processed using two workflows, each structured into three stages. First, individuals were categorized based on psychological assessments, either directly or in combination with unsupervised learning techniques. Second, various Machine Learning classifiers were trained to distinguish between the identified groups. Finally, feature importance analysis was conducted to identify the most influential variables related to different psychological conditions. The evaluated models demonstrated strong performance, with accuracy exceeding 80% and often surpassing 90%, particularly for Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. Sensitivity and specificity analyses revealed that models performed well across different psychological conditions, with the health impacts subset showing the highest reliability. For diagnosing vulnerability, models achieved over 90% accuracy, except for less vulnerable individuals using living environment and economic status features, where performance was slightly lower.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diederik Coppitters, Gabriel Wiest, Leonard G\"oke, Francesco Contino, Andr\'e Bardow, Stefano Moret</p>
<p>Abstract: Disruptions in energy imports, backlash in social acceptance, and novel technologies failing to develop are unexpected events that are often overlooked in energy planning, despite their ability to jeopardize the energy transition. We propose a method to explore unexpected events and assess their impact on the transition pathway of a large-scale whole-energy system. First, we evaluate unexpected events assuming "perfect foresight", where decision-makers can anticipate such events in advance. This allows us to identify dealbreakers, i.e., conditions that make the transition infeasible. Then, we assess the events under "limited foresight" to evaluate the robustness of early-stage decisions against unforeseen unexpected events and the costs associated with managing them. A case study for Belgium demonstrates that a lack of electrofuel imports in 2050 is the main dealbreaker, while accelerating the deployment of renewables is the most robust policy. Our transferable method can help policymakers identify key dealbreakers and devise robust energy transition policies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep generative models have recently been proposed for sampling protein conformations from the Boltzmann distribution, as an alternative to often prohibitively expensive Molecular Dynamics simulations. However, current state-of-the-art approaches rely on fine-tuning pre-trained folding models and evolutionary sequence information, limiting their applicability and efficiency, and introducing potential biases. In this work, we propose a flow matching model for sampling protein conformations based solely on backbone geometry. We introduce a geometric encoding of the backbone equilibrium structure as input and propose to condition not only the flow but also the prior distribution on the respective equilibrium structure, eliminating the need for evolutionary information. The resulting model is orders of magnitudes faster than current state-of-the-art approaches at comparable accuracy and can be trained from scratch in a few GPU days. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance with reduced inference time, across not only an established benchmark of naturally occurring proteins but also de novo proteins, for which evolutionary information is scarce.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nora Fink</p>
<p>Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains a challenging condition to diagnose effectively and promptly, despite global efforts in public health, clinical screening, and scientific research. Traditional diagnostic methods, primarily reliant on supervised learning approaches, presuppose the availability of labeled data, which can be both time-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain. Unsupervised learning, in contrast, offers a means of gaining insights from unlabeled datasets in a manner that can expedite or support the diagnostic process. This paper explores the use of four distinct unsupervised clustering algorithms K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN to analyze a publicly available dataset of 704 adult individuals screened for ASD. After extensive hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation, the study documents how the Gaussian Mixture Model achieved the highest clustering-to-label accuracy (95.31%) when mapped to the original ASD/NO classification (4). Other key performance metrics included the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and silhouette scores, which further illustrated the internal coherence of each cluster. The dataset underwent preprocessing procedures including data cleaning, label encoding of categorical features, and standard scaling, followed by a thorough cross-validation approach to assess and compare the four clustering methods (5). These results highlight the significant potential of unsupervised methods in assisting ASD screening, especially in contexts where labeled data may be sparse, uncertain, or prohibitively expensive to obtain. With continued methodological refinements, unsupervised approaches hold promise for augmenting early detection initiatives and guiding resource allocation to individuals at high risk.</p>

<p>Abstract: A radiology report comprises several sections, including the Findings and Impression of the diagnosis. Automatically generating the Impression from the Findings is crucial for reducing radiologists' workload and improving diagnostic accuracy. Pretrained models that excel in common abstractive summarization problems encounter challenges when applied to specialized medical domains largely due to the complex terminology and the necessity for accurate clinical context. Such tasks in medical domains demand extracting core information, avoiding context shifts, and maintaining proper flow. Misuse of medical terms can lead to drastic clinical errors. To address these issues, we introduce a sequential transfer learning that ensures key content extraction and coherent summarization. Sequential transfer learning often faces challenges like initial parameter decay and knowledge loss, which we resolve with the Fisher matrix regularization. Using MIMIC-CXR and Open-I datasets, our model, CSTRL-Context-driven Sequential TRansfer Learning-achieved state-of-the-art performance, showing 56.2% improvement in BLEU-1, 40.5% in BLEU-2, 84.3% in BLEU-3, 28.9% in ROUGE-1, 41.0% in ROUGE-2 and 26.5% in ROGUE-3 score over benchmark studies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xufang Zheng, Qilei Zhang, Victoria Cobb, Max Z. Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The air transportation local share, defined as the proportion of local passengers relative to total passengers, serves as a critical metric reflecting how economic growth, carrier strategies, and market forces jointly influence demand composition. This metric is particularly useful for examining industry structure changes and large-scale disruptive events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This research offers an in-depth analysis of local share patterns on more than 3900 Origin and Destination (O&D) pairs across the U.S. air transportation system, revealing how economic expansion, the emergence of low-cost carriers (LCCs), and strategic shifts by legacy carriers have collectively elevated local share. To efficiently identify the local share characteristics of thousands of O&Ds and to categorize the O&Ds that have the same behavior, a range of time series clustering methods were used. Evaluation using visualization, performance metrics, and case-based examination highlighted distinct patterns and trends, from magnitude-based stratification to trend-based groupings. The analysis also identified pattern commonalities within O&D pairs, suggesting that macro-level forces (e.g., economic cycles, changing demographics, or disruptions such as COVID-19) can synchronize changes between disparate markets. These insights set the stage for predictive modeling of local share, guiding airline network planning and infrastructure investments. This study combines quantitative analysis with flexible clustering to help stakeholders anticipate market shifts, optimize resource allocation strategies, and strengthen the air transportation system's resilience and competitiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Sirajul Islam, Sanjeev Panta, Fei Xu, Xu Yuan, Li Chen, Nian-Feng Tzeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising distributed machine learning framework that allows collaborative learning of a global model across decentralized devices without uploading their local data. However, in real-world FL scenarios, the conventional synchronous FL mechanism suffers from inefficient training caused by slow-speed devices, commonly known as stragglers, especially in heterogeneous communication environments. Though asynchronous FL effectively tackles the efficiency challenge, it induces substantial system overheads and model degradation. Striking for a balance, semi-asynchronous FL has gained increasing attention, while still suffering from the open challenge of stale models, where newly arrived updates are calculated based on outdated weights that easily hurt the convergence of the global model. In this paper, we present {\em SEAFL}, a novel FL framework designed to mitigate both the straggler and the stale model challenges in semi-asynchronous FL. {\em SEAFL} dynamically assigns weights to uploaded models during aggregation based on their staleness and importance to the current global model. We theoretically analyze the convergence rate of {\em SEAFL} and further enhance the training efficiency with an extended variant that allows partial training on slower devices, enabling them to contribute to global aggregation while reducing excessive waiting times. We evaluate the effectiveness of {\em SEAFL} through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that {\em SEAFL} outperforms its closest counterpart by up to $\sim$22\% in terms of the wall-clock training time required to achieve target accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aarush Sinha, OM Kumar CU</p>
<p>Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are integral to Natural Language Processing (NLP), yet their interaction with structured knowledge graphs (KGs) remains an open research challenge. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing graph structures, they struggle with textual feature representation compared to pretrained LMs. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Graph Masked Language Models (GMLM)} for node classification tasks. Our approach introduces two key innovations: a \textit{semantic masking strategy} that selectively masks nodes based on their structural importance, ensuring critical graph components contribute effectively to learning, and a \textit{soft masking mechanism} that generates interpolated node representations, enabling smoother information retention and improved gradient flow. Our dual-branch model architecture fuses structural graph information with contextual embeddings via a multi-layer fusion network. Extensive experiments on six node classification benchmarks demonstrate that GMLM not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance but also enhances robustness and stability across datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Veda C. Storey, Wei Thoo Yue, J. Leon Zhao, Roman Lukyanenko</p>
<p>Abstract: The continuing, explosive developments in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), built on large language models and related algorithms, has led to much excitement and speculation about the potential impact of this new technology. Claims include AI being poised to revolutionize business and society and dramatically change personal life. However, it remains unclear exactly how this technology, with its significantly distinct features from past AI technologies, has transformative potential. Nor is it clear how researchers in information systems (IS) should respond. In this paper, we consider the evolving and emerging trends of AI in order to examine its present and predict its future impacts. Many existing papers on GenAI are either too technical for most IS researchers or lack the depth needed to appreciate the potential impacts of GenAI. We, therefore, attempt to bridge the technical and organizational communities of GenAI from a system-oriented sociotechnical perspective. Specifically, we explore the unique features of GenAI, which are rooted in the continued change from symbolism to connectionism, and the deep systemic and inherent properties of human-AI ecosystems. We retrace the evolution of AI that proceeded the level of adoption, adaption, and use found today, in order to propose future research on various impacts of GenAI in both business and society within the context of information systems research. Our efforts are intended to contribute to the creation of a well-structured research agenda in the IS community to support innovative strategies and operations enabled by this new wave of AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of mental health conditions worldwide, AI-powered chatbots and conversational agents have emerged as accessible tools to support mental health. However, deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in mental healthcare applications raises significant privacy concerns, especially regarding regulations like HIPAA and GDPR. In this work, we propose FedMentalCare, a privacy-preserving framework that leverages Federated Learning (FL) combined with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune LLMs for mental health analysis. We investigate the performance impact of varying client data volumes and model architectures (e.g., MobileBERT and MiniLM) in FL environments. Our framework demonstrates a scalable, privacy-aware approach for deploying LLMs in real-world mental healthcare scenarios, addressing data security and computational efficiency challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Li, Kaiying Yan, Shuo Shao, Tongqing Zhai, Shu-Tao Xia, Zhan Qin, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing adoption of deep learning in speaker verification, large-scale speech datasets have become valuable intellectual property. To audit and prevent the unauthorized usage of these valuable released datasets, especially in commercial or open-source scenarios, we propose a novel dataset ownership verification method. Our approach introduces a clustering-based backdoor watermark (CBW), enabling dataset owners to determine whether a suspicious third-party model has been trained on a protected dataset under a black-box setting. The CBW method consists of two key stages: dataset watermarking and ownership verification. During watermarking, we implant multiple trigger patterns in the dataset to make similar samples (measured by their feature similarities) close to the same trigger while dissimilar samples are near different triggers. This ensures that any model trained on the watermarked dataset exhibits specific misclassification behaviors when exposed to trigger-embedded inputs. To verify dataset ownership, we design a hypothesis-test-based framework that statistically evaluates whether a suspicious model exhibits the expected backdoor behavior. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of our method against potential adaptive attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Morrison, Clara Na, Jared Fernandez, Tim Dettmers, Emma Strubell, Jesse Dodge</p>
<p>Abstract: As the performance of artificial intelligence systems has dramatically increased, so too has the environmental impact of creating these systems. While many model developers release estimates of the power consumption and carbon emissions from the final training runs for their latest models, there is comparatively little transparency into the impact of model development, hardware manufacturing, and total water usage throughout. In this work, we estimate the real-world environmental impact of developing a series of language models, ranging from 20 million to 13 billion active parameters, trained on up to 5.6 trillion tokens each. When accounting for hardware manufacturing, model development, and our final training runs, we find that our series of models released 493 metric tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to powering about 98 homes in the United States for one year, and consumed 2.769 million liters of water, equivalent to about 24.5 years of water usage by a person in the United States, even though our data center is extremely water-efficient. We measure and report the environmental impact of our model development; to the best of our knowledge we are the first to do so for LLMs, and we find that model development, the impact of which is generally not disclosed by most model developers, amounted to ~50% of that of training. By looking at detailed time series data for power consumption, we also find that power usage throughout training is not consistent, fluctuating between ~15% and ~85% of our hardware's maximum power draw, with negative implications for grid-scale planning as demand continues to grow. We close with a discussion on the continued difficulty of estimating the environmental impact of AI systems, and key takeaways for model developers and the public at large.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenyu Zhang, Jiaguo Tian, Zhengbang Zhu, Shan Huang, Jucheng Yang, Weinan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Microscopic traffic simulation has become an important tool for autonomous driving training and testing. Although recent data-driven approaches advance realistic behavior generation, their learning still relies primarily on a single real-world dataset, which limits their diversity and thereby hinders downstream algorithm optimization. In this paper, we propose DriveGen, a novel traffic simulation framework with large models for more diverse traffic generation that supports further customized designs. DriveGen consists of two internal stages: the initialization stage uses large language model and retrieval technique to generate map and vehicle assets; the rollout stage outputs trajectories with selected waypoint goals from visual language model and a specific designed diffusion planner. Through this two-staged process, DriveGen fully utilizes large models' high-level cognition and reasoning of driving behavior, obtaining greater diversity beyond datasets while maintaining high realism. To support effective downstream optimization, we additionally develop DriveGen-CS, an automatic corner case generation pipeline that uses failures of the driving algorithm as additional prompt knowledge for large models without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. Experiments show that our generated scenarios and corner cases have a superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Downstream experiments further verify that the synthesized traffic of DriveGen provides better optimization of the performance of typical driving algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepika Raman, Nada Madkour, Evan R. Murphy, Krystal Jackson, Jessica Newman</p>
<p>Abstract: Frontier AI models -- highly capable foundation models at the cutting edge of AI development -- may pose severe risks to public safety, human rights, economic stability, and societal value in the coming years. These risks could arise from deliberate adversarial misuse, system failures, unintended cascading effects, or simultaneous failures across multiple models.
  In response to such risks, at the AI Seoul Summit in May 2024, 16 global AI industry organizations signed the Frontier AI Safety Commitments, and 27 nations and the EU issued a declaration on their intent to define these thresholds. To fulfill these commitments, organizations must determine and disclose ``thresholds at which severe risks posed by a model or system, unless adequately mitigated, would be deemed intolerable.''
  To assist in setting and operationalizing intolerable risk thresholds, we outline key principles and considerations; for example, to aim for ``good, not perfect'' thresholds in the face of limited data on rapidly advancing AI capabilities and consequently evolving risks. We also propose specific threshold recommendations, including some detailed case studies, for a subset of risks across eight risk categories: (1) Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Weapons, (2) Cyber Attacks, (3) Model Autonomy, (4) Persuasion and Manipulation, (5) Deception, (6) Toxicity, (7) Discrimination, and (8) Socioeconomic Disruption. Our goal is to serve as a starting point or supplementary resource for policymakers and industry leaders, encouraging proactive risk management that prioritizes preventing intolerable risks (ex ante) rather than merely mitigating them after they occur (ex post).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Zhang, Zhihui Li, Zhibin Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the context of global warming, even relatively cooler countries like the UK are experiencing a rise in cooling demand, particularly in southern regions such as London. This growing demand, especially during the summer months, presents significant challenges for energy management systems. Accurately predicting cooling demand in urban domestic buildings is essential for maintaining energy efficiency. This study introduces a generalised framework for developing high-resolution Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks using physical model-based summer cooling demand data. To maximise the predictive capability and generalisation ability of the models under limited data scenarios, four distinct data partitioning strategies were implemented, including the extrapolation, month-based interpolation, global interpolation, and day-based interpolation. Bayesian Optimisation (BO) was then applied to fine-tune the hyper-parameters, substantially improving the framework predictive accuracy. Results show that the day-based interpolation GRU model demonstrated the best performance due to its ability to retain both the data randomness and the time sequence continuity characteristics. This optimal model achieves a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 2.22%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.87%, and a coefficient of determination (R square) of 0.9386 on the test set. The generalisation ability of this framework was further evaluated by forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Chen, Kelin Li, Dongmyoung Lee, Xiaoshuai Chen, Rui Zong, Petar Kormushev</p>
<p>Abstract: Physical manipulation of garments is often crucial when performing fabric-related tasks, such as hanging garments. However, due to the deformable nature of fabrics, these operations remain a significant challenge for robots in household, healthcare, and industrial environments. In this paper, we propose GraphGarment, a novel approach that models garment dynamics based on robot control inputs and applies the learned dynamics model to facilitate garment manipulation tasks such as hanging. Specifically, we use graphs to represent the interactions between the robot end-effector and the garment. GraphGarment uses a graph neural network (GNN) to learn a dynamics model that can predict the next garment state given the current state and input action in simulation. To address the substantial sim-to-real gap, we propose a residual model that compensates for garment state prediction errors, thereby improving real-world performance.The garment dynamics model is then applied to a model-based action sampling strategy, where it is utilized to manipulate the garment to a reference pre-hanging configuration for garment-hanging tasks. We conducted four experiments using six types of garments to validate our approach in both simulation and real-world settings. In simulation experiments, GraphGarment achieves better garment state prediction performance, with a prediction error 0.46 cm lower than the best baseline.Our approach also demonstrates improved performance in the garment-hanging simulation experiment with enhancements of 12%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. Moreover, real-world robot experiments confirm the robustness of sim-to-real transfer, with an error increase of 0.17 cm compared to simulation results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias J\"ulg, Wolfram Burgard, Florian Walter</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent generalist Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) can perform a variety of tasks on real robots with remarkable generalization capabilities. However, reported success rates are often not on par with those of expert policies. Moreover, VLAs usually do not work out of the box and often must be fine-tuned as they are sensitive to setup changes. In this work, we present Refined Policy Distillation (RPD), an RL-based policy refinement method that enables the distillation of large generalist models into small, high-performing expert policies. The student policy is guided during the RL exploration by actions of a teacher VLA for increased sample efficiency and faster convergence. Different from previous work that focuses on applying VLAs to real-world experiments, we create fine-tuned versions of Octo and OpenVLA for ManiSkill2 to evaluate RPD in simulation. As our results for different manipulation tasks demonstrate, RPD enables the RL agent to learn expert policies that surpass the teacher's performance in both dense and sparse reward settings. Our approach is even robust to changes in the camera perspective and can generalize to task variations that the underlying VLA cannot solve.</p>

<p>Abstract: Highly accurate force fields are a mandatory requirement to generate predictive simulations. In this regard, Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach in computational chemistry and materials science, combining the accuracy of quantum mechanical methods with computational efficiency orders of magnitude superior to ab-initio methods. This chapter provides an introduction of the fundamentals of learning and how it is applied to construct MLFFs, detailing key methodologies such as neural network potentials and kernel-based models. Emphasis is placed on the construction of SchNet model, as one of the most elemental neural network-based force fields that are nowadays the basis of modern architectures. Additionally, the GDML framework is described in detail as an example of how the elegant formulation of kernel methods can be used to construct mathematically robust and physics-inspired MLFFs. The ongoing advancements in MLFF development continue to expand their applicability, enabling precise simulations of large and complex systems that were previously beyond reach. This chapter concludes by highlighting the transformative impact of MLFFs on scientific research, underscoring their role in driving future discoveries in the fields of chemistry, physics, and materials science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sefik Serengil, Alper Ozpinar</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the use of partially homomorphic encryption (PHE) for encrypted vector similarity search, with a focus on facial recognition and broader applications like reverse image search, recommendation engines, and large language models (LLMs). While fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) exists, we demonstrate that encrypted cosine similarity can be computed using PHE, offering a more practical alternative. Since PHE does not directly support cosine similarity, we propose a method that normalizes vectors in advance, enabling dot product calculations as a proxy. We also apply min-max normalization to handle negative dimension values.
  Experiments on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset use DeepFace's FaceNet128d, FaceNet512d, and VGG-Face (4096d) models in a two-tower setup. Pre-encrypted embeddings are stored in one tower, while an edge device captures images, computes embeddings, and performs encrypted-plaintext dot products via additively homomorphic encryption. We implement this with LightPHE, evaluating Paillier, Damgard-Jurik, and Okamoto-Uchiyama schemes, excluding others due to performance or decryption complexity. Tests at 80-bit and 112-bit security (NIST-secure until 2030) compare PHE against FHE (via TenSEAL), analyzing encryption, decryption, operation time, cosine similarity loss, key/ciphertext sizes.
  Results show PHE is less computationally intensive, faster, and produces smaller ciphertexts/keys, making it well-suited for memory-constrained environments and real-world privacy-preserving encrypted similarity search.</p>

<p>Abstract: While the Question Generation (QG) task has been increasingly adopted in educational assessments, its evaluation remains limited by approaches that lack a clear connection to the educational values of test items. In this work, we introduce test item analysis, a method frequently used by educators to assess test question quality, into QG evaluation. Specifically, we construct pairs of candidate questions that differ in quality across dimensions such as topic coverage, item difficulty, item discrimination, and distractor efficiency. We then examine whether existing QG evaluation approaches can effectively distinguish these differences. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in these approaches with respect to accurately assessing test item quality in relation to student performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel QG evaluation framework, QG-SMS, which leverages Large Language Model for Student Modeling and Simulation to perform test item analysis. As demonstrated in our extensive experiments and human evaluation study, the additional perspectives introduced by the simulated student profiles lead to a more effective and robust assessment of test items.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Micha\"el Fanuel, R\'emi Bardenet</p>
<p>Abstract: Given an $n\times r$ matrix $X$ of rank $r$, consider the problem of sampling $r$ integers $\mathtt{C}\subset \{1, \dots, n\}$ with probability proportional to the squared determinant of the rows of $X$ indexed by $\mathtt{C}$. The distribution of $\mathtt{C}$ is called a projection determinantal point process (DPP). The vanilla classical algorithm to sample a DPP works in two steps, an orthogonalization in $\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ and a sampling step of the same cost. The bottleneck of recent quantum approaches to DPP sampling remains that preliminary orthogonalization step. For instance, (Kerenidis and Prakash, 2022) proposed an algorithm with the same $\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ orthogonalization, followed by a $\mathcal{O}(nr)$ classical step to find the gates in a quantum circuit. The classical $\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ orthogonalization thus still dominates the cost. Our first contribution is to reduce preprocessing to normalizing the columns of $X$, obtaining $\mathsf{X}$ in $\mathcal{O}(nr)$ classical operations. We show that a simple circuit inspired by the formalism of Kerenidis et al., 2022 samples a DPP of a type we had never encountered in applications, which is different from our target DPP. Plugging this circuit into a rejection sampling routine, we recover our target DPP after an expected $1/\det \mathsf{X}^\top\mathsf{X} = 1/a$ preparations of the quantum circuit. Using amplitude amplification, our second contribution is to boost the acceptance probability from $a$ to $1-a$ at the price of a circuit depth of $\mathcal{O}(r\log n/\sqrt{a})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ extra qubits. Prepending a fast, sketching-based classical approximation of $a$, we obtain a pipeline to sample a projection DPP on a quantum computer, where the former $\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ preprocessing bottleneck has been replaced by the $\mathcal{O}(nr)$ cost of normalizing the columns and the cost of our approximation of $a$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Zhao, Pranjal Awasthi, Nika Haghtalab</p>
<p>Abstract: Finetuning provides a scalable and cost-effective means of customizing language models for specific tasks or response styles, with greater reliability than prompting or in-context learning. In contrast, the conventional wisdom is that injecting knowledge via finetuning results in brittle performance and poor generalization. We argue that the dichotomy of "task customization" (e.g., instruction tuning) and "knowledge injection" (e.g., teaching new facts) is a distinction without a difference. We instead identify concrete factors that explain the heterogeneous effectiveness observed with finetuning. To this end, we conduct a large-scale experimental study of finetuning the frontier Gemini v1.5 model family on a spectrum of datasets that are artificially engineered to interpolate between the strengths and failure modes of finetuning. Our findings indicate that question-answer training data formats provide much stronger knowledge generalization than document/article-style training data, numerical information can be harder for finetuning to retain than categorical information, and models struggle to apply finetuned knowledge during multi-step reasoning even when trained on similar examples -- all factors that render "knowledge injection" to be especially difficult, even after controlling for considerations like data augmentation and information volume. On the other hand, our findings also indicate that it is not fundamentally more difficult to finetune information about a real-world event than information about what a model's writing style should be.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixiao Li, Xianzhi Du, Ajay Jaiswal, Tao Lei, Tuo Zhao, Chong Wang, Jianyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have intensified the need for efficient and deployable models within limited inference budgets. Structured pruning pipelines have shown promise in token efficiency compared to training target-size models from scratch. In this paper, we advocate incorporating enlarged model pretraining, which is often ignored in previous works, into pruning. We study the enlarge-and-prune pipeline as an integrated system to address two critical questions: whether it is worth pretraining an enlarged model even when the model is never deployed, and how to optimize the entire pipeline for better pruned models. We propose an integrated enlarge-and-prune pipeline, which combines enlarge model training, pruning, and recovery under a single cosine annealing learning rate schedule. This approach is further complemented by a novel iterative structured pruning method for gradual parameter removal. The proposed method helps to mitigate the knowledge loss caused by the rising learning rate in naive enlarge-and-prune pipelines and enable effective redistribution of model capacity among surviving neurons, facilitating smooth compression and enhanced performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments on compressing 2.8B models to 1.3B with up to 2T tokens in pretraining.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julie Michelman, Nasrin Baratalipour, Matthew Abueg</p>
<p>Abstract: We envision a continuous collaborative learning system where groups of LLM agents work together to solve reasoning problems, drawing on memory they collectively build to improve performance as they gain experience. This work establishes the foundations for such a system by studying the interoperability of chain-of-thought reasoning styles, multi-agent collaboration, and memory banks. Extending beyond the identical agents of self-consistency, we introduce varied-context agents with diverse exemplars and a summarizer agent in place of voting. We generate frozen and continuously learned memory banks of exemplars and pair them with fixed, random, and similarity-based retrieval mechanisms. Our systematic study reveals where various methods contribute to reasoning performance of two LLMs on three grounded reasoning tasks, showing that random exemplar selection can often beat more principled approaches, and in some tasks, inclusion of any exemplars serves only to distract both weak and strong models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Na\"il Khelifa, Ferdia Sherry, Carola-Bibiane Sch\"onlieb</p>
<p>Abstract: The inherent ill-posed nature of image reconstruction problems, due to limitations in the physical acquisition process, is typically addressed by introducing a regularisation term that incorporates prior knowledge about the underlying image. The iterative framework of Plug-and-Play methods, specifically designed for tackling such inverse problems, achieves state-of-the-art performance by replacing the regularisation with a generic denoiser, which may be parametrised by a neural network architecture. However, these deep learning approaches suffer from a critical limitation: the absence of a control parameter to modulate the regularisation strength, which complicates the design of a convergent regularisation. To address this issue, this work introduces a novel scaling method that explicitly integrates and adjusts the strength of regularisation. The scaling parameter enhances interpretability by reflecting the quality of the denoiser's learning process, and also systematically improves its optimisation. Furthermore, the proposed approach ensures that the resulting family of regularisations is provably stable and convergent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixuan Liu, Aaron Honjaya, Yuekai Xu, Yi Zhang, Hefu Pan, Xin Wang, Linda G Shapiro, Sheng Wang, Ruikang K Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is critical for diagnosing ocular conditions, yet current deep learning methods are limited by modality-specific challenges and significant distribution shifts across imaging devices, resolutions, and anatomical regions. In this paper, we propose GrInAdapt, a novel framework for source-free multi-target domain adaptation that leverages multi-view images to refine segmentation labels and enhance model generalizability for optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) of the fundus of the eye. GrInAdapt follows an intuitive three-step approach: (i) grounding images to a common anchor space via registration, (ii) integrating predictions from multiple views to achieve improved label consensus, and (iii) adapting the source model to diverse target domains. Furthermore, GrInAdapt is flexible enough to incorporate auxiliary modalities such as color fundus photography, to provide complementary cues for robust vessel segmentation. Extensive experiments on a multi-device, multi-site, and multi-modal retinal dataset demonstrate that GrInAdapt significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods, achieving higher segmentation accuracy and robustness across multiple domains. These results highlight the potential of GrInAdapt to advance automated retinal vessel analysis and support robust clinical decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manu Jayadharan, Christina Catlett, Arthur N. Montanari, Niall M. Mangan</p>
<p>Abstract: Differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) integrate ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with algebraic constraints, providing a fundamental framework for developing models of dynamical systems characterized by timescale separation, conservation laws, and physical constraints. While sparse optimization has revolutionized model development by allowing data-driven discovery of parsimonious models from a library of possible equations, existing approaches for dynamical systems assume DAEs can be reduced to ODEs by eliminating variables before model discovery. This assumption limits the applicability of such methods to DAE systems with unknown constraints and time scales. We introduce Sparse Optimization for Differential-Algebraic Systems (SODAs), a data-driven method for the identification of DAEs in their explicit form. By discovering the algebraic and dynamic components sequentially without prior identification of the algebraic variables, this approach leads to a sequence of convex optimization problems and has the advantage of discovering interpretable models that preserve the structure of the underlying physical system. To this end, SODAs improves numerical stability when handling high correlations between library terms -- caused by near-perfect algebraic relationships -- by iteratively refining the conditioning of the candidate library. We demonstrate the performance of our method on biological, mechanical, and electrical systems, showcasing its robustness to noise in both simulated time series and real-time experimental data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasin Sonmez, Hanna Krasowski, Murat Arcak</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning is a promising approach for training autonomous vehicles (AV) to navigate complex traffic environments by mimicking expert driver behaviors. However, a major challenge in this paradigm lies in effectively utilizing available driving data, as collecting new data is resource-intensive and often limited in its ability to cover diverse driving scenarios. While existing imitation learning frameworks focus on leveraging expert demonstrations, they often overlook the potential of additional complex driving data from surrounding traffic participants. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation strategy that enhances imitation learning by leveraging the observed trajectories of nearby vehicles, captured through the AV's sensors, as additional expert demonstrations. We introduce a vehicle selection sampling strategy that prioritizes informative and diverse driving behaviors, contributing to a richer and more diverse dataset for training. We evaluate our approach using the state-of-the-art learning-based planning method PLUTO on the nuPlan dataset and demonstrate that our augmentation method leads to improved performance in complex driving scenarios. Specifically, our method reduces collision rates and improves safety metrics compared to the baseline. Notably, even when using only 10% of the original dataset, our method achieves performance comparable to that of the full dataset, with improved collision rates. Our findings highlight the importance of leveraging diverse real-world trajectory data in imitation learning and provide insights into data augmentation strategies for autonomous driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keyao Zhan, Puheng Li, Lei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: It was empirically observed in Entezari et al. (2021) that when accounting for the permutation invariance of neural networks, there is likely no loss barrier along the linear interpolation between two SGD solutions -- a phenomenon known as linear mode connectivity (LMC) modulo permutation. This phenomenon has sparked significant attention due to both its theoretical interest and practical relevance in applications such as model merging. In this paper, we provide a fine-grained analysis of this phenomenon for two-layer ReLU networks under a teacher-student setup. We show that as the student network width $m$ increases, the LMC loss barrier modulo permutation exhibits a {\bf double descent} behavior. Particularly, when $m$ is sufficiently large, the barrier decreases to zero at a rate $O(m^{-1/2})$. Notably, this rate does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and demonstrates how substantial permutation can reduce the LMC loss barrier. Moreover, we observe a sharp transition in the sparsity of GD/SGD solutions when increasing the learning rate and investigate how this sparsity preference affects the LMC loss barrier modulo permutation. Experiments on both synthetic and MNIST datasets corroborate our theoretical predictions and reveal a similar trend for more complex network architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohao Xu, Feng Xue, Xiang Li, Haowei Li, Shusheng Yang, Tianyi Zhang, Matthew Johnson-Roberson, Xiaonan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth ambiguity is a fundamental challenge in spatial scene understanding, especially in transparent scenes where single-depth estimates fail to capture full 3D structure. Existing models, limited to deterministic predictions, overlook real-world multi-layer depth. To address this, we introduce a paradigm shift from single-prediction to multi-hypothesis spatial foundation models. We first present \texttt{MD-3k}, a benchmark exposing depth biases in expert and foundational models through multi-layer spatial relationship labels and new metrics. To resolve depth ambiguity, we propose Laplacian Visual Prompting (LVP), a training-free spectral prompting technique that extracts hidden depth from pre-trained models via Laplacian-transformed RGB inputs. By integrating LVP-inferred depth with standard RGB-based estimates, our approach elicits multi-layer depth without model retraining. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of LVP in zero-shot multi-layer depth estimation, unlocking more robust and comprehensive geometry-conditioned visual generation, 3D-grounded spatial reasoning, and temporally consistent video-level depth inference. Our benchmark and code will be available at https://github.com/Xiaohao-Xu/Ambiguity-in-Space.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to daily life, especially advancing as intelligent assistants through on-device deployment on smartphones. However, existing LLM evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on objective tasks like mathematics and coding in English, which do not necessarily reflect the practical use cases of on-device LLMs in real-world mobile scenarios, especially for Chinese users. To address these gaps, we introduce SmartBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of on-device LLMs in Chinese mobile contexts. We analyze functionalities provided by representative smartphone manufacturers and divide them into five categories: text summarization, text Q\&A, information extraction, content creation, and notification management, further detailed into 20 specific tasks. For each task, we construct high-quality datasets comprising 50 to 200 question-answer pairs that reflect everyday mobile interactions, and we develop automated evaluation criteria tailored for these tasks. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of on-device LLMs and MLLMs using SmartBench and also assess their performance after quantized deployment on real smartphone NPUs. Our contributions provide a standardized framework for evaluating on-device LLMs in Chinese, promoting further development and optimization in this critical area.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yian Huang, Zhen Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the application of randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) methods in random feature approximations for kernel-based learning. Compared to the classical Monte Carlo (MC) approach \citep{rahimi2007random}, RQMC improves the deterministic approximation error bound from $O_P(1/\sqrt{n})$ to $O(1/M)$ (up to logarithmic factors), matching the rate achieved by quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods \citep{huangquasi}. Beyond the deterministic error bound guarantee, we further establish additional average error bounds for RQMC features: some requiring weaker assumptions and others significantly reducing the exponent of the logarithmic factor. In the context of kernel ridge regression, we show that RQMC features offer computational advantages over MC features while preserving the same statistical error rate. Empirical results further show that RQMC methods maintain stable performance in both low and moderately high-dimensional settings, unlike QMC methods, which suffer from significant performance degradation as dimension increases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Acute brain dysfunction (ABD) is a common, severe ICU complication, presenting as delirium or coma and leading to prolonged stays, increased mortality, and cognitive decline. Traditional screening tools like the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) rely on intermittent assessments, causing delays and inconsistencies. In this study, we propose MANDARIN (Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Dynamic Delirium and Coma Prediction in ICU Patients), a 1.5M-parameter mixture-of-experts neural network to predict ABD in real-time among ICU patients. The model integrates temporal and static data from the ICU to predict the brain status in the next 12 to 72 hours, using a multi-branch approach to account for current brain status. The MANDARIN model was trained on data from 92,734 patients (132,997 ICU admissions) from 2 hospitals between 2008-2019 and validated externally on data from 11,719 patients (14,519 ICU admissions) from 15 hospitals and prospectively on data from 304 patients (503 ICU admissions) from one hospital in 2021-2024. Three datasets were used: the University of Florida Health (UFH) dataset, the electronic ICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU), and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV dataset. MANDARIN significantly outperforms the baseline neurological assessment scores (GCS, CAM, and RASS) for delirium prediction in both external (AUROC 75.5% CI: 74.2%-76.8% vs 68.3% CI: 66.9%-69.5%) and prospective (AUROC 82.0% CI: 74.8%-89.2% vs 72.7% CI: 65.5%-81.0%) cohorts, as well as for coma prediction (external AUROC 87.3% CI: 85.9%-89.0% vs 72.8% CI: 70.6%-74.9%, and prospective AUROC 93.4% CI: 88.5%-97.9% vs 67.7% CI: 57.7%-76.8%) with a 12-hour lead time. This tool has the potential to assist clinicians in decision-making by continuously monitoring the brain status of patients in the ICU.</p>

<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in diagnostic dialogue, their capabilities for effective management reasoning - including disease progression, therapeutic response, and safe medication prescription - remain under-explored. We advance the previously demonstrated diagnostic capabilities of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a new LLM-based agentic system optimised for clinical management and dialogue, incorporating reasoning over the evolution of disease and multiple patient visit encounters, response to therapy, and professional competence in medication prescription. To ground its reasoning in authoritative clinical knowledge, AMIE leverages Gemini's long-context capabilities, combining in-context retrieval with structured reasoning to align its output with relevant and up-to-date clinical practice guidelines and drug formularies. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) study, AMIE was compared to 21 primary care physicians (PCPs) across 100 multi-visit case scenarios designed to reflect UK NICE Guidance and BMJ Best Practice guidelines. AMIE was non-inferior to PCPs in management reasoning as assessed by specialist physicians and scored better in both preciseness of treatments and investigations, and in its alignment with and grounding of management plans in clinical guidelines. To benchmark medication reasoning, we developed RxQA, a multiple-choice question benchmark derived from two national drug formularies (US, UK) and validated by board-certified pharmacists. While AMIE and PCPs both benefited from the ability to access external drug information, AMIE outperformed PCPs on higher difficulty questions. While further research would be needed before real-world translation, AMIE's strong performance across evaluations marks a significant step towards conversational AI as a tool in disease management.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the significance of probabilistic time-series forecasting models, their evaluation metrics often involve intractable integrations. The most widely used metric, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), is a strictly proper scoring function; however, its computation requires approximation. We found that popular CRPS estimators--specifically, the quantile-based estimator implemented in the widely used GluonTS library and the probability-weighted moment approximation--both exhibit inherent estimation biases. These biases lead to crude approximations, resulting in improper rankings of forecasting model performance when CRPS values are close. To address this issue, we introduced a kernel quadrature approach that leverages an unbiased CRPS estimator and employs cubature construction for scalable computation. Empirically, our approach consistently outperforms the two widely used CRPS estimators.</p>

<p>Abstract: Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) provides a promising avenue for automating the complex design of deep learning (DL) models. However, current differentiable NAS methods often face constraints in efficiency, operation selection, and adaptability under varying resource limitations. We introduce ZO-DARTS++, a novel NAS method that effectively balances performance and resource constraints. By integrating a zeroth-order approximation for efficient gradient handling, employing a sparsemax function with temperature annealing for clearer and more interpretable architecture distributions, and adopting a size-variable search scheme for generating compact yet accurate architectures, ZO-DARTS++ establishes a new balance between model complexity and performance. In extensive tests on medical imaging datasets, ZO-DARTS++ improves the average accuracy by up to 1.8\% over standard DARTS-based methods and shortens search time by approximately 38.6\%. Additionally, its resource-constrained variants can reduce the number of parameters by more than 35\% while maintaining competitive accuracy levels. Thus, ZO-DARTS++ offers a versatile and efficient framework for generating high-quality, resource-aware DL models suitable for real-world medical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforced random walks (RRWs), including vertex-reinforced random walks (VRRWs) and edge-reinforced random walks (ERRWs), model random walks where the transition probabilities evolve based on prior visitation history~\cite{mgr, fmk, tarres, volkov}. These models have found applications in various areas, such as network representation learning~\cite{xzzs}, reinforced PageRank~\cite{gly}, and modeling animal behaviors~\cite{smouse}, among others. However, statistical estimation of the parameters governing RRWs remains underexplored. This work focuses on estimating the initial edge weights of ERRWs using observed trajectory data. Leveraging the connections between an ERRW and a random walk in a random environment (RWRE)~\cite{mr, mr2}, as given by the so-called "magic formula", we propose an estimator based on the generalized method of moments. To analyze the sample complexity of our estimator, we exploit the hyperbolic Gaussian structure embedded in the random environment to bound the fluctuations of the underlying random edge conductances.</p>

We propose a double machine learning (DML) algorithm for mediation analysis that supports continuous treatments. To estimate the target mediated response curve, our method uses a kernel-based doubly robust moment function for which we prove asymptotic Neyman orthogonality. This allows us to obtain asymptotic normality with nonparametric convergence rate while allowing for nonparametric or parametric estimation of the nuisance parameters. We then derive an optimal bandwidth strategy along with a procedure for estimating asymptotic confidence intervals. Finally, to illustrate the benefits of our method, we provide a numerical evaluation of our approach on a simulation along with an application to real-world medical data to analyze the effect of glycemic control on cognitive functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Kong, Xinge Ma, Jin Wang, Xuejie Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved outstanding performance in natural language processing, but enormous model sizes and high computational costs limit their practical deployment. Structured pruning can effectively reduce the resource demands for deployment by removing redundant model parameters. However, the randomly selected calibration data and fixed single importance estimation metrics in existing structured pruning methods lead to degraded performance of pruned models. This study introduces AdaPruner, a sample-aware adaptive structured pruning framework for LLMs, aiming to optimize the calibration data and importance estimation metrics in the structured pruning process. Specifically, AdaPruner effectively removes redundant parameters from LLMs by constructing a structured pruning solution space and then employing Bayesian optimization to adaptively search for the optimal calibration data and importance estimation metrics. Experimental results show that the AdaPruner outperforms existing structured pruning methods on a family of LLMs with varying pruning ratios, demonstrating its applicability and robustness. Remarkably, at a 20\% pruning ratio, the model pruned with AdaPruner maintains 97\% of the performance of the unpruned model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Liu, Zhiying Deng, Zhongyu Niu, Jun Wang, Haozhao Wang, Zhigang Zeng, Ruixuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting a small subset of crucial rationales from the full input is a key problem in explainability research. The most widely used fundamental criterion for rationale extraction is the maximum mutual information (MMI) criterion. In this paper, we first demonstrate that MMI suffers from diminishing marginal returns. Once part of the rationale has been identified, finding the remaining portions contributes only marginally to increasing the mutual information, making it difficult to use MMI to locate the rest. In contrast to MMI that aims to reproduce the prediction, we seek to identify the parts of the input that the network can actually utilize.
  This is achieved by comparing how different rationale candidates match the capability space of the weight matrix. The weight matrix of a neural network is typically low-rank, meaning that the linear combinations of its column vectors can only cover part of the directions in a high-dimensional space (high-dimension: the dimensions of an input vector). If an input is fully utilized by the network, {it generally matches these directions (e.g., a portion of a hypersphere), resulting in a representation with a high norm. Conversely, if an input primarily falls outside (orthogonal to) these directions}, its representation norm will approach zero, behaving like noise that the network cannot effectively utilize. Building on this, we propose using the norms of rationale candidates as an alternative objective to MMI. Through experiments on four text classification datasets and one graph classification dataset using three network architectures (GRUs, BERT, and GCN), we show that our method outperforms MMI and its improved variants in identifying better rationales. We also compare our method with a representative LLM (llama-3.1-8b-instruct) and find that our simple method gets comparable results to it and can sometimes even outperform it.</p>

<p>Abstract: While a plethora of machine learning (ML) models are currently available, along with their implementation on disparate platforms, there is hardly any verifiable ML code which can be executed on public blockchains. We propose a novel approach named LMST that enables conversion of the inferencing path of an ML model as well as its weights trained off-chain into Solidity code using Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive prompt engineering is done to achieve gas cost optimization beyond mere correctness of the produced code, while taking into consideration the capabilities and limitations of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. We have also developed a proof of concept decentralized application using the code so generated for verifying the accuracy claims of the underlying ML model. An extensive set of experiments demonstrate the feasibility of deploying ML models on blockchains through automated code translation using LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oriel Perets, Ofir Ben Shoham, Nir Grinberg, Nadav Rappoport</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical benchmark datasets significantly contribute to developing Large Language Models (LLMs) for medical knowledge extraction, diagnosis, summarization, and other uses. Yet, current benchmarks are mainly derived from exam questions given to medical students or cases described in the medical literature, lacking the complexity of real-world patient cases that deviate from classic textbook abstractions. These include rare diseases, uncommon presentations of common diseases, and unexpected treatment responses. Here, we construct Clinically Uncommon Patient Cases and Diagnosis Dataset (CUPCase) based on 3,562 real-world case reports from BMC, including diagnoses in open-ended textual format and as multiple-choice options with distractors. Using this dataset, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art LLMs, including both general-purpose and Clinical LLMs, to identify and correctly diagnose a patient case, and test models' performance when only partial information about cases is available. Our findings show that general-purpose GPT-4o attains the best performance in both the multiple-choice task (average accuracy of 87.9%) and the open-ended task (BERTScore F1 of 0.764), outperforming several LLMs with a focus on the medical domain such as Meditron-70B and MedLM-Large. Moreover, GPT-4o was able to maintain 87% and 88% of its performance with only the first 20% of tokens of the case presentation in multiple-choice and free text, respectively, highlighting the potential of LLMs to aid in early diagnosis in real-world cases. CUPCase expands our ability to evaluate LLMs for clinical decision support in an open and reproducible manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Ding, Hao Wu, Yifan Yang, Shiqi Jiang, Donglin Bai, Zhibo Chen, Ting Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of real-world human-AI interaction applications, such as AI assistants, the need for Streaming Video Dialogue is critical. To address this need, we introduce \sys, a video LLM framework that achieves ultra-FPS streaming video processing (100 fps on a single A100) and enables proactive, always-on responses in real time, without explicit user intervention.
  To solve the key challenge of the contradiction between linear video streaming speed and quadratic transformer computation cost, we propose a novel perception-cognition interleaving paradigm named ''event-gated LLM invocation'', in contrast to the existing per-time-step LLM invocation. By introducing a Cognition Gate network between the video encoder and the LLM, LLM is only invoked when relevant events occur. To realize the event feature extraction with constant cost, we propose Event-Preserving Feature Extractor (EPFE) based on state-space method, generating a single perception token for spatiotemporal features. These techniques enable the video LLM with full-FPS perception and real-time cognition response.
  Experiments on Ego4D and SoccerNet streaming tasks, as well as standard offline benchmarks, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both model capability and real-time efficiency, paving the way for ultra-high-FPS applications, such as Game AI Copilot and interactive media.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Frank, a human-in-the-loop system for co-evolutionary hybrid decision-making aiding the user to label records from an un-labeled dataset. Frank employs incremental learning to ``evolve'' in parallel with the user's decisions, by training an interpretable machine learning model on the records labeled by the user. Furthermore, Frank advances state-of-the-art approaches by offering inconsistency controls, explanations, fairness checks, and bad-faith safeguards simultaneously. We evaluate our proposal by simulating the users' behavior with various levels of expertise and reliance on Frank's suggestions. The experiments show that Frank's intervention leads to improvements in the accuracy and the fairness of the decisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinuo Liu, Zenghui Yuan, Guiyao Tie, Jiawen Shi, Lichao Sun, Neil Zhenqiang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the visual reasoning capability of vision-language models (VLMs) by dynamically accessing information from external knowledge bases. In this work, we introduce \textit{Poisoned-MRAG}, the first knowledge poisoning attack on multimodal RAG systems. Poisoned-MRAG injects a few carefully crafted image-text pairs into the multimodal knowledge database, manipulating VLMs to generate the attacker-desired response to a target query. Specifically, we formalize the attack as an optimization problem and propose two cross-modal attack strategies, dirty-label and clean-label, tailored to the attacker's knowledge and goals. Our extensive experiments across multiple knowledge databases and VLMs show that Poisoned-MRAG outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 98\% attack success rate with just five malicious image-text pairs injected into the InfoSeek database (481,782 pairs). Additionally, We evaluate 4 different defense strategies, including paraphrasing, duplicate removal, structure-driven mitigation, and purification, demonstrating their limited effectiveness and trade-offs against Poisoned-MRAG. Our results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of Poisoned-MRAG, underscoring its potential as a significant threat to multimodal RAG systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Jensen, Ian Reynolds, Yasir Atalan, Michael Garcia, Austin Woo, Anthony Chen, Trevor Howarth</p>
<p>Abstract: As national security institutions increasingly integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into decision-making and content generation processes, understanding the inherent biases of large language models (LLMs) is crucial. This study presents a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the biases and preferences of seven prominent foundation models-Llama 3.1 8B Instruct, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro-002, Mixtral 8x22B, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Qwen2 72B-in the context of international relations (IR). We designed a bias discovery study around core topics in IR using 400-expert crafted scenarios to analyze results from our selected models. These scenarios focused on four topical domains including: military escalation, military and humanitarian intervention, cooperative behavior in the international system, and alliance dynamics. Our analysis reveals noteworthy variation among model recommendations based on scenarios designed for the four tested domains. Particularly, Qwen2 72B, Gemini 1.5 Pro-002 and Llama 3.1 8B Instruct models offered significantly more escalatory recommendations than Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o models. All models exhibit some degree of country-specific biases, often recommending less escalatory and interventionist actions for China and Russia compared to the United States and the United Kingdom. These findings highlight the necessity for controlled deployment of LLMs in high-stakes environments, emphasizing the need for domain-specific evaluations and model fine-tuning to align with institutional objectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vinay Kumar Verma, Shreyas Sunil Kulkarni, Happy Mittal, Deepak Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Question Answering (QA) and Visual Question Answering (VQA) are well-studied problems in the language and vision domain. One challenging scenario involves multiple sources of information, each of a different modality, where the answer to the question may exist in one or more sources. This scenario contains richer information but is highly complex to handle. In this work, we formulate a novel question-answer generation (QAG) framework in an environment containing multi-source, multimodal information. The answer may belong to any or all sources; therefore, selecting the most prominent answer source or an optimal combination of all sources for a given question is challenging. To address this issue, we propose a question-guided attention mechanism that learns attention across multiple sources and decodes this information for robust and unbiased answer generation. To learn attention within each source, we introduce an explicit alignment between questions and various information sources, which facilitates identifying the most pertinent parts of the source information relative to the question. Scalability in handling diverse questions poses a challenge. We address this by extending our model to a sparse mixture-of-experts (sparse-MoE) framework, enabling it to handle thousands of question types. Experiments on T5 and Flan-T5 using three datasets demonstrate the model's efficacy, supported by ablation studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Digital network twins (DNTs) are virtual representations of physical networks, designed to enable real-time monitoring, simulation, and optimization of network performance. When integrated with machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly federated learning (FL) and reinforcement learning (RL), DNTs emerge as powerful solutions for managing the complexities of network operations. This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the synergy of DNTs, FL, and RL techniques, showcasing their collective potential to address critical challenges in 6G networks. We highlight key technical challenges that need to be addressed, such as ensuring network reliability, achieving joint data-scenario forecasting, and maintaining security in high-risk environments. Additionally, we propose several pipelines that integrate DNT and ML within coherent frameworks to enhance network optimization and security. Case studies demonstrate the practical applications of our proposed pipelines in edge caching and vehicular networks. In edge caching, the pipeline achieves over 80% cache hit rates while balancing base station loads. In autonomous vehicular system, it ensure a 100% no-collision rate, showcasing its reliability in safety-critical scenarios. By exploring these synergies, we offer insights into the future of intelligent and adaptive network systems that automate decision-making and problem-solving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chandan Kumar Sah, Ankit Kumar Shaw, Xiaoli Lian, Arsalan Shahid Baig, Tuopu Wen, Kun Jiang, Mengmeng Yang, Diange Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) require reliable traffic sign recognition and robust lane detection capabilities to ensure safe navigation in complex and dynamic environments. This paper introduces an integrated approach combining advanced deep learning techniques and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for comprehensive road perception. For traffic sign recognition, we systematically evaluate ResNet-50, YOLOv8, and RT-DETR, achieving state-of-the-art performance of 99.8% with ResNet-50, 98.0% accuracy with YOLOv8, and achieved 96.6% accuracy in RT-DETR despite its higher computational complexity. For lane detection, we propose a CNN-based segmentation method enhanced by polynomial curve fitting, which delivers high accuracy under favorable conditions. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight, Multimodal, LLM-based framework that directly undergoes instruction tuning using small yet diverse datasets, eliminating the need for initial pretraining. This framework effectively handles various lane types, complex intersections, and merging zones, significantly enhancing lane detection reliability by reasoning under adverse conditions. Despite constraints in available training resources, our multimodal approach demonstrates advanced reasoning capabilities, achieving a Frame Overall Accuracy (FRM) of 53.87%, a Question Overall Accuracy (QNS) of 82.83%, lane detection accuracies of 99.6% in clear conditions and 93.0% at night, and robust performance in reasoning about lane invisibility due to rain (88.4%) or road degradation (95.6%). The proposed comprehensive framework markedly enhances AV perception reliability, thus contributing significantly to safer autonomous driving across diverse and challenging road scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hristo N. Djidjev</p>
<p>Abstract: Node embedding is a key technique for representing graph nodes as vectors while preserving structural and relational properties, which enables machine learning tasks like feature extraction, clustering, and classification. While classical methods such as DeepWalk, node2vec, and graph convolutional networks learn node embeddings by capturing structural and relational patterns in graphs, they often require significant computational resources and struggle with scalability on large graphs. Quantum computing provides a promising alternative for graph-based learning by leveraging quantum effects and introducing novel optimization approaches. Variational quantum circuits and quantum kernel methods have been explored for embedding tasks, but their scalability remains limited due to the constraints of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. In this paper, we investigate quantum annealing (QA) as an alternative approach that mitigates key challenges associated with quantum gate-based models. We propose several formulations of the node embedding problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) instance, making it compatible with current quantum annealers such as those developed by D-Wave. We implement our algorithms on a D-Wave quantum annealer and evaluate their performance on graphs with up to 100 nodes and embedding dimensions of up to 5. Our findings indicate that QA is a viable approach for graph-based learning, providing a scalable and efficient alternative to previous quantum embedding techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawen Wang, Samin Karim, Yuan Hong, Binghui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful generative models in continuous data domains such as image and video data. Discrete graph diffusion models (DGDMs) have recently extended them for graph generation, which are crucial in fields like molecule and protein modeling, and obtained the SOTA performance. However, it is risky to deploy DGDMs for safety-critical applications (e.g., drug discovery) without understanding their security vulnerabilities. In this work, we perform the first study on graph diffusion models against backdoor attacks, a severe attack that manipulates both the training and inference/generation phases in graph diffusion models. We first define the threat model, under which we design the attack such that the backdoored graph diffusion model can generate 1) high-quality graphs without backdoor activation, 2) effective, stealthy, and persistent backdoored graphs with backdoor activation, and 3) graphs that are permutation invariant and exchangeable--two core properties in graph generative models. 1) and 2) are validated via empirical evaluations without and with backdoor defenses, while 3) is validated via theoretical results.</p>

<p>Abstract: General matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) is a cornerstone of AI computations, making tensor processing engines (TPEs) increasingly critical in GPUs and domain-specific architectures. Existing architectures primarily optimize dataflow or operand reuse strategies. However, considering the interaction between matrix multiplication and multiply-accumulators (MACs) offers greater optimization potential. This work introduces a novel hardware perspective on matrix multiplication, focusing on the bit-weight dimension of MACs. We propose a finer-grained TPE notation using matrix triple loops as an example, introducing new methods for designing and optimizing PE microarchitectures. Based on this notation and its transformations, we propose four optimization techniques that improve timing, area, and power consumption. Implementing our design in RTL using the SMIC-28nm process, we evaluate its effectiveness across four classic TPE architectures: systolic array, 3D-Cube, multiplier-adder tree, and 2D-Matrix. Our techniques achieve area efficiency improvements of 1.27x, 1.28x, 1.56x, and 1.44x, and energy efficiency gains of 1.04x, 1.56x, 1.49x, and 1.20x, respectively. Applied to a bit-slice architecture, our approach achieves a 12.10x improvement in energy efficiency and 2.85x in area efficiency compared to Laconic.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Scabini, Kallil M. Zielinski, Emir Konuk, Ricardo T. Fares, Lucas C. Ribas, Kevin Smith, Odemir M. Bruno</p>
<p>Abstract: Texture recognition has recently been dominated by ImageNet-pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with specialized modifications and feature engineering required to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However, although Vision Transformers (ViTs) were introduced a few years ago, little is known about their texture recognition ability. Therefore, in this work, we introduce VORTEX (ViTs with Orderless and Randomized Token Encodings for Texture Recognition), a novel method that enables the effective use of ViTs for texture analysis. VORTEX extracts multi-depth token embeddings from pre-trained ViT backbones and employs a lightweight module to aggregate hierarchical features and perform orderless encoding, obtaining a better image representation for texture recognition tasks. This approach allows seamless integration with any ViT with the common transformer architecture. Moreover, no fine-tuning of the backbone is performed, since they are used only as frozen feature extractors, and the features are fed to a linear SVM. We evaluate VORTEX on nine diverse texture datasets, demonstrating its ability to achieve or surpass SOTA performance in a variety of texture analysis scenarios. By bridging the gap between texture recognition with CNNs and transformer-based architectures, VORTEX paves the way for adopting emerging transformer foundation models. Furthermore, VORTEX demonstrates robust computational efficiency when coupled with ViT backbones compared to CNNs with similar costs. The method implementation and experimental scripts are publicly available in our online repository.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinwen Xu, Qin Lu, Yaakov Bar-Shalom</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper deals with the identification of the stochastic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process error model, which is characterized by an inverse time constant, and the unknown variances of the process and observation noises. Although the availability of the explicit expression of the log-likelihood function allows one to obtain the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), this entails evaluating the nontrivial gradient and also often struggles with local optima. To address these limitations, we put forth a sample-efficient global optimization approach based on the Bayesian optimization (BO) framework, which relies on a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model for the objective function that effectively balances exploration and exploitation to select the query points. Specifically, each evaluation of the objective is implemented efficiently through the Kalman filter (KF) recursion. Comprehensive experiments on various parameter settings and sampling intervals corroborate that BO-based estimator consistently outperforms MLE implemented by the steady-state KF approximation and the expectation-maximization algorithm (whose derivation is a side contribution) in terms of root mean-square error (RMSE) and statistical consistency, confirming the effectiveness and robustness of the BO for identification of the stochastic OU process. Notably, the RMSE values produced by the BO-based estimator are smaller than the classical Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound, especially for the inverse time constant, estimating which has been a long-standing challenge. This seemingly counterintuitive result can be explained by the data-driven prior for the learning parameters indirectly injected by BO through the GP prior over the objective function.</p>

To investigate this, we analyze how the information encoded in LLMs' internal representations evolves during the training process. Specifically, we train sparse autoencoders at multiple checkpoints of the model and systematically compare the interpretative results across these stages. Our findings suggest that LLMs initially acquire language-specific knowledge independently, followed by cross-linguistic correspondences. Moreover, we observe that after mastering token-level knowledge, the model transitions to learning higher-level, abstract concepts, indicating the development of more conceptual understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nguyen Do, Truc Nguyen, Malik Hassanaly, Raed Alharbi, Jung Taek Seo, My T. Thai</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite a plethora of anomaly detection models developed over the years, their ability to generalize to unseen anomalies remains an issue, particularly in critical systems. This paper aims to address this challenge by introducing Swift Hydra, a new framework for training an anomaly detection method based on generative AI and reinforcement learning (RL). Through featuring an RL policy that operates on the latent variables of a generative model, the framework synthesizes novel and diverse anomaly samples that are capable of bypassing a detection model. These generated synthetic samples are, in turn, used to augment the detection model, further improving its ability to handle challenging anomalies. Swift Hydra also incorporates Mamba models structured as a Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enable scalable adaptation of the number of Mamba experts based on data complexity, effectively capturing diverse feature distributions without increasing the model's inference time. Empirical evaluations on ADBench benchmark demonstrate that Swift Hydra outperforms other state-of-the-art anomaly detection models while maintaining a relatively short inference time. From these results, our research highlights a new and auspicious paradigm of integrating RL and generative AI for advancing anomaly detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: The kidney paired donation (KPD) program provides an innovative solution to overcome incompatibility challenges in kidney transplants by matching incompatible donor-patient pairs and facilitating kidney exchanges. To address unequal access to transplant opportunities, there are two widely used fairness criteria: group fairness and individual fairness. However, these criteria do not consider protected patient features, which refer to characteristics legally or ethically recognized as needing protection from discrimination, such as race and gender. Motivated by the calibration principle in machine learning, we introduce a new fairness criterion: the matching outcome should be conditionally independent of the protected feature, given the sensitization level. We integrate this fairness criterion as a constraint within the KPD optimization framework and propose a computationally efficient solution. Theoretically, we analyze the associated price of fairness using random graph models. Empirically, we compare our fairness criterion with group fairness and individual fairness through both simulations and a real-data example.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present SEED (\textbf{Se}mantic \textbf{E}valuation for Visual Brain \textbf{D}ecoding), a novel metric for evaluating the semantic decoding performance of visual brain decoding models. It integrates three complementary metrics, each capturing a different aspect of semantic similarity between images. Using carefully crowd-sourced human judgment data, we demonstrate that SEED achieves the highest alignment with human evaluations, outperforming other widely used metrics. Through the evaluation of existing visual brain decoding models, we further reveal that crucial information is often lost in translation, even in state-of-the-art models that achieve near-perfect scores on existing metrics. To facilitate further research, we open-source the human judgment data, encouraging the development of more advanced evaluation methods for brain decoding models. Additionally, we propose a novel loss function designed to enhance semantic decoding performance by leveraging the order of pairwise cosine similarity in CLIP image embeddings. This loss function is compatible with various existing methods and has been shown to consistently improve their semantic decoding performances when used for training, with respect to both existing metrics and SEED.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanyu Cao, Takuya Maekawa, Kazuya Ohara, Yasue Kishino</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proposes a new deep learning method for reconstructing depth images of moving objects within a specific area using Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI). The Wi-Fi-based depth imaging technique has novel applications in domains such as security and elder care. However, reconstructing depth images from CSI is challenging because learning the mapping function between CSI and depth images, both of which are high-dimensional data, is particularly difficult. To address the challenge, we propose a new approach called Wi-Depth. The main idea behind the design of Wi-Depth is that a depth image of a moving object can be decomposed into three core components: the shape, depth, and position of the target. Therefore, in the depth-image reconstruction task, Wi-Depth simultaneously estimates the three core pieces of information as auxiliary tasks in our proposed VAE-based teacher-student architecture, enabling it to output images with the consistency of a correct shape, depth, and position. In addition, the design of Wi-Depth is based on our idea that this decomposition efficiently takes advantage of the fact that shape, depth, and position relate to primitive information inferred from CSI such as angle-of-arrival, time-of-flight, and Doppler frequency shift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jean Seo, Jaeyoon Kim, Hyopil Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose the Mixture of Frozen Experts (MoFE) architecture, which integrates Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) and the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to enhance both training efficiency and model scalability. By freezing the Feed Forward Network (FFN) layers within the MoE framework, MoFE significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters, improving training efficiency while still allowing for effective knowledge transfer from the expert models. This facilitates the creation of models proficient in multiple domains. We conduct experiments to evaluate the trade-offs between performance and efficiency, compare MoFE with other PEFT methodologies, assess the impact of domain expertise in the constituent models, and determine the optimal training strategy. The results show that, although there may be some trade-offs in performance, the efficiency gains are substantial, making MoFE a reasonable solution for real-world, resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Mohammad Izadi, Seyed Mohammad Hadi Hosseini, Soroush Vafaie Tabar, Ali Abdollahi, Armin Saghafian, Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generative models have made significant advancements in recent years; however, accurately capturing intricate details in textual prompts, such as entity missing, attribute binding errors, and incorrect relationships remains a formidable challenge. In response, we present an innovative, training-free method that directly addresses these challenges by incorporating tailored objectives to account for textual constraints. Unlike layout-based approaches that enforce rigid structures and limit diversity, our proposed approach offers a more flexible arrangement of the scene by imposing just the extracted constraints from the text, without any unnecessary additions. These constraints are formulated as losses-entity missing, entity mixing, attribute binding, and spatial relationships, integrated into a unified loss that is applied in the first generation stage. Furthermore, we introduce a feedback-driven system for fine-grained initial noise refinement. This system integrates a verifier that evaluates the generated image, identifies inconsistencies, and provides corrective feedback. Leveraging this feedback, our refinement method first targets the unmet constraints by refining the faulty attention maps caused by initial noise, through the optimization of selective losses associated with these constraints. Subsequently, our unified loss function is reapplied to proceed the second generation phase. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, relying solely on our proposed objective functions, significantly enhances compositionality, achieving a 24% improvement in human evaluation and a 25% gain in spatial relationships. Furthermore, our fine-grained noise refinement proves effective, boosting performance by up to 5%. Code is available at https://github.com/hadi-hosseini/noise-refinement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoqiang Kang, Enna Sachdeva, Piyush Gupta, Sangjae Bae, Kwonjoon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promising advancements in sequential decision-making tasks through task-specific fine-tuning. However, common fine-tuning methods, such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), present notable limitations: SFT assumes Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) data, while PPO focuses on maximizing cumulative rewards. These limitations often restrict solution diversity and hinder generalization in multi-step reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, GFlowVLM, a framework that fine-tune VLMs using Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to promote generation of diverse solutions for complex reasoning tasks. GFlowVLM models the environment as a non-Markovian decision process, allowing it to capture long-term dependencies essential for real-world applications. It takes observations and task descriptions as inputs to prompt chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning which subsequently guides action selection. We use task based rewards to fine-tune VLM with GFlowNets. This approach enables VLMs to outperform prior fine-tuning methods, including SFT and RL. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of GFlowVLM on complex tasks such as card games (NumberLine, BlackJack) and embodied planning tasks (ALFWorld), showing enhanced training efficiency, solution diversity, and stronger generalization capabilities across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shinnosuke Matsuo, Riku Togashi, Ryoma Bise, Seiichi Uchida, Masahiro Nomura</p>
<p>Abstract: Active learning (AL) is a label-efficient machine learning paradigm that focuses on selectively annotating high-value instances to maximize learning efficiency. Its effectiveness can be further enhanced by incorporating weak supervision, which uses rough yet cost-effective annotations instead of exact (i.e., full) but expensive annotations. We introduce a novel AL framework, Instance-wise Supervision-Level Optimization (ISO), which not only selects the instances to annotate but also determines their optimal annotation level within a fixed annotation budget. Its optimization criterion leverages the value-to-cost ratio (VCR) of each instance while ensuring diversity among the selected instances. In classification experiments, ISO consistently outperforms traditional AL methods and surpasses a state-of-the-art AL approach that combines full and weak supervision, achieving higher accuracy at a lower overall cost.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leia Greenberg, Haim Avron</p>
<p>Abstract: Reduced Rank Regression (RRR) is a widely used method for multi-response regression. However, RRR assumes a linear relationship between features and responses. While linear models are useful and often provide a good approximation, many real-world problems involve more complex relationships that cannot be adequately captured by simple linear interactions. One way to model such relationships is via multilinear transformations. This paper introduces Higher Order Reduced Rank Regression (HORRR), an extension of RRR that leverages multi-linear transformations, and as such is capable of capturing nonlinear interactions in multi-response regression. HORRR employs tensor representations for the coefficients and a Tucker decomposition to impose multilinear rank constraints as regularization akin to the rank constraints in RRR. Encoding these constraints as a manifold allows us to use Riemannian optimization to solve this HORRR problems. We theoretically and empirically analyze the use of Riemannian optimization for solving HORRR problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Ai, Pengfei Zhou, Zhaopan Xu, Ming Li, Fanrui Zhang, Zizhen Li, Jianwen Sun, Yukang Feng, Baojin Huang, Zhongyuan Wang, Kaipeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: As multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit errors when solving scientific problems, evaluating the validity of their reasoning processes is critical for ensuring reliability and uncovering fine-grained model weaknesses. Since human evaluation is laborious and costly, prompting MLLMs as automated process judges has become a common practice. However, the reliability of these model-based judges remains uncertain. To address this, we introduce ProJudgeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating abilities of MLLM-based process judges. ProJudgeBench comprises 2,400 test cases and 50,118 step-level labels, spanning four scientific disciplines with diverse difficulty levels and multi-modal content. In ProJudgeBench, each step is meticulously annotated by human experts for correctness, error type, and explanation, enabling a systematic evaluation of judges' capabilities to detect, classify and diagnose errors. Evaluation on ProJudgeBench reveals a significant performance gap between open-source and proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we further propose ProJudge-173k, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset, and a Dynamic Dual-Phase fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to explicitly reason through problem-solving before assessing solutions. Both contributions significantly enhance the process evaluation capabilities of open-source models. All the resources will be released to foster future research of reliable multi-modal process evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding plant growth dynamics is essential for applications in agriculture and plant phenotyping. We present the Growth Modelling (GroMo) challenge, which is designed for two primary tasks: (1) plant age prediction and (2) leaf count estimation, both essential for crop monitoring and precision agriculture. For this challenge, we introduce GroMo25, a dataset with images of four crops: radish, okra, wheat, and mustard. Each crop consists of multiple plants (p1, p2, ..., pn) captured over different days (d1, d2, ..., dm) and categorized into five levels (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5). Each plant is captured from 24 different angles with a 15-degree gap between images. Participants are required to perform both tasks for all four crops with these multiview images. We proposed a Multiview Vision Transformer (MVVT) model for the GroMo challenge and evaluated the crop-wise performance on GroMo25. MVVT reports an average MAE of 7.74 for age prediction and an MAE of 5.52 for leaf count. The GroMo Challenge aims to advance plant phenotyping research by encouraging innovative solutions for tracking and predicting plant growth.

Differential attention was originally developed for large language models to amplify relevant context while canceling out noisy information. In this work, we integrate this mechanism into CLIP's dual encoder (image and text) framework. With minimal additional parameters, DiffCLIP achieves superior performance on image-text understanding tasks. Across zero-shot classification, retrieval, and robustness benchmarks, DiffCLIP consistently outperforms baseline CLIP models. Notably, these gains come with negligible computational overhead, demonstrating that differential attention can significantly enhance multi-modal representations without sacrificing efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hassan Kazemi Tehrani, Jun Cai, Abbas Yekanlou, Sylvia Santosa</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate food intake monitoring is crucial for maintaining a healthy diet and preventing nutrition-related diseases. With the diverse range of foods consumed across various cultures, classic food classification models have limitations due to their reliance on fixed-sized food datasets. Studies show that people consume only a small range of foods across the existing ones, each consuming a unique set of foods. Existing class-incremental models have low accuracy for the new classes and lack personalization. This paper introduces a personalized, class-incremental food classification model designed to overcome these challenges and improve the performance of food intake monitoring systems. Our approach adapts itself to the new array of food classes, maintaining applicability and accuracy, both for new and existing classes by using personalization. Our model's primary focus is personalization, which improves classification accuracy by prioritizing a subset of foods based on an individual's eating habits, including meal frequency, times, and locations. A modified version of DSN is utilized to expand on the appearance of new food classes. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive framework that integrates this model into a food intake monitoring system. This system analyzes meal images provided by users, makes use of a smart scale to estimate food weight, utilizes a nutrient content database to calculate the amount of each macro-nutrient, and creates a dietary user profile through a mobile application. Finally, experimental evaluations on two new benchmark datasets FOOD101-Personal and VFN-Personal, personalized versions of well-known datasets for food classification, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in improving the classification accuracy of both new and existing classes, addressing the limitations of both conventional and class-incremental food classification models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Standard NLP benchmarks often fail to capture vulnerabilities stemming from dataset artifacts and spurious correlations. Contrast sets address this gap by challenging models near decision boundaries but are traditionally labor-intensive to create and limited in diversity. This study leverages large language models to automate the generation of diverse contrast sets. Using the SNLI dataset, we created a 3,000-example contrast set to evaluate and improve model robustness. Fine-tuning on these contrast sets enhanced performance on systematically perturbed examples, maintained standard test accuracy, and modestly improved generalization to novel perturbations. This automated approach offers a scalable solution for evaluating and improving NLP models, addressing systematic generalization challenges, and advancing robustness in real-world applications.</p>

Introducing AgiBot World, a large-scale platform comprising over 1 million trajectories across 217 tasks in five deployment scenarios, we achieve an order-of-magnitude increase in data scale compared to existing datasets. Accelerated by a standardized collection pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, AgiBot World guarantees high-quality and diverse data distribution. It is extensible from grippers to dexterous hands and visuo-tactile sensors for fine-grained skill acquisition. Building on top of data, we introduce Genie Operator-1 (GO-1), a novel generalist policy that leverages latent action representations to maximize data utilization, demonstrating predictable performance scaling with increased data volume. Policies pre-trained on our dataset achieve an average performance improvement of 30% over those trained on Open X-Embodiment, both in in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios. GO-1 exhibits exceptional capability in real-world dexterous and long-horizon tasks, achieving over 60% success rate on complex tasks and outperforming prior RDT approach by 32%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Huang, Peng Ye, Xiaohui Wang, Shenghe Zheng, Biqing Qi, Lei Bai, Wanli Ouyang, Tao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: With transformer-based models and the pretrain-finetune paradigm becoming mainstream, the high storage and deployment costs of individual finetuned models on multiple tasks pose critical challenges. Delta compression attempts to lower the costs by reducing the redundancy of delta parameters (i.e., the difference between the finetuned and pre-trained model weights). However, existing methods usually face problems including data accessibility and training requirements. To tackle this issue, we introduce Delta-DCT, the first data-free delta compression method inspired by classic JPEG image compression, leveraging the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We first (a) group delta parameters within a layer into patches. Then we (b) assess the importance of each patch and allocate them with different quantization bit-widths. Afterwards, we (c) convert these patches to the DCT domain and conduct quantization to each patch based on the allocated bit-width. The proposed Delta-DCT does not require any training or data calibration, while achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing original finetuned models under 1-bit equivalent delta compression ratios on different kinds of models including: (1) recently-released LLMs of different sizes from 7B to 13B, (2) relatively smaller language models including RoBERTa and T5 models, (3) variants of vision transformer models, and (4) multi-modal BEiT-3 models.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of a Type-1 Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller, designed to operate as an artificial pancreas for Type 1 diabetes. The primary challenge in diabetes management is the dynamic nature of blood glucose levels, which are influenced by several factors such as meal intake and timing. Traditional controllers often struggle to adapt to these changes, leading to suboptimal insulin administration. To address this issue, we employ a reinforcement learning agent tasked with adjusting 27 parameters of the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller at each time step, ensuring real-time adaptability. The study's findings demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the robustness of the controller against variations in meal size and timing, while also stabilizing glucose levels with minimal exogenous insulin. This adaptive method holds promise for improving the quality of life and health outcomes for individuals with Type 1 diabetes by providing a more responsive and precise management tool.

<p>Abstract: Process-driven dialogue systems, which operate under strict predefined process constraints, are essential in customer service and equipment maintenance scenarios. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in dialogue and reasoning, they still struggle to solve these strictly constrained dialogue tasks. To address this challenge, we construct Process Flow Dialogue (PFDial) dataset, which contains 12,705 high-quality Chinese dialogue instructions derived from 440 flowcharts containing 5,055 process nodes. Based on PlantUML specification, each UML flowchart is converted into atomic dialogue units i.e., structured five-tuples. Experimental results demonstrate that a 7B model trained with merely 800 samples, and a 0.5B model trained on total data both can surpass 90% accuracy. Additionally, the 8B model can surpass GPT-4o up to 43.88% with an average of 11.00%. We further evaluate models' performance on challenging backward transitions in process flows and conduct an in-depth analysis of various dataset formats to reveal their impact on model performance in handling decision and sequential branches.

<p>Abstract: This work suggests faster and space-efficient index construction algorithms for LSH for Euclidean distance (\textit{a.k.a.}~\ELSH) and cosine similarity (\textit{a.k.a.}~\SRP). The index construction step of these LSHs relies on grouping data points into several bins of hash tables based on their hashcode. To generate an $m$-dimensional hashcode of the $d$-dimensional data point, these LSHs first project the data point onto a $d$-dimensional random Gaussian vector and then discretise the resulting inner product. The time and space complexity of both \ELSH~and \SRP~for computing an $m$-sized hashcode of a $d$-dimensional vector is $O(md)$, which becomes impractical for large values of $m$ and $d$. To overcome this problem, we propose two alternative LSH hashcode generation algorithms both for Euclidean distance and cosine similarity, namely, \CSELSH, \HCSELSH~and \CSSRP, \HCSSRP, respectively. \CSELSH~and \CSSRP~are based on count sketch \cite{count_sketch} and \HCSELSH~and \HCSSRP~utilize higher-order count sketch \cite{shi2019higher}. These proposals significantly reduce the hashcode computation time from $O(md)$ to $O(d)$. Additionally, both \CSELSH~and \CSSRP~reduce the space complexity from $O(md)$ to $O(d)$; ~and \HCSELSH, \HCSSRP~ reduce the space complexity from $O(md)$ to $O(N \sqrt[N]{d})$ respectively, where $N\geq 1$ denotes the size of the input/reshaped tensor. Our proposals are backed by strong mathematical guarantees, and we validate their performance through simulations on various real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: DeepSeek-R1-Zero has successfully demonstrated the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs purely through Reinforcement Learning (RL). Inspired by this breakthrough, we explore how RL can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capability of MLLMs. However, direct training with RL struggles to activate complex reasoning capabilities such as questioning and reflection in MLLMs, due to the absence of substantial high-quality multimodal reasoning data. To address this issue, we propose the reasoning MLLM, Vision-R1, to improve multimodal reasoning capability. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality multimodal CoT dataset without human annotations by leveraging an existing MLLM and DeepSeek-R1 through modality bridging and data filtering to obtain a 200K multimodal CoT dataset, Vision-R1-cold dataset. It serves as cold-start initialization data for Vision-R1. To mitigate the optimization challenges caused by overthinking after cold start, we propose Progressive Thinking Suppression Training (PTST) strategy and employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with the hard formatting result reward function to gradually refine the model's ability to learn correct and complex reasoning processes on a 10K multimodal math dataset. Comprehensive experiments show our model achieves an average improvement of $\sim$6% across various multimodal math reasoning benchmarks. Vision-R1-7B achieves a 73.5% accuracy on the widely used MathVista benchmark, which is only 0.4% lower than the leading reasoning model, OpenAI O1.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Nugyen, Kentaro Hoffman, Tyler McCormick</p>
<p>Abstract: Collecting labeled data for machine learning models is often expensive and time-consuming. Active learning addresses this challenge by selectively labeling the most informative observations, but when initial labeled data is limited, it becomes difficult to distinguish genuinely informative points from those appearing uncertain primarily due to noise. Ensemble methods like random forests are a powerful approach to quantifying this uncertainty but do so by aggregating all models indiscriminately. This includes poor performing models and redundant models, a problem that worsens in the presence of noisy data. We introduce UNique Rashomon Ensembled Active Learning (UNREAL), which selectively ensembles only distinct models from the Rashomon set, which is the set of nearly optimal models. Restricting ensemble membership to high-performing models with different explanations helps distinguish genuine uncertainty from noise-induced variation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peizheng Li, Adnan Aijaz</p>
<p>Abstract: The convergence of robotics, advanced communication networks, and artificial intelligence (AI) holds the promise of transforming industries through fully automated and intelligent operations. In this work, we introduce a novel co-working framework for robots that unifies goal-oriented semantic communication (SemCom) with a Generative AI (GenAI)-agent under a semantic-aware network. SemCom prioritizes the exchange of meaningful information among robots and the network, thereby reducing overhead and latency. Meanwhile, the GenAI-agent leverages generative AI models to interpret high-level task instructions, allocate resources, and adapt to dynamic changes in both network and robotic environments. This agent-driven paradigm ushers in a new level of autonomy and intelligence, enabling complex tasks of networked robots to be conducted with minimal human intervention. We validate our approach through a multi-robot anomaly detection use-case simulation, where robots detect, compress, and transmit relevant information for classification. Simulation results confirm that SemCom significantly reduces data traffic while preserving critical semantic details, and the GenAI-agent ensures task coordination and network adaptation. This synergy provides a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for modern industrial environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we describe the design of an inexpensive and agile climate sensor system which can be repurposed easily to measure various pollutants. We also propose the use of machine learning regression methods to calibrate CO2 data from this cost-effective sensing platform to a reference sensor at the South African Weather Service's Cape Point measurement facility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufei Li, John Nham, Ganesh Jawahar, Lei Shu, David Uthus, Yun-Hsuan Sung, Chengrun Yang, Itai Rolnick, Yi Qiao, Cong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generic text rewriting is a prevalent large language model (LLM) application that covers diverse real-world tasks, such as style transfer, fact correction, and email editing. These tasks vary in rewriting objectives (e.g., factual consistency vs. semantic preservation), making it challenging to develop a unified model that excels across all dimensions. Existing methods often specialize in either a single task or a specific objective, limiting their generalizability. In this work, we introduce a generic model proficient in factuality, stylistic, and conversational rewriting tasks. To simulate real-world user rewrite requests, we construct a conversational rewrite dataset, ChatRewrite, that presents ``natural''-sounding instructions, from raw emails using LLMs. Combined with other popular rewrite datasets, including LongFact for the factuality rewrite task and RewriteLM for the stylistic rewrite task, this forms a broad benchmark for training and evaluating generic rewrite models. To align with task-specific objectives, we propose Dr Genre, a Decoupled-reward learning framework for Generic rewriting, that utilizes objective-oriented reward models with a task-specific weighting. Evaluation shows that \approach delivers higher-quality rewrites across all targeted tasks, improving objectives including instruction following (agreement), internal consistency (coherence), and minimal unnecessary edits (conciseness).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Zhang, Weiming Zhi, Joshua Mangelson, Matthew Johnson-Roberson</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of generating representations of underwater 3D terrain. Off-the-shelf generative models, trained on Internet-scale data but not on specialized underwater images, exhibit downgraded realism, as images of the seafloor are relatively uncommon. To this end, we introduce DreamSea, a generative model to generate hyper-realistic underwater scenes. DreamSea is trained on real-world image databases collected from underwater robot surveys. Images from these surveys contain massive real seafloor observations and covering large areas, but are prone to noise and artifacts from the real world. We extract 3D geometry and semantics from the data with visual foundation models, and train a diffusion model that generates realistic seafloor images in RGBD channels, conditioned on novel fractal distribution-based latent embeddings. We then fuse the generated images into a 3D map, building a 3DGS model supervised by 2D diffusion priors which allows photorealistic novel view rendering. DreamSea is rigorously evaluated, demonstrating the ability to robustly generate large-scale underwater scenes that are consistent, diverse, and photorealistic. Our work drives impact in multiple domains, spanning filming, gaming, and robot simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashwinee Panda, Xinyu Tang, Milad Nasr, Christopher A. Choquette-Choo, Prateek Mittal</p>
<p>Abstract: Current techniques for privacy auditing of large language models (LLMs) have limited efficacy -- they rely on basic approaches to generate canaries which leads to weak membership inference attacks that in turn give loose lower bounds on the empirical privacy leakage. We develop canaries that are far more effective than those used in prior work under threat models that cover a range of realistic settings. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on multiple families of fine-tuned LLMs that our approach sets a new standard for detection of privacy leakage. For measuring the memorization rate of non-privately trained LLMs, our designed canaries surpass prior approaches. For example, on the Qwen2.5-0.5B model, our designed canaries achieve $49.6\%$ TPR at $1\%$ FPR, vastly surpassing the prior approach's $4.2\%$ TPR at $1\%$ FPR. Our method can be used to provide a privacy audit of $\varepsilon \approx 1$ for a model trained with theoretical $\varepsilon$ of 4. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a privacy audit of LLM training has achieved nontrivial auditing success in the setting where the attacker cannot train shadow models, insert gradient canaries, or access the model at every iteration.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06814">Unlocking Generalization for Robotics via Modularity and Scale</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Murtaza Dalal</p>
<p>Abstract: How can we build generalist robot systems? Scale may not be enough due to the significant multimodality of robotics tasks, lack of easily accessible data and the challenges of deploying on physical hardware. Meanwhile, most deployed robotic systems today are inherently modular and can leverage the independent generalization capabilities of each module to perform well. Therefore, this thesis seeks to tackle the task of building generalist robot agents by integrating these components into one: combining modularity with large-scale learning for general purpose robot control. The first question we consider is: how can we build modularity and hierarchy into learning systems? Our key insight is that rather than having the agent learn hierarchy and low-level control end-to-end, we can enforce modularity via planning to enable more efficient and capable robot learners. Next, we come to the role of scale in building generalist robot systems. To scale, neural networks require vast amounts of diverse data, expressive architectures to fit the data and a source of supervision to generate the data. We leverage a powerful supervision source: classical planning, which can generalize, but is expensive to run and requires access to privileged information to perform well in practice. We use these planners to supervise large-scale policy learning in simulation to produce generalist agents. Finally, we consider how to unify modularity with large-scale policy learning to build real-world robot systems capable of performing zero-shot manipulation. We do so by tightly integrating key ingredients of modular high and mid-level planning, learned local control, procedural scene generation and large-scale policy learning for sim2real transfer. We demonstrate that this recipe can produce a single, generalist agent that can solve challenging long-horizon manipulation tasks in the real world.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of video understanding, Video Question Answering (VideoQA) remains a focal point. However, existing datasets exhibit gaps in temporal and spatial granularity, which consequently limits the capabilities of existing VideoQA methods. This paper introduces the Multi-Object Multi-Actor Question Answering (MOMA-QA) dataset, which is designed to address these shortcomings by emphasizing temporal localization, spatial relationship reasoning, and entity-centric queries. With ground truth scene graphs and temporal interval annotations, MOMA-QA is ideal for developing models for fine-grained video understanding. Furthermore, we present a novel video-language model, SGVLM, which incorporates a scene graph predictor, an efficient frame retriever, and a pre-trained large language model for temporal localization and fine-grained relationship understanding. Evaluations on MOMA-QA and other public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model, setting new benchmarks for VideoQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianqi Zhang, Jingyao Wang, Xingchen Shen, Wenwen Qiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) plays a crucial role in many applications. Transformer-based methods are one of the mainstream techniques for TSF. Existing methods treat all token dependencies equally. However, we find that the effectiveness of token dependencies varies across different forecasting scenarios, and existing methods ignore these differences, which affects their performance. This raises two issues: (1) What are effective token dependencies? (2) How can we learn effective dependencies? From a logical perspective, we align Transformer-based TSF methods with the logical framework and define effective token dependencies as those that ensure the tokens as atomic formulas (Issue 1). We then align the learning process of Transformer methods with the process of obtaining atomic formulas in logic, which inspires us to design a method for learning these effective dependencies (Issue 2). Specifically, we propose Attention Logic Regularization (Attn-L-Reg), a plug-and-play method that guides the model to use fewer but more effective dependencies by making the attention map sparse, thereby ensuring the tokens as atomic formulas and improving prediction performance. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis confirm the effectiveness of Attn-L-Reg.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ta Duc Huy, Sen Kim Tran, Phan Nguyen, Nguyen Hoang Tran, Tran Bao Sam, Anton van den Hengel, Zhibin Liao, Johan W. Verjans, Minh-Son To, Vu Minh Hieu Phan</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to interpret and intervene model decisions is important for the adoption of computer-aided diagnosis methods in clinical workflows. Recent concept-based methods link the model predictions with interpretable concepts and modify their activation scores to interact with the model. However, these concepts are at the image level, which hinders the model from pinpointing the exact patches the concepts are activated. Alternatively, prototype-based methods learn representations from training image patches and compare these with test image patches, using the similarity scores for final class prediction. However, interpreting the underlying concepts of these patches can be challenging and often necessitates post-hoc guesswork. To address this issue, this paper introduces the novel Concept-based Similarity Reasoning network (CSR), which offers (i) patch-level prototype with intrinsic concept interpretation, and (ii) spatial interactivity. First, the proposed CSR provides localized explanation by grounding prototypes of each concept on image regions. Second, our model introduces novel spatial-level interaction, allowing doctors to engage directly with specific image areas, making it an intuitive and transparent tool for medical imaging. CSR improves upon prior state-of-the-art interpretable methods by up to 4.5\% across three biomedical datasets. Our code is released at https://github.com/tadeephuy/InteractCSR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuefan Cao, Xuyang Guo, Jiayan Huo, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Jiahao Zhang, Zhen Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative modeling is widely regarded as one of the most essential problems in today's AI community, with text-to-image generation having gained unprecedented real-world impacts. Among various approaches, diffusion models have achieved remarkable success and have become the de facto solution for text-to-image generation. However, despite their impressive performance, these models exhibit fundamental limitations in adhering to numerical constraints in user instructions, frequently generating images with an incorrect number of objects. While several prior works have mentioned this issue, a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of this limitation remains lacking. To address this gap, we introduce T2ICountBench, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the counting ability of state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models. Our benchmark encompasses a diverse set of generative models, including both open-source and private systems. It explicitly isolates counting performance from other capabilities, provides structured difficulty levels, and incorporates human evaluations to ensure high reliability.
  Extensive evaluations with T2ICountBench reveal that all state-of-the-art diffusion models fail to generate the correct number of objects, with accuracy dropping significantly as the number of objects increases. Additionally, an exploratory study on prompt refinement demonstrates that such simple interventions generally do not improve counting accuracy. Our findings highlight the inherent challenges in numerical understanding within diffusion models and point to promising directions for future improvements.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06901">Iterative Prompt Relocation for Distribution-Adaptive Visual Prompt Tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chikai Shang, Mengke Li, Yiqun Zhang, Zhen Chen, Jinlin Wu, Fangqing Gu, Yang Lu, Yiu-ming Cheung</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual prompt tuning (VPT) provides an efficient and effective solution for adapting pre-trained models to various downstream tasks by incorporating learnable prompts. However, most prior art indiscriminately applies a fixed prompt distribution across different tasks, neglecting the importance of each block differing depending on the task. In this paper, we investigate adaptive distribution optimization (ADO) by addressing two key questions: (1) How to appropriately and formally define ADO, and (2) How to design an adaptive distribution strategy guided by this definition? Through in-depth analysis, we provide an affirmative answer that properly adjusting the distribution significantly improves VPT performance, and further uncover a key insight that a nested relationship exists between ADO and VPT. Based on these findings, we propose a new VPT framework, termed PRO-VPT (iterative Prompt RelOcation-based VPT), which adaptively adjusts the distribution building upon a nested optimization formulation. Specifically, we develop a prompt relocation strategy for ADO derived from this formulation, comprising two optimization steps: identifying and pruning idle prompts, followed by determining the optimal blocks for their relocation. By iteratively performing prompt relocation and VPT, our proposal adaptively learns the optimal prompt distribution, thereby unlocking the full potential of VPT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VPT methods, e.g., PRO-VPT surpasses VPT by 1.6% average accuracy, leading prompt-based methods to state-of-the-art performance on the VTAB-1k benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanlong Wang, Jian Xu, Shao-Lun Huang, Danny Dongning Sun, Xiao-Ping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study seeks to advance the understanding and prediction of stock market return uncertainty through the application of advanced deep learning techniques. We introduce a novel deep learning model that utilizes a Gaussian mixture distribution to capture the complex, time-varying nature of asset return distributions in the Chinese stock market. By incorporating the Gaussian mixture distribution, our approach effectively characterizes short-term fluctuations and non-traditional features of stock returns, such as skewness and heavy tails, that are often overlooked by traditional models. Compared to GARCH models and their variants, our method demonstrates superior performance in volatility estimation, particularly during periods of heightened market volatility. It provides more accurate volatility forecasts and offers unique risk insights for different assets, thereby deepening the understanding of return uncertainty. Additionally, we propose a novel use of Code embedding which utilizes a bag-of-words approach to train hidden representations of stock codes and transforms the uncertainty attributes of stocks into high-dimensional vectors. These vectors are subsequently reduced to two dimensions, allowing the observation of similarity among different stocks. This visualization facilitates the identification of asset clusters with similar risk profiles, offering valuable insights for portfolio management and risk mitigation. Since we predict the uncertainty of returns by estimating their latent distribution, it is challenging to evaluate the return distribution when the true distribution is unobservable. However, we can measure it through the CRPS to assess how well the predicted distribution matches the true returns, and through MSE and QLIKE metrics to evaluate the error between the volatility level of the predicted distribution and proxy measures of true volatility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Xi, Hua Yang, Shentai Zhang, Yijie Liu, Sijin Sun, Xiuju Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Maritime Multi-Scene Recognition is crucial for enhancing the capabilities of intelligent marine robotics, particularly in applications such as marine conservation, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. However, this task presents significant challenges due to environmental interference, where marine conditions degrade image quality, and the complexity of maritime scenes, which requires deeper reasoning for accurate recognition. Pure vision models alone are insufficient to address these issues. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that integrates image data, textual descriptions and classification vectors generated by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), to provide richer semantic understanding and improve recognition accuracy. Our framework employs an efficient multimodal fusion mechanism to further enhance model robustness and adaptability in complex maritime environments. Experimental results show that our model achieves 98$\%$ accuracy, surpassing previous SOTA models by 3.5$\%$. To optimize deployment on resource-constrained platforms, we adopt activation-aware weight quantization (AWQ) as a lightweight technique, reducing the model size to 68.75MB with only a 0.5$\%$ accuracy drop while significantly lowering computational overhead. This work provides a high-performance solution for real-time maritime scene recognition, enabling Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) to support environmental monitoring and disaster response in resource-limited settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Zhang, Siddharth Das, Tanner Merry, Wenlong Zhang, Yi Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning Nash equilibrial policies for two-player risk-sensitive collision-avoiding interactions. Solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations of such general-sum differential games in real time is an open challenge due to the discontinuity of equilibrium values on the state space. A common solution is to learn a neural network that approximates the equilibrium Hamiltonian for given system states and actions. The learning, however, is usually supervised and requires a large amount of sample equilibrium policies from different initial states in order to mitigate the risks of collisions. This paper claims two contributions towards more data-efficient learning of equilibrium policies: First, instead of computing Hamiltonian through a value network, we show that the equilibrium co-states have simple structures when collision avoidance dominates the agents' loss functions and system dynamics is linear, and therefore are more data-efficient to learn. Second, we introduce theory-driven active learning to guide data sampling, where the acquisition function measures the compliance of the predicted co-states to Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. On an uncontrolled intersection case, the proposed method leads to more generalizable approximation of the equilibrium policies, and in turn, lower collision probabilities, than the state-of-the-art under the same data acquisition budget.</p>

<p>Abstract: Imitation learning is a promising approach for learning robot policies with user-provided data. The way demonstrations are provided, i.e., demonstration modality, influences the quality of the data. While existing research shows that kinesthetic teaching (physically guiding the robot) is preferred by users for the intuitiveness and ease of use, the majority of existing manipulation datasets were collected through teleoperation via a VR controller or spacemouse. In this work, we investigate how different demonstration modalities impact downstream learning performance as well as user experience. Specifically, we compare low-cost demonstration modalities including kinesthetic teaching, teleoperation with a VR controller, and teleoperation with a spacemouse controller. We experiment with three table-top manipulation tasks with different motion constraints. We evaluate and compare imitation learning performance using data from different demonstration modalities, and collected subjective feedback on user experience. Our results show that kinesthetic teaching is rated the most intuitive for controlling the robot and provides cleanest data for best downstream learning performance. However, it is not preferred as the way for large-scale data collection due to the physical load. Based on such insight, we propose a simple data collection scheme that relies on a small number of kinesthetic demonstrations mixed with data collected through teleoperation to achieve the best overall learning performance while maintaining low data-collection effort.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuting Hu, Chenhui Xu, Ruiyang Qin, Dancheng Liu, Amir Nassereldine, Yiyu Shi, Jinjun Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Partial perception deficits can compromise autonomous vehicle safety by disrupting environmental understanding. Current protocols typically respond with immediate stops or minimal-risk maneuvers, worsening traffic flow and lacking flexibility for rare driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose LLM-RCO, a framework leveraging large language models to integrate human-like driving commonsense into autonomous systems facing perception deficits. LLM-RCO features four key modules: hazard inference, short-term motion planner, action condition verifier, and safety constraint generator. These modules interact with the dynamic driving environment, enabling proactive and context-aware control actions to override the original control policy of autonomous agents. To improve safety in such challenging conditions, we construct DriveLM-Deficit, a dataset of 53,895 video clips featuring deficits of safety-critical objects, complete with annotations for LLM-based hazard inference and motion planning fine-tuning. Extensive experiments in adverse driving conditions with the CARLA simulator demonstrate that systems equipped with LLM-RCO significantly improve driving performance, highlighting its potential for enhancing autonomous driving resilience against adverse perception deficits. Our results also show that LLMs fine-tuned with DriveLM-Deficit can enable more proactive movements instead of conservative stops in the context of perception deficits.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the success of distillation in large language models (LLMs), most prior work applies identical loss functions to both teacher- and student-generated data. These strategies overlook the synergy between loss formulations and data types, leading to a suboptimal performance boost in student models.

Our extensive experiments show that DistiLLM-2 not only builds high-performing student models across a wide range of tasks, including instruction-following and code generation, but also supports diverse applications, such as preference alignment and vision-language extensions. These findings highlight the potential of a contrastive approach to enhance the efficacy of LLM distillation by effectively aligning teacher and student models across varied data types.</p>

In this work, we investigate the generalization of representation uncertainty in EO, considering the domain's unique semantic characteristics. We pretrain uncertainties on large EO datasets and propose an evaluation framework to assess their zero-shot performance in multi-label classification and segmentation EO tasks. Our findings reveal that, unlike uncertainties pretrained on natural images, EO-pretraining exhibits strong generalization across unseen EO domains, geographic locations, and target granularities, while maintaining sensitivity to variations in ground sampling distance. We demonstrate the practical utility of pretrained uncertainties showcasing their alignment with task-specific uncertainties in downstream tasks, their sensitivity to real-world EO image noise, and their ability to generate spatial uncertainty estimates out-of-the-box. Initiating the discussion on representation uncertainty in EO, our study provides insights into its strengths and limitations, paving the way for future research in the field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valentin von Bornhaupt, Johannes Gr\"un, and Justus Bisten, Tobias Bauer, Theodor R\"uber, Thomas Schultz</p>
<p>Abstract: Whole-brain tractography in diffusion MRI is often followed by a parcellation in which each streamline is classified as belonging to a specific white matter bundle, or discarded as a false positive. Efficient parcellation is important both in large-scale studies, which have to process huge amounts of data, and in the clinic, where computational resources are often limited. TractCloud is a state-of-the-art approach that aims to maximize accuracy with a local-global representation. We demonstrate that the local context does not contribute to the accuracy of that approach, and is even detrimental when dealing with pathological cases. Based on this observation, we propose PETParc, a new method for Parallel Efficient Tractography Parcellation. PETParc is a transformer-based architecture in which the whole-brain tractogram is randomly partitioned into sub-tractograms whose streamlines are classified in parallel, while serving as global context for each other. This leads to a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude relative to TractCloud, and permits inference even on clinical workstations without a GPU. PETParc accounts for the lack of streamline orientation either via a novel flip-invariant embedding, or by simply using flips as part of data augmentation. Despite the speedup, results are often even better than those of prior methods. The code and pretrained model will be made public upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoran E, Chenghan Chen, Yuyang Shi, Haiyun Wang, Peixin Hua, Xiwen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Methods: A method of the pulsation for a pVAD is proposed (AP-pVAD Model). AP-pVAD Model consists of two parts: NPQ Model and LSTM-Transformer Model. (1)The NPQ Model determines the mathematical relationship between motor speed, pressure, and flow rate for the pVAD. (2)The Attention module of Transformer neural network is integrated into the LSTM neural network to form the new LSTM-Transformer Model to predict the pulsation time characteristic points for adjusting the motor speed of the pVAD. Results: The AP-pVAD Model is validated in three hydraulic experiments and an animal experiment. (1)The pressure provided by pVAD calculated with the NPQ Model has a maximum error of only 2.15 mmHg compared to the expected values. (2)The pulsation time characteristic points predicted by the LSTM-Transformer Model shows a maximum prediction error of 1.78ms, which is significantly lower than other methods. (3)The in-vivo test of pVAD in animal experiment has significant improvements in aortic pressure. Animals survive for over 27 hours after the initiation of pVAD operation. Conclusion: (1)For a given pVAD, motor speed has a linear relationship with pressure and a quadratic relationship with flow. (2)Deep learning can be used to predict pulsation characteristic time points, with the LSTM-Transformer Model demonstrating minimal prediction error and better robust performance under conditions of limited dataset sizes, elevated noise levels, and diverse hyperparameter combinations, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Zou, Hu Yu, Jie Xiao, Feng Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has exhibited impressive generation capabilities but faces great challenges due to its high computational complexity. To address this problem, various methods, notably feature caching, have been introduced. However, these approaches focus on aligning non-cache diffusion without analyzing the impact of caching on the generation of intermediate processes. So the lack of exploration provides us with room for analysis and improvement. In this paper, we analyze the impact of caching on the SNR of the diffusion process and discern that feature caching intensifies the denoising procedure, and we further identify this as a more severe exposure bias issue. Drawing on this insight, we introduce EB-Cache, a joint cache strategy that aligns the Non-exposure bias (which gives us a higher performance ceiling) diffusion process. Our approach incorporates a comprehensive understanding of caching mechanisms and offers a novel perspective on leveraging caches to expedite diffusion processes. Empirical results indicate that EB-Cache optimizes model performance while concurrently facilitating acceleration. Specifically, in the 50-step generation process, EB-Cache achieves 1.49$\times$ acceleration with 0.63 FID reduction from 3.69, surpassing prior acceleration methods.

<p>Abstract: We present a hierarchical neuro-symbolic control framework that couples classical symbolic planning with transformer-based policies to address complex, long-horizon decision-making tasks. At the high level, a symbolic planner constructs an interpretable sequence of operators based on logical propositions, ensuring systematic adherence to global constraints and goals. At the low level, each symbolic operator is translated into a sub-goal token that conditions a decision transformer to generate a fine-grained sequence of actions in uncertain, high-dimensional environments. We provide theoretical analysis showing how approximation errors from both the symbolic planner and the neural execution layer accumulate. Empirical evaluations in grid-worlds with multiple keys, locked doors, and item-collection tasks show that our hierarchical approach outperforms purely end-to-end neural approach in success rates and policy efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although masked image generation models and masked diffusion models are designed with different motivations and objectives, we observe that they can be unified within a single framework. Building upon this insight, we carefully explore the design space of training and sampling, identifying key factors that contribute to both performance and efficiency. Based on the improvements observed during this exploration, we develop our model, referred to as eMIGM. Empirically, eMIGM demonstrates strong performance on ImageNet generation, as measured by Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, with similar number of function evaluations (NFEs) and model parameters, eMIGM outperforms the seminal VAR. Moreover, as NFE and model parameters increase, eMIGM achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models while requiring less than 40% of the NFE. Additionally, on ImageNet 512x512, with only about 60% of the NFE, eMIGM outperforms the state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruochen Pi, Lianlei Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: Collecting and annotating medical images is a time-consuming and resource-intensive task. However, generating synthetic data through models such as Diffusion offers a cost-effective alternative. This paper introduces a new method for the automatic generation of accurate semantic masks from synthetic lung X-ray images based on a stable diffusion model trained on text-image pairs. This method uses cross-attention mapping between text and image to extend text-driven image synthesis to semantic mask generation. It employs text-guided cross-attention information to identify specific areas in an image and combines this with innovative techniques to produce high-resolution, class-differentiated pixel masks. This approach significantly reduces the costs associated with data collection and annotation. The experimental results demonstrate that segmentation models trained on synthetic data generated using the method are comparable to, and in some cases even better than, models trained on real datasets. This shows the effectiveness of the method and its potential to revolutionize medical image analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guilherme Silva, Pedro Silva, Gladston Moreira, Vander Freitas, Jadson Gertrudes, Eduardo Luz</p>
<p>Abstract: The classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is crucial for early detection of arrhythmias and other cardiac conditions. However, despite advances in machine learning, many studies fail to follow standardization protocols, leading to inconsistencies in performance evaluation and real-world applicability. Additionally, hardware constraints essential for practical deployment, such as in pacemakers, Holter monitors, and wearable ECG patches, are often overlooked. Since real-world impact depends on feasibility in resource-constrained devices, ensuring efficient deployment is critical for continuous monitoring. This review systematically analyzes ECG classification studies published between 2017 and 2024, focusing on those adhering to the E3C (Embedded, Clinical, and Comparative Criteria), which include inter-patient paradigm implementation, compliance with Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) recommendations, and model feasibility for embedded systems. While many studies report high accuracy, few properly consider patient-independent partitioning and hardware limitations. We identify state-of-the-art methods meeting E3C criteria and conduct a comparative analysis of accuracy, inference time, energy consumption, and memory usage. Finally, we propose standardized reporting practices to ensure fair comparisons and practical applicability of ECG classification models. By addressing these gaps, this study aims to guide future research toward more robust and clinically viable ECG classification systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Boucher, Evangelos B. Mazomenos</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum vision transformers (QViTs) build on vision transformers (ViTs) by replacing linear layers within the self-attention mechanism with parameterised quantum neural networks (QNNs), harnessing quantum mechanical properties to improve feature representation. This hybrid approach aims to achieve superior performance, with significantly reduced model complexity as a result of the enriched feature representation, requiring fewer parameters. This paper proposes a novel QViT model for biomedical image classification and investigates its performance against comparable ViTs across eight diverse datasets, encompassing various modalities and classification tasks. We assess models trained from scratch and those pre-trained using knowledge distillation (KD) from high-quality teacher models. Our findings demonstrate that QViTs outperform comparable ViTs with average ROC AUC (0.863 vs 0.846) and accuracy (0.710 vs 0.687) when trained from scratch, and even compete with state-of-the-art classical models in multiple tasks, whilst being significantly more efficient (89% reduction in GFLOPs and 99.99% in parameter number). Additionally, we find that QViTs and ViTs respond equally well to KD, with QViT pre-training performance scaling with model complexity. This is the first investigation into the efficacy of deploying QViTs with KD for computer-aided diagnosis. Our results highlight the enormous potential of quantum machine learning (QML) in biomedical image analysis.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07313">The influence of missing data mechanisms and simple missing data handling techniques on fairness</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aeysha Bhatti, Trudie Sandrock, Johane Nienkemper-Swanepoel</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness of machine learning algorithms is receiving increasing attention, as such algorithms permeate the day-to-day aspects of our lives. One way in which bias can manifest in a dataset is through missing values. If data are missing, these data are often assumed to be missing completely randomly; in reality the propensity of data being missing is often tied to the demographic characteristics of individuals. There is limited research into how missing values and the handling thereof can impact the fairness of an algorithm. Most researchers either apply listwise deletion or tend to use the simpler methods of imputation (e.g. mean or mode) compared to the more advanced ones (e.g. multiple imputation); we therefore study the impact of the simpler methods on the fairness of algorithms. The starting point of the study is the mechanism of missingness, leading into how the missing data are processed and finally how this impacts fairness. Three popular datasets in the field of fairness are amputed in a simulation study. The results show that under certain scenarios the impact on fairness can be pronounced when the missingness mechanism is missing at random. Furthermore, elementary missing data handling techniques like listwise deletion and mode imputation can lead to higher fairness compared to more complex imputation methods like k-nearest neighbour imputation, albeit often at the cost of lower accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu He, Saverio Bolognani, Florian D\"orfler, Michael Muehlebach</p>
<p>Abstract: Distribution shifts have long been regarded as troublesome external forces that a decision-maker should either counteract or conform to. An intriguing feedback phenomenon termed decision dependence arises when the deployed decision affects the environment and alters the data-generating distribution. In the realm of performative prediction, this is encoded by distribution maps parameterized by decisions due to strategic behaviors. In contrast, we formalize an endogenous distribution shift as a feedback process featuring nonlinear dynamics that couple the evolving distribution with the decision. Stochastic optimization in this dynamic regime provides a fertile ground to examine the various roles played by dynamics in the composite problem structure. To this end, we develop an online algorithm that achieves optimal decision-making by both adapting to and shaping the dynamic distribution. Throughout the paper, we adopt a distributional perspective and demonstrate how this view facilitates characterizations of distribution dynamics and the optimality and generalization performance of the proposed algorithm. We showcase the theoretical results in an opinion dynamics context, where an opportunistic party maximizes the affinity of a dynamic polarized population, and in a recommender system scenario, featuring performance optimization with discrete distributions in the probability simplex.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriella Waters, Phillip Honenberger</p>
<p>Abstract: The understanding of bias in AI is currently undergoing a revolution. Initially understood as errors or flaws, biases are increasingly recognized as integral to AI systems and sometimes preferable to less biased alternatives. In this paper, we review the reasons for this changed understanding and provide new guidance on two questions: First, how should we think about and measure biases in AI systems, consistent with the new understanding? Second, what kinds of bias in an AI system should we accept or even amplify, and what kinds should we minimize or eliminate, and why? The key to answering both questions, we argue, is to understand biases as "violations of a symmetry standard" (following Kelly). We distinguish three main types of asymmetry in AI systems-error biases, inequality biases, and process biases-and highlight places in the pipeline of AI development and application where bias of each type is likely to be good, bad, or inevitable.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the field of robot target recognition research driven by artificial intelligence (AI), factors such as the disordered distribution of targets, the complexity of the environment, the massive scale of data, and noise interference have significantly restricted the improvement of target recognition accuracy. Against the backdrop of the continuous iteration and upgrading of current AI technologies, to meet the demand for accurate recognition of disordered targets by intelligent robots in complex and changeable scenarios, this study innovatively proposes an AI - based intelligent robot disordered target recognition method using reinforcement learning. This method processes the collected target images with the bilateral filtering algorithm, decomposing them into low - illumination images and reflection images. Subsequently, it adopts differentiated AI strategies, compressing the illumination images and enhancing the reflection images respectively, and then fuses the two parts of images to generate a new image. On this basis, this study deeply integrates deep learning, a core AI technology, with the reinforcement learning algorithm. The enhanced target images are input into a deep reinforcement learning model for training, ultimately enabling the AI - based intelligent robot to efficiently recognize disordered targets. Experimental results show that the proposed method can not only significantly improve the quality of target images but also enable the AI - based intelligent robot to complete the recognition task of disordered targets with higher efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating extremely high application value and broad development prospects in the field of AI robots.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural networks are part of daily-life decision-making, including in high-stakes settings where understanding and transparency are key. Saliency maps have been developed to gain understanding into which input features neural networks use for a specific prediction. Although widely employed, these methods often result in overly general saliency maps that fail to identify the specific information that triggered the classification. In this work, we suggest a framework that allows to incorporate attributions across classes to arrive at saliency maps that actually capture the class-relevant information. On established benchmarks for attribution methods, including the grid-pointing game and randomization-based sanity checks, we show that our framework heavily boosts the performance of standard saliency map approaches. It is, by design, agnostic to model architectures and attribution methods and now allows to identify the distinguishing and shared features used for a model prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eetu Tunturi, David Diaz-Guerra, Archontis Politis, Tuomas Virtanen</p>
<p>Abstract: Music source separation is the task of separating a mixture of instruments into constituent tracks. Music source separation models are typically trained using only audio data, although additional information can be used to improve the model's separation capability. In this paper, we propose two ways of using musical scores to aid music source separation: a score-informed model where the score is concatenated with the magnitude spectrogram of the audio mixture as the input of the model, and a model where we use only the score to calculate the separation mask. We train our models on synthetic data in the SynthSOD dataset and evaluate our methods on the URMP and Aalto anechoic orchestra datasets, comprised of real recordings. The score-informed model improves separation results compared to a baseline approach, but struggles to generalize from synthetic to real data, whereas the score-only model shows a clear improvement in synthetic-to-real generalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Attacks on sensing and perception threaten the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Security-aware sensor fusion helps mitigate threats but requires accurate field of view (FOV) estimation which has not been evaluated autonomy. To address this gap, we adapt classical computer graphics algorithms to develop the first autonomy-relevant FOV estimators and create the first datasets with ground truth FOV labels. Unfortunately, we find that these approaches are themselves highly vulnerable to attacks on sensing. To improve robustness of FOV estimation against attacks, we propose a learning-based segmentation model that captures FOV features, integrates Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) for uncertainty quantification, and performs anomaly detection on confidence maps. We illustrate through comprehensive evaluations attack resistance and strong generalization across environments. Architecture trade studies demonstrate the model is feasible for real-time deployment in multiple applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Materials informatics (MI), which emerges from the integration of materials science and data science, is expected to greatly streamline the material discovery and development. The data used for MI are obtained from both computational and experimental studies, while their integration remains challenging. In our previous study, we reported the integration of these datasets by applying a machine learning model that captures trends hidden in the experimental datasets to compositional data stored in the computational database. In this study, we use the obtained data to construct materials maps, which visualize the relation in the structural features of materials, aiming to support study by the experimental researchers. The map is constructed using the MatDeepLearn (MDL) framework, which implements the graph-based representation of material structures, deep learning, and dimensional reduction for the map construction. We evaluate the obtained materials maps through statistical analysis and found that the MDL using message passing neural network (MPNN) enables efficient extraction of features that reflect the structural complexity of materials. Moreover, we found that this advantage does not necessarily translate into improved accuracy in predicting material properties. We attribute this unexpected outcome to the high learning performance inherent in MPNN, which can contribute to the structuring of data points within the materials map.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diverse usage patterns induce complex and variable aging behaviors in lithium-ion batteries, complicating accurate health diagnosis and prognosis. Separate diagnostic cycles are often used to untangle the battery's current state of health from prior complex aging patterns. However, these same diagnostic cycles alter the battery's degradation trajectory, are time-intensive, and cannot be practically performed in onboard applications. In this work, we leverage portions of operational measurements in combination with an interpretable machine learning model to enable rapid, onboard battery health diagnostics and prognostics without offline diagnostic testing and the requirement of historical data. We integrate mechanistic constraints within an encoder-decoder architecture to extract electrode states in a physically interpretable latent space and enable improved reconstruction of the degradation path. The health diagnosis model framework can be flexibly applied across diverse application interests with slight fine-tuning. We demonstrate the versatility of this model framework by applying it to three battery-cycling datasets consisting of 422 cells under different operating conditions, highlighting the utility of an interpretable diagnostic-free, onboard battery diagnosis and prognosis model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Ney, Norbert Wehn</p>
<p>Abstract: Industrial pumps are essential components in various sectors, such as manufacturing, energy production, and water treatment, where their failures can cause significant financial and safety risks. Anomaly detection can be used to reduce those risks and increase reliability. In this work, we propose a novel enhanced convolutional neural network (ECNN) to predict the failure of an industrial pump based on the vibration data captured by an acceleration sensor. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed with a focus on low complexity to enable its implementation on edge devices with limited computational resources. Therefore, a detailed design space exploration is performed to find a topology satisfying the trade-off between complexity and accuracy. Moreover, to allow for adaptation to unknown pumps, our algorithm features a pump-specific parameter that can be determined by a small set of normal data samples. Finally, we combine the ECNN with a threshold approach to further increase the performance and satisfy the application requirements. As a result, our combined approach significantly outperforms a traditional statistical approach and a classical CNN in terms of accuracy. To summarize, this work provides a novel, low-complex, CNN-based algorithm that is enhanced by classical methods to offer high accuracy for anomaly detection of industrial pumps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junzhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous navigation in intelligent mobile systems represents a core research focus within artificial intelligence-driven robotics. Contemporary path planning approaches face constraints in dynamic environmental responsiveness and multi-objective task scalability, limiting their capacity to address growing intelligent operation requirements. Decision-centric reinforcement learning frameworks, capitalizing on their unique strengths in adaptive environmental interaction and self-optimization, have gained prominence in advanced control system research. This investigation introduces methodological improvements to address sample homogeneity challenges in reinforcement learning experience replay mechanisms. By incorporating determinant point processes (DPP) for diversity assessment, we develop a dual-criteria sampling framework with adaptive selection protocols. This approach resolves representation bias in conventional prioritized experience replay (PER) systems while preserving algorithmic interoperability, offering improved decision optimization for dynamic operational scenarios. Key contributions comprise: Develop a hybrid sampling paradigm (PER-DPP) combining priority sequencing with diversity maximization.Based on this,create an integrated optimization scheme (PER-DPP-Elastic DQN) merging diversity-aware sampling with adaptive step-size regulation. Comparative simulations in 2D navigation scenarios demonstrate that the elastic step-size component temporarily delays initial convergence speed but synergistically enhances final-stage optimization with PER-DPP integration. The synthesized method generates navigation paths with optimized length efficiency and directional stability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Farndale, Paul Henderson, Edward W Roberts, Ke Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning methods often fail to learn subtle or complex features, which can be dominated by simpler patterns which are much easier to learn. This limitation is particularly problematic in applications to science and engineering, as complex features can be critical for discovery and analysis. To address this, we introduce Split Component Embedding Registration (SpliCER), a novel architecture which splits the image into sections and distils information from each section to guide the model to learn more subtle and complex features without compromising on simpler features. SpliCER is compatible with any self-supervised loss function and can be integrated into existing methods without modification. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: i) we demonstrate that existing self-supervised methods can learn shortcut solutions when simple and complex features are both present; ii) we introduce a novel self-supervised training method, SpliCER, to overcome the limitations of existing methods, and achieve significant downstream performance improvements; iii) we demonstrate the effectiveness of SpliCER in cutting-edge medical and geospatial imaging settings. SpliCER offers a powerful new tool for representation learning, enabling models to uncover complex features which could be overlooked by other methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phu-Vinh Nguyen, Minh-Nam Tran, Long Nguyen, Dien Dinh</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of natural language processing, many language models have been invented for multiple tasks. One important task is information retrieval (IR), which requires models to retrieve relevant documents. Despite its importance in many real-life applications, especially in retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems, this task lacks Vietnamese benchmarks. This situation causes difficulty in assessing and comparing many existing Vietnamese embedding language models on the task and slows down the advancement of Vietnamese natural language processing (NLP) research. In this work, we aim to provide the Vietnamese research community with a new benchmark for information retrieval, which mainly focuses on retrieval and reranking tasks. Furthermore, we also present a new objective function based on the InfoNCE loss function, which is used to train our Vietnamese embedding model. Our function aims to be better than the origin in information retrieval tasks. Finally, we analyze the effect of temperature, a hyper-parameter in both objective functions, on the performance of text embedding models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> I-Jung Hsu, Chih-Hsun Lin, Chia-Mu Yu, Sy-Yen Kuo, Chun-Ying Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory data, which tracks movements through geographic locations, is crucial for improving real-world applications. However, collecting such sensitive data raises considerable privacy concerns. Local differential privacy (LDP) offers a solution by allowing individuals to locally perturb their trajectory data before sharing it. Despite its privacy benefits, LDP protocols are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where attackers inject fake data to manipulate aggregated results. In this work, we make the first attempt to analyze vulnerabilities in several representative LDP trajectory protocols. We propose \textsc{TraP}, a heuristic algorithm for data \underline{P}oisoning attacks using a prefix-suffix method to optimize fake \underline{Tra}jectory selection, significantly reducing computational complexity. Our experimental results demonstrate that our attack can substantially increase target pattern occurrences in the perturbed trajectory dataset with few fake users. This study underscores the urgent need for robust defenses and better protocol designs to safeguard LDP trajectory data against malicious manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengmeng Li, Junjie Wen, Yan Peng, Yaxin Peng, Feifei Feng, Yichen Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel at robotic tasks by leveraging large-scale 2D vision-language pretraining, but their reliance on RGB images limits spatial reasoning critical for real-world interaction. Retraining these models with 3D data is computationally prohibitive, while discarding existing 2D datasets wastes valuable resources. To bridge this gap, we propose PointVLA, a framework that enhances pre-trained VLAs with point cloud inputs without requiring retraining. Our method freezes the vanilla action expert and injects 3D features via a lightweight modular block. To identify the most effective way of integrating point cloud representations, we conduct a skip-block analysis to pinpoint less useful blocks in the vanilla action expert, ensuring that 3D features are injected only into these blocks--minimizing disruption to pre-trained representations.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointVLA outperforms state-of-the-art 2D imitation learning methods, such as OpenVLA, Diffusion Policy and DexVLA, across both simulated and real-world robotic tasks. Specifically, we highlight several key advantages of PointVLA enabled by point cloud integration: (1) Few-shot multi-tasking, where PointVLA successfully performs four different tasks using only 20 demonstrations each; (2) Real-vs-photo discrimination, where PointVLA distinguishes real objects from their images, leveraging 3D world knowledge to improve safety and reliability; (3) Height adaptability, Unlike conventional 2D imitation learning methods, PointVLA enables robots to adapt to objects at varying table height that unseen in train data. Furthermore, PointVLA achieves strong performance in long-horizon tasks, such as picking and packing objects from a moving conveyor belt, showcasing its ability to generalize across complex, dynamic environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yash Akhauri, Ahmed F AbouElhamayed, Yifei Gao, Chi-Chih Chang, Nilesh Jain, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on the Key-Value (KV) Cache to store token history, enabling efficient decoding of tokens. As the KV-Cache grows, it becomes a major memory and computation bottleneck, however, there is an opportunity to alleviate this bottleneck, especially because prior research has shown that only a small subset of tokens contribute meaningfully to each decoding step. A key challenge in finding these critical tokens is that they are dynamic, and heavily input query-dependent. Existing methods either risk quality by evicting tokens permanently, or retain the full KV-Cache but rely on retrieving chunks (pages) of tokens at generation, failing at dense, context-rich tasks. Additionally, many existing KV-Cache sparsity methods rely on inaccurate proxies for token importance. To address these limitations, we introduce TokenButler, a high-granularity, query-aware predictor that learns to identify these critical tokens. By training a light-weight predictor with less than 1.2% parameter overhead, TokenButler prioritizes tokens based on their contextual, predicted importance. This improves perplexity & downstream accuracy by over 8% relative to SoTA methods for estimating token importance. We evaluate TokenButler on a novel synthetic small-context co-referential retrieval task, demonstrating near-oracle accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qasim Khadim, Peter Manzl, Emil Kurvinen, Aki Mikkola, Grzegorz Orzechowski, Johannes Gerstmayr</p>
<p>Abstract: The precision, stability, and performance of lightweight high-strength steel structures in heavy machinery is affected by their highly nonlinear dynamics. This, in turn, makes control more difficult, simulation more computationally intensive, and achieving real-time autonomy, using standard approaches, impossible. Machine learning through data-driven, physics-informed and physics-inspired networks, however, promises more computationally efficient and accurate solutions to nonlinear dynamic problems. This study proposes a novel framework that has been developed to estimate real-time structural deflection in hydraulically actuated three-dimensional systems. It is based on SLIDE, a machine-learning-based method to estimate dynamic responses of mechanical systems subjected to forced excitations.~Further, an algorithm is introduced for the data acquisition from a hydraulically actuated system using randomized initial configurations and hydraulic pressures.~The new framework was tested on a hydraulically actuated flexible boom with various sensor combinations and lifting various payloads. The neural network was successfully trained in less time using standard parameters from PyTorch, ADAM optimizer, the various sensor inputs, and minimal output data. The SLIDE-trained neural network accelerated deflection estimation solutions by a factor of $10^7$ in reference to flexible multibody simulation batches and provided reasonable accuracy. These results support the studies goal of providing robust, real-time solutions for control, robotic manipulators, structural health monitoring, and automation problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhao-Heng Yin, Changhao Wang, Luis Pineda, Krishna Bodduluri, Tingfan Wu, Pieter Abbeel, Mustafa Mukadam</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Geometric Retargeting (GeoRT), an ultrafast, and principled neural hand retargeting algorithm for teleoperation, developed as part of our recent Dexterity Gen (DexGen) system. GeoRT converts human finger keypoints to robot hand keypoints at 1KHz, achieving state-of-the-art speed and accuracy with significantly fewer hyperparameters. This high-speed capability enables flexible postprocessing, such as leveraging a foundational controller for action correction like DexGen. GeoRT is trained in an unsupervised manner, eliminating the need for manual annotation of hand pairs. The core of GeoRT lies in novel geometric objective functions that capture the essence of retargeting: preserving motion fidelity, ensuring configuration space (C-space) coverage, maintaining uniform response through high flatness, pinch correspondence and preventing self-collisions. This approach is free from intensive test-time optimization, offering a more scalable and practical solution for real-time hand retargeting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Li, Junfeng Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks, yet still produce errors in domain-specific tasks. To further improve their performance, we propose KSOD (Knowledge Supplement for LLMs On Demand), a novel framework that empowers LLMs to improve their capabilities with knowledge-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT). KSOD analyzes the causes of errors from the perspective of knowledge deficiency by identifying potential missing knowledge in LLM that may lead to the errors. Subsequently, KSOD tunes a knowledge module on knowledge dataset and verifies whether the LLM lacks the identified knowledge based on it. If the knowledge is verified, KSOD supplements the LLM with the identified knowledge using the knowledge module. Tuning LLMs on specific knowledge instead of specific task decouples task and knowledge and our experiments on two domain-specific benchmarks and four general benchmarks empirically demonstrate that KSOD enhances the performance of LLMs on tasks requiring the supplemented knowledge while preserving their performance on other tasks. Our findings shed light on the potential of improving the capabilities of LLMs with knowledge-based SFT.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07558">Incentive-Compatible Recovery from Manipulated Signals, with Applications to Decentralized Physical Infrastructure</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Milionis, Jens Ernstberger, Joseph Bonneau, Scott Duke Kominers, Tim Roughgarden</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the first formal model capturing the elicitation of unverifiable information from a party (the "source") with implicit signals derived by other players (the "observers"). Our model is motivated in part by applications in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (a.k.a. "DePIN"), an emerging application domain in which physical services (e.g., sensor information, bandwidth, or energy) are provided at least in part by untrusted and self-interested parties. A key challenge in these signal network applications is verifying the level of service that was actually provided by network participants.
  We first establish a condition called source identifiability, which we show is necessary for the existence of a mechanism for which truthful signal reporting is a strict equilibrium. For a converse, we build on techniques from peer prediction to show that in every signal network that satisfies the source identifiability condition, there is in fact a strictly truthful mechanism, where truthful signal reporting gives strictly higher total expected payoff than any less informative equilibrium. We furthermore show that this truthful equilibrium is in fact the unique equilibrium of the mechanism if there is positive probability that any one observer is unconditionally honest (e.g., if an observer were run by the network owner). Also, by extending our condition to coalitions, we show that there are generally no collusion-resistant mechanisms in the settings that we consider.
  We apply our framework and results to two DePIN applications: proving location, and proving bandwidth. In the location-proving setting observers learn (potentially enlarged) Euclidean distances to the source. Here, our condition has an appealing geometric interpretation, implying that the source's location can be truthfully elicited if and only if it is guaranteed to lie inside the convex hull of the observers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Canyi Chen, Nan Qiao, Liping Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of efficiently classifying high-dimensional data over decentralized networks. Penalized support vector machines (SVMs) are widely used for high-dimensional classification tasks. However, the double nonsmoothness of the objective function poses significant challenges in developing efficient decentralized learning methods. Many existing procedures suffer from slow, sublinear convergence rates. To overcome this limitation, we consider a convolution-based smoothing technique for the nonsmooth hinge loss function. The resulting loss function remains convex and smooth. We then develop an efficient generalized alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for solving penalized SVM over decentralized networks. Our theoretical contributions are twofold. First, we establish that our generalized ADMM algorithm achieves provable linear convergence with a simple implementation. Second, after a sufficient number of ADMM iterations, the final sparse estimator attains near-optimal statistical convergence and accurately recovers the true support of the underlying parameters. Extensive numerical experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets validate our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Habibur Rahaman, Atri Chatterjee, Swarup Bhunia</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid adoption of AI technologies raises several major security concerns, including the risks of adversarial perturbations, which threaten the confidentiality and integrity of AI applications. Protecting AI hardware from misuse and diverse security threats is a challenging task. To address this challenge, we propose SAMURAI, a novel framework for safeguarding against malicious usage of AI hardware and its resilience to attacks. SAMURAI introduces an AI Performance Counter (APC) for tracking dynamic behavior of an AI model coupled with an on-chip Machine Learning (ML) analysis engine, known as TANTO (Trained Anomaly Inspection Through Trace Observation). APC records the runtime profile of the low-level hardware events of different AI operations. Subsequently, the summary information recorded by the APC is processed by TANTO to efficiently identify potential security breaches and ensure secure, responsible use of AI. SAMURAI enables real-time detection of security threats and misuse without relying on traditional software-based solutions that require model integration. Experimental results demonstrate that SAMURAI achieves up to 97% accuracy in detecting adversarial attacks with moderate overhead on various AI models, significantly outperforming conventional software-based approaches. It enhances security and regulatory compliance, providing a comprehensive solution for safeguarding AI against emergent threats.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mukesh Sahani, Binanda Sengupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning, when integrated with a large amount of training data, has the potential to outperform machine learning in terms of high accuracy. Recently, privacy-preserving deep learning has drawn significant attention of the research community. Different privacy notions in deep learning include privacy of data provided by data-owners and privacy of parameters and/or hyperparameters of the underlying neural network. Federated learning is a popular privacy-preserving execution environment where data-owners participate in learning the parameters collectively without leaking their respective data to other participants. However, federated learning suffers from certain security/privacy issues. In this paper, we propose Split-n-Chain, a variant of split learning where the layers of the network are split among several distributed nodes. Split-n-Chain achieves several privacy properties: data-owners need not share their training data with other nodes, and no nodes have access to the parameters and hyperparameters of the neural network (except that of the respective layers they hold). Moreover, Split-n-Chain uses blockchain to audit the computation done by different nodes. Our experimental results show that: Split-n-Chain is efficient, in terms of time required to execute different phases, and the training loss trend is similar to that for the same neural network when implemented in a monolithic fashion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bardia Safaei, Faizan Siddiqui, Jiacong Xu, Vishal M. Patel, Shao-Yuan Lo</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual instruction tuning (VIT) for large vision-language models (LVLMs) requires training on expansive datasets of image-instruction pairs, which can be costly. Recent efforts in VIT data selection aim to select a small subset of high-quality image-instruction pairs, reducing VIT runtime while maintaining performance comparable to full-scale training. However, a major challenge often overlooked is that generating instructions from unlabeled images for VIT is highly expensive. Most existing VIT datasets rely heavily on human annotations or paid services like the GPT API, which limits users with constrained resources from creating VIT datasets for custom applications. To address this, we introduce Pre-Instruction Data Selection (PreSel), a more practical data selection paradigm that directly selects the most beneficial unlabeled images and generates instructions only for the selected images. PreSel first estimates the relative importance of each vision task within VIT datasets to derive task-wise sampling budgets. It then clusters image features within each task, selecting the most representative images with the budget. This approach reduces computational overhead for both instruction generation during VIT data formation and LVLM fine-tuning. By generating instructions for only 15% of the images, PreSel achieves performance comparable to full-data VIT on the LLaVA-1.5 and Vision-Flan datasets.

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel analysis for the Scaffold algorithm, a popular method for dealing with data heterogeneity in federated learning. While its convergence in deterministic settings--where local control variates mitigate client drift--is well established, the impact of stochastic gradient updates on its performance is less understood. To address this problem, we first show that its global parameters and control variates define a Markov chain that converges to a stationary distribution in the Wasserstein distance. Leveraging this result, we prove that Scaffold achieves linear speed-up in the number of clients up to higher-order terms in the step size. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals that Scaffold retains a higher-order bias, similar to FedAvg, that does not decrease as the number of clients increases. This highlights opportunities for developing improved stochastic federated learning algorithms</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Style Matching Score (SMS), a novel optimization method for image stylization with diffusion models. Balancing effective style transfer with content preservation is a long-standing challenge. Unlike existing efforts, our method reframes image stylization as a style distribution matching problem. The target style distribution is estimated from off-the-shelf style-dependent LoRAs via carefully designed score functions. To preserve content information adaptively, we propose Progressive Spectrum Regularization, which operates in the frequency domain to guide stylization progressively from low-frequency layouts to high-frequency details. In addition, we devise a Semantic-Aware Gradient Refinement technique that leverages relevance maps derived from diffusion semantic priors to selectively stylize semantically important regions. The proposed optimization formulation extends stylization from pixel space to parameter space, readily applicable to lightweight feedforward generators for efficient one-step stylization. SMS effectively balances style alignment and content preservation, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches, verified by extensive experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jifan Zhang, Lalit Jain, Kevin Jamieson</p>
<p>Abstract: This work proposes a procedure for designing algorithms for specific adaptive data collection tasks like active learning and pure-exploration multi-armed bandits. Unlike the design of traditional adaptive algorithms that rely on concentration of measure and careful analysis to justify the correctness and sample complexity of the procedure, our adaptive algorithm is learned via adversarial training over equivalence classes of problems derived from information theoretic lower bounds. In particular, a single adaptive learning algorithm is learned that competes with the best adaptive algorithm learned for each equivalence class. Our procedure takes as input just the available queries, set of hypotheses, loss function, and total query budget. This is in contrast to existing meta-learning work that learns an adaptive algorithm relative to an explicit, user-defined subset or prior distribution over problems which can be challenging to define and be mismatched to the instance encountered at test time. This work is particularly focused on the regime when the total query budget is very small, such as a few dozen, which is much smaller than those budgets typically considered by theoretically derived algorithms. We perform synthetic experiments to justify the stability and effectiveness of the training procedure, and then evaluate the method on tasks derived from real data including a noisy 20 Questions game and a joke recommendation task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Programmatic hyperparamter optimization (HPO) methods, such as Bayesian optimization and evolutionary algorithms, show high sampling efficiency in finding optimal hyperparameter configurations in development of machine learning (ML) models. Yet, practitioners often use less sample-efficient HPO methods, such as grid search, which often results in under-optimized ML models. As a reason for this behavior, we suspect practitioners choose HPO methods based on different motives. Practitioner motives, however, still need to be clarified to enhance user-centered development of HPO tools. To uncover practitioner motives to use different HPO methods, we conducted 20 semi-structured interviews and an online questionnaire with 49 ML experts. By presenting main goals (e.g., increase ML model understanding) and contextual factors affecting practitioners' selection of HPO methods (e.g., available computer resources), this study offers a conceptual foundation to better understand why practitioners use different HPO methods, supporting design of more user-centered and context-adaptive HPO tools in automated ML.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rapha\"el Berthier, Andrea Montanari, Kangjie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient-based learning in multi-layer neural networks displays a number of striking features. In particular, the decrease rate of empirical risk is non-monotone even after averaging over large batches. Long plateaus in which one observes barely any progress alternate with intervals of rapid decrease. These successive phases of learning often take place on very different time scales. Finally, models learnt in an early phase are typically `simpler' or `easier to learn' although in a way that is difficult to formalize.
  Although theoretical explanations of these phenomena have been put forward, each of them captures at best certain specific regimes. In this paper, we study the gradient flow dynamics of a wide two-layer neural network in high-dimension, when data are distributed according to a single-index model (i.e., the target function depends on a one-dimensional projection of the covariates). Based on a mixture of new rigorous results, non-rigorous mathematical derivations, and numerical simulations, we propose a scenario for the learning dynamics in this setting. In particular, the proposed evolution exhibits separation of timescales and intermittency. These behaviors arise naturally because the population gradient flow can be recast as a singularly perturbed dynamical system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiyuan Wang, Pan Li, Muhan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study using graph neural networks (GNNs) for \textit{multi-node representation learning}, where a representation for a set of more than one node (such as a link) is to be learned. Existing GNNs are mainly designed to learn single-node representations. When used for multi-node representation learning, a common practice is to directly aggregate the single-node representations obtained by a GNN. In this paper, we show a fundamental limitation of such an approach, namely the inability to capture the dependence among multiple nodes in the node set. A straightforward solution is to distinguish target nodes from others. Formalizing this idea, we propose \text{labeling trick}, which first labels nodes in the graph according to their relationships with the target node set before applying a GNN and then aggregates node representations obtained in the labeled graph for multi-node representations. Besides node sets in graphs, we also extend labeling tricks to posets, subsets and hypergraphs. Experiments verify that the labeling trick technique can boost GNNs on various tasks, including undirected link prediction, directed link prediction, hyperedge prediction, and subgraph prediction. Our work explains the superior performance of previous node-labeling-based methods and establishes a theoretical foundation for using GNNs for multi-node representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Lanthaler, Andrew M. Stuart</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural operator architectures employ neural networks to approximate operators mapping between Banach spaces of functions; they may be used to accelerate model evaluations via emulation, or to discover models from data. Consequently, the methodology has received increasing attention over recent years, giving rise to the rapidly growing field of operator learning. The first contribution of this paper is to prove that for general classes of operators which are characterized only by their $C^r$- or Lipschitz-regularity, operator learning suffers from a "curse of parametric complexity", which is an infinite-dimensional analogue of the well-known curse of dimensionality encountered in high-dimensional approximation problems. The result is applicable to a wide variety of existing neural operators, including PCA-Net, DeepONet and the FNO.The second contribution of the paper is to prove that this general curse can be overcome for solution operators defined by the Hamilton-Jacobi equation; this is achieved by leveraging additional structure in the underlying solution operator, going beyond regularity. To this end, a novel neural operator architecture is introduced, termed HJ-Net, which explicitly takes into account characteristic information of the underlying Hamiltonian system. Error and complexity estimates are derived for HJ-Net which show that this architecture can provably beat the curse of parametric complexity related to the infinite-dimensional input and output function spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hai-Long Sun, Da-Wei Zhou, De-Chuan Zhan, Han-Jia Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: While traditional machine learning can effectively tackle a wide range of problems, it primarily operates within a closed-world setting, which presents limitations when dealing with streaming data. As a solution, incremental learning emerges to address real-world scenarios involving new data's arrival. Recently, pre-training has made significant advancements and garnered the attention of numerous researchers. The strong performance of these pre-trained models (PTMs) presents a promising avenue for developing continual learning algorithms that can effectively adapt to real-world scenarios. Consequently, exploring the utilization of PTMs in incremental learning has become essential. This paper introduces a pre-trained model-based continual learning toolbox known as PILOT. On the one hand, PILOT implements some state-of-the-art class-incremental learning algorithms based on pre-trained models, such as L2P, DualPrompt, and CODA-Prompt. On the other hand, PILOT also fits typical class-incremental learning algorithms (e.g., DER, FOSTER, and MEMO) within the context of pre-trained models to evaluate their effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilei Wu, Zijian Dong, Chongyao Chen, Wangchunshu Zhou, Juan Helen Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In medical image analysis, regression plays a critical role in computer-aided diagnosis. It enables quantitative measurements such as age prediction from structural imaging, cardiac function quantification, and molecular measurement from PET scans. While deep learning has shown promise for these tasks, most approaches focus solely on optimizing regression loss or model architecture, neglecting the quality of learned feature representations which are crucial for robust clinical predictions. Directly applying representation learning techniques designed for classification to regression often results in fragmented representations in the latent space, yielding sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we argue that the potential of contrastive learning for medical image regression has been overshadowed due to the neglect of two crucial aspects: ordinality-awareness and hardness. To address these challenges, we propose Supervised Contrastive Learning for Medical Imaging Regression with Mixup (SupReMix). It takes anchor-inclusive mixtures (mixup of the anchor and a distinct negative sample) as hard negative pairs and anchor-exclusive mixtures (mixup of two distinct negative samples) as hard positive pairs at the embedding level. This strategy formulates harder contrastive pairs by integrating richer ordinal information. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on six datasets spanning MRI, X-ray, ultrasound, and PET modalities, we demonstrate that SupReMix fosters continuous ordered representations, significantly improving regression performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianchao Lu, Yuzhe Tian, Yang Zhang, Quan Z. Sheng, Xi Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain--computer interfaces are groundbreaking technology whereby brain signals are used to control external devices. Despite some advances in recent years, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based motor-imagery tasks face challenges, such as amplitude and phase variability and complex spatial correlations, with a need for smaller models and faster inference. In this study, we develop a prototype, called the Lightweight Geometric Learning Brain--Computer Interface (LGL-BCI), which uses our customized geometric deep learning architecture for swift model inference without sacrificing accuracy. LGL-BCI contains an EEG channel selection module via a feature decomposition algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of a symmetric positive definite matrix, providing adaptiveness among the continuously changing EEG signal. Meanwhile, a built-in lossless transformation helps boost the inference speed. The performance of our solution was evaluated using two real-world EEG devices and two public EEG datasets. LGL-BCI demonstrated significant improvements, achieving an accuracy of 82.54% compared to 62.22% for the state-of-the-art approach. Furthermore, LGL-BCI uses fewer parameters (64.9K vs. 183.7K), highlighting its computational efficiency. These findings underscore both the superior accuracy and computational efficiency of LGL-BCI, demonstrating the feasibility and robustness of geometric deep learning in motor-imagery brain--computer interface applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as critical components in a variety of artificial intelligence applications, and showcase significant success in natural language processing and several other domains. Meanwhile, the field of graph machine learning is witnessing a paradigm transition from shallow methods to more sophisticated deep learning approaches. The capabilities of foundation models in generalization and adaptation motivate graph machine learning researchers to discuss the potential of developing a new graph learning paradigm. This paradigm envisions models that are pre-trained on extensive graph data and can be adapted for various graph tasks. Despite this burgeoning interest, there is a noticeable lack of clear definitions and systematic analyses pertaining to this new domain. To this end, this article introduces the concept of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs), and offers an exhaustive explanation of their key characteristics and underlying technologies. We proceed to classify the existing work related to GFMs into three distinct categories, based on their dependence on graph neural networks and large language models. In addition to providing a thorough review of the current state of GFMs, this article also outlooks potential avenues for future research in this rapidly evolving domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haitz S\'aez de Oc\'ariz Borde, Anastasis Kratsios</p>
<p>Abstract: The inductive bias of a graph neural network (GNN) is largely encoded in its specified graph. Latent graph inference relies on latent geometric representations to dynamically rewire or infer a GNN's graph to maximize the GNN's predictive downstream performance, but it lacks solid theoretical foundations in terms of embedding-based representation guarantees. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a trainable deep learning architecture, coined neural snowflake, that can adaptively implement fractal-like metrics on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove that any given finite weights graph can be isometrically embedded by a standard MLP encoder. Furthermore, when the latent graph can be represented in the feature space of a sufficiently regular kernel, we show that the combined neural snowflake and MLP encoder do not succumb to the curse of dimensionality by using only a low-degree polynomial number of parameters in the number of nodes. This implementation enables a low-dimensional isometric embedding of the latent graph. We conduct synthetic experiments to demonstrate the superior metric learning capabilities of neural snowflakes when compared to more familiar spaces like Euclidean space. Additionally, we carry out latent graph inference experiments on graph benchmarks. Consistently, the neural snowflake model achieves predictive performance that either matches or surpasses that of the state-of-the-art latent graph inference models. Importantly, this performance improvement is achieved without requiring random search for optimal latent geometry. Instead, the neural snowflake model achieves this enhancement in a differentiable manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gergely D\'aniel N\'emeth, Miguel \'Angel Lozano, Novi Quadrianto, Nuria Oliver</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed as a privacy-preserving solution for distributed machine learning, particularly in heterogeneous FL settings where clients have varying computational capabilities and thus train models with different complexities compared to the server's model. However, FL is not without vulnerabilities: recent studies have shown that it is susceptible to membership inference attacks (MIA), which can compromise the privacy of client data. In this paper, we examine the intersection of these two aspects, heterogeneous FL and its privacy vulnerabilities, by focusing on the role of client model integration, the process through which the server integrates parameters from clients' smaller models into its larger model. To better understand this process, we first propose a taxonomy that categorizes existing heterogeneous FL methods and enables the design of seven novel heterogeneous FL model integration strategies. Using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and FEMNIST vision datasets, we evaluate the privacy and accuracy trade-offs of these approaches under three types of MIAs. Our findings reveal significant differences in privacy leakage and performance depending on the integration method. Notably, introducing randomness in the model integration process enhances client privacy while maintaining competitive accuracy for both the clients and the server. This work provides quantitative light on the privacy-accuracy implications client model integration in heterogeneous FL settings, paving the way towards more secure and efficient FL systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Code optimization is a challenging task requiring a substantial level of expertise from developers. Nonetheless, this level of human capacity is not sufficient considering the rapid evolution of new hardware architectures and software environments. In light of this, recent research proposes adopting machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to automate the code optimization process. In this paper, we introduce PerfRL, an innovative framework designed to tackle the problem of code optimization. Our framework leverages the capabilities of small language models (SLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL), facilitating a system where SLMs can assimilate feedback from their environment during the fine-tuning phase, notably through unit tests. When benchmarked against existing models, PerfRL demonstrates superior efficiency in terms of speed and computational resource usage, attributed to its reduced need for training steps and its compatibility with SLMs. Furthermore, it substantially diminishes the risk of logical and syntactical errors. To evaluate our framework, we conduct experiments on the PIE dataset using a lightweight large language model (i.e., CodeT5) and a new reinforcement learning algorithm, namely RRHF. For evaluation purposes, we use a list of evaluation metrics related to optimization quality and speedup. The evaluation results show that our approach achieves similar or better results compared to state-of-the-art models using shorter training times and smaller pre-trained models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Corneliu Arsene, Alessandra Parisio</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting power consumptions of integrated electrical, heat or gas network systems is essential in order to operate more efficiently the whole energy network. Multi-energy systems are increasingly seen as a key component of future energy systems, and a valuable source of flexibility, which can significantly contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable whole energy system. Therefore, there is a stringent need for developing novel and performant models for forecasting multi-energy demand of integrated energy systems, which to account for the different types of interacting energy vectors and of the coupling between them. Previous efforts in demand forecasting focused mainly on the single electrical power consumption or, more recently, on the single heat or gas power consumptions. In order to address this gap, in this paper six novel prediction models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are developed, for either individual or joint prediction of multi-energy power consumptions: the single input/single output CNN model with determining the optimum number of epochs (CNN_1), the multiple input/single output CNN model (CNN_2), the single input/ single output CNN model with training/validation/testing datasets (CNN_3), the joint prediction CNN model (CNN_4), the multiple-building input/output CNN model (CNN_5) and the federated learning CNN model (CNN_6). All six novel CNN models are applied in a comprehensive manner on a novel integrated electrical, heat and gas network system, which only recently has started to be used for forecasting. The forecast horizon is short-term (next half an hour) and all the predictions results are evaluated in terms of the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), while the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is used for comparison purposes with other existent results from literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuele Sansone, Robin Manhaeve</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning excels at learning representations from large amounts of data. At the same time, generative models offer the complementary property of learning information about the underlying data generation process. In this study, we aim at establishing a principled connection between these two paradigms and highlight the benefits of their complementarity. In particular, we perform an analysis of self-supervised learning objectives, elucidating the underlying probabilistic graphical models and presenting a standardized methodology for their derivation from first principles. The analysis suggests a natural means of integrating self-supervised learning with likelihood-based generative models. We instantiate this concept within the realm of cluster-based self-supervised learning and energy models, introducing a lower bound proven to reliably penalize the most important failure modes. Our theoretical findings are substantiated through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including SVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, demonstrating that our objective function allows to jointly train a backbone network in a discriminative and generative fashion, consequently outperforming existing self-supervised learning strategies in terms of clustering, generation and out-of-distribution detection performance by a wide margin. We also demonstrate that the solution can be integrated into a neuro-symbolic framework to tackle a simple yet non-trivial instantiation of the symbol grounding problem.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predicting failures and maintenance time in predictive maintenance is challenging due to the scarcity of comprehensive real-world datasets, and among those available, few are of time series format. This paper introduces a real-world, multivariate time series dataset collected exclusively from a single anonymized engine component (Component X) across a fleet of SCANIA trucks. The dataset includes operational data, repair records, and specifications related to Component X, while maintaining confidentiality through anonymization. It is well-suited for a range of machine learning applications, including classification, regression, survival analysis, and anomaly detection, particularly in predictive maintenance scenarios. The dataset's large population size, diverse features (in the form of histograms and numerical counters), and temporal information make it a unique resource in the field. The objective of releasing this dataset is to give a broad range of researchers the possibility of working with real-world data from an internationally well-known company and introduce a standard benchmark to the predictive maintenance field, fostering reproducible research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seongmin Lee, Marcel B\"ohme</p>
<p>Abstract: The missing mass refers to the proportion of data points in an unknown population of classifier inputs that belong to classes not present in the classifier's training data, which is assumed to be a random sample from that unknown population. We find that in expectation the missing mass is entirely determined by the number $f_k$ of classes that do appear in the training data the same number of times and an exponentially decaying error. While this is the first precise characterization of the expected missing mass in terms of the sample, the induced estimator suffers from an impractically high variance. However, our theory suggests a large search space of nearly unbiased estimators that can be searched effectively and efficiently. Hence, we cast distribution-free estimation as an optimization problem to find a distribution-specific estimator with a minimized mean-squared error (MSE), given only the sample. In our experiments, our search algorithm discovers estimators that have a substantially smaller MSE than the state-of-the-art Good-Turing estimator. This holds for over 93% of runs when there are at least as many samples as classes. Our estimators' MSE is roughly 80% of the Good-Turing estimator's.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning good representations of historical contexts is one of the core challenges of reinforcement learning (RL) in partially observable environments. While self-predictive auxiliary tasks have been shown to improve performance in fully observed settings, their role in partial observability remains underexplored. In this empirical study, we examine the effectiveness of self-predictive representation learning via future prediction, i.e., predicting next-step observations as an auxiliary task for learning history representations, especially in environments with long-term dependencies. We test the hypothesis that future prediction alone can produce representations that enable strong RL performance. To evaluate this, we introduce $\texttt{DRL}^2$, an approach that explicitly decouples representation learning from reinforcement learning, and compare this approach to end-to-end training across multiple benchmarks requiring long-term memory. Our findings provide evidence that this hypothesis holds across different network architectures, reinforcing the idea that future prediction performance serves as a reliable indicator of representation quality and contributes to improved RL performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the evolving landscape of machine learning, a pivotal challenge lies in deciphering the internal representations harnessed by neural networks and Transformers. Building on recent progress toward comprehending how networks execute distinct target functions, our study embarks on an exploration of the underlying reasons behind networks adopting specific computational strategies. We direct our focus to the complex algebraic learning task of modular addition involving $k$ inputs. Our research presents a thorough analytical characterization of the features learned by stylized one-hidden layer neural networks and one-layer Transformers in addressing this task. A cornerstone of our theoretical framework is the elucidation of how the principle of margin maximization shapes the features adopted by one-hidden layer neural networks. Let $p$ denote the modulus, $D_p$ denote the dataset of modular arithmetic with $k$ inputs and $m$ denote the network width. We demonstrate that a neuron count of $ m \geq 2^{2k-2} \cdot (p-1) $, these networks attain a maximum $ L_{2,k+1} $-margin on the dataset $ D_p $. Furthermore, we establish that each hidden-layer neuron aligns with a specific Fourier spectrum, integral to solving modular addition problems. By correlating our findings with the empirical observations of similar studies, we contribute to a deeper comprehension of the intrinsic computational mechanisms of neural networks. Furthermore, we observe similar computational mechanisms in attention matrices of one-layer Transformers. Our work stands as a significant stride in unraveling their operation complexities, particularly in the realm of complex algebraic tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Li, Ruichu Cai, Zhenhui Yang, Haiqin Huang, Guangyi Chen, Yifan Shen, Zhengming Chen, Xiangchen Song, Kun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: As environments evolve, temporal distribution shifts can degrade time series forecasting performance. A straightforward solution is to adapt to nonstationary changes while preserving stationary dependencies. Hence, some methods disentangle stationary and nonstationary components by assuming uniform distribution shifts, but it is impractical since when the distribution changes is unknown. To address this challenge, we propose the \textbf{U}nknown \textbf{D}istribution \textbf{A}daptation (\textbf{UDA}) model for nonstationary time series forecasting, which detects when distribution shifts occur and disentangles stationary/nonstationary latent variables, thus enabling adaptation to unknown distribution without assuming a uniform distribution shift. Specifically, under a Hidden Markov assumption of latent environments, we demonstrate that the latent environments are identifiable. Sequentially, we further disentangle stationary/nonstationary latent variables by leveraging the variability of historical information. Based on these theoretical results, we propose a variational autoencoder-based model, which incorporates an autoregressive hidden Markov model to estimate latent environments. Additionally, we further devise the modular prior networks to disentangle stationary/nonstationary latent variables. These two modules realize automatic adaptation and enhance nonstationary forecasting performance. Experimental results on several datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Structure Learning (GSL) focuses on capturing intrinsic dependencies and interactions among nodes in graph-structured data by generating novel graph structures. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising GSL solutions, utilizing recursive message passing to encode node-wise inter-dependencies. However, many existing GSL methods heavily depend on explicit graph structural information as supervision signals, leaving them susceptible to challenges such as data noise and sparsity. In this work, we propose GraphEdit, an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to learn complex node relationships in graph-structured data. By enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through instruction-tuning over graph structures, we aim to overcome the limitations associated with explicit graph structural information and enhance the reliability of graph structure learning. Our approach not only effectively denoises noisy connections but also identifies node-wise dependencies from a global perspective, providing a comprehensive understanding of the graph structure. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of GraphEdit across various settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Xu, Yihong Gu, Cong Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Models are expected to engage in invariance learning, which involves distinguishing the core relations that remain consistent across varying environments to ensure the predictions are safe, robust and fair. While existing works consider specific algorithms to realize invariance learning, we show that model has the potential to learn invariance through standard training procedures. In other words, this paper studies the implicit bias of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) over heterogeneous data and shows that the implicit bias drives the model learning towards an invariant solution. We call the phenomenon the implicit invariance learning. Specifically, we theoretically investigate the multi-environment low-rank matrix sensing problem where in each environment, the signal comprises (i) a lower-rank invariant part shared across all environments; and (ii) a significantly varying environment-dependent spurious component. The key insight is, through simply employing the large step size large-batch SGD sequentially in each environment without any explicit regularization, the oscillation caused by heterogeneity can provably prevent model learning spurious signals. The model reaches the invariant solution after certain iterations. In contrast, model learned using pooled SGD over all data would simultaneously learn both the invariant and spurious signals. Overall, we unveil another implicit bias that is a result of the symbiosis between the heterogeneity of data and modern algorithms, which is, to the best of our knowledge, first in the literature.</p>

Therefore, identifying, quantifying, and utilizing uncertainty are essential to enhance the performance of the model for the downstream tasks as well as the reliability of the GNN predictions. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the GNNs from the perspective of uncertainty with an emphasis on its integration in graph learning. We compare and summarize existing graph uncertainty theory and methods, alongside the corresponding downstream tasks. Thereby, we bridge the gap between theory and practice, meanwhile connecting different GNN communities. Moreover, our work provides valuable insights into promising directions in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kristian Schwethelm, Johannes Kaiser, Moritz Knolle, Sarah Lockfisch, Daniel Rueckert, Alexander Ziller</p>
<p>Abstract: Data reconstruction attacks on machine learning models pose a substantial threat to privacy, potentially leaking sensitive information. Although defending against such attacks using differential privacy (DP) provides theoretical guarantees, determining appropriate DP parameters remains challenging. Current formal guarantees on the success of data reconstruction suffer from overly stringent assumptions regarding adversary knowledge about the target data, particularly in the image domain, raising questions about their real-world applicability. In this work, we empirically investigate this discrepancy by introducing a reconstruction attack based on diffusion models (DMs) that only assumes adversary access to real-world image priors and specifically targets the DP defense. We find that (1) real-world data priors significantly influence reconstruction success, (2) current reconstruction bounds do not model the risk posed by data priors well, and (3) DMs can serve as heuristic auditing tools for visualizing privacy leakage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danrui Qi, Zhengjie Miao, Jiannan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data standardization is a crucial part of the data science life cycle. While tools like Pandas offer robust functionalities, their complexity and the manual effort required for customizing code to diverse column types pose significant challenges. Although large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown promise in automating this process through natural language understanding and code generation, it still demands expert-level programming knowledge and continuous interaction for prompt refinement. To solve these challenges, our key idea is to propose a Python library with declarative, unified APIs for standardizing different column types, simplifying the LLM's code generation with concise API calls. We first propose Dataprep.Clean, a component of the Dataprep Python Library, significantly reduces the coding complexity by enabling the standardization of specific column types with a single line of code. Then, we introduce the CleanAgent framework integrating Dataprep.Clean and LLM-based agents to automate the data standardization process. With CleanAgent, data scientists only need to provide their requirements once, allowing for a hands-free process. To demonstrate the practical utility of CleanAgent, we developed a user-friendly web application, allowing attendees to interact with it using real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yann Dubois, Bal\'azs Galambosi, Percy Liang, Tatsunori B. Hashimoto</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-based auto-annotators have become a key component of the LLM development process due to their cost-effectiveness and scalability compared to human-based evaluation. However, these auto-annotators can introduce biases that are hard to remove. Even simple, known confounders such as preference for longer outputs remain in existing automated evaluation metrics. We propose a simple regression analysis approach for controlling biases in auto-evaluations. As a real case study, we focus on reducing the length bias of AlpacaEval, a fast and affordable benchmark for instruction-tuned LLMs that uses LLMs to estimate response quality. Despite being highly correlated with human preferences, AlpacaEval is known to favor models that generate longer outputs. We introduce a length-controlled AlpacaEval that aims to answer the counterfactual question: "What would the preference be if the model's and baseline's output had the same length?" To achieve this, we first fit a generalized linear model to predict the biased auto-annotator's preferences based on the mediators we want to control for (length difference) and other relevant features. We then obtain length-controlled preferences by predicting preferences while conditioning the GLM with a zero difference in lengths. Length-controlling not only improves the robustness of the metric to manipulations in model verbosity, but we also find that it increases the Spearman correlation with LMSYS Chatbot Arena from 0.94 to 0.98.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuan Chen, Tianchi Liao, Xiaojun Deng, Zihou Wu, Sheng Huang, Zibin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of heterogeneous federated learning (FL), the key challenge is to efficiently and collaboratively train models across multiple clients with different data distributions, model structures, task objectives, computational capabilities, and communication resources. This diversity leads to significant heterogeneity, which increases the complexity of model training. In this paper, we first outline the basic concepts of heterogeneous federated learning and summarize the research challenges in federated learning in terms of five aspects: data, model, task, device, and communication. In addition, we explore how existing state-of-the-art approaches cope with the heterogeneity of federated learning, and categorize and review these approaches at three different levels: data-level, model-level, and architecture-level. Subsequently, the paper extensively discusses privacy-preserving strategies in heterogeneous federated learning environments. Finally, the paper discusses current open issues and directions for future research, aiming to promote the further development of heterogeneous federated learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jad Mounayer, Chady Ghnatios, Sebastian Rodriguez, Mohammed El Fallaki Idrissi, Charbel Farhat, Francisco Chinesta</p>
<p>Abstract: The choice of an appropriate bottleneck dimension and the application of effective regularization are both essential for Autoencoders to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data. In this paper, we introduce a new class of deterministic autoencoders, Rank Reduction Autoencoders (RRAEs), which regularize their latent spaces by employing a truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) during training. In RRAEs, the bottleneck is defined by the rank of the latent matrix, thereby alleviating the dependence of the encoder/decoder architecture on the bottleneck size. This approach enabled us to propose an adaptive algorithm (aRRAEs) that efficiently determines the optimal bottleneck size during training. We empirically demonstrate that both RRAEs and aRRAEs are stable, scalable, and reliable, as they do not introduce any additional training hyperparameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on a synthetic dataset, as well as on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CelebA. Our results show that RRAEs offer several advantages over Vanilla AEs with both large and small latent spaces, and outperform other regularizing AE architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxin Guo, Zhenglin Cheng, Xiaoying Tang, Zhaopeng Tu, Tao Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has been widely employed to enhance the efficiency of training and inference for Transformer-based foundational models, yielding promising results.However, the performance of SMoE heavily depends on the choice of hyper-parameters, such as the number of experts and the number of experts to be activated (referred to as top-k), resulting in significant computational overhead due to the extensive model training by searching over various hyper-parameter configurations. As a remedy, we introduce the Dynamic Mixture of Experts (DynMoE) technique. DynMoE incorporates (1) a novel gating method that enables each token to automatically determine the number of experts to activate. (2) An adaptive process automatically adjusts the number of experts during training. Extensive numerical results across Vision, Language, and Vision-Language tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to achieve competitive performance compared to GMoE for vision and language tasks, and MoE-LLaVA for vision-language tasks, while maintaining efficiency by activating fewer parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Kuang, Zhibo Wang, Zhixuan Chu, Jingyi Wang, Kui Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Spurious correlations in training data significantly hinder the generalization capability of machine learning models when faced with distribution shifts in real-world scenarios.To tackle the problem, numerous debiasing approaches have been proposed and benchmarked on datasets intentionally designed with severe biases.However, it remains to be asked: \textit{1. Do existing benchmarks really capture biases in the real world? 2. Can existing debiasing methods handle biases in the real world?} To answer the questions, we revisit biased distributions in existing benchmarks and real-world datasets, and propose a fine-grained framework for analyzing dataset bias by disentangling it into the magnitude and prevalence of bias. We empirically and theoretically identify key characteristics of real-world biases poorly represented by existing benchmarks. We further introduce two novel biased distributions to bridge this gap, forming a systematic evaluation framework for real-world debiasing.With the evaluation framework, we focus on the practical setting of debiasing w/o bias supervision and find existing methods incapable of handling real-world biases.Through in-depth analysis, we propose a simple yet effective approach that can be easily applied to existing debiasing methods, named Debias in Destruction (DiD).Empirical results on real-world datasets in both image and language modalities demonstrate the superiority of DiD, improving the performance of existing methods on all types of biases.</p>

<p>Abstract: We formulate sequential maximum a posteriori inference as a recursion of loss functions and reduce the problem of continual learning to approximating the previous loss function. We then propose two coreset-free methods: autodiff quadratic consolidation, which uses an accurate and full quadratic approximation, and neural consolidation, which uses a neural network approximation. These methods are not scalable with respect to the neural network size, and we study them for classification tasks in combination with a fixed pre-trained feature extractor. We also introduce simple but challenging classical task sequences based on Iris and Wine datasets. We find that neural consolidation performs well in the classical task sequences, where the input dimension is small, while autodiff quadratic consolidation performs consistently well in image task sequences with a fixed pre-trained feature extractor, achieving comparable performance to joint maximum a posteriori training in many cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nils Philipp Walter, Linara Adilova, Jilles Vreeken, Michael Kamp</p>
<p>Abstract: Flatness of the loss surface not only correlates positively with generalization, but is also related to adversarial robustness since perturbations of inputs relate non-linearly to perturbations of weights. In this paper, we empirically analyze the relation between adversarial examples and relative flatness with respect to the parameters of one layer. We observe a peculiar property of adversarial examples in the context of relative flatness: during an iterative first-order white-box attack, the flatness of the loss surface measured around the adversarial example first becomes sharper until the label is flipped, but if we keep the attack running, it runs into a flat uncanny valley where the label remains flipped. In extensive experiments, we observe this phenomenon across various model architectures and datasets, even for adversarially trained models. Our results also extend to large language models (LLMs), but due to the discrete nature of the input space and comparatively weak attacks, adversarial examples rarely reach truly flat regions. Most importantly, this phenomenon shows that flatness alone cannot explain adversarial robustness unless we can also guarantee the behavior of the function around the examples. We, therefore theoretically connect relative flatness to adversarial robustness by bounding the third derivative of the loss surface, underlining the need for flatness in combination with a low global Lipschitz constant for a robust model.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17111">Diffusion Bridge AutoEncoders for Unsupervised Representation Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeongmin Kim, Kwanghyeon Lee, Minsang Park, Byeonghu Na, Il-Chul Moon</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based representation learning has achieved substantial attention due to its promising capabilities in latent representation and sample generation. Recent studies have employed an auxiliary encoder to identify a corresponding representation from a sample and to adjust the dimensionality of a latent variable z. Meanwhile, this auxiliary structure invokes information split problem because the diffusion and the auxiliary encoder would divide the information from the sample into two representations for each model. Particularly, the information modeled by the diffusion becomes over-regularized because of the static prior distribution on xT. To address this problem, we introduce Diffusion Bridge AuteEncoders (DBAE), which enable z-dependent endpoint xT inference through a feed-forward architecture. This structure creates an information bottleneck at z, so xT becomes dependent on z in its generation. This results in two consequences: 1) z holds the full information of samples, and 2) xT becomes a learnable distribution, not static any further. We propose an objective function for DBAE to enable both reconstruction and generative modeling, with their theoretical justification. Empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of the intended design in DBAE, which notably enhances downstream inference quality, reconstruction, and disentanglement. Additionally, DBAE generates high-fidelity samples in the unconditional generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/DBAE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bart M. N. Smets, Peter D. Donker, Jim W. Portegies</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a class of trainable nonlinear operators based on semirings that are suitable for use in neural networks. These operators generalize the traditional alternation of linear operators with activation functions in neural networks. Semirings are algebraic structures that describe a generalised notation of linearity, greatly expanding the range of trainable operators that can be included in neural networks. In fact, max- or min-pooling operations are convolutions in the tropical semiring with a fixed kernel.
  We perform experiments where we replace the activation functions for trainable semiring-based operators to show that these are viable operations to include in fully connected as well as convolutional neural networks (ConvNeXt). We discuss some of the challenges of replacing traditional activation functions with trainable semiring activations and the trade-offs of doing so.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Zhang, Peiyao Xiao, Shaofeng Zou, Kaiyi Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-objective optimization (MOO) is receiving more attention in various fields such as multi-task learning. Recent works provide some effective algorithms with theoretical analysis but they are limited by the standard $L$-smooth or bounded-gradient assumptions, which typically do not hold for neural networks, such as Long short-term memory (LSTM) models and Transformers. In this paper, we study a more general and realistic class of generalized $\ell$-smooth loss functions, where $\ell$ is a general non-decreasing function of gradient norm. We revisit and analyze the fundamental multiple gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) and its stochastic version with double sampling for solving the generalized $\ell$-smooth MOO problems, which approximate the conflict-avoidant (CA) direction that maximizes the minimum improvement among objectives. We provide a comprehensive convergence analysis of these algorithms and show that they converge to an $\epsilon$-accurate Pareto stationary point with a guaranteed $\epsilon$-level average CA distance (i.e., the gap between the updating direction and the CA direction) over all iterations, where totally $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ samples are needed for deterministic and stochastic settings, respectively. We prove that they can also guarantee a tighter $\epsilon$-level CA distance in each iteration using more samples. Moreover, we analyze an efficient variant of MGDA named MGDA-FA using only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and space, while achieving the same performance guarantee as MGDA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiliang Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we study the multitasking principal-agent problem. The agent performs several task for the principal, and the principal posts a contract incentivizing the agent to exert effort. The principal can observe a signal for each task, and the contract is a mapping from the space of possible signals to a payment. We study the special class of linear contracts from three perspectives: robustness, uniformity, and learning. Firstly, we show a robustness result: in an ambiguous setting when only first moment information is known, there is a linear contract maximizing the principal's payoff in a worst-case scenario. Secondly, we show a uniformity result: when the agent's cost function is homogeneous to a certain degree and the the principal's utility takes a linear form across tasks, then the optimal contract depends on the agent's cost function only through its homogeneuity degree. Thirdly, we study the problem of learning an optimal linear contract through observational data. We identify this as an measurement error model, and propose instrumental regression methods to estimate the optimal contract parameters in an offline setting, or to learn the optimal contract in an online setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jueqing Lu, Wray Buntine, Yuanyuan Qi, Joanna Dipnall, Belinda Gabbe, Lan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Resolving conflicts is essential to make the decisions of multi-view classification more reliable. Much research has been conducted on learning consistent informative representations among different views, assuming that all views are identically important and strictly aligned. However, real-world multi-view data may not always conform to these assumptions, as some views may express distinct information. To address this issue, we develop a computational trust-based discounting method to enhance the existing trustworthy framework in scenarios where conflicts between different views may arise. Its belief fusion process considers the trustworthiness of predictions made by individual views via an instance-wise probability-sensitive trust discounting mechanism. We evaluate our method on six real-world datasets, using Top-1 Accuracy, AUC-ROC for Uncertainty-Aware Prediction, Fleiss' Kappa, and a new metric called Multi-View Agreement with Ground Truth that takes into consideration the ground truth labels. The experimental results show that computational trust can effectively resolve conflicts, paving the way for more reliable multi-view classification models in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Yang, Xiaojie Li, Zhongzhu Zhou, Shuaiwen Leon Song, Jianlong Wu, Liqiang Nie, Bernard Ghanem</p>
<p>Abstract: Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods build adapters widely agnostic of the context of downstream task to learn, or the context of important knowledge to maintain. As a result, there is often a performance gap compared to full-parameter fine-tuning, and meanwhile the fine-tuned model suffers from catastrophic forgetting of the pre-trained world knowledge. In this paper, we propose CorDA, a Context-oriented Decomposition Adaptation method that builds learnable task-aware adapters from weight decomposition oriented by the context of downstream task or the world knowledge to maintain. Concretely, we collect a few data samples, and perform singular value decomposition for each linear layer of a pre-trained LLM multiplied by the covariance matrix of the input activation using these samples. The inverse of the covariance matrix is multiplied with the decomposed components to reconstruct the original weights. By doing so, the context of the representative samples is captured through deciding the factorizing orientation. Our method enables two options, the knowledge-preserved adaptation and the instruction-previewed adaptation. For the former, we use question-answering samples to obtain the covariance matrices, and use the decomposed components with the smallest $r$ singular values to initialize a learnable adapter, with the others frozen such that the world knowledge is better preserved. For the latter, we use the instruction data from the fine-tuning task, such as math or coding, to orientate the decomposition and train the largest $r$ components that most correspond to the task to learn. We conduct extensive experiments on Math, Code, and Instruction Following tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In contrast with Mercer kernel-based approaches as used e.g., in Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA), it was previously shown that Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) inherently relates to asymmetric kernels and Asymmetric Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD) has been proposed. However, the existing formulation to KSVD cannot work with infinite-dimensional feature mappings, the variational objective can be unbounded, and needs further numerical evaluation and exploration towards machine learning. In this work, i) we introduce a new asymmetric learning paradigm based on coupled covariance eigenproblem (CCE) through covariance operators, allowing infinite-dimensional feature maps. The solution to CCE is ultimately obtained from the SVD of the induced asymmetric kernel matrix, providing links to KSVD. ii) Starting from the integral equations corresponding to a pair of coupled adjoint eigenfunctions, we formalize the asymmetric Nystr\"om method through a finite sample approximation to speed up training. iii) We provide the first empirical evaluations verifying the practical utility and benefits of KSVD and compare with methods resorting to symmetrization or linear SVD across multiple tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) agents has raised new concerns regarding their safety and security, which cannot be addressed by traditional textual-harm-focused LLM guardrails. We propose GuardAgent, the first guardrail agent to protect the target agents by dynamically checking whether their actions satisfy given safety guard requests. Specifically, GuardAgent first analyzes the safety guard requests to generate a task plan, and then maps this plan into guardrail code for execution. By performing the code execution, GuardAgent can deterministically follow the safety guard request and safeguard target agents. In both steps, an LLM is utilized as the reasoning component, supplemented by in-context demonstrations retrieved from a memory module storing experiences from previous tasks. GuardAgent can understand different safety guard requests and provide reliable code-based guardrails with high flexibility and low operational overhead. In addition, we propose two novel benchmarks: EICU-AC benchmark to assess the access control for healthcare agents and Mind2Web-SC benchmark to evaluate the safety policies for web agents. We show that GuardAgent effectively moderates the violation actions for different types of agents on these two benchmarks with over 98% and 83% guardrail accuracies, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Li, Rongchang Zuo, Bofei Liu, Peng Liu, Yingnan Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) dogfight, which refers to a fight between two or more UCAVs usually at close quarters, plays a decisive role on the aerial battlefields. With the evolution of artificial intelligence, dogfight progressively transits towards intelligent and autonomous modes. However, the development of autonomous dogfight policy learning is hindered by challenges such as weak exploration capabilities, low learning efficiency, and unrealistic simulated environments. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel imitative reinforcement learning framework, which efficiently leverages expert data while enabling autonomous exploration. The proposed framework not only enhances learning efficiency through expert imitation, but also ensures adaptability to dynamic environments via autonomous exploration with reinforcement learning. Therefore, the proposed framework can learn a successful dogfight policy of 'pursuit-lock-launch' for UCAVs. To support data-driven learning, we establish a dogfight environment based on the Harfang3D sandbox, where we conduct extensive experiments. The results indicate that the proposed framework excels in multistage dogfight, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and imitation learning methods. Thanks to the ability of imitating experts and autonomous exploration, our framework can quickly learn the critical knowledge in complex aerial combat tasks, achieving up to a 100% success rate and demonstrating excellent robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivek Myers, Chongyi Zheng, Anca Dragan, Sergey Levine, Benjamin Eysenbach</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal distances lie at the heart of many algorithms for planning, control, and reinforcement learning that involve reaching goals, allowing one to estimate the transit time between two states. However, prior attempts to define such temporal distances in stochastic settings have been stymied by an important limitation: these prior approaches do not satisfy the triangle inequality. This is not merely a definitional concern, but translates to an inability to generalize and find shortest paths. In this paper, we build on prior work in contrastive learning and quasimetrics to show how successor features learned by contrastive learning (after a change of variables) form a temporal distance that does satisfy the triangle inequality, even in stochastic settings. Importantly, this temporal distance is computationally efficient to estimate, even in high-dimensional and stochastic settings. Experiments in controlled settings and benchmark suites demonstrate that an RL algorithm based on these new temporal distances exhibits combinatorial generalization (i.e., "stitching") and can sometimes learn more quickly than prior methods, including those based on quasimetrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zhe, Jun Sakuma</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of publicly available datasets for training machine learning models raises significant concerns about data misuse. Availability attacks have emerged as a means for data owners to safeguard their data by designing imperceptible perturbations that degrade model performance when incorporated into training datasets. However, existing availability attacks are ineffective when only a portion of the data can be perturbed. To address this challenge, we propose a novel availability attack approach termed Parameter Matching Attack (PMA). PMA is the first availability attack capable of causing more than a 30\% performance drop when only a portion of data can be perturbed. PMA optimizes perturbations so that when the model is trained on a mixture of clean and perturbed data, the resulting model will approach a model designed to perform poorly. Experimental results across four datasets demonstrate that PMA outperforms existing methods, achieving significant model performance degradation when a part of the training data is perturbed. Our code is available in the supplementary materials.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Tessari, Kunpeng Yao, Neville Hogan</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in computational power and hardware efficiency have enabled tackling increasingly complex, high-dimensional problems. While artificial intelligence (AI) achieves remarkable results, the interpretability of high-dimensional solutions remains challenging. A critical issue is the comparison of multidimensional quantities, essential in techniques like Principal Component Analysis. Metrics such as cosine similarity are often used, for example in the development of natural language processing algorithms or recommender systems. However, the interpretability of such metrics diminishes as dimensions increase. This paper analyzes the effects of dimensionality, revealing significant limitations of cosine similarity, particularly its dependency on the dimension of vectors, leading to biased and poorly interpretable outcomes. To address this, we introduce a Dimension Insensitive Euclidean Metric (DIEM) which demonstrates superior robustness and generalizability across dimensions. DIEM maintains consistent variability and eliminates the biases observed in traditional metrics, making it a reliable tool for high-dimensional comparisons. An example of the advantages of DIEM over cosine similarity is reported for a large language model application. This novel metric has the potential to replace cosine similarity, providing a more accurate and insightful method to analyze multidimensional data in fields ranging from neuromotor control to machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeqing Wang, Fei Cheng, Kangye Ji, Bohu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is a technique that enables neural networks to constantly adapt to their dynamic surroundings. Despite being overlooked for a long time, this technology can considerably address the customized needs of users in edge devices. Actually, most CL methods require huge resource consumption by the training behavior to acquire generalizability among all tasks for delaying forgetting regardless of edge scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a compact algorithm called LightCL, which evaluates and compresses the redundancy of already generalized components in structures of the neural network. Specifically, we consider two factors of generalizability, learning plasticity and memory stability, and design metrics of both to quantitatively assess generalizability of neural networks during CL. This evaluation shows that generalizability of different layers in a neural network exhibits a significant variation. Thus, we $\textit{Maintain Generalizability}$ by freezing generalized parts without the resource-intensive training process and $\textit{Memorize Feature Patterns}$ by stabilizing feature extracting of previous tasks to enhance generalizability for less-generalized parts with a little extra memory, which is far less than the reduction by freezing. Experiments illustrate that LightCL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and reduces at most $\textbf{6.16$\times$}$ memory footprint. We also verify the effectiveness of LightCL on the edge device.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael-Andrei Panaitescu-Liess, Zora Che, Bang An, Yuancheng Xu, Pankayaraj Pathmanathan, Souradip Chakraborty, Sicheng Zhu, Tom Goldstein, Furong Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating diverse and contextually rich text. However, concerns regarding copyright infringement arise as LLMs may inadvertently produce copyrighted material. In this paper, we first investigate the effectiveness of watermarking LLMs as a deterrent against the generation of copyrighted texts. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that incorporating watermarks into LLMs significantly reduces the likelihood of generating copyrighted content, thereby addressing a critical concern in the deployment of LLMs. However, we also find that watermarking can have unintended consequences on Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to discern whether a sample was part of the pretraining dataset and may be used to detect copyright violations. Surprisingly, we find that watermarking adversely affects the success rate of MIAs, complicating the task of detecting copyrighted text in the pretraining dataset. These results reveal the complex interplay between different regulatory measures, which may impact each other in unforeseen ways. Finally, we propose an adaptive technique to improve the success rate of a recent MIA under watermarking. Our findings underscore the importance of developing adaptive methods to study critical problems in LLMs with potential legal implications.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18807">When narrower is better: the narrow width limit of Bayesian parallel branching neural networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zechen Zhang, Haim Sompolinsky</p>
<p>Abstract: The infinite width limit of random neural networks is known to result in Neural Networks as Gaussian Process (NNGP) (Lee et al. (2018)), characterized by task-independent kernels. It is widely accepted that larger network widths contribute to improved generalization (Park et al. (2019)). However, this work challenges this notion by investigating the narrow width limit of the Bayesian Parallel Branching Neural Network (BPB-NN), an architecture that resembles neural networks with residual blocks. We demonstrate that when the width of a BPB-NN is significantly smaller compared to the number of training examples, each branch exhibits more robust learning due to a symmetry breaking of branches in kernel renormalization. Surprisingly, the performance of a BPB-NN in the narrow width limit is generally superior to or comparable to that achieved in the wide width limit in bias-limited scenarios. Furthermore, the readout norms of each branch in the narrow width limit are mostly independent of the architectural hyperparameters but generally reflective of the nature of the data. We demonstrate such phenomenon primarily in the branching graph neural networks, where each branch represents a different order of convolutions of the graph; we also extend the results to other more general architectures such as the residual-MLP and demonstrate that the narrow width effect is a general feature of the branching networks. Our results characterize a newly defined narrow-width regime for parallel branching networks in general.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dang Nguyen, Wenhan Yang, Rathul Anand, Yu Yang, Baharan Mirzasoleiman</p>
<p>Abstract: Training with larger mini-batches improves the convergence rate and can yield superior performance. However, training with large mini-batches becomes prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs), due to the large GPU memory requirement. To address this problem, an effective approach is finding small mini-batch coresets that closely match the gradient of larger mini-batches. However, this approach becomes infeasible and ineffective for LLMs, due to the highly imbalanced mixture of sources in language data, use of the Adam optimizer, and the very large gradient dimensionality of LLMs. In this work, we address the above challenges by proposing Coresets for Training LLMs (CoLM). First, we show that mini-batch coresets found by gradient matching do not contain representative examples of the small sources w.h.p., and thus including all examples of the small sources in the mini-batch coresets is crucial for optimal performance. Second, we normalize the gradients by their historical exponential to find mini-batch coresets for training with Adam. Finally, we leverage zeroth-order methods to find smooth gradient of the last V-projection matrix and sparsify it to keep the dimensions with the largest normalized gradient magnitude. We apply CoLM to fine-tuning Phi-2, Phi-3, Zephyr, and Llama-3 models with LoRA on MathInstruct and SuperGLUE benchmark. Remarkably, CoLM reduces the memory requirement of fine-tuning by 2x and even outperforms training with 4x larger mini-batches. Moreover, CoLM seamlessly integrates with existing memory-efficient training methods like LoRA, further reducing the memory requirements of training LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Linkerh\"agner, Cheng Shi, Ivan Dokmani\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: When learning from graph data, the graph and the node features both give noisy information about the node labels. In this paper we propose an algorithm to jointly denoise the features and rewire the graph (JDR), which improves the performance of downstream node classification graph neural nets (GNNs). JDR works by aligning the leading spectral spaces of graph and feature matrices. It approximately solves the associated non-convex optimization problem in a way that handles graphs with multiple classes and different levels of homophily or heterophily. We theoretically justify JDR in a stylized setting and show that it consistently outperforms existing rewiring methods on a wide range of synthetic and real-world node classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haitz S\'aez de Oc\'ariz Borde, Anastasis Kratsios, Marc T. Law, Xiaowen Dong, Michael Bronstein</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a class of trainable deep learning-based geometries called Neural Spacetimes (NSTs), which can universally represent nodes in weighted directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as events in a spacetime manifold. While most works in the literature focus on undirected graph representation learning or causality embedding separately, our differentiable geometry can encode both graph edge weights in its spatial dimensions and causality in the form of edge directionality in its temporal dimensions. We use a product manifold that combines a quasi-metric (for space) and a partial order (for time). NSTs are implemented as three neural networks trained in an end-to-end manner: an embedding network, which learns to optimize the location of nodes as events in the spacetime manifold, and two other networks that optimize the space and time geometries in parallel, which we call a neural (quasi-)metric and a neural partial order, respectively. The latter two networks leverage recent ideas at the intersection of fractal geometry and deep learning to shape the geometry of the representation space in a data-driven fashion, unlike other works in the literature that use fixed spacetime manifolds such as Minkowski space or De Sitter space to embed DAGs. Our main theoretical guarantee is a universal embedding theorem, showing that any $k$-point DAG can be embedded into an NST with $1+\mathcal{O}(\log(k))$ distortion while exactly preserving its causal structure. The total number of parameters defining the NST is sub-cubic in $k$ and linear in the width of the DAG. If the DAG has a planar Hasse diagram, this is improved to $\mathcal{O}(\log(k)) + 2)$ spatial and 2 temporal dimensions. We validate our framework computationally with synthetic weighted DAGs and real-world network embeddings; in both cases, the NSTs achieve lower embedding distortions than their counterparts using fixed spacetime geometries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucia Pezzetti, Stefano Favaro, Stefano Peluchetti</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks represent a fascinating confluence of deep learning and probabilistic reasoning, offering a compelling framework for understanding uncertainty in complex predictive models. In this paper, we investigate the use of the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson algorithm and its Langevin version to sample from a reparametrised posterior distribution of the neural network's weights, as the widths grow larger. In addition to being robust in the infinite-dimensional setting, we prove that the acceptance probabilities of the proposed algorithms approach 1 as the width of the network increases, independently of any stepsize tuning. Moreover, we examine and compare how the mixing speeds of the underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo, the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson and the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin samplers are influenced by changes in the network width in some real-world cases. Our findings suggest that, in wide Bayesian Neural Networks configurations, the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson algorithm allows for a scalable and more efficient sampling of the reparametrised posterior distribution, as also evidenced by a higher effective sample size and improved diagnostic results compared with the other analysed algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anton Kozyriev, Vladimir Norkin</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of conventional vector quantization algorithms, particularly K-Means and its variant K-Means++, and investigates the Stochastic Quantization (SQ) algorithm as a scalable alternative for high-dimensional unsupervised and semi-supervised learning tasks. Traditional clustering algorithms often suffer from inefficient memory utilization during computation, necessitating the loading of all data samples into memory, which becomes impractical for large-scale datasets. While variants such as Mini-Batch K-Means partially mitigate this issue by reducing memory usage, they lack robust theoretical convergence guarantees due to the non-convex nature of clustering problems. In contrast, the Stochastic Quantization algorithm provides strong theoretical convergence guarantees, making it a robust alternative for clustering tasks. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and rapid convergence of the algorithm on an image classification problem with partially labeled data, comparing model accuracy across various ratios of labeled to unlabeled data. To address the challenge of high dimensionality, we employ a Triplet Network to encode images into low-dimensional representations in a latent space, which serve as a basis for comparing the efficiency of both the Stochastic Quantization algorithm and traditional quantization algorithms. Furthermore, we enhance the algorithm's convergence speed by introducing modifications with an adaptive learning rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolaos Nakis, Chrysoula Kosma, Giannis Nikolentzos, Michalis Chatzianastasis, Iakovos Evdaimon, Michalis Vazirgiannis</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent representations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as graphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE extracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is achieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its polarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the SGAAEs' capability to successfully infer node memberships over the different underlying latent structures while extracting competing communities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the network. Additionally, we introduce the 2-level network polarization problem and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model achieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across four real-world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zilinghan Li, Shilan He, Ze Yang, Minseok Ryu, Kibaek Kim, Ravi Madduri</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm enabling collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. In today's landscape, where most data is proprietary, confidential, and distributed, FL has become a promising approach to leverage such data effectively, particularly in sensitive domains such as medicine and the electric grid. Heterogeneity and security are the key challenges in FL, however, most existing FL frameworks either fail to address these challenges adequately or lack the flexibility to incorporate new solutions. To this end, we present the recent advances in developing APPFL, an extensible framework and benchmarking suite for federated learning, which offers comprehensive solutions for heterogeneity and security concerns, as well as user-friendly interfaces for integrating new algorithms or adapting to new applications. We demonstrate the capabilities of APPFL through extensive experiments evaluating various aspects of FL, including communication efficiency, privacy preservation, computational performance, and resource utilization. We further highlight the extensibility of APPFL through case studies in vertical, hierarchical, and decentralized FL. APPFL is fully open-sourced on GitHub at https://github.com/APPFL/APPFL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-world data distributions are often highly skewed. This has spurred a growing body of research on long-tailed recognition, aimed at addressing the imbalance in training classification models. Among the methods studied, multiplicative logit adjustment (MLA) stands out as a simple and effective method. What theoretical foundation explains the effectiveness of this heuristic method? We provide a justification for the effectiveness of MLA with the following two-step process. First, we develop a theory that adjusts optimal decision boundaries by estimating feature spread on the basis of neural collapse. Second, we demonstrate that MLA approximates this optimal method. Additionally, through experiments on long-tailed datasets, we illustrate the practical usefulness of MLA under more realistic conditions. We also offer experimental insights to guide the tuning of MLA hyperparameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Musco, R. Teal Witter</p>
<p>Abstract: Originally introduced in game theory, Shapley values have emerged as a central tool in explainable machine learning, where they are used to attribute model predictions to specific input features. However, computing Shapley values exactly is expensive: for a general model with $n$ features, $O(2^n)$ model evaluations are necessary. To address this issue, approximation algorithms are widely used. One of the most popular is the Kernel SHAP algorithm, which is model agnostic and remarkably effective in practice. However, to the best of our knowledge, Kernel SHAP has no strong non-asymptotic complexity guarantees. We address this issue by introducing Leverage SHAP, a light-weight modification of Kernel SHAP that provides provably accurate Shapley value estimates with just $O(n\log n)$ model evaluations. Our approach takes advantage of a connection between Shapley value estimation and agnostic active learning by employing leverage score sampling, a powerful regression tool. Beyond theoretical guarantees, we show that Leverage SHAP consistently outperforms even the highly optimized implementation of Kernel SHAP available in the ubiquitous SHAP library [Lundberg & Lee, 2017].</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdulla Jasem Almansoori, Samuel Horv\'ath, Martin Tak\'a\v{c}</p>
<p>Abstract: Heterogenous data is prevalent in real-world federated learning. We propose a parameter-efficient framework, Federated Low-Rank Adaptive Learning (FLoRAL), that allows clients to personalize in groups by mixing between low-rank adaptors, where the mixtures are client-specific. FLoRAL is a model parameterization that casts personalized federated learning as a multi-task learning problem, with weight sharing as an implicit regularizer. It is memory-efficient, as the personalized parameters (i.e., base model + adaptors) are all federated. Our results show that FLoRAL can generalize better than a mixture of full models when data are scarce. It can also consistently personalize better than models with a locally tuned adaptor per client. This demonstrates the benefits of "federated personalization" and its robustness against overfitting. We derive the convergence rates and show theoretically that FLoRAL can lead to better variance reduction of the base model's gradients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dmitry Yarotsky, Maksim Velikanov</p>
<p>Abstract: An important open problem is the theoretically feasible acceleration of mini-batch SGD-type algorithms on quadratic problems with power-law spectrum. In the non-stochastic setting, the optimal exponent $\xi$ in the loss convergence $L_t\sim C_Lt^{-\xi}$ is double that in plain GD and is achievable using Heavy Ball (HB) with a suitable schedule; this no longer works in the presence of mini-batch noise. We address this challenge by considering first-order methods with an arbitrary fixed number $M$ of auxiliary velocity vectors (*memory-$M$ algorithms*). We first prove an equivalence between two forms of such algorithms and describe them in terms of suitable characteristic polynomials. Then we develop a general expansion of the loss in terms of signal and noise propagators. Using it, we show that losses of stationary stable memory-$M$ algorithms always retain the exponent $\xi$ of plain GD, but can have different constants $C_L$ depending on their effective learning rate that generalizes that of HB. We prove that in memory-1 algorithms we can make $C_L$ arbitrarily small while maintaining stability. As a consequence, we propose a memory-1 algorithm with a time-dependent schedule that we show heuristically and experimentally to improve the exponent $\xi$ of plain SGD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humans perceive the world as a series of sequential events, which can be hierarchically organized with different levels of abstraction based on conceptual knowledge. Drawing inspiration from human learning behaviors, this work proposes a novel approach to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in Prompt-based Continual Learning models by exploiting the relationships between continuously emerging class data. We find that applying human habits of organizing and connecting information can serve as an efficient strategy when training deep learning models. Specifically, by building a hierarchical tree structure based on the expanding set of labels, we gain fresh insights into the data, identifying groups of similar classes could easily cause confusion. Additionally, we delve deeper into the hidden connections between classes by exploring the original pretrained model's behavior through an optimal transport-based approach. From these insights, we propose a novel regularization loss function that encourages models to focus more on challenging knowledge areas, thereby enhancing overall performance. Experimentally, our method demonstrated significant superiority over the most robust state-of-the-art models on various benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Given the limitations of backpropagation, perturbation-based gradient computation methods have recently gained focus for learning with only forward passes, also referred to as queries. Conventional forward learning consumes enormous queries on each data point for accurate gradient estimation through Monte Carlo sampling, which hinders the scalability of those algorithms. However, not all data points deserve equal queries for gradient estimation. In this paper, we study the problem of improving the forward learning efficiency from a novel perspective: how to reduce the gradient estimation variance with minimum cost? For this, we propose to allocate the optimal number of queries over each data in one batch during training to achieve a good balance between estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, with a simplified proxy objective and a reparameterization technique, we derive a novel plug-and-play query allocator with minimal parameters. Theoretical results are carried out to verify its optimality. We conduct extensive experiments for fine-tuning Vision Transformers on various datasets and further deploy the allocator to two black-box applications: prompt tuning and multimodal alignment for foundation models. All findings demonstrate that our proposed allocator significantly enhances the scalability of forward-learning algorithms, paving the way for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Botong Zhang, Shuo Li, Osbert Bastani</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction has recently emerged as a promising strategy for quantifying the uncertainty of a predictive model; these algorithms modify the model to output sets of labels that are guaranteed to contain the true label with high probability. However, existing conformal prediction algorithms have largely targeted classification and regression settings, where the structure of the prediction set has a simple form as a level set of the scoring function. However, for complex structured outputs such as text generation, these prediction sets might include a large number of labels and therefore be hard for users to interpret. In this paper, we propose a general framework for conformal prediction in the structured prediction setting, that modifies existing conformal prediction algorithms to output structured prediction sets that implicitly represent sets of labels. In addition, we demonstrate how our approach can be applied in domains where the prediction sets can be represented as a set of nodes in a directed acyclic graph; for instance, for hierarchical labels such as image classification, a prediction set might be a small subset of coarse labels implicitly representing the prediction set of all their more fine-descendants. We demonstrate how our algorithm can be used to construct prediction sets that satisfy a desired coverage guarantee in several domains.</p>

While low-level control mechanisms permit fine-grained control over a system, they introduce considerable complexity, particularly in dynamic environments. To this end, we propose drawing from Active Inference (AIF), a neuroscientific framework for designing adaptive agents. Specifically, we introduce a conceptual agent for heterogeneous pervasive systems that permits setting global systems constraints as high-level SLOs. Instead of manually setting low-level SLOs, the system finds an equilibrium that can adapt to environmental changes. We demonstrate the viability of our AIF agents with an extensive experiment design, using heterogeneous and lifelong federated learning as an application scenario. We conduct our experiments on a physical testbed of devices with different resource types and vendor specifications. The results provide convincing evidence that an AIF agent can adapt a system to environmental changes. In particular, the AIF agent can balance competing SLOs in resource heterogeneous environments to ensure up to 98% fulfillment rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyang Li, Jiachun Pan, Vincent Y. F. Tan, Kim-Chuan Toh, Pan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL), exemplified by FixMatch (Sohn et al., 2020), has shown significant generalization advantages over supervised learning (SL), particularly in the context of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it is still unclear, from a theoretical standpoint, why FixMatch-like SSL algorithms generalize better than SL on DNNs. In this work, we present the first theoretical justification for the enhanced test accuracy observed in FixMatch-like SSL applied to DNNs by taking convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on classification tasks as an example. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the semantic feature learning processes in FixMatch and SL are rather different. In particular, FixMatch learns all the discriminative features of each semantic class, while SL only randomly captures a subset of features due to the well-known lottery ticket hypothesis. Furthermore, we show that our analysis framework can be applied to other FixMatch-like SSL methods, e.g., FlexMatch, FreeMatch, Dash, and SoftMatch. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, we develop an improved variant of FixMatch, termed Semantic-Aware FixMatch (SA-FixMatch). Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings and the enhanced generalization capability of SA-FixMatch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyang He, Ying-Jung Chen, Alireza Jafari, Anushka Idamekorala, Geoffrey Fox</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been active investigation into deep learning approaches for time series analysis, including foundation models. However, most studies do not address significant scientific applications. This paper aims to identify key features in time series by examining hydrology data. Our work advances computer science by emphasizing critical application features and contributes to hydrology and other scientific fields by identifying modeling approaches that effectively capture these features. Scientific time series data are inherently complex, involving observations from multiple locations, each with various time-dependent data streams and exogenous factors that may be static or time-varying and either application-dependent or purely mathematical. This research analyzes hydrology time series from the CAMELS and Caravan global datasets, which encompass rainfall and runoff data across catchments, featuring up to six observed streams and 209 static parameters across approximately 8,000 locations. Our investigation assesses the impact of exogenous data through eight different model configurations for key hydrology tasks. Results demonstrate that integrating exogenous information enhances data representation, reducing mean squared error by up to 40% in the largest dataset. Additionally, we present a detailed performance comparison of over 20 state-of-the-art pattern and foundation models. The analysis is fully open-source, facilitated by Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab for LSTM-based modeling, data preprocessing, and model comparisons. Preliminary findings using alternative deep learning architectures reveal that models incorporating comprehensive observed and exogenous data outperform more limited approaches, including foundation models. Notably, natural annual periodic exogenous time series contribute the most significant improvements, though static and other periodic factors are also valuable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujia Wu, Junyi Mo, Elynn Chen, Yuzhou Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance graph neural networks' (GNNs) ability to learn rich representations from unlabeled graph-structured data. However, current GCL models face challenges with computational demands and limited feature utilization, often relying only on basic graph properties like node degrees and edge attributes. This constrains their capacity to fully capture the complex topological characteristics of real-world phenomena represented by graphs. To address these limitations, we propose Tensor-Fused Multi-View Graph Contrastive Learning (TensorMV-GCL), a novel framework that integrates extended persistent homology (EPH) with GCL representations and facilitates multi-scale feature extraction. Our approach uniquely employs tensor aggregation and compression to fuse information from graph and topological features obtained from multiple augmented views of the same graph. By incorporating tensor concatenation and contraction modules, we reduce computational overhead by separating feature tensor aggregation and transformation. Furthermore, we enhance the quality of learned topological features and model robustness through noise-injected EPH. Experiments on molecular, bioinformatic, and social network datasets demonstrate TensorMV-GCL's superiority, outperforming 15 state-of-the-art methods in graph classification tasks across 9 out of 11 benchmarks while achieving comparable results on the remaining two.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyu Wang, Jiawei Li, Xiaoming Shi, Zhou Ye, Baichuan Mo, Wenze Lin, Shengtong Ju, Zhixuan Chu, Ming Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series analysis plays a critical role in numerous applications, supporting tasks such as forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gathika Ratnayaka, James Nichols, Qing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Partial graph matching extends traditional graph matching by allowing some nodes to remain unmatched, enabling applications in more complex scenarios. However, this flexibility introduces additional complexity, as both the subset of nodes to match and the optimal mapping must be determined. While recent studies have explored deep learning techniques for partial graph matching, a significant limitation remains: the absence of an optimization objective that fully captures the problem's intrinsic nature while enabling efficient solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization framework for partial graph matching, inspired by optimal partial transport. Our approach formulates an objective that enables partial assignments while incorporating matching biases, using weighted total variation as the divergence function to guarantee optimal partial assignments. Our method can achieve efficient, exact solutions within cubic worst case time complexity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we introduce a novel optimization objective that balances matched and unmatched nodes; (ii) we establish a connection between partial graph matching and linear sum assignment problem, enabling efficient solutions; (iii) we propose a deep graph matching architecture with a novel partial matching loss, providing an end-to-end solution. The empirical evaluations on standard graph matching benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Salami, Pietro Buzzega, Matteo Mosconi, Jacopo Bonato, Luigi Sabetta, Simone Calderara</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a crucial technique in Deep Learning, enabling the integration of multiple models into a unified system while preserving perfor-mance and scalability. In this respect, the compositional properties of low-rank adaptation techniques (e.g., LoRA) have proven beneficial, as simple averaging LoRA modules yields a single model that mostly integrates the capabilities of all individual modules. Building on LoRA, we take a step further by imposing that the merged model matches the responses of all learned modules. Solving this objective in closed form yields an indeterminate system with A and B as unknown variables, indicating the existence of infinitely many closed-form solutions. To address this challenge, we introduce LoRM, an alternating optimization strategy that trains one LoRA matrix at a time. This allows solving for each unknown variable individually, thus finding a unique solution. We apply our proposed methodology to Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL), ensuring alignment of model responses both between clients and across tasks. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across a range of FCIL scenarios. The code to reproduce our experiments is available at github.com/aimagelab/fed-mammoth.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luran Wang, Chaoran Cheng, Yizhen Liao, Yanru Qu, Ge Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Controlled generation with pre-trained Diffusion and Flow Matching models has vast applications. One strategy for guiding ODE-based generative models is through optimizing a target loss $R(x_1)$ while staying close to the prior distribution. Along this line, some recent work showed the effectiveness of guiding flow model by differentiating through its ODE sampling process. Despite the superior performance, the theoretical understanding of this line of methods is still preliminary, leaving space for algorithm improvement. Moreover, existing methods predominately focus on Euclidean data manifold, and there is a compelling need for guided flow methods on complex geometries such as SO(3), which prevails in high-stake scientific applications like protein design. We present OC-Flow, a general and theoretically grounded training-free framework for guided flow matching using optimal control. Building upon advances in optimal control theory, we develop effective and practical algorithms for solving optimal control in guided ODE-based generation and provide a systematic theoretical analysis of the convergence guarantee in both Euclidean and SO(3). We show that existing backprop-through-ODE methods can be interpreted as special cases of Euclidean OC-Flow. OC-Flow achieved superior performance in extensive experiments on text-guided image manipulation, conditional molecule generation, and all-atom peptide design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunchong Liu, Xiaorui Shen, Yeyubei Zhang, Zhongyan Wang, Yexin Tian, Jianglai Dai, Yuchen Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have facilitated the spread of misinformation, necessitating automated detection systems. This systematic review evaluates 36 studies that apply machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to detect fake news, spam, and fake accounts on social media. Using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST), the review identified key biases across the ML lifecycle: selection bias due to non-representative sampling, inadequate handling of class imbalance, insufficient linguistic preprocessing (e.g., negations), and inconsistent hyperparameter tuning. Although models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks showed strong potential, over-reliance on accuracy as an evaluation metric in imbalanced data settings was a common flaw. The review highlights the need for improved data preprocessing (e.g., resampling techniques), consistent hyperparameter tuning, and the use of appropriate metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and AUROC. Addressing these limitations can lead to more reliable and generalizable ML/DL models for detecting deceptive content, ultimately contributing to the reduction of misinformation on social media.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiwo A. Adebiyi, Bach Do, Ruda Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization devolves the global optimization of a costly objective function to the global optimization of a sequence of acquisition functions. This inner-loop optimization can be catastrophically difficult if it involves posterior sample paths, especially in higher dimensions. We introduce an efficient global optimization strategy for posterior samples based on global rootfinding. It provides gradient-based optimizers with two sets of judiciously selected starting points, designed to combine exploration and exploitation. The number of starting points can be kept small without sacrificing optimization quality. Remarkably, even with just one point from each set, the global optimum is discovered most of the time. The algorithm scales practically linearly to high dimensions, breaking the curse of dimensionality. For Gaussian process Thompson sampling (GP-TS), we demonstrate remarkable improvement in both inner- and outer-loop optimization, surprisingly outperforming alternatives like EI and GP-UCB in most cases. Our approach also improves the performance of other posterior sample-based acquisition functions, such as variants of entropy search. Furthermore, we propose a sample-average formulation of GP-TS, which has a parameter to explicitly control exploitation and can be computed at the cost of one posterior sample.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22796">Solving Differential Equations with Constrained Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Viggo Moro, Luiz F. O. Chamon</p>
<p>Abstract: (Partial) differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental tools for describing natural phenomena, making their solution crucial in science and engineering. While traditional methods, such as the finite element method, provide reliable solutions, their accuracy is often tied to the use of computationally intensive fine meshes. Moreover, they do not naturally account for measurements or prior solutions, and any change in the problem parameters requires results to be fully recomputed. Neural network-based approaches, such as physics-informed neural networks and neural operators, offer a mesh-free alternative by directly fitting those models to the PDE solution. They can also integrate prior knowledge and tackle entire families of PDEs by simply aggregating additional training losses. Nevertheless, they are highly sensitive to hyperparameters such as collocation points and the weights associated with each loss. This paper addresses these challenges by developing a science-constrained learning (SCL) framework. It demonstrates that finding a (weak) solution of a PDE is equivalent to solving a constrained learning problem with worst-case losses. This explains the limitations of previous methods that minimize the expected value of aggregated losses. SCL also organically integrates structural constraints (e.g., invariances) and (partial) measurements or known solutions. The resulting constrained learning problems can be tackled using a practical algorithm that yields accurate solutions across a variety of PDEs, neural network architectures, and prior knowledge levels without extensive hyperparameter tuning and sometimes even at a lower computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ebrahim Farahmand, Shovito Barua Soumma, Nooshin Taheri Chatrudi, Hassan Ghasemzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: The availability of continuous glucose monitors as over-the-counter commodities have created a unique opportunity to monitor a person's blood glucose levels, forecast blood glucose trajectories and provide automated interventions to prevent devastating chronic complications that arise from poor glucose control. However, forecasting blood glucose levels is challenging because blood glucose changes consistently in response to food intake, medication intake, physical activity, sleep, and stress. It is particularly difficult to accurately predict BGL from multimodal and irregularly sampled data and over long prediction horizons. Furthermore, these forecasting models must operate in real-time on edge devices to provide in-the-moment interventions. To address these challenges, we propose GlucoNet, an AI-powered sensor system for continuously monitoring behavioral and physiological health and robust forecasting of blood glucose patterns. GlucoNet devises a feature decomposition-based transformer model that incorporates patients' behavioral and physiological data and transforms sparse and irregular patient data (e.g., diet and medication intake data) into continuous features using a mathematical model, facilitating better integration with the BGL data. Given the non-linear and non-stationary nature of BG signals, we propose a decomposition method to extract both low and high-frequency components from the BGL signals, thus providing accurate forecasting. To reduce the computational complexity, we also propose to employ knowledge distillation to compress the transformer model. GlucoNet achieves a 60% improvement in RMSE and a 21% reduction in the number of parameters, improving RMSE and MAE by 51% and 57%, using data obtained involving 12 participants with T1-Diabetes. These results underscore GlucoNet's potential as a compact and reliable tool for real-world diabetes prevention and management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad R. Salmanpour, Morteza Alizadeh, Ghazal Mousavi, Saba Sadeghi, Sajad Amiri, Mehrdad Oveisi, Arman Rahmim, Ilker Hacihaliloglu</p>
<p>Abstract: This study evaluates metrics for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, correlation analysis, statistical tests, segmentation, and image-to-image (I2I) translation. Metrics were compared across Python libraries, R packages, and Matlab functions to assess their consistency and highlight discrepancies. The findings underscore the need for a unified roadmap to standardize metrics, ensuring reliable and reproducible ML evaluations across platforms. This study examined a wide range of evaluation metrics across various tasks and found only some to be consistent across platforms, such as (i) Accuracy, Balanced Accuracy, Cohens Kappa, F-beta Score, MCC, Geometric Mean, AUC, and Log Loss in binary classification; (ii) Accuracy, Cohens Kappa, and F-beta Score in multi-class classification; (iii) MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, Explained Variance, Median AE, MSLE, and Huber in regression; (iv) Davies-Bouldin Index and Calinski-Harabasz Index in clustering; (v) Pearson, Spearman, Kendall's Tau, Mutual Information, Distance Correlation, Percbend, Shepherd, and Partial Correlation in correlation analysis; (vi) Paired t-test, Chi-Square Test, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis Test, Shapiro-Wilk Test, Welchs t-test, and Bartlett's test in statistical tests; (vii) Accuracy, Precision, and Recall in 2D segmentation; (viii) Accuracy in 3D segmentation; (ix) MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-Squared in 2D-I2I translation; and (x) MAE, MSE, and RMSE in 3D-I2I translation. Given observation of discrepancies in a number of metrics (e.g. precision, recall and F1 score in binary classification, WCSS in clustering, multiple statistical tests, and IoU in segmentation, amongst multiple metrics), this study concludes that ML evaluation metrics require standardization and recommends that future research use consistent metrics for different tasks to effectively compare ML techniques and solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant advancements, demonstrating powerful capabilities in processing and understanding multimodal data. Fine-tuning MLLMs with Federated Learning (FL) allows for expanding the training data scope by including private data sources, thereby enhancing their practical applicability in privacy-sensitive domains. However, current research remains in the early stage, particularly in addressing the \textbf{multimodal heterogeneities} in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark to evaluate the performance of federated fine-tuning of MLLMs across various multimodal heterogeneous scenarios, laying the groundwork for future research in the field. Our benchmark includes two lightweight MLLMs, two downstream tasks, three evaluation metrics, and five datasets across three domains, along with six comparison baselines, covering over ten types of modality heterogeneities across four multimodal scenarios. To address the challenges posed by multimodal heterogeneity, we develop a general FedMLLM framework that integrates classic FL methods alongside two modality-agnostic strategies. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FL paradigm improves the performance of MLLMs by broadening the range of training data and mitigating multimodal heterogeneity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Xie, Weijie Zheng, Hanxun Huang, Guangnan Ye, Xingjun Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, evaluating their vulnerabilities to adversarial perturbations is essential for ensuring their reliability and trustworthiness. Over the past decade, a large number of white-box adversarial robustness evaluation methods (i.e., attacks) have been proposed, ranging from single-step to multi-step methods and from individual to ensemble methods. Despite these advances, challenges remain in conducting meaningful and comprehensive robustness evaluations, particularly when it comes to large-scale testing and ensuring evaluations reflect real-world adversarial risks. In this work, we focus on image classification models and propose a novel individual attack method, Probability Margin Attack (PMA), which defines the adversarial margin in the probability space rather than the logits space. We analyze the relationship between PMA and existing cross-entropy or logits-margin-based attacks, and show that PMA can outperform the current state-of-the-art individual methods. Building on PMA, we propose two types of ensemble attacks that balance effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, we create a million-scale dataset, CC1M, derived from the existing CC3M dataset, and use it to conduct the first million-scale white-box adversarial robustness evaluation of adversarially-trained ImageNet models. Our findings provide valuable insights into the robustness gaps between individual versus ensemble attacks and small-scale versus million-scale evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Paul E. Apolinario, Sakshi Choudhary, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) - the ability to progressively acquire and integrate new concepts - is essential to intelligent systems to adapt to dynamic environments. However, deep neural networks struggle with catastrophic forgetting (CF) when learning tasks sequentially, as training for new tasks often overwrites previously learned knowledge. To address this, recent approaches constrain updates to orthogonal subspaces using gradient projection, effectively preserving important gradient directions for previous tasks. While effective in reducing forgetting, these approaches inadvertently hinder forward knowledge transfer (FWT), particularly when tasks are highly correlated. In this work, we propose Conceptor-based gradient projection for Deep Continual Learning (CODE-CL), a novel method that leverages conceptor matrix representations, a form of regularized reconstruction, to adaptively handle highly correlated tasks. CODE-CL mitigates CF by projecting gradients onto pseudo-orthogonal subspaces of previous task feature spaces while simultaneously promoting FWT. It achieves this by learning a linear combination of shared basis directions, allowing efficient balance between stability and plasticity and transfer of knowledge between overlapping input feature representations. Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks validate CODE-CL's efficacy, demonstrating superior performance, reduced forgetting, and improved FWT as compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiming Xu, Suorong Yang, Baile Xu, Jian Zhao, Furao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to acquire new classes while conserving historical knowledge incrementally. Despite existing pre-trained model (PTM) based methods performing excellently in CIL, it is better to fine-tune them on downstream incremental tasks with massive patterns unknown to PTMs. However, using task streams for fine-tuning could lead to catastrophic forgetting that will erase the knowledge in PTMs. This paper proposes the Dual Prototype network for Task-wise Adaption (DPTA) of PTM-based CIL. For each incremental learning task, a task-wise adapter module is built to fine-tune the PTM, where the center-adapt loss forces the representation to be more centrally clustered and class separable. The dual prototype network improves the prediction process by enabling test-time adapter selection, where the raw prototypes deduce several possible task indexes of test samples to select suitable adapter modules for PTM, and the augmented prototypes that could separate highly correlated classes are utilized to determine the final result. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DPTA. The code will be open-sourced after the paper is published.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhua Yu, Ding Zhou, Cong Xie, An Xu, Zhi Zhang, Xin Liu, Soummya Kar</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-training Transformer models is resource-intensive, and recent studies have shown that sign momentum is an efficient technique for training large-scale deep learning models, particularly Transformers. However, its application in distributed training remains underexplored. This paper investigates a novel communication-efficient distributed sign momentum method with multiple local steps, to cope with the scenarios where communicating at every step is prohibitive. Our proposed method allows for a broad class of base optimizers for local steps, and uses sign momentum in the global step, where momentum is generated from differences accumulated during local steps. For generic base optimizers, by approximating the sign operator with a randomized version that acts as a continuous analog in expectation, we present a general convergence analysis, which specializes to an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate for a particular instance. When local step is stochastic gradient descent, we show an optimal $O(1/T^{1/4})$ rate in terms of $\ell_1$ gradient norm for nonconvex smooth cost functions. We extensively evaluate our method on the pre-training of various sized GPT-2 models from scratch, and the empirical results show significant improvement compared to other distributed methods with multiple local steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianliang Li, Jun Luo, Zhiwei Zheng, Hanxiao Wang, Li Luo, Lingkun Wen, Linlong Wu, Sheng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Momentum-based optimizers are widely adopted for training neural networks. However, the optimal selection of momentum coefficients remains elusive. This uncertainty impedes a clear understanding of the role of momentum in stochastic gradient methods. In this paper, we present a frequency domain analysis framework that interprets the momentum method as a time-variant filter for gradients, where adjustments to momentum coefficients modify the filter characteristics. Our experiments support this perspective and provide a deeper understanding of the mechanism involved. Moreover, our analysis reveals the following significant findings: high-frequency gradient components are undesired in the late stages of training; preserving the original gradient in the early stages, and gradually amplifying low-frequency gradient components during training both enhance performance. Based on these insights, we propose Frequency Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (FSGDM), a heuristic optimizer that dynamically adjusts the momentum filtering characteristic with an empirically effective dynamic magnitude response. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSGDM over conventional momentum optimizers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Zhou, Youwen Zhu, Qiao Xue, Ji Zhang, Pengfei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the enactment of ``right to be forgotten" laws and regulations has imposed new privacy requirements on federated learning (FL). Researchers aim to remove the influence of certain data from the trained model without training from scratch through federated unlearning (FU). While current FU research has shown progress in enhancing unlearning efficiency, it often results in degraded model performance upon achieving the goal of data unlearning, necessitating additional steps to recover the performance of the unlearned model. Moreover, these approaches also suffer from many shortcomings such as high consumption of computational and storage resources. To this end, we propose a streamlined federated unlearning approach (SFU) aimed at effectively removing the influence of the target data while preserving the model performance on the retained data without degradation. We design a practical multi-teacher system that achieves both target data influence removal and model performance preservation by guiding the unlearned model through several distinct teacher models. SFU is both computationally and storage-efficient, highly flexible, and generalizable. We conduct extensive experiments on both image and text benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that SFU significantly improves time and communication efficiency compared to the benchmark retraining method and significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods. Additionally, we verify the effectiveness of SFU using the backdoor attack.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongyang Zhao, Dong Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to efficiently learn from a non-stationary data stream, without storing or recomputing all seen samples. CL enables prediction on new tasks by incorporating sequential training samples. Building on this connection between CL and sequential modeling, meta-continual learning (MCL) aims to meta-learn an efficient continual learner as a sequence prediction model, with advanced sequence models like Transformers being natural choices. However, despite decent performance, Transformers rely on a linearly growing cache to store all past representations, conflicting with CL's objective of not storing all seen samples and limiting efficiency. In this paper, we focus on meta-learning sequence-prediction-based continual learners without retaining all past representations. While attention-free models with fixed-size hidden states (e.g., Linear Transformers) align with CL's essential goal and efficiency needs, they have shown limited effectiveness in MCL in previous literature. Given Mamba's strong sequence modeling performance and attention-free nature, we explore a key question: Can attention-free models like Mamba perform well on MCL? By formulating Mamba and the SSM for MCL tasks, we propose MambaCL, a meta-learned continual learner. To enhance MambaCL's training, we introduce selectivity regularization, leveraging the connection between Mamba and Transformers to guide its behavior over sequences. Furthermore, we study how Mamba and other models perform across various MCL scenarios through extensive and well-designed experiments. Our results highlight the promising performance and strong generalization of Mamba and attention-free models in MCL, demonstrating its potential for efficient continual learning and adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Clinton Cao, Agathe Blaise, Annibale Panichella, Sicco Verwer</p>
<p>Abstract: Many works have studied the efficacy of state machines for detecting anomalies within NetFlows. These works typically learn a model from unlabeled data and compute anomaly scores for arbitrary traces based on their likelihood of occurrence or how well they fit within the model. However, these methods do not dynamically adapt their scores based on the traces seen at test time. This becomes a problem when an adversary produces seemingly common traces in their attack, causing the model to miss the detection by assigning low anomaly scores. We propose SEQUENT, a new unsupervised approach that uses the state visit frequency of a state machine to adapt its scoring dynamically for anomaly detection. SEQUENT subsequently uses the scores to generate root causes for anomalies. These allow the grouping of alarms and simplify the analysis of anomalies. We evaluate SEQUENT's effectiveness in detecting network anomalies on three publicly available NetFlow datasets and compare its performance against various existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Our evaluation shows promising results for using the state visit frequency of a state machine to detect network anomalies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Khairul Islam, Judy Fox</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpreting complex time series forecasting models is challenging due to the temporal dependencies between time steps and the dynamic relevance of input features over time. Existing interpretation methods are limited by focusing mostly on classification tasks, evaluating using custom baseline models instead of the latest time series models, using simple synthetic datasets, and requiring training another model. We introduce a novel interpretation method, \textit{Windowed Temporal Saliency Rescaling (WinTSR)} addressing these limitations. WinTSR explicitly captures temporal dependencies among the past time steps and efficiently scales the feature importance with this time importance. We benchmark WinTSR against 10 recent interpretation techniques with 5 state-of-the-art deep-learning models of different architectures, including a time series foundation model. We use 3 real-world datasets for both time-series classification and regression. Our comprehensive analysis shows that WinTSR significantly outperforms other local interpretation methods in overall performance. Finally, we provide a novel, open-source framework to interpret the latest time series transformers and foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Navyansh Mahla, Sunny Gupta, Amit Sethi</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has gained popularity for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) across multiple nodes, each with its own private data. While LoRA has been widely adopted for parameter efficient federated fine-tuning, recent theoretical and empirical studies highlight its suboptimal performance in the federated learning context. In response, we propose a novel, simple, and more effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that does not rely on LoRA. Our approach introduces a small multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layer between two existing MLP layers the up proj (the FFN projection layer following the self-attention module) and down proj within the feed forward network of the transformer block. This solution addresses the bottlenecks associated with LoRA in federated fine tuning and outperforms recent LoRA-based approaches, demonstrating superior performance for both language models and vision encoders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Myeongseob Ko, Henry Li, Zhun Wang, Jonathan Patsenker, Jiachen T. Wang, Qinbin Li, Ming Jin, Dawn Song, Ruoxi Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale generative models have shown impressive image-generation capabilities, propelled by massive data. However, this often inadvertently leads to the generation of harmful or inappropriate content and raises copyright concerns. Driven by these concerns, machine unlearning has become crucial to effectively purge undesirable knowledge from models. While existing literature has studied various unlearning techniques, these often suffer from either poor unlearning quality or degradation in text-image alignment after unlearning, due to the competitive nature of these objectives. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that seeks an optimal model update at each unlearning iteration, ensuring monotonic improvement on both objectives. We further derive the characterization of such an update.
  In addition, we design procedures to strategically diversify the unlearning and remaining datasets to boost performance improvement. Our evaluation demonstrates that our method effectively removes target classes from recent diffusion-based generative models and concepts from stable diffusion models while maintaining close alignment with the models' original trained states, thus outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Li, Zitong Yu, Ziqiang He, Z. Jane Wang, Xiangui Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Imperceptible adversarial attacks have recently attracted increasing research interests. Existing methods typically incorporate external modules or loss terms other than a simple $l_p$-norm into the attack process to achieve imperceptibility, while we argue that such additional designs may not be necessary. In this paper, we rethink the essence of imperceptible attacks and propose two simple yet effective strategies to unleash the potential of PGD, the common and classical attack, for imperceptibility from an optimization perspective. Specifically, the Dynamic Step Size is introduced to find the optimal solution with minimal attack cost towards the decision boundary of the attacked model, and the Adaptive Early Stop strategy is adopted to reduce the redundant strength of adversarial perturbations to the minimum level. The proposed PGD-Imperceptible (PGD-Imp) attack achieves state-of-the-art results in imperceptible adversarial attacks for both untargeted and targeted scenarios. When performing untargeted attacks against ResNet-50, PGD-Imp attains 100$\%$ (+0.3$\%$) ASR, 0.89 (-1.76) $l_2$ distance, and 52.93 (+9.2) PSNR with 57s (-371s) running time, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aecheon Jung, Seunghwan Lee, Dongyoon Han, Sungeun Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging integrates independently fine-tuned models into a single multi-task model, offering a flexible alternative to joint training. However, many existing model merging methods introduce additional task-specific components, increasing complexity and requiring extra modifications. We propose Model Tinting, a lightweight yet highly effective approach that improves model merging by updating just a single layer, accounting for as low as 0.5% of total parameters. Our key observation is that explicit task-specific modules are not necessary; instead, subtle adjustments to a single layer can effectively capture task-specific variations within the merged model while maintaining generalization. We introduce a confidence-based filtering mechanism to alleviate the impact of unreliable predictions from individual models on the merged model. Extensive experiments across vision and NLP tasks demonstrate that Model Tinting achieves state-of-the-art performance, even in challenging dense prediction tasks.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20436">Treatment Effect Estimation for Graph-Structured Targets</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shonosuke Harada, Ryosuke Yoneda, Hisashi Kashima</p>
<p>Abstract: Treatment effect estimation, which helps understand the causality between treatment and outcome variable, is a central task in decision-making across various domains. While most studies focus on treatment effect estimation on individual targets, in specific contexts, there is a necessity to comprehend the treatment effect on a group of targets, especially those that have relationships represented as a graph structure between them. In such cases, the focus of treatment assignment is prone to depend on a particular node of the graph, such as the one with the highest degree, thus resulting in an observational bias from a small part of the entire graph. Whereas a bias tends to be caused by the small part, straightforward extensions of previous studies cannot provide efficient bias mitigation owing to the use of the entire graph information. In this study, we propose Graph-target Treatment Effect Estimation (GraphTEE), a framework designed to estimate treatment effects specifically on graph-structured targets. GraphTEE aims to mitigate observational bias by focusing on confounding variable sets and consider a new regularization framework. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis on how GraphTEE performs better in terms of bias mitigation. Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present AlphaNet, a local frame-based equivariant model designed to achieve both accurate and efficient simulations for atomistic systems. Recently, machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have gained prominence in molecular dynamics simulations due to their advantageous efficiency-accuracy balance compared to classical force fields and quantum mechanical calculations, alongside their transferability across various systems. Despite the advancements in improving model accuracy, the efficiency and scalability of MLFFs remain significant obstacles in practical applications. AlphaNet enhances computational efficiency and accuracy by leveraging the local geometric structures of atomic environments through the construction of equivariant local frames and learnable frame transitions. We substantiate the efficacy of AlphaNet across diverse datasets, including defected graphene, formate decomposition, zeolites, and surface reactions. AlphaNet consistently surpasses well-established models, such as NequIP and DeepPot, in terms of both energy and force prediction accuracy. Notably, AlphaNet offers one of the best trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy among existing models. Moreover, AlphaNet exhibits scalability across a broad spectrum of system and dataset sizes, affirming its versatility.</p>

Although the vanilla GP itself is already a powerful tool for BO, it is often beneficial to be able to consider the dependencies of multiple outputs. To do so, Multi-task GP (MTGP) is formulated, but it is not trivial to fully understand the derivations of its formulations and their gradients from the previous literature. This paper serves friendly derivations of the MTGP formulations and their gradients.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for inventory management of newly launched products with no historical demand information. The algorithm follows the classic Dyna-$Q$ structure, balancing the model-free and model-based approaches, while accelerating the training process of Dyna-$Q$ and mitigating the model discrepancy generated by the model-based feedback. Based on the idea of transfer learning, warm-start information from the demand data of existing similar products can be incorporated into the algorithm to further stabilize the early-stage training and reduce the variance of the estimated optimal policy. Our approach is validated through a case study of bakery inventory management with real data. The adjusted Dyna-$Q$ shows up to a 23.7\% reduction in average daily cost compared with $Q$-learning, and up to a 77.5\% reduction in training time within the same horizon compared with classic Dyna-$Q$. By using transfer learning, it can be found that the adjusted Dyna-$Q$ has the lowest total cost, lowest variance in total cost, and relatively low shortage percentages among all the benchmarking algorithms under a 30-day testing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a decentralized machine learning technique, allowing clients to train a global model collaboratively without sharing private data. However, most FL studies ignore the crucial challenge of heterogeneous domains where each client has a distinct feature distribution, which is popular in real-world scenarios. Prototype learning, which leverages the mean feature vectors within the same classes, has become a prominent solution for federated learning under domain shift. However, existing federated prototype learning methods focus soley on inter-domain prototypes and neglect intra-domain perspectives. In this work, we introduce a novel federated prototype learning method, namely I$^2$PFL, which incorporates $\textbf{I}$ntra-domain and $\textbf{I}$nter-domain $\textbf{P}$rototypes, to mitigate domain shift from both perspectives and learn a generalized global model across multiple domains in federated learning. To construct intra-domain prototypes, we propose feature alignment with MixUp-based augmented prototypes to capture the diversity within local domains and enhance the generalization of local features. Additionally, we introduce a reweighting mechanism for inter-domain prototypes to generate generalized prototypes that reduce domain shift while providing inter-domain knowledge across multiple clients. Extensive experiments on the Digits, Office-10, and PACS datasets illustrate the superior performance of our method compared to other baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taoran Fang, Tianhong Gao, Chunping Wang, Yihao Shang, Wei Chow, Lei Chen, Yang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms, often referred to as attentive GNNs, have emerged as a prominent paradigm in advanced GNN models in recent years. However, our understanding of the critical process of scoring neighbor nodes remains limited, leading to the underperformance of many existing attentive GNNs. In this paper, we unify the scoring functions of current attentive GNNs and propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KAA), which integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture into the scoring process. KAA enhances the performance of scoring functions across the board and can be applied to nearly all existing attentive GNNs. To compare the expressive power of KAA with other scoring functions, we introduce Maximum Ranking Distance (MRD) to quantitatively estimate their upper bounds in ranking errors for node importance. Our analysis reveals that, under limited parameters and constraints on width and depth, both linear transformation-based and MLP-based scoring functions exhibit finite expressive power. In contrast, our proposed KAA, even with a single-layer KAN parameterized by zero-order B-spline functions, demonstrates nearly infinite expressive power. Extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level tasks using various backbone models show that KAA-enhanced scoring functions consistently outperform their original counterparts, achieving performance improvements of over 20% in some cases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vector representations have been pivotal in advancing natural language processing (NLP), with prior research focusing on embedding techniques for mathematical expressions using mathematically equivalent formulations. While effective, these approaches are constrained by the size and diversity of training data. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing E-Gen, a novel e-graph-based dataset generation scheme that synthesizes large and diverse mathematical expression datasets, surpassing prior methods in size and operator variety. Leveraging this dataset, we train embedding models using two strategies: (1) generating mathematically equivalent expressions, and (2) contrastive learning to explicitly group equivalent expressions. We evaluate these embeddings on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution mathematical language processing tasks, comparing them against prior methods. Finally, we demonstrate that our embedding-based approach outperforms state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on several tasks, underscoring the necessity of optimizing embedding methods for the mathematical data modality.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have opened promising avenues for steganography, which can securely protect sensitive information for individuals operating in hostile environments, such as journalists, activists, and whistleblowers. However, existing methods for generative steganography have significant limitations, particularly in scalability and their dependence on retraining diffusion models. We introduce PSyDUCK, a training-free, model-agnostic steganography framework specifically designed for latent diffusion models. PSyDUCK leverages controlled divergence and local mixing within the latent denoising process, enabling high-capacity, secure message embedding without compromising visual fidelity. Our method dynamically adapts embedding strength to balance accuracy and detectability, significantly improving upon existing pixel-space approaches. Crucially, PSyDUCK extends generative steganography to latent-space video diffusion models, surpassing previous methods in both encoding capacity and robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate PSyDUCK's superiority over state-of-the-art techniques, achieving higher transmission accuracy and lower detectability rates across diverse image and video datasets. By overcoming the key challenges associated with latent diffusion model architectures, PSyDUCK sets a new standard for generative steganography, paving the way for scalable, real-world steganographic applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Chen, Marco Cusumano-Towner, Brody Huval, Aleksei Petrenko, Jackson Hamburger, Vladlen Koltun, Philipp Kr\"ahenb\"uhl</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactive digital agents (IDAs) leverage APIs of stateful digital environments to perform tasks in response to user requests. While IDAs powered by instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) can react to feedback from interface invocations in multi-step exchanges, they have not been trained in their respective digital environments. Prior methods accomplish less than half of tasks in sophisticated benchmarks such as AppWorld. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains IDAs directly in their target environments. We formalize this training as a partially observable Markov decision process and derive LOOP, a data- and memory-efficient variant of proximal policy optimization. LOOP uses no value network and maintains exactly one copy of the underlying LLM in memory, making its implementation straightforward and as memory-efficient as fine-tuning a single LLM. A 32-billion-parameter agent trained with LOOP in the AppWorld environment outperforms the much larger OpenAI o1 agent by 9 percentage points (15% relative). To our knowledge, this is the first reported application of RL to IDAs that interact with a stateful, multi-domain, multi-app environment via direct API calls. Our analysis sheds light on the effectiveness of RL in this area, showing that the agent learns to consult the API documentation, avoid unwarranted assumptions, minimize confabulation, and recover from setbacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijia Zhao, Qing Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The causal bandit problem aims to sequentially learn the intervention that maximizes the expectation of a reward variable within a system governed by a causal graph. Most existing approaches assume prior knowledge of the graph structure, or impose unrealistically restrictive conditions on the graph. In this paper, we assume a Gaussian linear directed acyclic graph (DAG) over arms and the reward variable, and study the causal bandit problem when the graph structure is unknown. We identify backdoor adjustment sets for each arm using sequentially generated experimental and observational data during the decision process, which allows us to estimate causal effects and construct upper confidence bounds. By integrating estimates from both data sources, we develop a novel bandit algorithm, based on modified upper confidence bounds, to sequentially determine the optimal intervention. We establish both case-dependent and case-independent upper bounds on the cumulative regret for our algorithm, which improve upon the bounds of the standard multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our empirical study demonstrates its advantage over existing methods with respect to cumulative regret and computation time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengdi Liu, Zhangyang Gao, Hong Chang, Stan Z. Li, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how genes influence phenotype across species is a fundamental challenge in genetic engineering, which will facilitate advances in various fields such as crop breeding, conservation biology, and personalized medicine. However, current phenotype prediction models are limited to individual species and expensive phenotype labeling process, making the genotype-to-phenotype prediction a highly domain-dependent and data-scarce problem. To this end, we suggest taking images as morphological proxies, facilitating cross-species generalization through large-scale multimodal pretraining. We propose the first genotype-to-phenotype diffusion model (G2PDiffusion) that generates morphological images from DNA considering two critical evolutionary signals, i.e., multiple sequence alignments (MSA) and environmental contexts. The model contains three novel components: 1) a MSA retrieval engine that identifies conserved and co-evolutionary patterns; 2) an environment-aware MSA conditional encoder that effectively models complex genotype-environment interactions; and 3) an adaptive phenomic alignment module to improve genotype-phenotype consistency. Extensive experiments show that integrating evolutionary signals with environmental context enriches the model's understanding of phenotype variability across species, thereby offering a valuable and promising exploration into advanced AI-assisted genomic analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: The U.S. allocates nearly 18\% of its GDP to healthcare but experiences lower life expectancy and higher preventable death rates compared to other high-income nations. Hospitals struggle to predict critical outcomes such as mortality, ICU admission, and prolonged hospital stays. Traditional early warning systems, like NEWS and MEWS, rely on static variables and fixed thresholds, limiting their adaptability, accuracy, and personalization. We developed the Enhanced Transformer for Health Outcome Simulation (ETHOS), an AI model that tokenizes patient health timelines (PHTs) from EHRs and uses transformer-based architectures to predict future PHTs. The Adaptive Risk Estimation System (ARES) leverages ETHOS to compute dynamic, personalized risk probabilities for clinician-defined critical events. ARES also features a personalized explainability module that highlights key clinical factors influencing risk estimates. We evaluated ARES on the MIMIC-IV v2.2 dataset in emergency department settings, benchmarking its performance against traditional early warning systems and machine learning models. From 299,721 unique patients, 285,622 PHTs (60\% with hospital admissions) were processed, comprising over 357 million tokens. ETHOS outperformed benchmark models in predicting hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and prolonged stays, achieving superior AUC scores. Its risk estimates were robust across demographic subgroups, with calibration curves confirming model reliability. The explainability module provided valuable insights into patient-specific risk factors. ARES, powered by ETHOS, advances predictive healthcare AI by delivering dynamic, real-time, personalized risk estimation with patient-specific explainability. Its adaptability and accuracy offer a transformative tool for clinical decision-making, potentially improving patient outcomes and resource allocation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Flore Sentenac, Ilbin Lee, Csaba Szepesvari</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider what we call the offline-to-online learning setting, focusing on stochastic finite-armed bandit problems. In offline-to-online learning, a learner starts with offline data collected from interactions with an unknown environment in a way that is not under the learner's control. Given this data, the learner begins interacting with the environment, gradually improving its initial strategy as it collects more data to maximize its total reward. The learner in this setting faces a fundamental dilemma: if the policy is deployed for only a short period, a suitable strategy (in a number of senses) is the Lower Confidence Bound (LCB) algorithm, which is based on pessimism. LCB can effectively compete with any policy that is sufficiently "covered" by the offline data. However, for longer time horizons, a preferred strategy is the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, which is based on optimism. Over time, UCB converges to the performance of the optimal policy at a rate that is nearly the best possible among all online algorithms. In offline-to-online learning, however, UCB initially explores excessively, leading to worse short-term performance compared to LCB. This suggests that a learner not in control of how long its policy will be in use should start with LCB for short horizons and gradually transition to a UCB-like strategy as more rounds are played. This article explores how and why this transition should occur. Our main result shows that our new algorithm performs nearly as well as the better of LCB and UCB at any point in time. The core idea behind our algorithm is broadly applicable, and we anticipate that our results will extend beyond the multi-armed bandit setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Massimiliano Ciranni, Vito Paolo Pastore, Roberto Di Via, Enzo Tartaglione, Francesca Odone, Vittorio Murino</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning model effectiveness in classification tasks is often challenged by the quality and quantity of training data whenever they are affected by strong spurious correlations between specific attributes and target labels. This results in a form of bias affecting training data, which typically leads to unrecoverable weak generalization in prediction. This paper aims at facing this problem by leveraging bias amplification with generated synthetic data: we introduce Diffusing DeBias (DDB), a novel approach acting as a plug-in for common methods of unsupervised model debiasing exploiting the inherent bias-learning tendency of diffusion models in data generation. Specifically, our approach adopts conditional diffusion models to generate synthetic bias-aligned images, which replace the original training set for learning an effective bias amplifier model that we subsequently incorporate into an end-to-end and a two-step unsupervised debiasing approach. By tackling the fundamental issue of bias-conflicting training samples memorization in learning auxiliary models, typical of this type of techniques, our proposed method beats current state-of-the-art in multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating its potential as a versatile and effective tool for tackling bias in deep learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Longchao Da, Justin Turnau, Thirulogasankar Pranav Kutralingam, Alvaro Velasquez, Paulo Shakarian, Hua Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been explored and verified to be effective in solving decision-making tasks in various domains, such as robotics, transportation, recommender systems, etc. It learns from the interaction with environments and updates the policy using the collected experience. However, due to the limited real-world data and unbearable consequences of taking detrimental actions, the learning of RL policy is mainly restricted within the simulators. This practice guarantees safety in learning but introduces an inevitable sim-to-real gap in terms of deployment, thus causing degraded performance and risks in execution. There are attempts to solve the sim-to-real problems from different domains with various techniques, especially in the era with emerging techniques such as large foundations or language models that have cast light on the sim-to-real. This survey paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first taxonomy that formally frames the sim-to-real techniques from key elements of the Markov Decision Process (State, Action, Transition, and Reward). Based on the framework, we cover comprehensive literature from the classic to the most advanced methods including the sim-to-real techniques empowered by foundation models, and we also discuss the specialties that are worth attention in different domains of sim-to-real problems. Then we summarize the formal evaluation process of sim-to-real performance with accessible code or benchmarks. The challenges and opportunities are also presented to encourage future exploration of this direction. We are actively maintaining a repository to include the most up-to-date sim-to-real research work to help domain researchers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milton Nicol\'as Plasencia Palacios, Sebastiano Saccani, Gabriele Sgroi, Alexander Boudewijn, Luca Bortolussi</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic data has garnered attention as a Privacy Enhancing Technology (PET) in sectors such as healthcare and finance. When using synthetic data in practical applications, it is important to provide protection guarantees. In the literature, two family of approaches are proposed for tabular data: on the one hand, Similarity-based methods aim at finding the level of similarity between training and synthetic data. Indeed, a privacy breach can occur if the generated data is consistently too similar or even identical to the train data. On the other hand, Attack-based methods conduce deliberate attacks on synthetic datasets. The success rates of these attacks reveal how secure the synthetic datasets are.
  In this paper, we introduce a contrastive method that improves privacy assessment of synthetic datasets by embedding the data in a more representative space. This overcomes obstacles surrounding the multitude of data types and attributes. It also makes the use of intuitive distance metrics possible for similarity measurements and as an attack vector. In a series of experiments with publicly available datasets, we compare the performances of similarity-based and attack-based methods, both with and without use of the contrastive learning-based embeddings. Our results show that relatively efficient, easy to implement privacy metrics can perform equally well as more advanced metrics explicitly modeling conditions for privacy referred to by the GDPR.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated significant potential across various safety-critical applications, yet ensuring its robustness remains a key challenge. While adversarial robustness has been extensively studied in worst-case scenarios, probabilistic robustness (PR) offers a more practical perspective by quantifying the likelihood of failures under stochastic perturbations. This paper provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of PR, covering its formal definitions, evaluation and enhancement methods. We introduce a reformulated ''min-max'' optimisation framework for adversarial training specifically designed to improve PR. Furthermore, we explore the integration of PR verification evidence into system-level safety assurance, addressing challenges in translating DL model-level robustness to system-level claims. Finally, we highlight open research questions, including benchmarking PR evaluation methods, extending PR to generative AI tasks, and developing rigorous methodologies and case studies for system-level integration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evan Frick, Connor Chen, Joseph Tennyson, Tianle Li, Wei-Lin Chiang, Anastasios N. Angelopoulos, Ion Stoica</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) evaluations typically rely on aggregated metrics like accuracy or human preference, averaging across users and prompts. This averaging obscures user- and prompt-specific variations in model performance. To address this, we propose Prompt-to-Leaderboard (P2L), a method that produces leaderboards specific to a prompt. The core idea is to train an LLM taking natural language prompts as input to output a vector of Bradley-Terry coefficients which are then used to predict the human preference vote. The resulting prompt-dependent leaderboards allow for unsupervised task-specific evaluation, optimal routing of queries to models, personalization, and automated evaluation of model strengths and weaknesses. Data from Chatbot Arena suggest that P2L better captures the nuanced landscape of language model performance than the averaged leaderboard. Furthermore, our findings suggest that P2L's ability to produce prompt-specific evaluations follows a power law scaling similar to that observed in LLMs themselves. In January 2025, the router we trained based on this methodology achieved the #1 spot on the Chatbot Arena leaderboard. Our code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/lmarena/p2l.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilun Xu, Weili Nie, Arash Vahdat</p>
<p>Abstract: Sampling from diffusion models involves a slow iterative process that hinders their practical deployment, especially for interactive applications. To accelerate generation speed, recent approaches distill a multi-step diffusion model into a single-step student generator via variational score distillation, which matches the distribution of samples generated by the student to the teacher's distribution. However, these approaches use the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for distribution matching which is known to be mode seeking. In this paper, we generalize the distribution matching approach using a novel $f$-divergence minimization framework, termed $f$-distill, that covers different divergences with different trade-offs in terms of mode coverage and training variance. We derive the gradient of the $f$-divergence between the teacher and student distributions and show that it is expressed as the product of their score differences and a weighting function determined by their density ratio. This weighting function naturally emphasizes samples with higher density in the teacher distribution, when using a less mode-seeking divergence. We observe that the popular variational score distillation approach using the reverse-KL divergence is a special case within our framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that alternative $f$-divergences, such as forward-KL and Jensen-Shannon divergences, outperform the current best variational score distillation methods across image generation tasks. In particular, when using Jensen-Shannon divergence, $f$-distill achieves current state-of-the-art one-step generation performance on ImageNet64 and zero-shot text-to-image generation on MS-COCO.

<p>Abstract: The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a scientifically aligned manner.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential to accelerate drug discovery. However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing critical challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs in cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it impedes the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. To investigate these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses -- all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) equipped with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) leverage both their rich parametric knowledge and the dynamic, external knowledge to excel in tasks such as Question Answering. While RAG enhances MLLMs by grounding responses in query-relevant external knowledge, this reliance poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where misinformation or irrelevant knowledge is intentionally injected into external knowledge bases to manipulate model outputs to be incorrect and even harmful. To expose such vulnerabilities in multimodal RAG, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, a novel knowledge poisoning attack framework with two attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which injects query-specific misinformation in both text and images for targeted manipulation, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA) to provide false guidance during MLLM generation to elicit nonsensical responses across all queries. We evaluate our attacks across multiple tasks, models, and access settings, demonstrating that LPA successfully manipulates the MLLM to generate attacker-controlled answers, with a success rate of up to 56% on MultiModalQA. Moreover, GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single irrelevant knowledge injection. Our results highlight the urgent need for robust defenses against knowledge poisoning to safeguard multimodal RAG frameworks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present M2-omni, a cutting-edge, open-source omni-MLLM that achieves competitive performance to GPT-4o. M2-omni employs a unified multimodal sequence modeling framework, which empowers Large Language Models(LLMs) to acquire comprehensive cross-modal understanding and generation capabilities. Specifically, M2-omni can process arbitrary combinations of audio, video, image, and text modalities as input, generating multimodal sequences interleaving with audio, image, or text outputs, thereby enabling an advanced and interactive real-time experience. The training of such an omni-MLLM is challenged by significant disparities in data quantity and convergence rates across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a step balance strategy during pre-training to handle the quantity disparities in modality-specific data. Additionally, a dynamically adaptive balance strategy is introduced during the instruction tuning stage to synchronize the modality-wise training progress, ensuring optimal convergence. Notably, we prioritize preserving strong performance on pure text tasks to maintain the robustness of M2-omni's language understanding capability throughout the training process. To our best knowledge, M2-omni is currently a very competitive open-source model to GPT-4o, characterized by its comprehensive modality and task support, as well as its exceptional performance. We expect M2-omni will advance the development of omni-MLLMs, thus facilitating future research in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanzhou Ke, Shengfeng He, Xiao Li Wang, Bo Wang, Guoqing Chao, Yuanyang Zhang, Yi Xie, HeXing Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous successful approaches to missing modality completion rely on carefully designed fusion techniques and extensive pre-training on complete data, which can limit their generalizability in out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. In this study, we pose a new challenge: can we develop a missing modality completion model that is both resource-efficient and robust to OOD generalization? To address this, we present a training-free framework for missing modality completion that leverages large multimodal models (LMMs). Our approach, termed the "Knowledge Bridger", is modality-agnostic and integrates generation and ranking of missing modalities. By defining domain-specific priors, our method automatically extracts structured information from available modalities to construct knowledge graphs. These extracted graphs connect the missing modality generation and ranking modules through the LMM, resulting in high-quality imputations of missing modalities. Experimental results across both general and medical domains show that our approach consistently outperforms competing methods, including in OOD generalization. Additionally, our knowledge-driven generation and ranking techniques demonstrate superiority over variants that directly employ LMMs for generation and ranking, offering insights that may be valuable for applications in other domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-rich Graph Knowledge Bases (TG-KBs) have become increasingly crucial for answering queries by providing textual and structural knowledge. However, current retrieval methods often retrieve these two types of knowledge in isolation without considering their mutual reinforcement and some hybrid methods even bypass structural retrieval entirely after neighboring aggregation. To fill in this gap, we propose a Mixture of Structural-and-Textual Retrieval (MoR) to retrieve these two types of knowledge via a Planning-Reasoning-Organizing framework. In the Planning stage, MoR generates textual planning graphs delineating the logic for answering queries. Following planning graphs, in the Reasoning stage, MoR interweaves structural traversal and textual matching to obtain candidates from TG-KBs. In the Organizing stage, MoR further reranks fetched candidates based on their structural trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MoR in harmonizing structural and textual retrieval with insights, including uneven retrieving performance across different query logics and the benefits of integrating structural trajectories for candidate reranking.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nesryne Mejri, Enjie Ghorbel, Anis Kacem, Pavel Chernakov, Niki Foteinopoulou, Djamila Aouada</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the first fully unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework for unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD). The performance of UAD techniques degrades significantly in the presence of a domain shift, difficult to avoid in a real-world setting. While UDA has contributed to solving this issue in binary and multi-class classification, such a strategy is ill-posed in UAD. This might be explained by the unsupervised nature of the two tasks, namely, domain adaptation and anomaly detection. Herein, we first formulate this problem that we call the two-fold unsupervised curse. Then, we propose a pioneering solution to this curse, considered intractable so far, by assuming that anomalies are rare. Specifically, we leverage clustering techniques to identify a dominant cluster in the target feature space. Posed as the normal cluster, the latter is aligned with the source normal features. Concretely, given a one-class source set and an unlabeled target set composed mostly of normal data and some anomalies, we fit the source features within a hypersphere while jointly aligning them with the features of the dominant cluster from the target set. The paper provides extensive experiments and analysis on common adaptation benchmarks for anomaly detection, demonstrating the relevance of both the newly introduced paradigm and the proposed approach. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laziz Abdullaev, Tan M. Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across numerous language and vision tasks. While the self-attention mechanism, a core component of transformers, has proven capable of handling complex data patterns, it has been observed that the representational capacity of the attention matrix degrades significantly across transformer layers, thereby hurting its overall performance. In this work, we leverage the connection between self-attention computations and low-pass non-local means (NLM) smoothing filters and propose the Twicing Attention, a novel attention mechanism that uses kernel twicing procedure in nonparametric regression to alleviate the low-pass behavior of associated NLM smoothing with compelling theoretical guarantees and enhanced adversarial robustness. This approach enables the extraction and reuse of meaningful information retained in the residuals following the imperfect smoothing operation at each layer. Our proposed method offers two key advantages over standard self-attention: 1) a provably slower decay of representational capacity and 2) improved robustness and accuracy across various data modalities and tasks. We empirically demonstrate the performance gains of our model over baseline transformers on multiple tasks and benchmarks, including image classification and language modeling, on both clean and corrupted data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyang Liu, James Chenhao Liang, Ruixiang Tang, Yugyung Lee, Majid Rabbani, Sohail Dianat, Raghuveer Rao, Lifu Huang, Dongfang Liu, Qifan Wang, Cheng Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal instruction tuning has proven to be an effective strategy for achieving zero-shot generalization by fine-tuning pre-trained Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with instruction-following data. However, as the scale of LMMs continues to grow, fully fine-tuning these models has become highly parameter-intensive. Although Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have been introduced to reduce the number of tunable parameters, a significant performance gap remains compared to full fine-tuning. Furthermore, existing PEFT approaches are often highly parameterized, making them difficult to interpret and control. In light of this, we introduce Multimodal Representation Tuning (MRT), a novel approach that focuses on directly editing semantically rich multimodal representations to achieve strong performance and provide intuitive control over LMMs. Empirical results show that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines with significant performance gains (e.g., 1580.40 MME score) while requiring substantially fewer tunable parameters (e.g., 0.03% parameters). Additionally, we conduct experiments on editing instrumental tokens within multimodal representations, demonstrating that direct manipulation of these representations enables simple yet effective control over network behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qia Hu, Bo Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph sampling based Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) decouple the sampling from the forward and backward propagation during minibatch training, which exhibit good scalability in terms of layer depth and graph size. We propose HIS_GCNs, a hierarchical importance graph sampling based learning method. By constructing minibatches using sampled subgraphs, HIS_GCNs gives attention to the importance of both core and periphery nodes/edges in a scale-free training graph. Specifically, it preserves the centrum of the core to most minibatches, which maintains connectivity between periphery nodes, and samples periphery edges without core node interference, in order to keep more long chains composed entirely of low-degree nodes in the same minibatch. HIS_GCNs can maximize the discrete Ricci curvature (i.e., Ollivier-Ricci curvatures) of the edges in a subgraph that enables the preservation of important chains for information propagation, and can achieve a low node embedding variance and a high convergence speed. Diverse experiments on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with node classification tasks confirm superior performance of HIS_GCNs in both accuracy and training time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandre Alouadi, Baptiste Barreau, Laurent Carlier, Huy\^en Pham</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the generative capabilities of the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) approach for time series. The SB framework formulates time series synthesis as an entropic optimal interpolation transport problem between a reference probability measure on path space and a target joint distribution. This results in a stochastic differential equation over a finite horizon that accurately captures the temporal dynamics of the target time series. While the SB approach has been largely explored in fields like image generation, there is a scarcity of studies for its application to time series. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the SB method's robustness and generative performance. We benchmark it against state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series generation methods across diverse datasets, assessing its strengths, limitations, and capacity to model complex temporal dependencies. Our results offer valuable insights into the SB framework's potential as a versatile and robust tool for time series generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runze Wang, Mingqi Yang, Yanming Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional generalization capabilities, their ability to process graph data, such as molecular structures, remains limited. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Graph2Token, an efficient solution that aligns graph tokens to LLM tokens. The key idea is to represent a graph token with the LLM token vocabulary, without fine-tuning the LLM backbone. To achieve this goal, we first construct a molecule-text paired dataset from multisources, including CHEBI and HMDB, to train a graph structure encoder, which reduces the distance between graphs and texts representations in the feature space. Then, we propose a novel alignment strategy that associates a graph token with LLM tokens. To further unleash the potential of LLMs, we collect molecular IUPAC name identifiers, which are incorporated into the LLM prompts. By aligning molecular graphs as special tokens, we can activate LLM generalization ability to molecular few-shot learning. Extensive experiments on molecular classification and regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Graph2Token.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elizabeth Bates, Chris Hicks, Vasilios Mavroudis</p>
<p>Abstract: The last few years have seen an explosion of interest in autonomous cyber defence agents based on deep reinforcement learning. Such agents are typically trained in a cyber gym environment, also known as a cyber simulator, at least 32 of which have already been built. Most, if not all cyber gyms provide dense "scaffolded" reward functions which combine many penalties or incentives for a range of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Whilst dense rewards help alleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments, yielding seemingly effective strategies from relatively few environment steps; they are also known to bias the solutions an agent can find, potentially towards suboptimal solutions. This is especially a problem in complex cyber environments where policy weaknesses may not be noticed until exploited by an adversary. In this work we set out to evaluate whether sparse reward functions might enable training more effective cyber defence agents. Towards this goal we first break down several evaluation limitations in existing work by proposing a ground truth evaluation score that goes beyond the standard RL paradigm used to train and evaluate agents. By adapting a well-established cyber gym to accommodate our methodology and ground truth score, we propose and evaluate two sparse reward mechanisms and compare them with a typical dense reward. Our evaluation considers a range of network sizes, from 2 to 50 nodes, and both reactive and proactive defensive actions. Our results show that sparse rewards, particularly positive reinforcement for an uncompromised network state, enable the training of more effective cyber defence agents. Furthermore, we show that sparse rewards provide more stable training than dense rewards, and that both effectiveness and training stability are robust to a variety of cyber environment considerations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akash Yadav, Eulalia Nualart</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate time series prediction is challenging due to the inherent nonlinearity and sensitivity to initial conditions. We propose a novel approach that enhances neural network predictions through differential learning, which involves training models on both the original time series and its differential series. Specifically, we develop a differential long short-term memory (Diff-LSTM) network that uses a shared LSTM cell to simultaneously process both data streams, effectively capturing intrinsic patterns and temporal dynamics. Evaluated on the Mackey-Glass, Lorenz, and R\"ossler chaotic time series, as well as a real-world financial dataset from ACI Worldwide Inc., our results demonstrate that the Diff- LSTM network outperforms prevalent models such as recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and bidirectional and encoder-decoder LSTM networks in both short-term and long-term predictions. This framework offers a promising solution for enhancing time series prediction, even when comprehensive knowledge of the underlying dynamics of the time series is not fully available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hetarth Chopra, Vidhi Rambhia, Vikram Adve</p>
<p>Abstract: As specialized large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, model merging methods are being used to combine them to create a single multi-task model without requiring any additional data or training. However, these approaches fall short when the objective of merging is to increase the downstream model's performance on a particular task-specific benchmark. In this work, we propose LEWIS (Layer Wise Sparsity), a guided model-merging framework that uses activation-based layer importance to dynamically adjust layer-wise task-vector sparsity required for the merge process. LEWIS uses a calibration dataset to prioritize critical layers during the task-vector pruning process required for model merging. This approach guides existing merging methods by preserving essential layer-wise task-specific knowledge while ensuring the merged model performs the best at benchmarks resembling the calibration dataset. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LEWIS with performance improvements of code instruction-following and math-solving models created through model merging up to 4 percent and 11.3 percent, respectively, outperforming unguided data-less model merging approaches that use uniform-sparsity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Majed Luay, Siamak Layeghy, Seyedehfaezeh Hosseininoorbin, Mohanad Sarhan, Nour Moustafa, Marius Portmann</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the temporal analysis of NetFlow datasets for machine learning (ML)-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Although many previous studies have highlighted the critical role of temporal features, such as inter-packet arrival time and flow length/duration, in NIDS, the currently available NetFlow datasets for NIDS lack these temporal features. This study addresses this gap by creating and making publicly available a set of NetFlow datasets that incorporate these temporal features [1]. With these temporal features, we provide a comprehensive temporal analysis of NetFlow datasets by examining the distribution of various features over time and presenting time-series representations of NetFlow features. This temporal analysis has not been previously provided in the existing literature. We also borrowed an idea from signal processing, time frequency analysis, and tested it to see how different the time frequency signal presentations (TFSPs) are for various attacks. The results indicate that many attacks have unique patterns, which could help ML models to identify them more easily.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Pan, Chaozheng Wang, Zekai Wu, Qifan Wang, Min Zhang, Zenglin Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable accomplishments in practice. The success of these networks hinges on effective initialization methods, which are vital for ensuring stable and rapid convergence during training. Recently, initialization methods that maintain identity transition within layers have shown good efficiency in network training. These techniques (e.g., Fixup) set specific weights to zero to achieve identity control. However, settings of remaining weight (e.g., Fixup uses random values to initialize non-zero weights) will affect the inductive bias that is achieved only by a zero weight, which may be harmful to training. Addressing this concern, we introduce fully identical initialization (IDInit), a novel method that preserves identity in both the main and sub-stem layers of residual networks. IDInit employs a padded identity-like matrix to overcome rank constraints in non-square weight matrices. Furthermore, we show the convergence problem of an identity matrix can be solved by stochastic gradient descent. Additionally, we enhance the universality of IDInit by processing higher-order weights and addressing dead neuron problems. IDInit is a straightforward yet effective initialization method, with improved convergence, stability, and performance across various settings, including large-scale datasets and deep models.</p>

<p>Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse tasks are now well-established, yet their effective deployment necessitates careful hyperparameter optimization. Through extensive empirical studies involving grid searches across diverse configurations, we discover universal scaling laws governing these hyperparameters: optimal learning rate follows a power-law relationship with both model parameters and data sizes, while optimal batch size scales primarily with data sizes. Our analysis reveals a convex optimization landscape for hyperparameters under fixed models and data size conditions. This convexity implies an optimal hyperparameter plateau. We contribute a universal, plug-and-play optimal hyperparameter tool for the community. Its estimated values on the test set are merely 0.09% away from the globally optimal LLM performance found via an exhaustive search. These laws demonstrate remarkable robustness across variations in model sparsity, training data distribution, and model shape. To our best known, this is the first work that unifies different model shapes and structures, such as Mixture-of-Experts models and dense transformers, as well as establishes optimal hyperparameter scaling laws across diverse data distributions. This exhaustive optimization process demands substantial computational resources, utilizing nearly one million NVIDIA H800 GPU hours to train 3,700 LLMs of varying sizes and hyperparameters from scratch and consuming approximately 100 trillion tokens in total. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we will progressively release all loss measurements and model checkpoints through our designated repository https://step-law.github.io/</p>

<p>Abstract: In this technical report, we tackle the challenges of training large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, focusing on overcoming cost inefficiency and resource limitations prevalent in such systems. To address these issues, we present two differently sized MoE large language models (LLMs), namely Ling-Lite and Ling-Plus (referred to as "Bailing" in Chinese, spelled B\v{a}il\'ing in Pinyin). Ling-Lite contains 16.8 billion parameters with 2.75 billion activated parameters, while Ling-Plus boasts 290 billion parameters with 28.8 billion activated parameters. Both models exhibit comparable performance to leading industry benchmarks. This report offers actionable insights to improve the efficiency and accessibility of AI development in resource-constrained settings, promoting more scalable and sustainable technologies. Specifically, to reduce training costs for large-scale MoE models, we propose innovative methods for (1) optimization of model architecture and training processes, (2) refinement of training anomaly handling, and (3) enhancement of model evaluation efficiency. Additionally, leveraging high-quality data generated from knowledge graphs, our models demonstrate superior capabilities in tool use compared to other models. Ultimately, our experimental findings demonstrate that a 300B MoE LLM can be effectively trained on lower-performance devices while achieving comparable performance to models of a similar scale, including dense and MoE models. Compared to high-performance devices, utilizing a lower-specification hardware system during the pre-training phase demonstrates significant cost savings, reducing computing costs by approximately 20%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengqi Zheng, Haiyan Yin, Jianda Chen, Terence Ng, Yew-Soon Ong, Ivor Tsang</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is essential for developing agents that can learn, adapt, and accumulate knowledge over time. However, a fundamental challenge persists as agents must strike a delicate balance between plasticity, which enables rapid skill acquisition, and stability, which ensures long-term knowledge retention while preventing catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we introduce SSDE, a novel structure-based approach that enhances plasticity through a fine-grained allocation strategy with Structured Sparsity and Dormant-guided Exploration. SSDE decomposes the parameter space into forward-transfer (frozen) parameters and task-specific (trainable) parameters. Crucially, these parameters are allocated by an efficient co-allocation scheme under sparse coding, ensuring sufficient trainable capacity for new tasks while promoting efficient forward transfer through frozen parameters. However, structure-based methods often suffer from rigidity due to the accumulation of non-trainable parameters, limiting exploration and adaptability. To address this, we further introduce a sensitivity-guided neuron reactivation mechanism that systematically identifies and resets dormant neurons, which exhibit minimal influence in the sparse policy network during inference. This approach effectively enhance exploration while preserving structural efficiency. Extensive experiments on the CW10-v1 Continual World benchmark demonstrate that SSDE achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching a success rate of 95%, surpassing prior methods significantly in both plasticity and stability trade-offs (code is available at: https://github.com/chengqiArchy/SSDE).</p>

The introduction of RLVR not only improves the model's overall performance on in-distribution data but also demonstrates superior robustness when evaluated on out-of-distribution datasets. More importantly, the improved reasoning capability enables clear analysis of the contributions of different modalities, particularly visual and audio information, in the emotion recognition process.

<p>Abstract: Optimal allocation of scarce resources is a common problem for decision makers faced with choosing a limited number of locations for intervention. Spatiotemporal prediction models could make such decisions data-driven. A recent performance metric called fraction of best possible reach (BPR) measures the impact of using a model's recommended size K subset of sites compared to the best possible top-K in hindsight. We tackle two open problems related to BPR. First, we explore how to rank all sites numerically given a probabilistic model that predicts event counts jointly across sites. Ranking via the per-site mean is suboptimal for BPR. Instead, we offer a better ranking for BPR backed by decision theory. Second, we explore how to train a probabilistic model's parameters to maximize BPR. Discrete selection of K sites implies all-zero parameter gradients which prevent standard gradient training. We overcome this barrier via advances in perturbed optimizers. We further suggest a training objective that combines likelihood with a decision-aware BPR constraint to deliver high-quality top-K rankings as well as good forecasts for all sites. We demonstrate our approach on two where-to-intervene applications: mitigating opioid-related fatal overdoses for public health and monitoring endangered wildlife.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaditya K. Singh, Ted Moskovitz, Sara Dragutinovic, Felix Hill, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Andrew M. Saxe</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful ability that emerges in transformer models, enabling them to learn from context without weight updates. Recent work has established emergent ICL as a transient phenomenon that can sometimes disappear after long training times. In this work, we sought a mechanistic understanding of these transient dynamics. Firstly, we find that, after the disappearance of ICL, the asymptotic strategy is a remarkable hybrid between in-weights and in-context learning, which we term "context-constrained in-weights learning" (CIWL). CIWL is in competition with ICL, and eventually replaces it as the dominant strategy of the model (thus leading to ICL transience). However, we also find that the two competing strategies actually share sub-circuits, which gives rise to cooperative dynamics as well. For example, in our setup, ICL is unable to emerge quickly on its own, and can only be enabled through the simultaneous slow development of asymptotic CIWL. CIWL thus both cooperates and competes with ICL, a phenomenon we term "strategy coopetition." We propose a minimal mathematical model that reproduces these key dynamics and interactions. Informed by this model, we were able to identify a setup where ICL is truly emergent and persistent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran You, Tong Geng, Yongan Zhang, Ang Li, Yingyan Celine Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art graph learning model. However, it can be notoriously challenging to inference GCNs over large graph datasets, limiting their application to large real-world graphs and hindering the exploration of deeper and more sophisticated GCN graphs. This is because real-world graphs can be extremely large and sparse. Furthermore, the node degree of GCNs tends to follow the power-law distribution and therefore have highly irregular adjacency matrices, resulting in prohibitive inefficiencies in both data processing and movement and thus substantially limiting the achievable GCN acceleration efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes a GCN algorithm and accelerator Co-Design framework dubbed GCoD which can largely alleviate the aforementioned GCN irregularity and boost GCNs' inference efficiency. Specifically, on the algorithm level, GCoD integrates a split and conquer GCN training strategy that polarizes the graphs to be either denser or sparser in local neighborhoods without compromising the model accuracy, resulting in graph adjacency matrices that (mostly) have merely two levels of workload and enjoys largely enhanced regularity and thus ease of acceleration. On the hardware level, we further develop a dedicated two-pronged accelerator with a separated engine to process each of the aforementioned denser and sparser workloads, further boosting the overall utilization and acceleration efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that our GCoD consistently reduces the number of off-chip accesses, leading to speedups of 15286x, 294x, 7.8x, and 2.5x as compared to CPUs, GPUs, and prior-art GCN accelerators including HyGCN and AWB-GCN, respectively, while maintaining or even improving the task accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Schmidt</p>
<p>Abstract: High complexity models are notorious in machine learning for overfitting, a phenomenon in which models well represent data but fail to generalize an underlying data generating process. A typical procedure for circumventing overfitting computes empirical risk on a holdout set and halts once (or flags that/when) it begins to increase. Such practice often helps in outputting a well-generalizing model, but justification for why it works is primarily heuristic.
  We discuss the overfitting problem and explain why standard asymptotic and concentration results do not hold for evaluation with training data. We then proceed to introduce and argue for a hypothesis test by means of which both model performance may be evaluated using training data, and overfitting quantitatively defined and detected. We rely on said concentration bounds which guarantee that empirical means should, with high probability, approximate their true mean to conclude that they should approximate each other. We stipulate conditions under which this test is valid, describe how the test may be used for identifying overfitting, articulate a further nuance according to which distributional shift may be flagged, and highlight an alternative notion of learning which usefully captures generalization in the absence of uniform PAC guarantees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vinoth Nandakumar, Qiang Qu, Peng Mi, Tongliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have reinvigorated interest in their application to natural language processing tasks, particularly with the development of more efficient and parallelizable variants known as state space models (SSMs), which have shown competitive performance against transformer models while maintaining a lower memory footprint. While RNNs and SSMs (e.g., Mamba) have been empirically more successful than rule-based systems based on n-gram models, a rigorous theoretical explanation for this success has not yet been developed, as it is unclear how these models encode the combinatorial rules that govern the next-word prediction task. In this paper, we construct state space language models that can solve the next-word prediction task for languages generated from n-gram rules, thereby showing that the former are more expressive. Our proof shows how SSMs can encode n-gram rules using new theoretical results on their memorization capacity, and demonstrates how their context window can be controlled by restricting the spectrum of the state transition matrix. We conduct experiments with a small dataset generated from n-gram rules to show how our framework can be applied to SSMs and RNNs obtained through gradient-based optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Souradeep Dutta, Michele Caprio, Vivian Lin, Matthew Cleaveland, Kuk Jin Jang, Ivan Ruchkin, Oleg Sokolsky, Insup Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: A particularly challenging problem in AI safety is providing guarantees on the behavior of high-dimensional autonomous systems. Verification approaches centered around reachability analysis fail to scale, and purely statistical approaches are constrained by the distributional assumptions about the sampling process. Instead, we pose a distributionally robust version of the statistical verification problem for black-box systems, where our performance guarantees hold over a large family of distributions. This paper proposes a novel approach based on uncertainty quantification using concepts from imprecise probabilities. A central piece of our approach is an ensemble technique called Imprecise Neural Networks, which provides the uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we solve the allied problem of exploring the input set using active learning. The active learning uses an exhaustive neural-network verification tool Sherlock to collect samples. An evaluation on multiple physical simulators in the openAI gym Mujoco environments with reinforcement-learned controllers demonstrates that our approach can provide useful and scalable guarantees for high-dimensional systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marien Renaud, Jiaming Liu, Valentin de Bortoli, Andr\'es Almansa, Ulugbek S. Kamilov</p>
<p>Abstract: Posterior sampling has been shown to be a powerful Bayesian approach for solving imaging inverse problems. The recent plug-and-play unadjusted Langevin algorithm (PnP-ULA) has emerged as a promising method for Monte Carlo sampling and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation by combining physical measurement models with deep-learning priors specified using image denoisers. However, the intricate relationship between the sampling distribution of PnP-ULA and the mismatched data-fidelity and denoiser has not been theoretically analyzed. We address this gap by proposing a posterior-L2 pseudometric and using it to quantify an explicit error bound for PnP-ULA under mismatched posterior distribution. We numerically validate our theory on several inverse problems such as sampling from Gaussian mixture models and image deblurring. Our results suggest that the sensitivity of the sampling distribution of PnP-ULA to a mismatch in the measurement model and the denoiser can be precisely characterized.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zherui Chen, Yuchen Lu, Hao Wang, Yizhou Liu, Tongyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We initiate the study of utilizing Quantum Langevin Dynamics (QLD) to solve optimization problems, particularly those non-convex objective functions that present substantial obstacles for traditional gradient descent algorithms. Specifically, we examine the dynamics of a system coupled with an infinite heat bath. This interaction induces both random quantum noise and a deterministic damping effect to the system, which nudge the system towards a steady state that hovers near the global minimum of objective functions. We theoretically prove the convergence of QLD in convex landscapes, demonstrating that the average energy of the system can approach zero in the low temperature limit with an exponential decay rate correlated with the evolution time. Numerically, we first show the energy dissipation capability of QLD by retracing its origins to spontaneous emission. Furthermore, we conduct detailed discussion of the impact of each parameter. Finally, based on the observations when comparing QLD with classical Fokker-Plank-Smoluchowski equation, we propose a time-dependent QLD by making temperature and $\hbar$ time-dependent parameters, which can be theoretically proven to converge better than the time-independent case and also outperforms a series of state-of-the-art quantum and classical optimization algorithms in many non-convex landscapes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evelyn Mannix, Howard Bondell</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the early weaknesses identified in deep neural networks trained for image classification tasks was their inability to provide low confidence predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) data that was significantly different from the in-distribution (ID) data used to train them. Representation learning, where neural networks are trained in specific ways that improve their ability to detect OOD examples, has emerged as a promising solution. However, these approaches require long training times and can add additional overhead to detect OOD examples. Recent developments in Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation models$\unicode{x2013}$large networks trained on large and diverse datasets with self-supervised approaches$\unicode{x2013}$also show strong performance in OOD detection, and could address these challenges. This paper presents Mixture of Exemplars (MoLAR), an efficient approach to tackling OOD detection challenges that is designed to maximise the benefit of training a classifier with a high quality, frozen, pretrained foundation model backbone. MoLAR provides strong OOD performance when only comparing the similarity of OOD examples to the exemplars, a small set of images chosen to be representative of the dataset, leading to up to 30 times faster OOD detection inference over other methods that provide best performance when the full ID dataset is used. In some cases, only using these exemplars actually improves performance with MoLAR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the improved OOD detection performance of MoLAR in comparison to comparable approaches in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, and code is available at github.com/emannix/molar-mixture-of-exemplars.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brecht Evens, Puya Latafat, Panagiotis Patrinos</p>
<p>Abstract: The Chambolle-Pock algorithm (CPA), also known as the primal-dual hybrid gradient method, has gained popularity over the last decade due to its success in solving large-scale convex structured problems. This work extends its convergence analysis for problems with varying degrees of (non)monotonicity, quantified through a so-called oblique weak Minty condition on the associated primal-dual operator. Our results reveal novel stepsize and relaxation parameter ranges which do not only depend on the norm of the linear mapping, but also on its other singular values. In particular, in nonmonotone settings, in addition to the classical stepsize conditions, extra bounds on the stepsizes and relaxation parameters are required. On the other hand, in the strongly monotone setting, the relaxation parameter is allowed to exceed the classical upper bound of two. Moreover, we build upon the recently introduced class of semimonotone operators, providing sufficient convergence conditions for CPA when the individual operators are semimonotone. Since this class of operators encompasses traditional operator classes including (hypo)- and co(hypo)-monotone operators, this analysis recovers and extends existing results for CPA. Tightness of the proposed stepsize ranges is demonstrated through several examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyed A. Esmaeili, Suho Shin, Aleksandrs Slivkins</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by applications such as online labor markets we consider a variant of the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem where we have a collection of arms representing strategic agents with different performance characteristics. The platform (principal) chooses an agent in each round to complete a task. Unlike the standard setting, when an arm is pulled it can modify its reward by absorbing it or improving it at the expense of a higher cost. The principle has to solve a mechanism design problem to incentivize the arms to give their best performance. However, since even with an effective mechanism agents may still deviate from rational behavior, the principal wants a robust algorithm that also gives a non-vacuous guarantee on the total accumulated rewards under non-equilibrium behavior. In this paper, we introduce a class of bandit algorithms that meet the two objectives of performance incentivization and robustness simultaneously. We do this by identifying a collection of intuitive properties that a bandit algorithm has to satisfy to achieve these objectives. Finally, we show that settings where the principal has no information about the arms' performance characteristics can be handled by combining ideas from second price auctions with our algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Wang, Hefei Ling, Yingwei Li, Qihao Liu, Ruoxi Jia, Ning Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: In response to the rapidly evolving nature of adversarial attacks against visual classifiers on a monthly basis, numerous defenses have been proposed to generalize against as many known attacks as possible. However, designing a defense method that generalizes to all types of attacks is not realistic because the environment in which defense systems operate is dynamic and comprises various unique attacks that emerge as time goes on. A well-matched approach to the dynamic environment lies in a defense system that continuously collects adversarial data online to quickly improve itself. Therefore, we put forward a practical defense deployment against a challenging threat model and propose, for the first time, the Continual Adversarial Defense (CAD) framework that adapts to attack sequences under four principles: (1)~continual adaptation to new attacks without catastrophic forgetting, (2)~few-shot adaptation, (3)~memory-efficient adaptation, and (4)~high accuracy on both clean and adversarial data. We explore and integrate cutting-edge continual learning, few-shot learning, and ensemble learning techniques to qualify the principles. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach against multiple stages of modern adversarial attacks and demonstrate significant improvements over numerous baseline methods. In particular, CAD is capable of quickly adapting with minimal budget and a low cost of defense failure while maintaining good performance against previous attacks. Our research sheds light on a brand-new paradigm for continual defense adaptation against dynamic and evolving attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Loris Belcastro, Riccardo Cantini, Fabrizio Marozzo, Domenico Talia, Paolo Trunfio</p>
<p>Abstract: In the digital era, the prevalence of depressive symptoms expressed on social media has raised serious concerns, necessitating advanced methodologies for timely detection. This paper addresses the challenge of interpretable depression detection by proposing a novel methodology that effectively combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and conversational agents like ChatGPT. In our methodology, explanations are achieved by integrating BERTweet, a Twitter-specific variant of BERT, into a novel self-explanatory model, namely BERT-XDD, capable of providing both classification and explanations via masked attention. The interpretability is further enhanced using ChatGPT to transform technical explanations into human-readable commentaries. By introducing an effective and modular approach for interpretable depression detection, our methodology can contribute to the development of socially responsible digital platforms, fostering early intervention and support for mental health challenges under the guidance of qualified healthcare professionals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nuojin Cheng, Stephen Becker</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a widely used technique for optimizing black-box functions, with Expected Improvement (EI) being the most commonly utilized acquisition function in this domain. While EI is often viewed as distinct from other information-theoretic acquisition functions, such as entropy search (ES) and max-value entropy search (MES), our work reveals that EI can be considered a special case of MES when approached through variational inference (VI). In this context, we have developed the Variational Entropy Search (VES) methodology and the VES-Gamma algorithm, which adapts EI by incorporating principles from information-theoretic concepts. The efficacy of VES-Gamma is demonstrated across a variety of test functions and read datasets, highlighting its theoretical and practical utilities in Bayesian optimization scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Zhang, Yi Zhou, Shaofeng Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper provides the first tight convergence analyses for RMSProp and Adam in non-convex optimization under the most relaxed assumptions of coordinate-wise generalized smoothness and affine noise variance. We first analyze RMSProp, which is a special case of Adam with adaptive learning rates but without first-order momentum. Specifically, to solve the challenges due to dependence among adaptive update, unbounded gradient estimate and Lipschitz constant, we demonstrate that the first-order term in the descent lemma converges and its denominator is upper bounded by a function of gradient norm. Based on this result, we show that RMSProp with proper hyperparameters converges to an $\epsilon$-stationary point with an iteration complexity of $\mathcal O(\epsilon^{-4})$. We then generalize our analysis to Adam, where the additional challenge is due to a mismatch between the gradient and first-order momentum. We develop a new upper bound on the first-order term in the descent lemma, which is also a function of the gradient norm. We show that Adam with proper hyperparameters converges to an $\epsilon$-stationary point with an iteration complexity of $\mathcal O(\epsilon^{-4})$. Our complexity results for both RMSProp and Adam match with the complexity lower bound established in \cite{arjevani2023lower}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingran Chen, Navid NaderiAlizadeh, Alejandro Ribeiro, Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the challenge of sampling and remote estimation for autoregressive Markovian processes in a multi-hop wireless network with statistically-identical agents. Agents cache the most recent samples from others and communicate over wireless collision channels governed by an underlying graph topology. Our goal is to minimize time-average estimation error and/or age of information with decentralized scalable sampling and transmission policies, considering both oblivious (where decision-making is independent of the physical processes) and non-oblivious policies (where decision-making depends on physical processes). We prove that in oblivious policies, minimizing estimation error is equivalent to minimizing the age of information. The complexity of the problem, especially the multi-dimensional action spaces and arbitrary network topologies, makes theoretical methods for finding optimal transmission policies intractable. We optimize the policies using a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, where each agent employs a permutation-equivariant graph neural network architecture. Theoretically, we prove that our proposed framework exhibits desirable transferability properties, allowing transmission policies trained on small- or moderate-size networks to be executed effectively on large-scale topologies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) Our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) The trained policies are transferable to larger networks, and their performance gains increase with the number of agents; (iii) The training procedure withstands non-stationarity even if we utilize independent learning techniques; and, (iv) Recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity in independent learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachid Karami, Sheng-Chun Kao, Hyoukjun Kwon</p>
<p>Abstract: Among ML operators today, GEneralMatrix Multiplication (GEMM)-based operators are known to be key operators that build the main backbone of ML models. As their computational overhead dominates the overall execution time (e.g., 42.8% - 96.6% in our results), GEMM operators have been the prime optimization targets for fast ML inference. This led to advanced GPUs and accelerators available today, which provided significant boost in the GEMM performance compared to CPUs, aligned with the lesson from Amdahl's law. However, accelerating GEMM has significantly shifted the Amdahl's law's landscape for ML inference; due to the decreased GEMM execution time, the relative execution time of non-GEMM operators is not dominant. Although the importance of non-GEMM performance is increasing, we have little knowledge about the non-GEMM performance horizon in the latest hardware platforms and models. Therefore, to guide non-GEMM-oriented optimizations, we conduct a thorough performance analysis of 16 widely adopted ML models in Hugging Face and Torchvision on workstation and data center platforms with/without GPUs. We discover that non-GEMM performance bottleneck is a considerable issue across all the platforms and models, accounting for 11.3% to 73.6% of total latency, on average. The challenge significantly aggravates when we apply quantization, which is a common model compression technique, due to the boosted GEMM performance and extra non-GEMM operators for dequantization and requantization. To provide insights into non-GEMM optimization targets, we demystify the most dominant non-GEMM operators for each model and deployment software.We also show that widely adopted optimizations such as operator fusion do not completely address the non-GEMM performance bottleneck, where non-GEMM operators still account for 15% to 48% of total latency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sairamvinay Vijayaraghavan, Prasant Mohapatra</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable Recommender Systems is an important field of study which provides reasons behind the suggested recommendations. Explanations with recommender systems are useful for developers while debugging anomalies within the system and for consumers while interpreting the model's effectiveness in capturing their true preferences towards items. However, most of the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) explainable recommenders could not retain their explanation capability under noisy circumstances and moreover are not generalizable across different datasets. The robustness of the explanations must be ensured so that certain malicious attackers do not manipulate any high-stake decision scenarios to their advantage, which could cause severe consequences affecting large groups of interest. In this work, we present a general framework for feature-aware explainable recommenders that can withstand external attacks and provide robust and generalized explanations. This paper presents a novel framework which could be utilized as an additional defense tool, preserving the global explainability when subject to model-based white box attacks. Our framework is simple to implement and supports different methods regardless of the internal model structure and intrinsic utility within any model. We experimented our framework on two architecturally different feature-based SOTA explainable algorithms by training them on three popular e-commerce datasets of increasing scales. We noticed that both the algorithms displayed an overall improvement in the quality and robustness of the global explainability under normal as well as noisy environments across all the datasets, indicating the flexibility and mutability of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Won-Gi Paeng, Daesuk Kwon, Kyungwon Jeong, Honggyo Suh</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we present a generalized formulation of the Transformer algorithm by reinterpreting its core mechanisms within the framework of Path Integral formalism. In this perspective, the attention mechanism is recast as a process that integrates all possible transition paths leading to future token states, with temporal evolution governed by the Feed-Forward Network. By systematically mapping each component of the Transformer to its counterpart in the Path Integral formulation, we obtain a more compact and efficient representation, in which the contextual information of a sequence is condensed into memory-like segments. These segments are recurrently processed across Transformer layers, enabling more effective long-term information retention. We validate the effectiveness of this approach through the Passkey retrieval task and a summarization task, demonstrating that the proposed method preserves historical information while exhibiting memory usage that scales linearly with sequence length. This contrasts with the non-linear memory growth typically observed in standard attention mechanisms. We expect that this quantum-inspired generalization of the Transformer architecture will open new avenues for enhancing both the efficiency and expressiveness of future Transformer models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sparse tensor operations are increasingly important in diverse applications such as social networks, deep learning, diagnosis, crime, and review analysis. However, a major obstacle in sparse tensor research is the lack of large-scale sparse tensor datasets. Another challenge lies in analyzing sparse tensor features, which are essential not only for understanding the nonzero pattern but also for selecting the most suitable storage format, decomposition algorithm, and reordering methods. However, due to the large size of real-world tensors, even extracting these features can be computationally expensive without careful optimization. To address these limitations, we have developed a smart sparse tensor generator that replicates key characteristics of real sparse tensors. Additionally, we propose efficient methods for extracting a comprehensive set of sparse tensor features. The effectiveness of our generator is validated through the quality of extracted features and the performance of decomposition on the generated tensors. Both the sparse tensor feature extractor and the tensor generator are open source with all the artifacts available at https://github.com/sparcityeu/FeaTensor and https://github.com/sparcityeu/GenTensor, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: $C^*$-algebra-valued kernels could pave the way for the next generation of kernel machines. To further our fundamental understanding of learning with $C^*$-algebraic kernels, we propose a new class of positive definite kernels based on the spectral truncation. We focus on kernels whose inputs and outputs are vectors or functions and generalize typical kernels by introducing the noncommutativity of the products appearing in the kernels. The noncommutativity induces interactions along the data function domain. We show that the proposed kernels fill the gap between existing separable and commutative kernels. We also propose a deep learning perspective to obtain a more flexible framework. The flexibility of the proposed class of kernels allows us to go beyond previous separable and commutative kernels, addressing two of the foremost issues regarding learning in vector-valued RKHSs, namely the choice of the kernel and the computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Koichi Saito, Dongjun Kim, Takashi Shibuya, Chieh-Hsin Lai, Zhi Zhong, Yuhta Takida, Yuki Mitsufuji</p>
<p>Abstract: Sound content creation, essential for multimedia works such as video games and films, often involves extensive trial-and-error, enabling creators to semantically reflect their artistic ideas and inspirations, which evolve throughout the creation process, into the sound. Recent high-quality diffusion-based Text-to-Sound (T2S) generative models provide valuable tools for creators. However, these models often suffer from slow inference speeds, imposing an undesirable burden that hinders the trial-and-error process. While existing T2S distillation models address this limitation through 1-step generation, the sample quality of $1$-step generation remains insufficient for production use. Additionally, while multi-step sampling in those distillation models improves sample quality itself, the semantic content changes due to their lack of deterministic sampling capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Sound Consistency Trajectory Models (SoundCTM), which allow flexible transitions between high-quality $1$-step sound generation and superior sound quality through multi-step deterministic sampling. This allows creators to efficiently conduct trial-and-error with 1-step generation to semantically align samples with their intention, and subsequently refine sample quality with preserving semantic content through deterministic multi-step sampling. To develop SoundCTM, we reframe the CTM training framework, originally proposed in computer vision, and introduce a novel feature distance using the teacher network for a distillation loss. For production-level generation, we scale up our model to 1B trainable parameters, making SoundCTM-DiT-1B the first large-scale distillation model in the sound community to achieve both promising high-quality 1-step and multi-step full-band (44.1kHz) generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhong Zheng, Haochen Zhang, Lingzhou Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider model-free federated reinforcement learning for tabular episodic Markov decision processes. Under the coordination of a central server, multiple agents collaboratively explore the environment and learn an optimal policy without sharing their raw data. Despite recent advances in federated Q-learning algorithms achieving near-linear regret speedup with low communication cost, existing algorithms only attain suboptimal regrets compared to the information bound. We propose a novel model-free federated Q-learning algorithm, termed FedQ-Advantage. Our algorithm leverages reference-advantage decomposition for variance reduction and operates under two distinct mechanisms: synchronization between the agents and the server, and policy update, both triggered by events. We prove that our algorithm not only requires a lower logarithmic communication cost but also achieves an almost optimal regret, reaching the information bound up to a logarithmic factor and near-linear regret speedup compared to its single-agent counterpart when the time horizon is sufficiently large.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eleanor Clifford, Adhithya Saravanan, Harry Langford, Cheng Zhang, Yiren Zhao, Robert Mullins, Ilia Shumailov, Jamie Hayes</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) models are expensive IP and business competitiveness often depends on keeping this IP confidential. This in turn restricts how these models are deployed; for example, it is unclear how to deploy a model on-device without inevitably leaking the underlying model. At the same time, confidential computing technologies such as multi-party computation or homomorphic encryption remain impractical for wide adoption. In this paper, we take a different approach and investigate the feasibility of ML-specific mechanisms that deter unauthorized model use by restricting the model to only be usable on specific hardware, making adoption on unauthorized hardware inconvenient. That way, even if IP is compromised, it cannot be trivially used without specialised hardware or major model adjustment. In a sense, we seek to enable cheap \emph{locking of machine learning models into specific hardware}. We demonstrate that \emph{locking} mechanisms are feasible by either targeting efficiency of model representations, making such models incompatible with quantization, or tying the model's operation to specific characteristics of hardware, such as the number of clock cycles for arithmetic operations. We demonstrate that locking comes with negligible overheads, while significantly restricting usability of the resultant model on unauthorized hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seokju Yun, Dongheon Lee, Youngmin Ro</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer, composed of self-attention and Feed-Forward Network, has revolutionized the landscape of network design across various vision tasks. While self-attention is extensively explored as a key factor in performance, FFN has received little attention. FFN is a versatile operator seamlessly integrated into nearly all AI models to effectively harness rich representations. Recent works also show that FFN functions like key-value memories. Thus, akin to the query-key-value mechanism within self-attention, FFN can be viewed as a memory network, where the input serves as query and the two projection weights operate as keys and values, respectively. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the importance lies in query-key-value framework itself for competitive performance. To verify this, we propose converting self-attention into a more FFN-like efficient token mixer with only convolutions while retaining query-key-value framework, namely FFNification. Specifically, FFNification replaces query-key-value interactions with large kernel convolutions and adopts GELU activation function instead of softmax. The derived token mixer, FFNified attention, serves as key-value memories for detecting locally distributed spatial patterns, and operates in the opposite dimension to the ConvNeXt block within each corresponding sub-operation of the query-key-value framework. Building upon the above two modules, we present a family of Fast-Forward Networks (FFNet). Despite being composed of only simple operators, FFNet outperforms sophisticated and highly specialized methods in each domain, with notable efficiency gains. These results validate our hypothesis, leading us to propose MetaMixer, a general mixer architecture that does not specify sub-operations within the query-key-value framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyun Cui, Ziyang Zhang, Wen Wu, Guangzhi Sun, Chao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in large language models raise the question of how alignment techniques will adapt as models become increasingly complex and humans will only be able to supervise them weakly. Weak-to-Strong mimics such a scenario where weak model supervision attempts to harness the full capabilities of a much stronger model. This work extends Weak-to-Strong to WeakS-to-Strong by exploring an ensemble of weak models which simulate the variability in human opinions. Confidence scores are estimated using a Bayesian approach to guide the WeakS-to-Strong generalization. Furthermore, we extend the application of WeakS-to-Strong from text classification tasks to text generation tasks where more advanced strategies are investigated for supervision. Moreover, direct preference optimization is applied to advance the student model's preference learning, beyond the basic learning framework of teacher forcing. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the reliability of a strong student model, showing potential for superalignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyed A. Esmaeili, Kevin Lim, Kshipra Bhawalkar, Zhe Feng, Di Wang, Haifeng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) will have significant impact on content creation platforms. In this paper, we study the dynamic competition between a GenAI and a human contributor. Unlike the human, the GenAI's content only improves when more contents are created by the human over time; however, GenAI has the advantage of generating content at a lower cost. We study the algorithmic problem in this dynamic competition model about how the human contributor can maximize her utility when competing against the GenAI for content generation over a set of topics. In time-sensitive content domains (e.g., news or pop music creation) where contents' value diminishes over time, we show that there is no polynomial time algorithm for finding the human's optimal (dynamic) strategy, unless the randomized exponential time hypothesis is false. Fortunately, we are able to design a polynomial time algorithm that naturally cycles between myopically optimizing over a short time window and pausing and provably guarantees an approximation ratio of $\frac{1}{2}$. We then turn to time-insensitive content domains where contents do not lose their value (e.g., contents on history facts). Interestingly, we show that this setting permits a polynomial time algorithm that maximizes the human's utility in the long run. Finally, we conduct simulations that demonstrate the advantage of our algorithms in comparison to a collection of baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranav Jeevan, Amit Sethi</p>
<p>Abstract: In contemporary computer vision applications, particularly image classification, architectural backbones pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet are commonly employed as feature extractors. Despite the widespread use of these pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), there remains a gap in understanding the performance of various resource-efficient backbones across diverse domains and dataset sizes. Our study systematically evaluates multiple lightweight, pre-trained CNN backbones under consistent training settings across a variety of datasets, including natural images, medical images, galaxy images, and remote sensing images. This comprehensive analysis aims to aid machine learning practitioners in selecting the most suitable backbone for their specific problem, especially in scenarios involving small datasets where fine-tuning a pre-trained network is crucial. Even though attention-based architectures are gaining popularity, we observed that they tend to perform poorly under low data finetuning tasks compared to CNNs. We also observed that some CNN architectures such as ConvNeXt, RegNet and EfficientNet performs well compared to others on a diverse set of domains consistently. Our findings provide actionable insights into the performance trade-offs and effectiveness of different backbones, facilitating informed decision-making in model selection for a broad spectrum of computer vision domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avital Shafran, Roei Schuster, Vitaly Shmatikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems respond to queries by retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge database and applying an LLM to the retrieved documents. We demonstrate that RAG systems that operate on databases with untrusted content are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks we call jamming. An adversary can add a single ``blocker'' document to the database that will be retrieved in response to a specific query and result in the RAG system not answering this query, ostensibly because it lacks relevant information or because the answer is unsafe.
  We describe and measure the efficacy of several methods for generating blocker documents, including a new method based on black-box optimization. Our method (1) does not rely on instruction injection, (2) does not require the adversary to know the embedding or LLM used by the target RAG system, and (3) does not employ an auxiliary LLM.
  We evaluate jamming attacks on several embeddings and LLMs and demonstrate that the existing safety metrics for LLMs do not capture their vulnerability to jamming. We then discuss defenses against blocker documents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaoteng Tan, Zikui Cai, M. Salman Asif</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep networks are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet conventional attack methods utilize static adversarial perturbations that induce fixed mispredictions. In this work, we exploit an overlooked property of adversarial perturbations--their dependence on image transforms--and introduce transform-dependent adversarial attacks. Unlike traditional attacks, our perturbations exhibit metamorphic properties, enabling diverse adversarial effects as a function of transformation parameters. We demonstrate that this transform-dependent vulnerability exists across different architectures (e.g., CNN and transformer), vision tasks (e.g., image classification and object detection), and a wide range of image transforms. Additionally, we show that transform-dependent perturbations can serve as a defense mechanism, preventing sensitive information disclosure when image enhancement transforms pose a risk of revealing private content. Through analysis in blackbox and defended model settings, we show that transform-dependent perturbations achieve high targeted attack success rates, outperforming state-of-the-art transfer attacks by 17-31% in blackbox scenarios. Our work introduces novel, controllable paradigm for adversarial attack deployment, revealing a previously overlooked vulnerability in deep networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julia Gaudio, Nirmit Joshi</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of exact community recovery in general, two-community block models, in the presence of node-attributed $side$ $information$. We allow for a very general side information channel for node attributes, and for pairwise (edge) observations, consider both Bernoulli and Gaussian matrix models, capturing the Stochastic Block Model, Submatrix Localization, and $\mathbb{Z}_2$-Synchronization as special cases. A recent work of Dreveton et al. 2024 characterized the information-theoretic limit of a very general exact recovery problem with side information. In this paper, we show algorithmic achievability in the above important cases by designing a simple but optimal spectral algorithm that incorporates side information (when present) along with the eigenvectors of the pairwise observation matrix. Using the powerful tool of entrywise eigenvector analysis of Abbe et al. 2020, we show that our spectral algorithm can mimic the so called $genie$-$aided$ $estimators$, where the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ genie-aided estimator optimally computes the estimate of the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ label, when all remaining labels are revealed by a genie. This perspective provides a unified understanding of the optimality of spectral algorithms for various exact recovery problems in a recent line of work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Liu, Jiayi Geng, Joshua C. Peterson, Ilia Sucholutsky, Thomas L. Griffiths</p>
<p>Abstract: In order for AI systems to communicate effectively with people, they must understand how we make decisions. However, people's decisions are not always rational, so the implicit internal models of human decision-making in Large Language Models (LLMs) must account for this. Previous empirical evidence seems to suggest that these implicit models are accurate -- LLMs offer believable proxies of human behavior, acting how we expect humans would in everyday interactions. However, by comparing LLM behavior and predictions to a large dataset of human decisions, we find that this is actually not the case: when both simulating and predicting people's choices, a suite of cutting-edge LLMs (GPT-4o & 4-Turbo, Llama-3-8B & 70B, Claude 3 Opus) assume that people are more rational than we really are. Specifically, these models deviate from human behavior and align more closely with a classic model of rational choice -- expected value theory. Interestingly, people also tend to assume that other people are rational when interpreting their behavior. As a consequence, when we compare the inferences that LLMs and people draw from the decisions of others using another psychological dataset, we find that these inferences are highly correlated. Thus, the implicit decision-making models of LLMs appear to be aligned with the human expectation that other people will act rationally, rather than with how people actually act.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Do Huu Dat, Do Duc Anh, Anh Tuan Luu, Wray Buntine</p>
<p>Abstract: While diffusion models excel at conditional generating high-quality images, prior works in discrete diffusion models were not evaluated on conditional long-text generation. In this work, we address the limitations of prior discrete diffusion models for conditional long-text generation, particularly in long sequence-to-sequence tasks such as abstractive summarization. Despite fast decoding speeds compared to autoregressive methods, previous diffusion models failed on the abstractive summarization task due to the incompatibility between the backbone architectures and the random noising process. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel semantic-aware noising process that enables Transformer backbones to handle long sequences effectively. Additionally, we propose CrossMamba, an adaptation of the Mamba model to the encoder-decoder paradigm, which integrates seamlessly with the random absorbing noising process. Our approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark summarization datasets: Gigaword, CNN/DailyMail, and Arxiv, outperforming existing discrete diffusion models on ROUGE metrics as well as possessing much faster speed in inference compared to autoregressive models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiong Zhang, Yan Shuo Tan, Jiahua Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional statistical methods need to be updated to work with modern distributed data storage paradigms. A common approach is the split-and-conquer framework, which involves learning models on local machines and averaging their parameter estimates. However, this does not work for the important problem of learning finite mixture models, because subpopulation indices on each local machine may be arbitrarily permuted (the "label switching problem"). Zhang and Chen (2022) proposed Mixture Reduction (MR) to address this issue, but MR remains vulnerable to Byzantine failure, whereby a fraction of local machines may transmit arbitrarily erroneous information. This paper introduces Distance Filtered Mixture Reduction (DFMR), a Byzantine tolerant adaptation of MR that is both computationally efficient and statistically sound. DFMR leverages the densities of local estimates to construct a robust filtering mechanism. By analysing the pairwise L2 distances between local estimates, DFMR identifies and removes severely corrupted local estimates while retaining the majority of uncorrupted ones. We provide theoretical justification for DFMR, proving its optimal convergence rate and asymptotic equivalence to the global maximum likelihood estimate under standard assumptions. Numerical experiments on simulated and real-world data validate the effectiveness of DFMR in achieving robust and accurate aggregation in the presence of Byzantine failure.</p>

<p>Abstract: RNA plays a pivotal role in diverse biological processes, ranging from gene regulation to catalysis. Recent advances in RNA design, such as RfamGen, Ribodiffusion and RDesign, have demonstrated promising results, with successful designs of functional sequences. However, RNA design remains challenging due to the inherent flexibility of RNA molecules and the scarcity of experimental data on tertiary and secondary structures compared to proteins. These limitations highlight the need for a more universal and comprehensive approach to RNA design that integrates diverse annotation information at the sequence level. To address these challenges, we propose RNACG (RNA Conditional Generator), a universal framework for RNA sequence design based on flow matching. RNACG supports diverse conditional inputs, including structural, functional, and family-specific annotations, and offers a modular design that allows users to customize the encoding network for specific tasks. By unifying sequence generation under a single framework, RNACG enables the integration of multiple RNA design paradigms, from family-specific generation to tertiary structure inverse folding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruihuai Liang, Bo Yang, Zhiwen Yu, Bin Guo, Xuelin Cao, M\'erouane Debbah, H. Vincent Poor, Chau Yuen</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative diffusion models, famous for their performance in image generation, are popular in various cross-domain applications. However, their use in the communication community has been mostly limited to auxiliary tasks like data modeling and feature extraction. These models hold greater promise for fundamental problems in network optimization compared to traditional machine learning methods. Discriminative deep learning often falls short due to its single-step input-output mapping and lack of global awareness of the solution space, especially given the complexity of network optimization's objective functions. In contrast, generative diffusion models can consider a broader range of solutions and exhibit stronger generalization by learning parameters that describe the distribution of the underlying solution space, with higher probabilities assigned to better solutions. We propose a new framework Diffusion Model-based Solution Generation (DiffSG), which leverages the intrinsic distribution learning capabilities of generative diffusion models to learn high-quality solution distributions based on given inputs. The optimal solution within this distribution is highly probable, allowing it to be effectively reached through repeated sampling. We validate the performance of DiffSG on several typical network optimization problems, including mixed-integer non-linear programming, convex optimization, and hierarchical non-convex optimization. Our results demonstrate that DiffSG outperforms existing baseline methods not only on in-domain inputs but also on out-of-domain inputs. In summary, we demonstrate the potential of generative diffusion models in tackling complex network optimization problems and outline a promising path for their broader application in the communication community.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuan-Lin Chen, Bhaskar D. Rao</p>
<p>Abstract: Localizing more sources than sensors with a sparse linear array (SLA) has long relied on minimizing a distance between two covariance matrices and recent algorithms often utilize semidefinite programming (SDP). Although deep neural network (DNN)-based methods offer new alternatives, they still depend on covariance matrix fitting. In this paper, we develop a novel methodology that estimates the co-array subspaces from a sample covariance for SLAs. Our methodology trains a DNN to learn signal and noise subspace representations that are invariant to the selection of bases. To learn such representations, we propose loss functions that gauge the separation between the desired and the estimated subspace. In particular, we propose losses that measure the length of the shortest path between subspaces viewed on a union of Grassmannians, and prove that it is possible for a DNN to approximate signal subspaces. The computation of learning subspaces of different dimensions is accelerated by a new batch sampling strategy called consistent rank sampling. The methodology is robust to array imperfections due to its geometry-agnostic and data-driven nature. In addition, we propose a fully end-to-end gridless approach that directly learns angles to study the possibility of bypassing subspace methods. Numerical results show that learning such subspace representations is more beneficial than learning covariances or angles. It outperforms conventional SDP-based methods such as the sparse and parametric approach (SPA) and existing DNN-based covariance reconstruction methods for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), snapshots, and source numbers for both perfect and imperfect arrays.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tristan Thrush, Christopher Potts, Tatsunori Hashimoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Quality pretraining data is often seen as the key to high-performance language models. However, progress in understanding pretraining data has been slow due to the costly pretraining runs required for data selection experiments. We present a framework that avoids these costs and selects high-quality pretraining data without any LLM training of our own. Our work is based on a simple observation: LLM losses on many pretraining texts are correlated with downstream benchmark performance, and selecting high-correlation documents is an effective pretraining data selection method. We build a new statistical framework for data selection centered around estimates of perplexity-benchmark correlations and perform data selection using a sample of 90 LLMs taken from the Open LLM Leaderboard on texts from tens of thousands of web domains. In controlled pretraining experiments at the 160M parameter scale on 8 benchmarks, our approach outperforms DSIR on every benchmark, while matching the best data selector found in DataComp-LM, a hand-engineered bigram classifier. We have now also updated this paper to include results from preregistered experiments with new pretraining data on an aggregation of 22 benchmarks up to the 1.4B scale, showing increasing improvements of our method over others with more scale.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jake Fawkes, Lucile Ter-Minassian, Desi Ivanova, Uri Shalit, Chris Holmes</p>
<p>Abstract: Merging datasets across institutions is a lengthy and costly procedure, especially when it involves private information. Data hosts may therefore want to prospectively gauge which datasets are most beneficial to merge with, without revealing sensitive information. For causal estimation this is particularly challenging as the value of a merge will depend not only on the reduction in epistemic uncertainty but also the improvement in overlap. To address this challenge, we introduce the first cryptographically secure information-theoretic approach for quantifying the value of a merge in the context of heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. We do this by evaluating the Expected Information Gain (EIG) and utilising multi-party computation to ensure it can be securely computed without revealing any raw data. As we demonstrate, this can be used with differential privacy (DP) to ensure privacy requirements whilst preserving more accurate computation than naive DP alone. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first privacy-preserving method for dataset acquisition tailored to causal estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our method on a range of simulated and realistic benchmarks. The code is available anonymously.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthias Lehmann, Philipp B. Cornelius, Fabian J. Sting</p>
<p>Abstract: The effect of large language models (LLMs) in education is debated: Previous research shows that LLMs can help as well as hurt learning. In two pre-registered and incentivized laboratory experiments, we find no effect of LLMs on overall learning outcomes. In exploratory analyses and a field study, we provide evidence that the effect of LLMs on learning outcomes depends on usage behavior. Students who substitute some of their learning activities with LLMs (e.g., by generating solutions to exercises) increase the volume of topics they can learn about but decrease their understanding of each topic. Students who complement their learning activities with LLMs (e.g., by asking for explanations) do not increase topic volume but do increase their understanding. We also observe that LLMs widen the gap between students with low and high prior knowledge. While LLMs show great potential to improve learning, their use must be tailored to the educational context and students' needs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Artem Dementyev, Chandan K. A. Reddy, Scott Wisdom, Navin Chatlani, John R. Hershey, Richard F. Lyon</p>
<p>Abstract: Low latency models are critical for real-time speech enhancement applications, such as hearing aids and hearables. However, the sub-millisecond latency space for resource-constrained hearables remains underexplored. We demonstrate speech enhancement using a computationally efficient minimum-phase FIR filter, enabling sample-by-sample processing to achieve mean algorithmic latency of 0.32 ms to 1.25 ms. With a single microphone, we observe a mean SI-SDRi of 4.1 dB. The approach shows generalization with a DNSMOS increase of 0.2 on unseen audio recordings. We use a lightweight LSTM-based model of 626k parameters to generate FIR taps. Using a real hardware implementation on a low-power DSP, our system can run with 376 MIPS and a mean end-to-end latency of 3.35 ms. In addition, we provide a comparison with existing low-latency spectral masking techniques. We hope this work will enable a better understanding of latency and can be used to improve the comfort and usability of hearables.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Liu, Geng Yuan, Weihao Zeng, Hao Tang, Wenbin Zhang, Xue Lin, XiaoLin Xu, Dong Huang, Yanzhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In research findings, co-deletion of the 1p/19q gene is associated with clinical outcomes in low-grade gliomas. The ability to predict 1p19q status is critical for treatment planning and patient follow-up. This study aims to utilize a specially MRI-based convolutional neural network for brain cancer detection. Although public networks such as RestNet and AlexNet can effectively diagnose brain cancers using transfer learning, the model includes quite a few weights that have nothing to do with medical images. As a result, the diagnostic results are unreliable by the transfer learning model. To deal with the problem of trustworthiness, we create the model from the ground up, rather than depending on a pre-trained model. To enable flexibility, we combined convolution stacking with a dropout and full connect operation, it improved performance by reducing overfitting. During model training, we also supplement the given dataset and inject Gaussian noise. We use three--fold cross-validation to train the best selection model. Comparing InceptionV3, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 fine-tuned with pre-trained models, our model produces better results. On an validation set of 125 codeletion vs. 31 not codeletion images, the proposed network achieves 96.37\% percent F1-score, 97.46\% percent precision, and 96.34\% percent recall when classifying 1p/19q codeletion and not codeletion images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianru Zhang, Peng Yang, Junliang Yu, Haixin Wang, Xingwei He, Siu-Ming Yiu, Hongzhi Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of smartphones and Location-Based Social Networks has led to a massive influx of spatio-temporal data, creating unparalleled opportunities for enhancing Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation systems. These advanced POI systems are crucial for enriching user experiences, enabling personalized interactions, and optimizing decision-making processes in the digital landscape. However, existing surveys tend to focus on traditional approaches and few of them delve into cutting-edge developments, emerging architectures, as well as security considerations in POI recommendations. To address this gap, our survey stands out by offering a comprehensive, up-to-date review of POI recommendation systems, covering advancements in models, architectures, and security aspects. We systematically examine the transition from traditional models to advanced techniques such as large language models. Additionally, we explore the architectural evolution from centralized to decentralized and federated learning systems, highlighting the improvements in scalability and privacy. Furthermore, we address the increasing importance of security, examining potential vulnerabilities and privacy-preserving approaches. Our taxonomy provides a structured overview of the current state of POI recommendation, while we also identify promising directions for future research in this rapidly advancing field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Zhang, Yuhan Liu, Haonan Chang, Liam Schramm, Abdeslam Boularias</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing a universal policy architecture that performs well across diverse robots and task configurations remains a key challenge. In this work, we address this by representing robot actions as sequential data and generating actions through autoregressive sequence modeling. Existing autoregressive architectures generate end-effector waypoints sequentially as word tokens in language modeling, which are limited to low-frequency control tasks. Unlike language, robot actions are heterogeneous and often include continuous values -- such as joint positions, 2D pixel coordinates, and end-effector poses -- which are not easily suited for language-based modeling. Based on this insight, we introduce a straightforward enhancement: we extend causal transformers' single-token prediction to support predicting a variable number of tokens in a single step through our Chunking Causal Transformer (CCT). This enhancement enables robust performance across diverse tasks of various control frequencies, greater efficiency by having fewer autoregression steps, and lead to a hybrid action sequence design by mixing different types of actions and using a different chunk size for each action type. Based on CCT, we propose the Autoregressive Policy (ARP) architecture, which solves manipulation tasks by generating hybrid action sequences. We evaluate ARP across diverse robotic manipulation environments, including Push-T, ALOHA, and RLBench, and show that ARP, as a universal architecture, matches or outperforms the environment-specific state-of-the-art in all tested benchmarks, while being more efficient in computation and parameter sizes. Videos of our real robot demonstrations, all source code and the pretrained models of ARP can be found at http://github.com/mlzxy/arp.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javier Marin</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing multi-hop reasoning in language models through Hamiltonian mechanics. We map reasoning chains in embedding spaces to Hamiltonian systems, defining a function that balances reasoning progression (kinetic energy) against question relevance (potential energy). Analyzing reasoning chains from a question-answering dataset reveals that valid reasoning shows lower Hamiltonian energy values, representing an optimal trade-off between information gathering and targeted answering. While our framework offers complex visualization and quantification methods, the claimed ability to "steer" or "improve" reasoning algorithms requires more rigorous empirical validation, as the connection between physical systems and reasoning remains largely metaphorical. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals consistent geometric patterns distinguishing valid reasoning, suggesting this physics-inspired approach offers promising diagnostic tools and new perspectives on reasoning processes in large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melanie Rieff, Fabian Holzberger, Oksana Lapina, Geir Ringstad, Lars Magnus Valnes, Bogna Warsza, Kent-Andre Mardal, Per Kristian Eide, Barbara Wohlmuth</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous work indicates evidence that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plays a crucial role in brain waste clearance processes, and that altered flow patterns are associated with various diseases of the central nervous system. In this study, we investigate the potential of deep learning to predict the distribution in human brain of a gadolinium-based CSF contrast agent (tracer) administered intrathecal. For this, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans taken at multiple time points before and after injection were utilized. We propose a U-net-based supervised learning model to predict pixel-wise signal increase at its peak after 24 hours. Performance is evaluated based on different tracer distribution stages provided during training, including predictions from baseline scans taken before injection. Our findings show that training with imaging data from only the first two hours post-injection yields tracer flow predictions comparable to models trained with additional later-stage scans. Validation against ventricular reflux gradings from neuroradiologists confirmed alignment with expert evaluations. These results demonstrate that deep learning-based methods for CSF flow prediction deserve more attention, as minimizing MR imaging without compromising clinical analysis could enhance efficiency, improve patient well-being, and lower healthcare costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianjian Li, Haoran Xu, Weiting Tan, Kenton Murray, Daniel Khashabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Data abundance across different domains exhibits a long-tailed distribution: few domains have abundant data, while most face data scarcity. Our work focuses on a multilingual setting, where available data is heavily skewed towards high-resource languages. Two common strategies to address this disparity are upsampling low-resource data (Temperature Sampling) and upweighting low-resource loss (Scalarization). These methods are often assumed to be equivalent, but this equivalence has not been rigorously established, prompting our investigation.
  Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify when these two methods are equivalent and when they diverge. We prove that they are equivalent under full gradient descent but differ under stochastic gradient descent due to differences in gradient variance. Specifically, Temperature Sampling exhibits lower variance in gradient estimation compared to Scalarization, leading to faster convergence but a higher risk of overfitting. Based on these insights, we propose Cooldown, a strategy that starts by heavily upsampling low-resource languages to accelerate convergence and gradually reduces the upsampling to prevent overfitting -- achieving the best of both worlds. Our method competes effectively with existing data re-weighting techniques while offering computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saemi Moon, Minjong Lee, Sangdon Park, Dongwoo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: As text-to-image diffusion models gain widespread commercial applications, there are increasing concerns about unethical or harmful use, including the unauthorized generation of copyrighted or sensitive content. Concept unlearning has emerged as a promising solution to these challenges by removing undesired and harmful information from the pre-trained model. However, the previous evaluations primarily focus on whether target concepts are removed while preserving image quality, neglecting the broader impacts such as unintended side effects. In this work, we propose Holistic Unlearning Benchmark (HUB), a comprehensive framework for evaluating unlearning methods across six key dimensions: faithfulness, alignment, pinpoint-ness, multilingual robustness, attack robustness, and efficiency. Our benchmark covers 33 target concepts, including 16,000 prompts per concept, spanning four categories: Celebrity, Style, Intellectual Property, and NSFW. Our investigation reveals that no single method excels across all evaluation criteria. By releasing our evaluation code and dataset, we hope to inspire further research in this area, leading to more reliable and effective unlearning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhong Zheng, Haochen Zhang, Lingzhou Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the gap-dependent bounds of two important algorithms for on-policy Q-learning for finite-horizon episodic tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs): UCB-Advantage (Zhang et al. 2020) and Q-EarlySettled-Advantage (Li et al. 2021). UCB-Advantage and Q-EarlySettled-Advantage improve upon the results based on Hoeffding-type bonuses and achieve the almost optimal $\sqrt{T}$-type regret bound in the worst-case scenario, where $T$ is the total number of steps. However, the benign structures of the MDPs such as a strictly positive suboptimality gap can significantly improve the regret. While gap-dependent regret bounds have been obtained for Q-learning with Hoeffding-type bonuses, it remains an open question to establish gap-dependent regret bounds for Q-learning using variance estimators in their bonuses and reference-advantage decomposition for variance reduction. We develop a novel error decomposition framework to prove gap-dependent regret bounds of UCB-Advantage and Q-EarlySettled-Advantage that are logarithmic in $T$ and improve upon existing ones for Q-learning algorithms. Moreover, we establish the gap-dependent bound for the policy switching cost of UCB-Advantage and improve that under the worst-case MDPs. To our knowledge, this paper presents the first gap-dependent regret analysis for Q-learning using variance estimators and reference-advantage decomposition and also provides the first gap-dependent analysis on policy switching cost for Q-learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoling Hu, Karthik Gopinath, Peirong Liu, Malte Hoffmann, Koen Van Leemput, Oula Puonti, Juan Eugenio Iglesias</p>
<p>Abstract: Over recent years, deep learning based image registration has achieved impressive accuracy in many domains, including medical imaging and, specifically, human neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the uncertainty estimation associated with these methods has been largely limited to the application of generic techniques (e.g., Monte Carlo dropout) that do not exploit the peculiarities of the problem domain, particularly spatial modeling. Here, we propose a principled way to propagate uncertainties (epistemic or aleatoric) estimated at the level of spatial location by these methods, to the level of global transformation models, and further to downstream tasks. Specifically, we justify the choice of a Gaussian distribution for the local uncertainty modeling, and then propose a framework where uncertainties spread across hierarchical levels, depending on the choice of transformation model. Experiments on publicly available data sets show that Monte Carlo dropout correlates very poorly with the reference registration error, whereas our uncertainty estimates correlate much better. Crucially, the results also show that uncertainty-aware fitting of transformations improves the registration accuracy of brain MRI scans. Finally, we illustrate how sampling from the posterior distribution of the transformations can be used to propagate uncertainties to downstream neuroimaging tasks.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11843">From Commands to Prompts: LLM-based Semantic File System for AIOS</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeru Shi, Kai Mei, Mingyu Jin, Yongye Su, Chaoji Zuo, Wenyue Hua, Wujiang Xu, Yujie Ren, Zirui Liu, Mengnan Du, Dong Deng, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the development of intelligent applications and systems such as LLM-based agents and agent operating systems (AIOS). However, when these applications and systems interact with the underlying file system, the file system still remains the traditional paradigm: reliant on manual navigation through precise commands. This paradigm poses a bottleneck to the usability of these systems as users are required to navigate complex folder hierarchies and remember cryptic file names. To address this limitation, we propose an LLM-based semantic file system ( LSFS ) for prompt-driven file management. Unlike conventional approaches, LSFS incorporates LLMs to enable users or agents to interact with files through natural language prompts, facilitating semantic file management. At the macro-level, we develop a comprehensive API set to achieve semantic file management functionalities, such as semantic file retrieval, file update monitoring and summarization, and semantic file rollback). At the micro-level, we store files by constructing semantic indexes for them, design and implement syscalls of different semantic operations (e.g., CRUD, group by, join) powered by vector database. Our experiments show that LSFS offers significant improvements over traditional file systems in terms of user convenience, the diversity of supported functions, and the accuracy and efficiency of file operations. Additionally, with the integration of LLM, our system enables more intelligent file management tasks, such as content summarization and version comparison, further enhancing its capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian Ciotinga, YooJung Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel optimal transport framework for probabilistic circuits (PCs). While it has been shown recently that divergences between distributions represented as certain classes of PCs can be computed tractably, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing approach to compute the Wasserstein distance between probability distributions given by PCs. We propose a Wasserstein-type distance that restricts the coupling measure of the associated optimal transport problem to be a probabilistic circuit. We then develop an algorithm for computing this distance by solving a series of small linear programs and derive the circuit conditions under which this is tractable. Furthermore, we show that we can easily retrieve the optimal transport plan between the PCs from the solutions to these linear programs. Lastly, we study the empirical Wasserstein distance between a PC and a dataset, and show that we can estimate the PC parameters to minimize this distance through an efficient iterative algorithm.</p>

<p>Abstract: In computational physics, machine learning has now emerged as a powerful complementary tool to explore efficiently candidate designs in engineering studies. Outputs in such supervised problems are signals defined on meshes, and a natural question is the extension of general scalar output regression models to such complex outputs. Changes between input geometries in terms of both size and adjacency structure in particular make this transition non-trivial. In this work, we propose an innovative strategy for Gaussian process regression where inputs are large and sparse graphs with continuous node attributes and outputs are signals defined on the nodes of the associated inputs. The methodology relies on the combination of regularized optimal transport, dimension reduction techniques, and the use of Gaussian processes indexed by graphs. In addition to enabling signal prediction, the main point of our proposal is to come with confidence intervals on node values, which is crucial for uncertainty quantification and active learning. Numerical experiments highlight the efficiency of the method to solve real problems in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sim2real for robotic manipulation is difficult due to the challenges of simulating complex contacts and generating realistic task distributions. To tackle the latter problem, we introduce ManipGen, which leverages a new class of policies for sim2real transfer: local policies. Locality enables a variety of appealing properties including invariances to absolute robot and object pose, skill ordering, and global scene configuration. We combine these policies with foundation models for vision, language and motion planning and demonstrate SOTA zero-shot performance of our method to Robosuite benchmark tasks in simulation (97%). We transfer our local policies from simulation to reality and observe they can solve unseen long-horizon manipulation tasks with up to 8 stages with significant pose, object and scene configuration variation. ManipGen outperforms SOTA approaches such as SayCan, OpenVLA, LLMTrajGen and VoxPoser across 50 real-world manipulation tasks by 36%, 76%, 62% and 60% respectively.

<p>Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery has been a long-standing goal within the research community, driven by the potential to accelerate knowledge creation. While significant progress has been made using commercial large language models (LLMs) as research assistants or idea generators, the possibility of automating the entire research process with open-source LLMs remains largely unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of using open-source post-trained LLMs as autonomous agents capable of performing the full cycle of automated research and review, from literature review and manuscript preparation to peer review and paper refinement. Our iterative preference training framework consists of CycleResearcher, which conducts research tasks, and CycleReviewer, which simulates the peer review process, providing iterative feedback via reinforcement learning. To train these models, we develop two new datasets, Review-5k and Research-14k, reflecting real-world machine learning research and peer review dynamics. Our results demonstrate that CycleReviewer achieves promising performance with a 26.89\% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to individual human reviewers in predicting paper scores, indicating the potential of LLMs to effectively assist expert-level research evaluation. In research, the papers generated by the CycleResearcher model achieved a score of 5.36 in simulated peer reviews, showing some competitiveness in terms of simulated review scores compared to the preprint level of 5.24 from human experts, while still having room for improvement compared to the accepted paper level of 5.69. This work represents a significant step toward fully automated scientific inquiry, providing ethical safeguards and exploring AI-driven research capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Hu, Ziqi Chen, Bo Peng, Daniel Adu-Ampratwum, Xia Ning</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of chemical reaction yields is crucial for optimizing organic synthesis, potentially reducing time and resources spent on experimentation. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), there is growing interest in leveraging AI-based methods to accelerate yield predictions without conducting in vitro experiments. We present log-RRIM, an innovative graph transformer-based framework designed for predicting chemical reaction yields. A key feature of log-RRIM is its integration of a cross-attention mechanism that focuses on the interplay between reagents and reaction centers. This design reflects a fundamental principle in chemical reactions: the crucial role of reagents in influencing bond-breaking and formation processes, which ultimately affect reaction yields. log-RRIM also implements a local-to-global reaction representation learning strategy. This approach initially captures detailed molecule-level information and then models and aggregates intermolecular interactions. Through this hierarchical process, log-RRIM effectively captures how different molecular fragments contribute to and influence the overall reaction yield, regardless of their size variations. log-RRIM shows superior performance in our experiments, especially for medium to high-yielding reactions, proving its reliability as a predictor. The framework's sophisticated modeling of reactant-reagent interactions and precise capture of molecular fragment contributions make it a valuable tool for reaction planning and optimization in chemical synthesis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuming Feng, Chuye Hong, Yaru Niu, Shiqi Liu, Yuxiang Yang, Wenhao Yu, Tingnan Zhang, Jie Tan, Ding Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, quadrupedal locomotion has achieved significant success, but their manipulation capabilities, particularly in handling large objects, remain limited, restricting their usefulness in demanding real-world applications such as search and rescue, construction, industrial automation, and room organization. This paper tackles the task of obstacle-aware, long-horizon pushing by multiple quadrupedal robots. We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with three levels of control. The high-level controller integrates an RRT planner and a centralized adaptive policy to generate subgoals, while the mid-level controller uses a decentralized goal-conditioned policy to guide the robots toward these sub-goals. A pre-trained low-level locomotion policy executes the movement commands. We evaluate our method against several baselines in simulation, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches, with 36.0% higher success rates and 24.5% reduction in completion time than the best baseline. Our framework successfully enables long-horizon, obstacle-aware manipulation tasks like Push-Cuboid and Push-T on Go1 robots in the real world.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a diffusion-based approach to quadrupedal locomotion that simultaneously addresses the limitations of learning and interpolating between multiple skills and of (modes) offline adapting to new locomotion behaviours after training. This is the first framework to apply classifier-free guided diffusion to quadruped locomotion and demonstrate its efficacy by extracting goal-conditioned behaviour from an originally unlabelled dataset. We show that these capabilities are compatible with a multi-skill policy and can be applied with little modification and minimal compute overhead, i.e., running entirely on the robots onboard CPU. We verify the validity of our approach with hardware experiments on the ANYmal quadruped platform.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arundhati S. Shanbhag, Brian B. Moser, Tobias C. Nauen, Stanislav Frolov, Federico Raue, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models, celebrated for their generative capabilities, have recently demonstrated surprising effectiveness in image classification tasks by using Bayes' theorem. Yet, current diffusion classifiers must evaluate every label candidate for each input, creating high computational costs that impede their use in large-scale applications. To address this limitation, we propose a Hierarchical Diffusion Classifier (HDC) that exploits hierarchical label structures or well-defined parent-child relationships in the dataset. By pruning irrelevant high-level categories and refining predictions only within relevant subcategories (leaf nodes and sub-trees), HDC reduces the total number of class evaluations. As a result, HDC can speed up inference by as much as 60% while preserving and sometimes even improving classification accuracy. In summary, our work provides a tunable control mechanism between speed and precision, making diffusion-based classification more feasible for large-scale applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hailang Huang, Yong Wang, Zixuan Huang, Huaqiu Li, Tongwen Huang, Xiangxiang Chu, Richong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities. However, current benchmarks predominantly focus on image comprehension in specific domains, and these benchmarks are labor-intensive to construct. Moreover, their answers tend to be brief, making it difficult to assess the ability of LMMs to generate detailed descriptions of images. To address these limitations, we propose the MMGenBench-Pipeline, a straightforward and fully automated evaluation pipeline. This involves generating textual descriptions from input images, using these descriptions to create auxiliary images via text-to-image generative models, and then comparing the original and generated images. Furthermore, to ensure the effectiveness of MMGenBench-Pipeline, we design MMGenBench-Test, evaluating LMMs across 13 distinct image patterns, and MMGenBench-Domain, focusing on generative image performance. A thorough evaluation involving over 50 popular LMMs demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability of both the pipeline and benchmark. Our observations indicate that numerous LMMs excelling in existing benchmarks fail to adequately complete the basic tasks related to image understanding and description. This finding highlights the substantial potential for performance improvement in current LMMs and suggests avenues for future model optimization. Concurrently, MMGenBench-Pipeline can efficiently assess the performance of LMMs across diverse domains using only image inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youwei Zhou, Tianyang Xu, Cong Wu, Xiaojun Wu, Josef Kittler</p>
<p>Abstract: The shared topology of human skeletons motivated the recent investigation of graph convolutional network (GCN) solutions for action recognition. However, most of the existing GCNs rely on the binary connection of two neighboring vertices (joints) formed by an edge (bone), overlooking the potential of constructing multi-vertex convolution structures. Although some studies have attempted to utilize hyper-graphs to represent the topology, they rely on a fixed construction strategy, which limits their adaptivity in uncovering the intricate latent relationships within the action. In this paper, we address this oversight and explore the merits of an adaptive hyper-graph convolutional network (Hyper-GCN) to achieve the aggregation of rich semantic information conveyed by skeleton vertices. In particular, our Hyper-GCN adaptively optimises the hyper-graphs during training, revealing the action-driven multi-vertex relations. Besides, virtual connections are often designed to support efficient feature aggregation, implicitly extending the spectrum of dependencies within the skeleton. By injecting virtual connections into hyper-graphs, the semantic clues of diverse action categories can be highlighted. The results of experiments conducted on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and NW-UCLA datasets demonstrate the merits of our Hyper-GCN, compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, we outperform the existing solutions on NTU-120, achieving 90.5\% and 91.7\% in terms of the top-1 recognition accuracy on X-Sub and X-Set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ri-Zhao Qiu, Yuchen Song, Xuanbin Peng, Sai Aneesh Suryadevara, Ge Yang, Minghuan Liu, Mazeyu Ji, Chengzhe Jia, Ruihan Yang, Xueyan Zou, Xiaolong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: 'In-the-wild' mobile manipulation aims to deploy robots in diverse real-world environments, which requires the robot to (1) have skills that generalize across object configurations; (2) be capable of long-horizon task execution in diverse environments; and (3) perform complex manipulation beyond pick-and-place. Quadruped robots with manipulators hold promise for extending the workspace and enabling robust locomotion, but existing results do not investigate such a capability. This paper proposes WildLMa with three components to address these issues: (1) adaptation of learned low-level controller for VR-enabled whole-body teleoperation and traversability; (2) WildLMa-Skill -- a library of generalizable visuomotor skills acquired via imitation learning or heuristics and (3) WildLMa-Planner -- an interface of learned skills that allow LLM planners to coordinate skills for long-horizon tasks. We demonstrate the importance of high-quality training data by achieving higher grasping success rate over existing RL baselines using only tens of demonstrations. WildLMa exploits CLIP for language-conditioned imitation learning that empirically generalizes to objects unseen in training demonstrations. Besides extensive quantitative evaluation, we qualitatively demonstrate practical robot applications, such as cleaning up trash in university hallways or outdoor terrains, operating articulated objects, and rearranging items on a bookshelf.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Egor Sevriugov, Ivan Oseledets</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-autoregressive language models generate all tokens simultaneously, offering potential speed advantages over traditional autoregressive models, but they face challenges in modeling the complex dependencies inherent in text data. In this work, we investigate a conditional flow matching approach for text generation. We represent tokens as one-hot vectors in a \(V\)-dimensional simplex and utilize geodesics under the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which correspond to linear interpolation in logit space. We provide a theoretical justification that maximizing the conditional likelihood \(P_{\theta}(x_1 \mid x_t, t)\) yields the exact flow matching velocity under logit interpolation. To address the suboptimal performance of basic inference, we propose a novel empirical sampling scheme that iteratively samples from the conditional distribution and introduces additional noise, significantly improving results despite lacking full theoretical underpinnings. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid inference method that combines the basic approach with the sampling scheme. This method demonstrates superior performance on both conditional and unconditional text generation experiments compared to previous SOTA method for discrete flow matching.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, PaLM, and Llama has significantly transformed natural language processing, showcasing remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating language. However, these models often struggle with tasks requiring complex reasoning, particularly in mathematical problem-solving, due in part to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality, domain-specific datasets necessary for training sophisticated reasoning abilities. To address this limitation, we introduce Template-based Data Generation (TDG), a novel approach that leverages LLMs (GPT-4) to automatically generate parameterized meta-templates, which are then used to synthesize a vast array of high-quality problems and solutions. Leveraging TDG, we create TemplateMath Part I: TemplateGSM, a dataset comprising over 7 million synthetically generated grade school math problems--each accompanied by code-based and natural language solutions--with the potential to generate an effectively unlimited number more. This dataset alleviates the scarcity of large-scale mathematical datasets and serves as a valuable resource for pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluating LLMs in mathematical reasoning. Our method not only enables the generation of virtually infinite data but also elevates data augmentation to a new level by using GPT-4 for meta-template generation, ensuring diverse and high-quality problem structures. The TemplateMath Part I: TemplateGSM dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/math-ai/TemplateGSM. The code is available at https://github.com/iiis-ai/TemplateMath.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Ganon, Alon Zolfi, Omer Hofman, Inderjeet Singh, Hisashi Kojima, Yuval Elovici, Asaf Shabtai</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have had great success in tasks such as casual conversation, contributing to significant advancements in domains like virtual assistance. However, they often generate responses that are not aligned with human values (e.g., ethical standards, safety), leading to potentially unsafe or inappropriate outputs. While several techniques have been proposed to address this problem, they come with a cost, requiring computationally expensive training or dramatically increasing the inference time. In this paper, we present DIESEL, a lightweight inference-guidance technique that can be seamlessly integrated into any autoregressive LLM to semantically filter undesired concepts from the response. DIESEL can function either as a standalone safeguard or as an additional layer of defense, enhancing response safety by reranking the LLM's proposed tokens based on their similarity to predefined negative concepts in the latent space. Our evaluation demonstrates DIESEL's effectiveness on state-of-the-art conversational models, even in adversarial jailbreaking scenarios that challenge response safety. We also highlight DIESEL's generalization capabilities, showing that it can be used in use cases other than safety, providing general-purpose response filtering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Zifeng Wang, Hamid Palangi, Rujun Han, Sayna Ebrahimi, Long Le, Vincent Perot, Swaroop Mishra, Mohit Bansal, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister</p>
<p>Abstract: Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between their forward and backward thinking. To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework composed of data augmentation and learning objectives. In RevThink, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2) forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4) backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning from a question, (b) generate a backward question from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math, and logical reasoning show an average 13.53% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance and a 6.84% improvement over the strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency -- using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning from the training data, it outperforms a standard fine-tuning method trained on 10x more forward reasoning. RevThink also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prajwal Singh, Ashish Tiwari, Gautam Vashishtha, Shanmuganathan Raman</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have revolutionized photorealistic rendering of novel views for 3D scenes. Despite their growing popularity and efficiency as 3D resources, NeRFs face scalability challenges due to the need for separate models per scene and the cumulative increase in training time for multiple scenes. The potential for incrementally encoding multiple 3D scenes into a single NeRF model remains largely unexplored. To address this, we introduce Continual-Neural Graphics Primitives (C-NGP), a novel continual learning framework that integrates multiple scenes incrementally into a single neural radiance field. Using a generative replay approach, C-NGP adapts to new scenes without requiring access to old data. We demonstrate that C-NGP can accommodate multiple scenes without increasing the parameter count, producing high-quality novel-view renderings on synthetic and real datasets. Notably, C-NGP models all 8 scenes from the Real-LLFF dataset together, with only a 2.2% drop in PSNR compared to vanilla NeRF, which models each scene independently. Further, C-NGP allows multiple style edits in the same network. The implementation details and dynamic visualizations are in the supplementary material.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the vision understanding domain. The success of these models can largely be attributed to the dominant scaling law, which states that larger parameter sizes and data volumes contribute to better performance. Notably, data scaling has mainly been powered by automatic data pipelines, which center around the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted for quite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these data has been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits scaling with synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a data-centric perspective. Our main study approach is fine-tuning pre-trained image-LLMs with video data and investigating learning efficiency through data scaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning efficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through our probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes video-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic samples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves performance comparable to or even superior to baselines trained with many more samples. Meanwhile, we find that incorporating these synthetic samples can boost the performance of long video understanding without training with long video data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenda Shi, Yiren Song, Dengming Zhang, Jiaming Liu, Xingxing Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual text rendering are widespread in various real-world applications, requiring careful font selection and typographic choices. Recent progress in diffusion transformer (DiT)-based text-to-image (T2I) models show promise in automating these processes. However, these methods still encounter challenges like inconsistent fonts, style variation, and limited fine-grained control, particularly at the word-level. This paper proposes a two-stage DiT-based pipeline to address these problems by enhancing controllability over typography and style in text rendering. We introduce typography control fine-tuning (TC-FT), an parameter-efficient fine-tuning method (on $5\%$ key parameters) with enclosing typography control tokens (ETC-tokens), which enables precise word-level application of typographic features. To further address style inconsistency in text rendering, we propose a text-agnostic style control adapter (SCA) that prevents content leakage while enhancing style consistency. To implement TC-FT and SCA effectively, we incorporated HTML-render into the data synthesis pipeline and proposed the first word-level controllable dataset. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving superior word-level typographic control, font consistency, and style consistency in text rendering tasks. The datasets and models will be available for academic use.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transient objects in video sequences can significantly degrade the quality of 3D scene reconstructions. To address this challenge, we propose T-3DGS, a novel framework that robustly filters out transient distractors during 3D reconstruction using Gaussian Splatting. Our framework consists of two steps. First, we employ an unsupervised classification network that distinguishes transient objects from static scene elements by leveraging their distinct training dynamics within the reconstruction process. Second, we refine these initial detections by integrating an off-the-shelf segmentation method with a bidirectional tracking module, which together enhance boundary accuracy and temporal coherence. Evaluations on both sparsely and densely captured video datasets demonstrate that T-3DGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, enabling high-fidelity 3D reconstructions in challenging, real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthetic data is gaining increasing popularity for face recognition technologies, mainly due to the privacy concerns and challenges associated with obtaining real data, including diverse scenarios, quality, and demographic groups, among others. It also offers some advantages over real data, such as the large amount of data that can be generated or the ability to customize it to adapt to specific problem-solving needs. To effectively use such data, face recognition models should also be specifically designed to exploit synthetic data to its fullest potential. In order to promote the proposal of novel Generative AI methods and synthetic data, and investigate the application of synthetic data to better train face recognition systems, we introduce the 2nd FRCSyn-onGoing challenge, based on the 2nd Face Recognition Challenge in the Era of Synthetic Data (FRCSyn), originally launched at CVPR 2024. This is an ongoing challenge that provides researchers with an accessible platform to benchmark i) the proposal of novel Generative AI methods and synthetic data, and ii) novel face recognition systems that are specifically proposed to take advantage of synthetic data. We focus on exploring the use of synthetic data both individually and in combination with real data to solve current challenges in face recognition such as demographic bias, domain adaptation, and performance constraints in demanding situations, such as age disparities between training and testing, changes in the pose, or occlusions. Very interesting findings are obtained in this second edition, including a direct comparison with the first one, in which synthetic databases were restricted to DCFace and GANDiffFace.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent generative models based on score matching and flow matching have significantly advanced generation tasks, but their potential in discriminative tasks remains underexplored. Previous approaches, such as generative classifiers, have not fully leveraged the capabilities of these models for discriminative tasks due to their intricate designs. We propose Pretrained Reversible Generation (PRG), which extracts unsupervised representations by reversing the generative process of a pretrained continuous generation model. PRG effectively reuses unsupervised generative models, leveraging their high capacity to serve as robust and generalizable feature extractors for downstream tasks. This framework enables the flexible selection of feature hierarchies tailored to specific downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms prior approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance among generative model based methods, including 78% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet at a resolution of 64. Extensive ablation studies, including out-of-distribution evaluations, further validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Zhang, Nicholas Konz, Kevin Kramer, Maciej A. Mazurowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Image segmentation foundation models (SFMs) like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have achieved impressive zero-shot and interactive segmentation across diverse domains. However, they struggle to segment objects with certain structures, particularly those with dense, tree-like morphology and low textural contrast from their surroundings. These failure modes are crucial for understanding the limitations of SFMs in real-world applications. To systematically study this issue, we introduce interpretable metrics quantifying object tree-likeness and textural separability. On carefully controlled synthetic experiments and real-world datasets, we show that SFM performance (e.g., SAM, SAM 2, HQ-SAM) noticeably correlates with these factors. We link these failures to "textural confusion", where models misinterpret local structure as global texture, causing over-segmentation or difficulty distinguishing objects from similar backgrounds. Notably, targeted fine-tuning fails to resolve this issue, indicating a fundamental limitation. Our study provides the first quantitative framework for modeling the behavior of SFMs on challenging structures, offering interpretable insights into their segmentation capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raanan Y. Rohekar, Yaniv Gurwicz, Sungduk Yu, Estelle Aflalo, Vasudev Lal</p>
<p>Abstract: Are generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models only trained to predict the next token, or do they implicitly learn a world model from which a sequence is generated one token at a time? We examine this question by deriving a causal interpretation of the attention mechanism in GPT, and suggesting a causal world model that arises from this interpretation. Furthermore, we propose that GPT-models, at inference time, can be utilized for zero-shot causal structure learning for in-distribution sequences. Empirical evaluation is conducted in a controlled synthetic environment using the setup and rules of the Othello board game. A GPT, pre-trained on real-world games played with the intention of winning, is tested on synthetic data that only adheres to the game rules, oblivious to the goal of winning. We find that the GPT model is likely to generate moves that adhere to the game rules for sequences for which a causal structure is encoded in the attention mechanism with high confidence. In general, in cases for which the GPT model generates moves that do not adhere to the game rules, it also fails to capture any causal structure.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humanoid robots require both robust lower-body locomotion and precise upper-body manipulation. While recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches provide whole-body loco-manipulation policies, they lack precise manipulation with high DoF arms. In this paper, we propose decoupling upper-body control from locomotion, using inverse kinematics (IK) and motion retargeting for precise manipulation, while RL focuses on robust lower-body locomotion. We introduce PMP (Predictive Motion Priors), trained with Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to effectively represent upper-body motions. The locomotion policy is trained conditioned on this upper-body motion representation, ensuring that the system remains robust with both manipulation and locomotion. We show that CVAE features are crucial for stability and robustness, and significantly outperforms RL-based whole-body control in precise manipulation. With precise upper-body motion and robust lower-body locomotion control, operators can remotely control the humanoid to walk around and explore different environments, while performing diverse manipulation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Identifying the training data samples that most influence a generated image is a critical task in understanding diffusion models (DMs), yet existing influence estimation methods are constrained to small-scale or LoRA-tuned models due to computational limitations. To address this challenge, we propose DMin (Diffusion Model influence), a scalable framework for estimating the influence of each training data sample on a given generated image. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first method capable of influence estimation for DMs with billions of parameters. Leveraging efficient gradient compression, DMin reduces storage requirements from hundreds of TBs to mere MBs or even KBs, and retrieves the top-k most influential training samples in under 1 second, all while maintaining performance. Our empirical results demonstrate DMin is both effective in identifying influential training samples and efficient in terms of computational and storage requirements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vasiliki Sideri-Lampretsa, Nil Stolt-Ans\'o, Huaqi Qiu, Julian McGinnis, Wenke Karbole, Martin Menten, Daniel Rueckert</p>
<p>Abstract: Deformable image registration poses a challenging problem where, unlike most deep learning tasks, a complex relationship between multiple coordinate systems has to be considered. Although data-driven methods have shown promising capabilities to model complex non-linear transformations, existing works employ standard deep learning architectures assuming they are general black-box solvers. We argue that understanding how learned operations perform pattern-matching between the features in the source and target domains is the key to building robust, data-efficient, and interpretable architectures. We present a theoretical foundation for designing an interpretable registration framework: separated feature extraction and deformation modeling, dynamic receptive fields, and a data-driven deformation functions awareness of the relationship between both spatial domains. Based on this foundation, we formulate an end-to-end process that refines transformations in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Our architecture employs spatially continuous deformation modeling functions that use geometric deep-learning principles, therefore avoiding the problematic approach of resampling to a regular grid between successive refinements of the transformation. We perform a qualitative investigation to highlight interesting interpretability properties of our architecture. We conclude by showing significant improvement in performance metrics over state-of-the-art approaches for both mono- and multi-modal inter-subject brain registration, as well as the challenging task of longitudinal retinal intra-subject registration. We make our code publicly available</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose CAD-Assistant, a general-purpose CAD agent for AI-assisted design. Our approach is based on a powerful Vision and Large Language Model (VLLM) as a planner and a tool-augmentation paradigm using CAD-specific tools. CAD-Assistant addresses multimodal user queries by generating actions that are iteratively executed on a Python interpreter equipped with the FreeCAD software, accessed via its Python API. Our framework is able to assess the impact of generated CAD commands on geometry and adapts subsequent actions based on the evolving state of the CAD design. We consider a wide range of CAD-specific tools including a sketch image parameterizer, rendering modules, a 2D cross-section generator, and other specialized routines. CAD-Assistant is evaluated on multiple CAD benchmarks, where it outperforms VLLM baselines and supervised task-specific methods. Beyond existing benchmarks, we qualitatively demonstrate the potential of tool-augmented VLLMs as general-purpose CAD solvers across diverse workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiran Ma, Zui Chen, Tianqiao Liu, Mi Tian, Zhuo Liu, Zitao Liu, Weiqi Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Step-level reward models (SRMs) can significantly enhance mathematical reasoning performance through process supervision or step-level preference alignment based on reinforcement learning. The performance of SRMs is pivotal, as they serve as critical guidelines, ensuring that each step in the reasoning process is aligned with desired outcomes. Recently, AlphaZero-like methods, where Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is employed for automatic step-level preference annotation, have proven particularly effective. However, the precise mechanisms behind the success of SRMs remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this study delves into the counterintuitive aspects of SRMs, particularly focusing on MCTS-based approaches. Our findings reveal that the removal of natural language descriptions of thought processes has minimal impact on the efficacy of SRMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SRMs are adept at assessing the complex logical coherence present in mathematical language while having difficulty in natural language. These insights provide a nuanced understanding of the core elements that drive effective step-level reward modeling in mathematical reasoning. By shedding light on these mechanisms, this study offers valuable guidance for developing more efficient and streamlined SRMs, which can be achieved by focusing on the crucial parts of mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-context video modeling is critical for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enabling them to process movies, online video streams, and so on. Despite its advances, handling long videos remains challenging due to the difficulty in efficiently understanding the extremely long video context. This paper aims to address this issue from aspects of model architecture, training data, training strategy and evaluation benchmark. First, we propose a novel Hierarchical video token Compression (HiCo) method, which leverages visual redundancy in long videos to compress long video context from Clip-level to Video-level, reducing the computation significantly while preserving essential details, achieving an extreme compression ratio of approximately 1/50 with almost no performance loss. Second, we introduce a multi-stage short-to-long learning scheme, a large-scale dataset of real-world long videos named LongVid, and a challenging ``Multi-Hop Needle-In-A-Video-Haystack'' benchmark. Finally, we build a powerful video MLLM named VideoChat-Flash, which shows a leading performance on both mainstream long and short video benchmarks at the 2B and 7B model scale. It first gets 99.1% accuracy over 10,000 frames in NIAH among open-source models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingfeng Yao, Bin Yang, Xinggang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent diffusion models with Transformer architectures excel at generating high-fidelity images. However, recent studies reveal an optimization dilemma in this two-stage design: while increasing the per-token feature dimension in visual tokenizers improves reconstruction quality, it requires substantially larger diffusion models and more training iterations to achieve comparable generation performance. Consequently, existing systems often settle for sub-optimal solutions, either producing visual artifacts due to information loss within tokenizers or failing to converge fully due to expensive computation costs. We argue that this dilemma stems from the inherent difficulty in learning unconstrained high-dimensional latent spaces. To address this, we propose aligning the latent space with pre-trained vision foundation models when training the visual tokenizers. Our proposed VA-VAE (Vision foundation model Aligned Variational AutoEncoder) significantly expands the reconstruction-generation frontier of latent diffusion models, enabling faster convergence of Diffusion Transformers (DiT) in high-dimensional latent spaces. To exploit the full potential of VA-VAE, we build an enhanced DiT baseline with improved training strategies and architecture designs, termed LightningDiT. The integrated system achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on ImageNet 256x256 generation with an FID score of 1.35 while demonstrating remarkable training efficiency by reaching an FID score of 2.11 in just 64 epochs--representing an over 21 times convergence speedup compared to the original DiT.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew J. Larkoski</p>
<p>Abstract: The problem of interpretability of machine learning architecture in particle physics has no agreed-upon definition, much less any proposed solution. We present a first modest step toward these goals by proposing a definition and corresponding practical method for isolation and identification of relevant physical energy scales exploited by the machine. This is accomplished by smearing or averaging over all input events that lie within a prescribed metric energy distance of one another and correspondingly renders any quantity measured on a finite, discrete dataset continuous over the dataspace. Within this approach, we are able to explicitly demonstrate that (approximate) scaling laws are a consequence of extreme value theory applied to analysis of the distribution of the irreducible minimal distance over which a machine must extrapolate given a finite dataset. As an example, we study quark versus gluon jet identification, construct the smeared likelihood, and show that discrimination power steadily increases as resolution decreases, indicating that the true likelihood for the problem is sensitive to emissions at all scales.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Skvrna, Lukas Neumann</p>
<p>Abstract: Inferring object 3D position and orientation from a single RGB camera is a foundational task in computer vision with many important applications. Traditionally, 3D object detection methods are trained in a fully-supervised setup, requiring LiDAR and vast amounts of human annotations, which are laborious, costly, and do not scale well with the ever-increasing amounts of data being captured.
  We present a novel method to train a 3D object detector from a single RGB camera without domain-specific human annotations, making orders of magnitude more data available for training. The method uses newly proposed Local Object Motion Model to disentangle object movement source between subsequent frames, is approximately 700 times faster than previous work and compensates camera focal length differences to aggregate multiple datasets.
  The method is evaluated on three public datasets, where despite using no human labels, it outperforms prior work by a significant margin. It also shows its versatility as a pre-training tool for fully-supervised training and shows that combining pseudo-labels from multiple datasets can achieve comparable accuracy to using human labels from a single dataset. The source code and model will be published soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saeid Asgari Taghanaki, Joao Monteiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating detailed and coherent explanations of complex concepts. However, the extent to which these models truly comprehend the concepts they articulate remains unclear. To assess the level of comprehension of a model relative to the content it generates, we implemented a self-evaluation pipeline where models: (i) given a topic generate an excerpt with information about the topic, (ii) given an excerpt generate question-answer pairs, and finally (iii) given a question generate an answer. We refer to this self-evaluation approach as Explain-Query-Test (EQT). Interestingly, the accuracy on generated questions resulting from running the EQT pipeline correlates strongly with the model performance as verified by typical benchmarks such as MMLU-Pro. In other words, EQT's performance is predictive of MMLU-Pro's, and EQT can be used to rank models without the need for any external source of evaluation data other than lists of topics of interest. Moreover, our results reveal a disparity between the models' ability to produce detailed explanations and their performance on questions related to those explanations. This gap highlights fundamental limitations in the internal knowledge representation and reasoning abilities of current LLMs. We release the code at https://github.com/asgsaeid/EQT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Kaykobad Reza, Ameya Patil, Mashhour Solh, M. Salman Asif</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal models often experience a significant performance drop when one or more modalities are missing during inference. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities while maintaining strong performance when all modalities are available. Our method introduces cross-modal proxy tokens (CMPTs), which approximate the class token of a missing modality by attending only to the tokens of the available modality. To efficiently learn the approximation for the missing modality via CMPTs with minimal computational overhead, we employ low-rank adapters in frozen unimodal encoders and jointly optimize an alignment loss with a task-specific loss. Extensive experiments on five multimodal datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various missing rates while achieving competitive results in complete-modality settings. Overall, our method offers a flexible and efficient solution for robust multimodal learning. The code and pretrained models will be released on GitHub.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses a fundamental but largely unexplored challenge in sequential changepoint analysis: conducting inference following a detected change. We study the problem of localizing the changepoint using only the data observed up to a data-dependent stopping time at which a sequential detection algorithm $\mathcal A$ declares a change. We first construct confidence sets for the unknown changepoint when pre- and post-change distributions are assumed to be known. We then extend our framework to composite pre- and post-change scenarios. We impose no conditions on the observation space or on $\mathcal A$ -- we only need to be able to run $\mathcal A$ on simulated data sequences. In summary, this work offers both theoretically sound and practically effective tools for sequential changepoint localization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Tian, Xiaotong Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction with multimodal data-encompassing tabular, textual, and visual inputs or outputs-is fundamental to advancing analytics in diverse application domains. Traditional approaches often struggle to integrate heterogeneous data types while maintaining high predictive accuracy. We introduce Generative Distribution Prediction (GDP), a novel framework that leverages multimodal synthetic data generation-such as conditional diffusion models-to enhance predictive performance across structured and unstructured modalities. GDP is model-agnostic, compatible with any high-fidelity generative model, and supports transfer learning for domain adaptation. We establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for GDP, providing statistical guarantees on its predictive accuracy when using diffusion models as the generative backbone. By estimating the data-generating distribution and adapting to various loss functions for risk minimization, GDP enables accurate point predictions across multimodal settings. We empirically validate GDP on four supervised learning tasks-tabular data prediction, question answering, image captioning, and adaptive quantile regression-demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across diverse domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series data is essential in various applications, including climate modeling, healthcare monitoring, and financial analytics. Understanding the contextual information associated with real-world time series data is often essential for accurate and reliable event predictions. In this paper, we introduce TimeCAP, a time-series processing framework that creatively employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as contextualizers of time series data, extending their typical usage as predictors. TimeCAP incorporates two independent LLM agents: one generates a textual summary capturing the context of the time series, while the other uses this enriched summary to make more informed predictions. In addition, TimeCAP employs a multi-modal encoder that synergizes with the LLM agents, enhancing predictive performance through mutual augmentation of inputs with in-context examples. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeCAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods for time series event prediction, including those utilizing LLMs as predictors, achieving an average improvement of 28.75% in F1 score.</p>

<p>Abstract: Agents built on large language models (LLMs) have excelled in turn-by-turn human-AI collaboration but struggle with simultaneous tasks requiring real-time interaction. Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. DPT-Agent can effectively help LLMs convert correct slow thinking and reasoning into executable actions, thereby improving performance. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously.

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled the integration of multiple modalities, including texts and images, within the large language model (LLM) framework. However, texts and images are usually interconnected, forming a multimodal attributed graph (MMAG). It is underexplored how MLLMs can incorporate the relational information (\textit{i.e.}, graph structure) and semantic information (\textit{i.e.,} texts and images) on such graphs for multimodal comprehension and generation. In this paper, we propose GraphGPT-o, which supports omni-multimodal understanding and creation on MMAGs. We first comprehensively study linearization variants to transform semantic and structural information as input for MLLMs. Then, we propose a hierarchical aligner that enables deep graph encoding, bridging the gap between MMAGs and MLLMs. Finally, we explore the inference choices, adapting MLLM to interleaved text and image generation in graph scenarios. Extensive experiments on three datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Datasets and codes will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Purificato, Maria Sofia Bucarelli, Anil Kumar Nelakanti, Andrea Bacciu, Fabrizio Silvestri, Amin Mantrach</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliably labelling data typically requires annotations from multiple human workers. However, humans are far from being perfect. Hence, it is a common practice to aggregate labels gathered from multiple annotators to make a more confident estimate of the true label. Among many aggregation methods, the simple and well known Majority Vote (MV) selects the class label polling the highest number of votes. However, despite its importance, the optimality of MV's label aggregation has not been extensively studied. We address this gap in our work by characterising the conditions under which MV achieves the theoretically optimal lower bound on label estimation error. Our results capture the tolerable limits on annotation noise under which MV can optimally recover labels for a given class distribution. This certificate of optimality provides a more principled approach to model selection for label aggregation as an alternative to otherwise inefficient practices that sometimes include higher experts, gold labels, etc., that are all marred by the same human uncertainty despite huge time and monetary costs. Experiments on both synthetic and real world data corroborate our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guang Ping He</p>
<p>Abstract: The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm offers exponential speedup for solving the quantum linear-system problem. But some caveats for the speedup could be hard to met. One of the difficulties is the encoding bottleneck, i.e., the efficient preparation of the initial quantum state. To prepare an arbitrary $N$-dimensional state exactly, existing state-preparation approaches generally require a runtime of $O(N)$, which will ruin the speedup of the HHL algorithm. Here we show that the states can be prepared approximately with a runtime of $O(poly(\log N))$ by employing a slightly modified version of the HHL algorithm itself. Thus, applying this approach to prepare the initial state of the original HHL algorithm can preserve the exponential speedup advantage. It can also serve as a standalone solution for other applications demanding fast state preparation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although being widely adopted for evaluating generated audio signals, the Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD) suffers from significant limitations, including reliance on Gaussian assumptions, sensitivity to sample size, and high computational complexity. As an alternative, we introduce the Kernel Audio Distance (KAD), a novel, distribution-free, unbiased, and computationally efficient metric based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Through analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate KAD's advantages: (1) faster convergence with smaller sample sizes, enabling reliable evaluation with limited data; (2) lower computational cost, with scalable GPU acceleration; and (3) stronger alignment with human perceptual judgments. By leveraging advanced embeddings and characteristic kernels, KAD captures nuanced differences between real and generated audio. Open-sourced in the kadtk toolkit, KAD provides an efficient, reliable, and perceptually aligned benchmark for evaluating generative audio models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuan-Anh Yang, Truong-Son Hy, Phuong D. Dao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multiscale object-based graph neural network called MOB-GCN for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. The central aim of this study is to enhance feature extraction and classification performance by utilizing multiscale object-based image analysis (OBIA). Traditional pixel-based methods often suffer from low accuracy and speckle noise, while single-scale OBIA approaches may overlook crucial information of image objects at different levels of detail. MOB-GCN addresses this issue by extracting and integrating features from multiple segmentation scales to improve classification results using the Multiresolution Graph Network (MGN) architecture that can model fine-grained and global spatial patterns. By constructing a dynamic multiscale graph hierarchy, MOB-GCN offers a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate details and global context of HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that MOB-GCN consistently outperforms single-scale graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in terms of classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and noise reduction, particularly when labeled data is limited. The implementation of MOB-GCN is publicly available at https://github.com/HySonLab/MultiscaleHSI</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kirtan Padh, Zhufeng Li, Cecilia Casolo, Niki Kilbertus</p>
<p>Abstract: Assuming a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents prior knowledge of causal relationships between variables is a common starting point for cause-effect estimation. Existing literature typically invokes hypothetical domain expert knowledge or causal discovery algorithms to justify this assumption. In practice, neither may propose a single DAG with high confidence. Domain experts are hesitant to rule out dependencies with certainty or have ongoing disputes about relationships; causal discovery often relies on untestable assumptions itself or only provides an equivalence class of DAGs and is commonly sensitive to hyperparameter and threshold choices. We propose an efficient, gradient-based optimization method that provides bounds for causal queries over a collection of causal graphs -- compatible with imperfect prior knowledge -- that may still be too large for exhaustive enumeration. Our bounds achieve good coverage and sharpness for causal queries such as average treatment effects in linear and non-linear synthetic settings as well as on real-world data. Our approach aims at providing an easy-to-use and widely applicable rebuttal to the valid critique of `What if your assumed DAG is wrong?'.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional text-to-speech (TTS) methods primarily focus on establishing a mapping between phonemes and mel-spectrograms. However, during the phoneme encoding stage, there is often a lack of real mel-spectrogram auxiliary information, which results in the encoding process lacking true semantic understanding. At the same time, traditional TTS systems often struggle to balance the inference speed of the model with the quality of the synthesized speech. Methods that generate high-quality synthesized speech tend to have slower inference speeds, while faster inference methods often sacrifice speech quality. In this paper, I propose Clip-TTS, a TTS method based on the Clip architecture. This method uses the Clip framework to establish a connection between text content and real mel-spectrograms during the text encoding stage, enabling the text encoder to directly learn the true semantics of the global context, thereby ensuring the quality of the synthesized speech. In terms of model architecture, I adopt the basic structure of Transformer, which allows Clip-TTS to achieve fast inference speeds. Experimental results show that on the LJSpeech and Baker datasets, the speech generated by Clip-TTS achieves state-of-the-art MOS scores, and it also performs excellently on multi-emotion datasets.Audio samples are available at: https://ltydd1314.github.io/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Jacobi, Gal Niv</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and interpreting the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) remains an open challenge. Patchscopes introduced a method for probing internal activations by patching them into new prompts, prompting models to self-explain their hidden representations. We introduce Superscopes, a technique that systematically amplifies superposed features in MLP outputs (multilayer perceptron) and hidden states before patching them into new contexts. Inspired by the "features as directions" perspective and the Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) approach from diffusion models, Superscopes amplifies weak but meaningful features, enabling the interpretation of internal representations that previous methods failed to explain-all without requiring additional training. This approach provides new insights into how LLMs build context and represent complex concepts, further advancing mechanistic interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fran\c{c}ois Bachoc, Tommaso Cesari, Roberto Colomboni</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a contextual version of the repeated brokerage problem. In each interaction, two traders with private valuations for an item seek to buy or sell based on the learner's-a broker-proposed price, which is informed by some contextual information. The broker's goal is to maximize the traders' net utility-also known as the gain from trade-by minimizing regret compared to an oracle with perfect knowledge of traders' valuation distributions. We assume that traders' valuations are zero-mean perturbations of the unknown item's current market value-which can change arbitrarily from one interaction to the next-and that similar contexts will correspond to similar market prices. We analyze two feedback settings: full-feedback, where after each interaction the traders' valuations are revealed to the broker, and limited-feedback, where only transaction attempts are revealed. For both feedback types, we propose algorithms achieving tight regret bounds. We further strengthen our performance guarantees by providing a tight 1/2-approximation result showing that the oracle that knows the traders' valuation distributions achieves at least 1/2 of the gain from trade of the omniscient oracle that knows in advance the actual realized traders' valuations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Resting heart rate (RHR) is an important biomarker of cardiovascular health and mortality, but tracking it longitudinally generally requires a wearable device, limiting its availability. We present PHRM, a deep learning system for passive heart rate (HR) and RHR measurements during everyday smartphone use, using facial video-based photoplethysmography. Our system was developed using 225,773 videos from 495 participants and validated on 185,970 videos from 205 participants in laboratory and free-living conditions, representing the largest validation study of its kind. Compared to reference electrocardiogram, PHRM achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) < 10% for HR measurements across three skin tone groups of light, medium and dark pigmentation; MAPE for each skin tone group was non-inferior versus the others. Daily RHR measured by PHRM had a mean absolute error < 5 bpm compared to a wearable HR tracker, and was associated with known risk factors. These results highlight the potential of smartphones to enable passive and equitable heart health monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aoxiong Yin, Kai Shen, Yichong Leng, Xu Tan, Xinyu Zhou, Juncheng Li, Siliang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generation have been driven by two competing paradigms: autoregressive language models and diffusion models. However, each paradigm has intrinsic limitations: language models struggle with visual quality and error accumulation, while diffusion models lack semantic understanding and causal modeling. In this work, we propose LanDiff, a hybrid framework that synergizes the strengths of both paradigms through coarse-to-fine generation. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) a semantic tokenizer that compresses 3D visual features into compact 1D discrete representations through efficient semantic compression, achieving a $\sim$14,000$\times$ compression ratio; (2) a language model that generates semantic tokens with high-level semantic relationships; (3) a streaming diffusion model that refines coarse semantics into high-fidelity videos. Experiments show that LanDiff, a 5B model, achieves a score of 85.43 on the VBench T2V benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art open-source models Hunyuan Video (13B) and other commercial models such as Sora, Kling, and Hailuo. Furthermore, our model also achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation, surpassing other open-source models in this field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Trung Tran, Nasrin Sohrabi, Zahir Tari, Qin Wang, Xiaoyu Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: We identify the slow liquidity drain (SLID) scam, an insidious and highly profitable threat to decentralized finance (DeFi), posing a large-scale, persistent, and growing risk to the ecosystem. Unlike traditional scams such as rug pulls or honeypots (USENIX Sec'19, USENIX Sec'23), SLID gradually siphons funds from liquidity pools over extended periods, making detection significantly more challenging. In this paper, we conducted the first large-scale empirical analysis of 319,166 liquidity pools across six major decentralized exchanges (DEXs) since 2018. We identified 3,117 SLID affected liquidity pools, resulting in cumulative losses of more than US$103 million. We propose a rule-based heuristic and an enhanced machine learning model for early detection. Our machine learning model achieves a detection speed 4.77 times faster than the heuristic while maintaining 95% accuracy. Our study establishes a foundation for protecting DeFi investors at an early stage and promoting transparency in the DeFi ecosystem.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04870">Leveraging Large Language Models to Address Data Scarcity in Machine Learning: Applications in Graphene Synthesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Devi Dutta Biswajeet, Sara Kadkhodaei</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning in materials science faces challenges due to limited experimental data, as generating synthesis data is costly and time-consuming, especially with in-house experiments. Mining data from existing literature introduces issues like mixed data quality, inconsistent formats, and variations in reporting experimental parameters, complicating the creation of consistent features for the learning algorithm. Additionally, combining continuous and discrete features can hinder the learning process with limited data. Here, we propose strategies that utilize large language models (LLMs) to enhance machine learning performance on a limited, heterogeneous dataset of graphene chemical vapor deposition synthesis compiled from existing literature. These strategies include prompting modalities for imputing missing data points and leveraging large language model embeddings to encode the complex nomenclature of substrates reported in chemical vapor deposition experiments. The proposed strategies enhance graphene layer classification using a support vector machine (SVM) model, increasing binary classification accuracy from 39% to 65% and ternary accuracy from 52% to 72%. We compare the performance of the SVM and a GPT-4 model, both trained and fine-tuned on the same data. Our results demonstrate that the numerical classifier, when combined with LLM-driven data enhancements, outperforms the standalone LLM predictor, highlighting that in data-scarce scenarios, improving predictive learning with LLM strategies requires more than simple fine-tuning on datasets. Instead, it necessitates sophisticated approaches for data imputation and feature space homogenization to achieve optimal performance. The proposed strategies emphasize data enhancement techniques, offering a broadly applicable framework for improving machine learning performance on scarce, inhomogeneous datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yordan P. Raykov, Hengrui Luo, Justin D. Strait, Wasiur R. KhudaBukhsh</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose causal effect estimators based on empirical Fr\'{e}chet means and operator-valued kernels, tailored to functional data spaces. These methods address the challenges of high-dimensionality, sequential ordering, and model complexity while preserving robustness to treatment misspecification. Using structural assumptions, we obtain compact representations of potential outcomes, enabling scalable estimation of causal effects over time and across covariates. We provide both theoretical, regarding the consistency of functional causal effects, as well as empirical comparison of a range of proposed causal effect estimators.
  Applications to binary treatment settings with functional outcomes illustrate the framework's utility in biomedical monitoring, where outcomes exhibit complex temporal dynamics. Our estimators accommodate scenarios with registered covariates and outcomes, aligning them to the Fr\'{e}chet means, as well as cases requiring higher-order representations to capture intricate covariate-outcome interactions. These advancements extend causal inference to dynamic and non-linear domains, offering new tools for understanding complex treatment effects in functional data settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengguang Zhou, Xirui Li, Ruochen Wang, Minhao Cheng, Tianyi Zhou, Cho-Jui Hsieh</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently DeepSeek R1 demonstrated how reinforcement learning with simple rule-based incentives can enable autonomous development of complex reasoning in large language models, characterized by the "aha moment", in which the model manifest self-reflection and increased response length during training. However, attempts to extend this success to multimodal reasoning often failed to reproduce these key characteristics. In this report, we present the first successful replication of these emergent characteristics for multimodal reasoning on only a non-SFT 2B model. Starting with Qwen2-VL-2B and applying reinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset, our model achieves 59.47% accuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model by approximately ~30% and exceeding both SFT setting by ~2%. In addition, we share our failed attempts and insights in attempting to achieve R1-like reasoning using RL with instruct models. aiming to shed light on the challenges involved. Our key observations include: (1) applying RL on instruct model often results in trivial reasoning trajectories, and (2) naive length reward are ineffective in eliciting reasoning capabilities.

<p>Abstract: Powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD) experiments are a cornerstone for materials structure characterization. Despite their widespread application, analyzing pXRD diffractograms still presents a significant challenge to automation and a bottleneck in high-throughput discovery in self-driving labs. Machine learning promises to resolve this bottleneck by enabling automated powder diffraction analysis. A notable difficulty in applying machine learning to this domain is the lack of sufficiently sized experimental datasets, which has constrained researchers to train primarily on simulated data. However, models trained on simulated pXRD patterns showed limited generalization to experimental patterns, particularly for low-quality experimental patterns with high noise levels and elevated backgrounds. With the Open Experimental Powder X-Ray Diffraction Database (opXRD), we provide an openly available and easily accessible dataset of labeled and unlabeled experimental powder diffractograms. Labeled opXRD data can be used to evaluate the performance of models on experimental data and unlabeled opXRD data can help improve the performance of models on experimental data, e.g. through transfer learning methods. We collected 92552 diffractograms, 2179 of them labeled, from a wide spectrum of materials classes. We hope this ongoing effort can guide machine learning research toward fully automated analysis of pXRD data and thus enable future self-driving materials labs.</p>
